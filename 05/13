Given a word, our framework can create its negation\nthat is similar to how humans perceive negation. The framework corrects logical\nnegation to weight meanings closer in the entailment hierarchy more than\nmeanings further apart. The proposed framework is flexible to accommodate\ndifferent choices of logical negations, compositions, and worldly context\ngeneration. In particular, we propose and motivate a new logical negation using\nmatrix inverse.\n  We validate the sensibility of our conversational negation framework by\nperforming experiments, leveraging density matrices to encode graded entailment\ninformation. We conclude that the combination of subtraction negation and\nphaser in the basis of the negated word yields the highest Pearson correlation\nof 0.635 with human ratings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 16:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-17"}

Twisted light however can excite internal degrees of\nfreedom, resulting in the appearance of new peaks in the even multipole\nspectrum which are not present when the probe is a plane wave. We also\ndemonstrate the ability of the proposed twisted light probe to capture the\ntransition of interacting fermions into a strongly correlated regime in a\none-dimensional harmonic trap. We report that by suitable choice of the probe's\nparameters, the transition into a strongly correlated phase manifests itself as\nan approach and ultimate superposition of peaks in the second order quadrupole\nresponse.

In many systems noise plays an important role\nin the dynamical behavior and it models their internal irregularities or their\ncoupling with the environment. In these situations the unpredictability is\naffected by both the chaotic dynamics and the stochastic fluctuations. In the\npresence of noise two trajectories with the same initial condition can evolve\nin different ways and converge to a different asymptotic behavior. For this\nreason, even the exact knowledge of the initial conditions does not necessarily\nlead to the predictability of the final state of the system. Hence, the noise\ncan be considered as an important source of unpredictability that cannot be\nfully understood using the conventional methods of nonlinear dynamics, such as\nthe exit basins and the uncertainty exponent. By adopting a probabilistic point\nof view, we develop the concepts of probability basin, uncertainty basin and\nnoise-sensitivity exponent, that allow us to carry out both a quantitative and\nqualitative analysis of the unpredictability on noisy chaotic scattering\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 16:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

The ability of the system to\ndifferentiate between two closely located (parallel) catheters was investigated\nby connecting catheters to the afterloader and moving it from its axis with an\nincrement of 1mm. A robotic arm was used to move the catheter between each\nreconstruction. Reconstructions were obtained with a locally weighted\nscatter-plot smoothing algorithm. To quantify the reconstruction accuracy,\ndistances between two catheters were computed along the reconstruction track\nwith a 5mm step. Reconstructions of curve catheter paths were assessed through\nparallel and perpendicular phantom configuration to the EM field generator.\nIndexer length and lateral error were simulated and ROC analysis was made.\nUsing a 50cm/s check cable speed does not allow accurate reconstruction. A\nslower check cable speed results in better reconstruction performance and\nsmaller standard deviations. The optimum operating distance from the field\ngenerator (50-300mm) resulted in a lower absolute mean deviation from the\nexpected value (0.2pm0.1mm) versus being positioned on the edge of the\nelectromagnetic sensitive detection volume (0.6pm0.3mm).

The PIR-PSI framework ensures that the privacy\nof the demand and the side information are jointly preserved, thereby finding\npotential applications when multiple files have to be downloaded spread across\ndifferent time-instants. Although the capacity of the PIR-PSI setting is known,\nwe observe that the underlying capacity achieving code construction uses\nMaximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes thereby contributing to high\ncomputational complexity when retrieving the demand. Pointing at this drawback\nof MDS-based PIR-PSI codes, we propose XOR-based PIR-PSI codes for a simple yet\nnon-trivial setting of two non-colluding databases and two side information\nfiles at the user. While our codes offer substantial reduction in complexity\nwhen compared to MDS based codes, the code-rate marginally falls short of the\ncapacity of the PIR-PSI setting. Nevertheless, we show that our code-rate is\nstrictly higher than that of XOR-based codes for PIR with no side information,\nthereby implying that our codes can be useful when downloading multiple files\nin a sequential manner, instead of applying XOR-based PIR codes on each file.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 17:01:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 10:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

We derive explicit expressions for the\nfrequency-dependent higher-order dielectric susceptibilities exhibiting a\nnon-monotonic shape, the height of which increases as temperature is lowered.\nWe demonstrate excellent agreement with the experimental data for glycerol,\nchallenging the idea that non-linear response functions reveal correlated\nrelaxation in supercooled liquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 17:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

However, cometary outbursts may arise from other processes\nthat are not necessarily driven by volatiles. In order to fully understand\nnuclear surfaces and their evolution, we must identify the causes of cometary\noutbursts. In that context, we present a study of mini-outbursts of comet\n46P/Wirtanen. Six events are found in our long-term lightcurve of the comet\naround its perihelion passage in 2018. The apparent strengths range from $-0.2$\nto $-1.6$ mag in a 5\" radius aperture, and correspond to dust masses between\n$\\sim10^4$ to $10^6$ kg, but with large uncertainties due to the unknown grain\nsize distributions. However, the nominal mass estimates are the same order of\nmagnitude as the mini-outbursts at comet 9P/Tempel 1 and\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, events which were notably lacking at comet\n103P/Hartley 2. We compare the frequency of outbursts at the four comets, and\nsuggest that the surface of 46P has large-scale ($\\sim$10-100 m) roughness that\nis intermediate to that of 67P and 103P, if not similar to the latter.

In this study, we consider the movements of selfish drivers\nfrom their homes (origins) to work places (destinations) to see how\ninteractions and randomness in the movements affect a measure of efficiency and\nentropy production (uncertainty in the destination time intervals) in this\nprocess. We employ realistic models of population distributions and mobility\nlaws to simulate the movement process, where interactions are modelled by\ndependence of the local travel times on the local flows. We observe that some\nlevel of information (the travel times) sharing enhances a measure of\npredictability in the process without any coordination.

In this case, it is very\nlikely that the EL approximation would at times return mass-loss rates of up to\nseveral orders of magnitude above or below those predicted by hydrodynamic\nsimulations. For planetary atmospheric evolution calculations, interpolation\nroutines or approximations based on grids of hydrodynamic models should be used\ninstead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 13:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

Towards alleviating these concerns, we are\nproposing the FeTS challenge 2021 to cater towards both the development and the\nevaluation of models for the segmentation of intrinsically heterogeneous (in\nappearance, shape, and histology) brain tumors, namely gliomas. Specifically,\nthe FeTS 2021 challenge uses clinically acquired, multi-institutional magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) scans from the BraTS 2020 challenge, as well as from\nvarious remote independent institutions included in the collaborative network\nof a real-world federation (https://www.fets.ai/). The goals of the FeTS\nchallenge are directly represented by the two included tasks: 1) the\nidentification of the optimal weight aggregation approach towards the training\nof a consensus model that has gained knowledge via federated learning from\nmultiple geographically distinct institutions, while their data are always\nretained within each institution, and 2) the federated evaluation of the\ngeneralizability of brain tumor segmentation models \"in the wild\", i.e. on data\nfrom institutional distributions that were not part of the training datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 18:00:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 00:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

By representing products as\nnodes and their relationships as edges of a graph, we show how an inductive\ngraph neural network approach, named GraphSAGE, can efficiently learn\ncontinuous representations for nodes and edges. These representations also\ncapture product feature information such as price, brand, or engineering\nattributes.

In\nparticular, the holographic entanglement entropy is a very useful tool in\nstudying AdS/CFT, and its efficacy is manifested in the recent black hole page\ncurve calculation. On the other hand, the one-shot information-theoretic\nentropies, such as the smooth min/max-entropies, are less discussed in AdS/CFT.\nThey are however more fundamental entropy measures from the quantum information\nperspective and should also play pivotal roles in holography. We combine the\ntechnical methods from both quantum information and quantum gravity to put this\nidea on firm grounds. In particular, we study the quantum extremal surface\n(QES) prescription that was recently revised to highlight the significance of\none-shot entropies in characterizing the QES phase transition. Motivated by the\nasymptotic equipartition property (AEP), we derive the refined quantum extremal\nsurface prescription for fixed-area states via a novel AEP replica trick,\ndemonstrating the synergy between quantum information and quantum gravity. We\nfurther prove that, when restricted to pure bulk marginal states, such\ncorrections do not occur for the higher R\\'enyi entropies of a boundary\nsubregion in fixed-area states, meaning they always have sharp QES transitions.\nOur path integral derivation suggests that the refinement applies beyond\nAdS/CFT, and we confirm it in a black hole toy model by showing that the Page\ncurve, for a black hole in a superposition of two radiation stages, receives a\nlarge correction that is consistent with the refined QES prescription.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 18:26:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2021 22:52:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 22:57:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 17:37:53 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 13:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

However, treatment implementation is often slow and incomplete,\ngiving a biased estimation of the study value. Previous methods have adjusted\nfor this bias, but they typically make the unrealistic assumption that the\nstudy outcomes do not impact the implementation. One method does assume that\nthe implementation is related to the strength of evidence in favour of the\ntreatment but this method uses analytical results, which require alternative\nrestrictive assumptions. Methods: We develop two implementation-adjusted EVSI\ncalculation methods that relax these assumptions. The first method uses\ncomputationally demanding nested simulations, using the definition of the\nimplementation-adjusted EVSI. The second method aims to facilitate the\ncomputation by adapting a recently developed efficient EVSI computation method\nto adjust for imperfect implementation. The implementation-adjusted EVSI is\nthen calculated with the two methods across three examples. Results: The\nmaximum difference between the two methods is at most 6% in all examples.

The efficient\nestimation method is accurate and can estimate the implementation-adjusted EVSI\nin practice. By adapting standard EVSI estimation methods, we allow accurate\nadjustments for imperfect implementation with the same computational cost as a\nstandard analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 18:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

The presented system modeling approach leverages a novel incremental\nKoopman-based update law that retrieves a mini-batch of samples stored in a\nmemory to not only minimizes the instantaneous Koopman operator's\nidentification errors but also the identification errors for the batch of\nretrieved samples. Discontinuous modifications of gradient flows are presented\nfor the online update law to assure finite-time convergence under\neasy-to-verify conditions defined on the batch of data. Therefore, this unified\nonline-batch framework allows performing joint sample- and time-domain analysis\nfor converging the Koopman operator's parameters. More specifically, it is\nshown that if the collected mini-batch of samples guarantees a rank condition,\nthen finite-time guarantee in the time domain can be certified and the settling\ntime depends on the quality of collected samples being reused in the update\nlaw. Moreover, the efficiency of the proposed Koopman-based update law is\nfurther analyzed by showing that the identification regret in continuous time\ngrows sub-linearly with time. Furthermore, to avoid learning corrupted dynamics\ndue to the selection of an inappropriate set of Koopman observables, a\nhigher-layer meta learner employs a discrete Bayesian optimization algorithm to\nobtain the best library of observable functions for the operator. Since\nfinite-time convergence of the Koopman model for each set of observable is\nguaranteed under a rank condition on stored data, the fitness of each set of\nobservables can be obtained based on the identification error on the stored\nsamples in the proposed framework and even without implementing any controller\nbased on the learned system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 18:45:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 15:19:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 01:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

However, since a range of different mechanisms have been\nproposed to cause the same feature, clear observational diagnostics of disc\ndispersal leaving an imprint in the observed distribution of giant planets\ncould help to constrain the dominant mechanisms. We aim to assess the impact of\ndisc dispersal via X-ray driven-photoevaporation (XPE) onto giant planet\nseparations in order to provide theoretical constraints on the location and\nsize of any possible features related to this process within their observed\norbital distribution. For this purpose, we perform a set of 1D population\nsyntheses with varying initial conditions and correlate the gas giants' final\nparking locations with the X-ray luminosities of their host stars in order to\nquantify observables of this process within the $L_\\mathrm{x}$-$a$-plane of\nthese systems. We find that XPE indeed creates an underdensity of gas giants\nnear the gravitational radius, with corresponding pile-ups inside and/or\noutside of this location. However, the size and location of these features are\nstrongly dependent on the choice of initial conditions in our model, such as\nthe assumed formation location of the planets. XPE can strongly affect the\nmigration process of giant planets and leave potentially observable signatures\nwithin the observed orbital separations of giant planets. However, due to the\nsimplistic approach employed in our model, which lacks a self-consistent\ntreatment of planet formation within an evolving disc, a quantitative analysis\nof the final planet population orbits is not possible. Our results however\nstrongly motivate future studies to include realistic disc dispersal mechanisms\ninto global planet population synthesis models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 18:55:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 20:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Although a few of these structural parameters, primarily linked to the\nnanoparticle and the mirror morphology, have been identified, the impact of\nmolecular assembly and organization of the spacer layer between them has often\nbeen left uncharacterized. Here, we experimentally investigate how the complex\nand reconfigurable nature of a thiol-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM)\nadsorbed on the mirror surface impacts the optical properties of the NPoMs. We\nfabricate NPoMs with distinct molecular organizations by controlling the\nincubation time of the mirror in the thiol solution. Afterwards, we investigate\nthe structural changes that occur under laser irradiation by tracking the\nbonding dipole plasmon mode, while also monitoring Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman\nscattering from the molecules as a probe of their integrity. First, we find an\neffective decrease in the SAM height as the laser power increases, compatible\nwith an irreversible change of molecule orientation caused by heating. Second,\nwe observe that the nanocavities prepared with a densely packed and more\nordered monolayer of molecules are more prone to changes in their resonance\ncompared to samples with sparser and more disordered SAMs. Our measurements\nindicate that molecular orientation and packing on the mirror surface play a\nkey role in determining the stability of NPoM structures and hence highlight\nthe under-recognized significance of SAM characterization in the development of\nNPoM-based applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 19:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

The clusters are selected from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope\nData Release 5 and the galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 dataset.\nWith signal-to-noise of 62 (43) for galaxy (weak lensing) profiles over scales\nof about $0.2-20h^{-1}$ Mpc, these are the highest precision measurements for\nSZ-selected clusters to date. Because SZ selection closely approximates mass\nselection, these measurements enable several tests of theoretical models of the\nmass and light distribution around clusters. Our main findings are: 1. The\nsplashback feature is detected at a consistent location in both the mass and\ngalaxy profiles and its location is consistent with predictions of cold dark\nmatter N-body simulations. 2. The full mass profile is also consistent with the\nsimulations; hence it can constrain alternative dark matter models that modify\nthe mass distribution of clusters. 3. The shapes of the galaxy and lensing\nprofiles are remarkably similar for our sample over the entire range of scales,\nfrom well inside the cluster halo to the quasilinear regime. This can be used\nto constrain processes such as quenching and tidal disruption that alter the\ngalaxy distribution inside the halo, and scale-dependent features in the\ntransition regime outside the halo. We measure the dependence of the profile\nshapes on the galaxy sample, redshift and cluster mass. We extend the Diemer \\&\nKravtsov model for the cluster profiles to the linear regime using perturbation\ntheory and show that it provides a good match to the measured profiles. We also\ncompare the measured profiles to predictions of the standard halo model and\nsimulations that include hydrodynamics.

Next, the timing of donations to high-profile far-right streamers\nfollows a fairly predictable pattern that is closely tied to a broadcast\nschedule. Finally, the far-right video streaming financial landscape is divided\ninto separate cliques which exhibit very little crossover in terms of sizable\ndonations.

Modelling includes quantum chemistry, quantum-classical molecular\ndynamics, thermodynamic, and kinetic approaches. It is shown that BN compounds\nare formed in the interaction of N2 molecules with small boron clusters (N2\nmolecule fixation) rather than with less reactive liquid boron. We demonstrate\nthat the transformation and consumption of liquid boron proceeds through the\nevaporation of clusters, Bm with m less than or equal to 5 and their subsequent\nconversion into BmNn chains. The production of such chains is crucial to the\ngrowth of BNNTs because these chains form the building blocks of bigger and\nlonger BN chains and rings, which are themselves the building blocks of\nfullborenes and BNNTs. Moreover, kinetic modelling revealed that B4N4 and B5N4\nspecies play a major role in the N2 molecule fixation process. The formation of\nthese species via reactions with B4 and B5 clusters is not adequately described\nunder the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium because the accumulation of\nboth B4N4 and B5N4 depends on the background gas pressure and the gas cooling\nrate. Long BN chains and rings, which are precursors of the fullborene and BNNT\ngrowth, form via self-assembly of component B4N4 and B5N4. Our modelling\nresults (particularly the increased densities of B4N4 and B5N4 species at\nhigher gas pressures) explain the experimentally observed effect of gas\npressure on the yield of high-quality BNNTs.

Our experiments show that an LSTM with power\nlaw forget gates (pLSTM) can effectively capture long-range dependencies beyond\nhundreds of elements on image classification, language modeling, and\ncategorization tasks, improving performance over the vanilla LSTM. We also\ninspected the revised forget gate by varying the initialization of p, setting p\nto a fixed value, and ablating cells in the pLSTM network. The results show\nthat the information decay can be controlled by the learnable decay factor p,\nwhich allows pLSTM to achieve its superior performance. Altogether, we found\nthat LSTM with the proposed forget gate can learn long-term dependencies,\noutperforming other recurrent networks in multiple domains; such gating\nmechanism can be integrated into other architectures for improving the learning\nof long timescale information in recurrent neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 20:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

The native states of the\nconstituent particles in the droplets can be linked to the emergent\nmorphological patterns via this drying process. This paper explores the\ninterplay between different initial concentrations of a globular protein\nlysozyme ($\\phi_p$) and the salts ($\\phi_s$) in the phosphate buffer saline\n(PBS). The $\\phi_s$ = 0 wt% embodies the lysozyme solution prepared in\nde-ionized water. The samples at $\\phi_s$ = 0.9 wt% display a dark texture in\nthe central region. We examined the drying evolution and dried morphology by\nextracting the mean gray values (I) and standard deviation (SD). For this,\n$\\phi_p$ was fixed at 9.0 wt%, and only the $\\phi_s$ were varied. The I\ndecreases, and the SD increases as the salt crystals start appearing during the\ndrying process. The phase separation of these salts directly maps with this\ntextural evolution and is influenced by the salts' amount in these droplets.\nThe scanning electron microscopic images of the dried films at $\\phi_s$ = 0.5\nwt% at different $\\phi_p$ show that the lysozyme-salt interactions drop off in\nthe ring region. This ring becomes more apparent with the increasing $\\phi_p$.\nThough all the droplets show \"coffee-ring\" behavior, the leftover lysozyme\nparticles indicated with the mound-like structure diminishes in the salts'\npresence. The alteration of the crack patterns is also found. Therefore, the\nchemistry between multiple salts and lysozyme at various initial concentrations\nreveals that the features are not merely a sum (or average) of individual\nmicroscopic actions. It appears to involve both protein-protein and\nprotein-salt interactions partially averaged over one length/time scale that\nsets the next larger/longer length/time scale in such drying droplets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 20:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

Cross-section cuts of the\nnanowires reveal a sharp, oxide-free interface between semiconductor and\nsuperconductor. By growing InP structures on both sides of in-plane nanowires,\na combination of Pt and Pb can independently be shadow deposited, enabling a\nscalable and reproducible in-situ device fabrication.

The next generation computer technology is expected to solve\nproblems at the exascale with 1018 calculations each second. Even though these\nfuture computers will be incredibly powerful, if they are based on von Neumann\ntype architectures, they will consume between 20 and 30 megawatts of power and\nwill not have intrinsic physically built-in capabilities to learn or deal with\ncomplex data as our brain does.

These primitives implement a trusted execution environment (TEE)\nin which a program can run such that the integrity and confidentiality of its\nexecution are guaranteed. Intel's Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) is an example\nof such primitives and its isolated processes are called \\emph{enclaves}. These\nguarantees, however, can be easily thwarted if the enclave has not been\nproperly designed. Its interface with the untrusted software stack is arguably\nthe largest attack surface that adversaries can exploit; unintended\ninteractions with untrusted code can expose the enclave to memory corruption\nattacks, for instance. In this paper, we propose a notion of an \\emph{orderly}\nenclave which splits its behaviour into several execution phases each of which\nimposes a set of restrictions on accesses to untrusted memory, phase\ntransitions and registers sanitisation. A violation to these restrictions\nindicates an undesired behaviour which could be harnessed to perpetrate attacks\nagainst the enclave.

This is commonly\nachieved by obtaining multiple undersampled images, simultaneously, through\nparallel imaging. In this paper, we propose the Dual-Octave Network (DONet),\nwhich is capable of learning multi-scale spatial-frequency features from both\nthe real and imaginary components of MR data, for fast parallel MR image\nreconstruction. More specifically, our DONet consists of a series of\nDual-Octave convolutions (Dual-OctConv), which are connected in a dense manner\nfor better reuse of features. In each Dual-OctConv, the input feature maps and\nconvolutional kernels are first split into two components (ie, real and\nimaginary), and then divided into four groups according to their spatial\nfrequencies. Then, our Dual-OctConv conducts intra-group information updating\nand inter-group information exchange to aggregate the contextual information\nacross different groups. Our framework provides three appealing benefits: (i)\nIt encourages information interaction and fusion between the real and imaginary\ncomponents at various spatial frequencies to achieve richer representational\ncapacity. (ii) The dense connections between the real and imaginary groups in\neach Dual-OctConv make the propagation of features more efficient by feature\nreuse. (iii) DONet enlarges the receptive field by learning multiple\nspatial-frequency features of both the real and imaginary components.

Applications range from string problems to\nKnapsack-type problems, and from 3SUM to All-Pairs Shortest Paths. These\napplications often come in the form of nonnegative convolution, where the\nentries of $A,B$ are nonnegative integers. The classical algorithm to compute\n$A\\star B$ uses the Fast Fourier Transform and runs in time $O(n\\log n)$.\n  However, often $A$ and $B$ satisfy sparsity conditions, and hence one could\nhope for significant improvements. The ideal goal is an $O(k\\log k)$-time\nalgorithm, where $k$ is the number of non-zero elements in the output, i.e.,\nthe size of the support of $A\\star B$. This problem is referred to as sparse\nnonnegative convolution, and has received considerable attention in the\nliterature; the fastest algorithms to date run in time $O(k\\log^2 n)$.\n  The main result of this paper is the first $O(k\\log k)$-time algorithm for\nsparse nonnegative convolution. Our algorithm is randomized and assumes that\nthe length $n$ and the largest entry of $A$ and $B$ are subexponential in $k$.\nSurprisingly, we can phrase our algorithm as a reduction from the sparse case\nto the dense case of nonnegative convolution, showing that, under some mild\nassumptions, sparse nonnegative convolution is equivalent to dense nonnegative\nconvolution for constant-error randomized algorithms. Specifically, if $D(n)$\nis the time to convolve two nonnegative length-$n$ vectors with success\nprobability $2/3$, and $S(k)$ is the time to convolve two nonnegative vectors\nwith output size $k$ with success probability $2/3$, then\n$S(k)=O(D(k)+k(\\log\\log k)^2)$.\n  Our approach uses a variety of new techniques in combination with some old\nmachinery from linear sketching and structured linear algebra, as well as new\ninsights on linear hashing, the most classical hash function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 21:58:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 11:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-17"}

We propose a more\ngeneral theory, also based on prime-implicants, tailored to taking constraints\ninto account.

Moreover, at any time, the state of the world may\nevolve arbitrarily depending on the action taken by the principal. The goal is\nto compute an optimal mechanism which maximizes the principal's utility in the\nface of the self-interested strategic agent.\n  We give an efficient algorithm for computing optimal mechanisms, with or\nwithout payments, under different individual-rationality constraints, when the\ntime horizon is constant.

Event logs may be used to analyze business\nprocesses at a fine level of detail using process mining techniques. Among\nother things, process mining techniques allow us to discover a process model\nfrom an event log -- an operation known as automated process discovery. Despite\na rich body of research in the field, existing automated process discovery\ntechniques do not fully capture the concurrency inherent in a business process.\nSpecifically, the bulk of these techniques treat two activities A and B as\nconcurrent if sometimes A completes before B and other times B completes before\nA.

This paper addresses this gap by presenting a refined version of an\nautomated process discovery technique, namely Split Miner, that discovers true\nconcurrency relations from event logs containing start and end timestamps for\neach activity.

It is difficult for sensors to\nreduce energy consumption by reducing the moving distances. Therefore, charging\ntechnology is the best way to extend the lifetime of the sweep coverage\nnetwork. This paper studies the sweep coverage of rechargeable sensors: the\nsensors are rechargeable, constantly sweep between the target points and the\ncharging stations not only tp meet the periodic coverage requirement of the\ntarget points, but also need to return to the charging stations during the\ncharging period to avoid running out of energy. This paper proposes the general\ndefinition of Chargeable Sweep Coverage (CSC) problem for the first time, and\nstudies the complexity of the CSC problem by analyzing CSC problems under\ndifferent constraints, and then proposes two kinds of CSC problems under\nspecial constraints: 1) The sensors need to return to their original charging\nstations for charging; 2) The sensors can go to different charging stations for\ncharging, and the number of charging stations is 2.

As in Papers I--III of this\nseries, we performed post-processed radiative transfer calculations using the\n\"radiation-driven fountain model\" (wada2016}, which yields a geometrically\nthick obscuring structure around the nucleus. This model is consistent with the\nspectral energy distribution of the nearest type-2 Seyfert galaxy, the Circinus\ngalaxy. We found that the continuum-subtracted channel maps of $J = 4-3$ and\nhigher transitions show absorption regions along the disk mid-plane for an\nedge-on viewing angle. The spectra consist of multiple absorption and emission\nfeatures, reflecting the internal inhomogeneous and turbulent structure of the\ntorus. The deepest absorption feature is caused by the gas on the near-side of\nthe torus between $r =10$ and 15 pc, which is located in front of the\nAGN-heated dust inside $r \\simeq 5$ pc. We also found that a spatial resolution\nof 0.5--1.0 pc is necessary to resolve the absorption features. Moreover, the\ninclination angle must be close to the edge-on angle (i.e., $\\sim 85^\\circ$) to\nobserve the absorption features.

It is undoubtedly\ncritical to consider popularity bias in recommender systems, and existing work\nmainly eliminates the bias effect. However, we argue that not all biases in the\ndata are bad -- some items demonstrate higher popularity because of their\nbetter intrinsic quality. Blindly pursuing unbiased learning may remove the\nbeneficial patterns in the data, degrading the recommendation accuracy and user\nsatisfaction.\n  This work studies an unexplored problem in recommendation -- how to leverage\npopularity bias to improve the recommendation accuracy. The key lies in two\naspects: how to remove the bad impact of popularity bias during training, and\nhow to inject the desired popularity bias in the inference stage that generates\ntop-K recommendations. This questions the causal mechanism of the\nrecommendation generation process. Along this line, we find that item\npopularity plays the role of confounder between the exposed items and the\nobserved interactions, causing the bad effect of bias amplification. To achieve\nour goal, we propose a new training and inference paradigm for recommendation\nnamed Popularity-bias Deconfounding and Adjusting (PDA). It removes the\nconfounding popularity bias in model training and adjusts the recommendation\nscore with desired popularity bias via causal intervention. We demonstrate the\nnew paradigm on latent factor model and perform extensive experiments on three\nreal-world datasets. Empirical studies validate that the deconfounded training\nis helpful to discover user real interests and the inference adjustment with\npopularity bias could further improve the recommendation accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 04:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

In this\npaper, we propose a radar cross section-based received power model for an\nRIS-aided wireless communication system that is rooted in the physical\nproperties of RIS.

To the best of our knowledge, this\npaper is the first to model the angle-dependent phase shift of the reflection\ncoefficient, which is typically ignored in existing literature.

Automatic methods for this\ntask view it as a sequence labeling problem and dramatically reduce human\nlabor. However, as contract genres and element types may vary widely, a\nsignificant challenge for this sequence labeling task is how to transfer\nknowledge from one domain to another, i.e., cross-domain CEE. Cross-domain CEE\ndiffers from cross-domain named entity recognition (NER) in two important ways.\nFirst, contract elements are far more fine-grained than named entities, which\nhinders the transfer of extractors. Second, the extraction zones for\ncross-domain CEE are much larger than for cross-domain NER. As a result, the\ncontexts of elements from different domains can be more diverse. We propose a\nframework, the Bi-directional Feedback cLause-Element relaTion network\n(Bi-FLEET), for the cross-domain CEE task that addresses the above challenges.\nBi-FLEET has three main components: (1) a context encoder, (2) a clause-element\nrelation encoder, and (3) an inference layer.

To reduce the influence of context variations,\na multi-task framework with a bi-directional feedback scheme is designed in the\ninference layer, conducting both clause classification and element extraction.\nThe experimental results over both cross-domain NER and CEE tasks show that\nBi-FLEET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 05:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

They have, a\npriori nothing in common. At a formal level, collapse models add a non-linear\nnoise term to the Schr\\\"odinger equation, and extract definite measurement\noutcomes either from the wave function (e.g. mass density ontology) or the\nnoise itself (flash ontology). Bohmian mechanics keeps the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation intact but uses the wave function to guide particles (or fields),\nwhich comprise the primitive ontology. Collapse models modify the predictions\nof orthodox quantum mechanics, whilst Bohmian mechanics can be argued to\nreproduce them. However, it turns out that collapse models and their primitive\nontology can be exactly recast as Bohmian theories. More precisely, considering\n(i) a system described by a non-Markovian collapse model, and (ii) an extended\nsystem where a carefully tailored bath is added and described by Bohmian\nmechanics, the stochastic wave-function of the collapse model is exactly the\nwave-function of the original system conditioned on the Bohmian hidden\nvariables of the bath. Further, the noise driving the collapse model is a\nlinear functional of the Bohmian variables. The randomness that seems\nprogressively revealed in the collapse models lies entirely in the initial\nconditions in the Bohmian-like theory. Our construction of the appropriate bath\nis not trivial and exploits an old result from the theory of open quantum\nsystems. This reformulation of collapse models as Bohmian theories brings to\nthe fore the question of whether there exists `unromantic' realist\ninterpretations of quantum theory that cannot ultimately be rewritten this way,\nwith some guiding law. It also points to important foundational differences\nbetween `true' (Markovian) collapse models and non-Markovian models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 07:13:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 11:14:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 09:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

While many deepfake detection models can detect\ndifferent types of deepfakes separately, they perform poorly on generalizing\nthe detection performance over multiple types of deepfake. This motivates us to\ndevelop a generalized model to detect different types of deepfakes. Therefore,\nin this work, we introduce a practical digital forensic tool to detect\ndifferent types of deepfakes simultaneously and propose Transfer learning-based\nAutoencoder with Residuals (TAR). The ultimate goal of our work is to develop a\nunified model to detect various types of deepfake videos with high accuracy,\nwith only a small number of training samples that can work well in real-world\nsettings.

To tackle this problem, inspired by the recent success of contrastive\nlearning in learning continuous representations, we propose to adapt this\nframework to learn binary hashing codes.

Typically, the main\nobjective of automatic metro traffic regulation methods is to minimize the\ndelay time of trains while passengers' satisfaction is not considered. Instead,\nin this work, a novel framework that integrates a passenger flow module (PFM)\nand a train operation module (TOM) is proposed with the aim of simultaneously\nminimizing traffic delays and passengers' discomfort. In particular, the PFM is\ndevoted to the optimization of the headway time in case of platform\novercrowding, so as to reduce the passengers waiting time at platforms and\nincrease the load rate of trains; while the TOM is devoted to the minimization\nof trains' delays. The two modules interact with each other so that the headway\ntime is automatically adjusted when a platform is overcrowded, and the train\ntraffic is immediately regulated according to the new headway time. As a\nresult, the number of passengers on the platform and their total waiting time\ncan be significantly reduced. Numerical results are provided to show the\neffectiveness of the proposed method in improving the operation performance\nwhile minimizing the passengers' discomfort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 09:05:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

The effects of decoherence are then numerically investigated by means of\na simple dynamical model that captures the essential features of the phenomenon\nunder Markovian conditions, leaving aside extra complications associated with a\nmore detailed dynamical description of the system-environment interaction. As\nit is shown, this model takes into account and reproduces the fact that\ndecoherence effects are stronger as energy levels become more separated (in\nenergy), which translates into a progressive collapse of the energy density\nmatrix to its main diagonal. However, because energy dissipation is not\nconsidered, an analogous behavior is not observed in the position\nrepresentation, where a proper spatial localization of the probability density\ndoes not take place, but rather a delocalized distribution. This result\nemphasizes the fact that classicality is reached only if both decoherence and\ndissipation coexist; otherwise, non-classical traits might still persist.\nActually, as it is also shown, in the position representation some off-diagonal\ncorrelations indeed survive unless an additional spatial-type factor is\nincluded in the model.

In this paper, we propose PassFlow, a flow-based\ngenerative model approach to password guessing. Flow-based models allow for\nprecise log-likelihood computation and optimization, which enables exact latent\nvariable inference.

To further corroborate these\nresults, we analyze data from a repeated prisoner's dilemma experiment. We find\nthat selfish learning is insufficient to explain human behavior when there is a\ntrade-off between payoff maximization and fairness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 11:37:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 15:22:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 23:24:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

While different techniques\nare available to model and remove the deterministic errors, there has been\nconsiderable research over the past years with respect to modelling the\nstochastic errors which have complex structures. In order to do the latter,\ndifferent replicates of these error signals are collected and a model is\nidentified and estimated based on one of these replicates. While this procedure\nhas allowed to improve navigation performance, it has not yet taken advantage\nof the information coming from all the other replicates collected on the same\nsensor. However, it has been observed that there is often a change of error\nbehaviour between replicates which can also be explained by different\n(constant) external conditions under which each replicate was taken. Whatever\nthe reason for the difference between replicates, it appears that the model\nstructure remains the same between replicates but the parameter values vary. In\nthis work we therefore consider and study the properties of different\napproaches that allow to combine the information from all replicates\nconsidering this phenomenon, confirming their validity both in simulation\nsettings and also when applied to real inertial sensor error signals. By taking\ninto account parameter variation between replicates, this work highlights how\nthese approaches can improve the average navigation precision as well as obtain\nreliable estimates of the uncertainty of the navigation solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 12:17:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 09:13:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 07:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

Existing\nmethods use transfer learning for I2I translation, but they still require the\nlearning of millions of parameters from scratch. This drawback severely limits\nits application on small domains. In this paper, we propose a new transfer\nlearning for I2I translation (TransferI2I). We decouple our learning process\ninto the image generation step and the I2I translation step. In the first step\nwe propose two novel techniques: source-target initialization and\nself-initialization of the adaptor layer. The former finetunes the pretrained\ngenerative model (e.g., StyleGAN) on source and target data. The latter allows\nto initialize all non-pretrained network parameters without the need of any\ndata. These techniques provide a better initialization for the I2I translation\nstep. In addition, we introduce an auxiliary GAN that further facilitates the\ntraining of deep I2I systems even from small datasets.

Based on table structure characteristics, we\nfind that obtaining the aligned bounding boxes of text region can effectively\nmaintain the entire relevant range of different cells. However, the aligned\nbounding boxes are hard to be accurately predicted due to the visual\nambiguities. In this paper, we aim to obtain more reliable aligned bounding\nboxes by fully utilizing the visual information from both text regions in\nproposed local features and cell relations in global features. Specifically, we\npropose the framework of Local and Global Pyramid Mask Alignment, which adopts\nthe soft pyramid mask learning mechanism in both the local and global feature\nmaps. It allows the predicted boundaries of bounding boxes to break through the\nlimitation of original proposals. A pyramid mask re-scoring module is then\nintegrated to compromise the local and global information and refine the\npredicted boundaries.

In\na QW MTJ of Cr/Fe/MgAl$_2$O$_4$/top electrode, where the QW is formed by a\nmismatch between Cr and Fe in the $d$ band with $\\Delta_1$ symmetry, a QW-TAMR\nratio of up to 5.4 % was observed at 5 K, which persisted to 1.2 % even at\n380K. The magnetic control of QW transport can open new applications for\nspin-coupled optoelectronic devices, ultra-thin sensors, and memories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 12:40:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 07:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

In this work, such a method is\napplied to the community Weather Research and Forecasting model. Simulations\nare carried out to replicate a wind-tunnel experiment of neutral boundary-layer\nflow across a forested ridge. It is shown that features of the flow, such as\nthe separated region on the lee slope of the ridge, are reproduced by the\nroughness length or canopy model methods. Shear at the top of the ridge\ngenerates turbulence that spreads vertically as the flow moves downstream in\nboth cases, but is elevated to canopy top where a canopy model is used. The\nroughness-length approach is shown to suffer several deficiencies, such as an\nover-prediction of mean wind-speeds, a lack of turbulence over flat forested\nground and an insufficient vertical extent of turbulence at all locations of\nthe domain studied. Sensitivity to the horizontal resolution of the simulation\nis explored. It is found that higher resolution simulations improve\nreproduction of the mean flow when modelling the canopy explicitly. However,\nhigher resolutions do not provide improvements for the roughness-length case\nand lead to a reduction in the horizontal extent of the separated region of\nflow on the lee slope of the ridge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 13:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

For discriminative modeling between positive\nand negative interactions, most previous work relied on negative sampling to\nsome extent, which refers to considering unobserved user-item pairs as\nnegative, as actual negative ones are unknown. However, the negative sampling\nscheme has critical limitations because it may choose \"positive but unobserved\"\npairs as negative. This paper proposes a novel OCCF framework, named as BUIR,\nwhich does not require negative sampling. To make the representations of\npositively-related users and items similar to each other while avoiding a\ncollapsed solution, BUIR adopts two distinct encoder networks that learn from\neach other; the first encoder is trained to predict the output of the second\nencoder as its target, while the second encoder provides the consistent targets\nby slowly approximating the first encoder. In addition, BUIR effectively\nalleviates the data sparsity issue of OCCF, by applying stochastic data\naugmentation to encoder inputs. Based on the neighborhood information of users\nand items, BUIR randomly generates the augmented views of each positive\ninteraction each time it encodes, then further trains the model by this\nself-supervision. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that BUIR consistently\nand significantly outperforms all baseline methods by a large margin especially\nfor much sparse datasets in which any assumptions about negative interactions\nare less valid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 14:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

To address the uncertainty in\nvision, human inspectors actively touch the surface of the structures, guided\nby vision, which has not been explored in autonomous crack detection.

When contacts are made, a pixel-wise\nmask of the crack can be obtained from the tactile images and therefore the\nprofile of the crack can be refined by aligning the RGB-D image and the tactile\nimages.

These systems are thought to have formed through a final\nphase of giant impacts, which would tend to leave systems close to the edge of\nstability. Here, we assess this hypothesis, comparing observed eccentricities\nin systems exhibiting transit-timing variations (TTVs), with the maximum\neccentricities compatible with long-term stability. We use the machine-learning\nclassifier SPOCK (Tamayo et al. 2020) to rapidly classify the stability of\nnumerous initial configurations and hence determine these stability limits.\nWhile previous studies have argued that multi-planet systems are often\nmaximally packed, in the sense that they could not host any additional planets,\nwe find that the existing planets in these systems have measured eccentricities\nbelow the limits allowed by stability by a factor of 2--10. We compare these\nresults against predictions from the giant impact theory of planet formation,\nderived from both $N$-body integrations and theoretical expectations that in\nthe absence of dissipation, the orbits of such planets should be distributed\nuniformly throughout the phase space volume allowed by stability. We find that\nthe observed systems have systematically lower eccentricities than this\nscenario predicts, with a median eccentricity about 4 times lower than\npredicted. These findings suggest that if such systems formed through giant\nimpacts, then some dissipation must occur to damp their eccentricities. This\nmay take place during formation, perhaps through interactions with the natal\ngas disk or a leftover population of planetesimals, or over longer timescales\nthrough the coupling of tidal and secular processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 14:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

In general, our results\npredict that the ionization dynamics for vortex projectiles are similar to\nthose of their non-vortex counterparts. However, some key differences are\nobserved. For non-vortex projectiles, a double scattering mechanism is required\nto emit electrons into the azimuthal plane, and this mechanism becomes more\nimportant with increasing energy. Our results demonstrate that for vortex\nprojectiles, emission into the azimuthal plane does not require a double\nscattering mechanism, although this process still significantly influences the\nshape of the TDCS at higher energies. At low projectile energies, non-vortex\nionization proceeds primarily through single binary collisions. The same is\ngenerally true for vortex projectiles, although our results indicate that\ndouble scattering is also important, even at low energy. Vortex projectiles\nhave an inherent uncertainty in their incident momentum, which causes a\nbroadening of the binary peak at all energies and results in a splitting of the\nbinary peak at higher energies.

The popularity of 1D spectral retrieval codes\nis easy to understand: they are robust and have a rich legacy in Solar System\natmospheric studies. Exoplanet researchers have recently introduced\nmulti-dimensional retrieval schemes for interpreting the spectra of\nshort-period planets, but these codes are necessarily more complex and\ncomputationally expensive than their 1D counterparts.

We test this scheme on the iconic phase-resolved\nspectra of WASP-43b and on simulated JWST observations using the open-source\npyratbay 1D spectral retrieval framework.

Potential temperature and salinity are active tracers that determine\nthe ocean's potential density: their distribution strongly affects the\ndensity-driven component while the overall flow affects their distribution. We\npresent a robust framework that allows one to study the effects of a general 3D\nflow on a density-driven velocity component, by constructing a modular\nobservation-based 3D model of intermediate complexity. The model contains an\nincompressible velocity that couples two advection-diffusion equations, for\ntemperature and salinity. Instead of solving the Navier-Stokes equations for\nthe velocity, we consider a flow composed of several temporally separated,\nspatially predetermined modes. One of these modes models the density-driven\nflow: its spatial form describes the density-driven flow structure and its\nstrength is determined dynamically by average density differences. The other\nmodes are completely predetermined, consisting of any incompressible, possibly\nunsteady, 3D flow, e.g. as determined by kinematic models, observations, or\nsimulations. The model is a non-linear, weakly coupled system of two non-local\nPDEs. We prove its well-posedness in the sense of Hadamard, and obtain rigorous\nbounds regarding analytical solutions. The model's relevance to oceanic systems\nis demonstrated by tuning the model to mimic the North Atlantic ocean's\ndynamics.
