It serves as a key input to transportation planning, roadway design,\nand traffic signal control. However, the traffic volume data collected by\nfixed-location sensors, such as loop detectors, often suffer from the missing\ndata problem and low coverage problem. The missing data problem could be caused\nby hardware malfunction. The low coverage problem is due to the limited\ncoverage of fixed-location sensors in the transportation network, which\nrestrains our understanding of the traffic at the network level. To tackle\nthese problems, we propose a probabilistic model for traffic volume\nreconstruction by fusing fixed-location sensor data and probe vehicle data. We\napply the probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) to capture the\ncorrelations in traffic volume data. An innovative contribution of this work is\nthat we also integrate probe vehicle data into the framework, which allows the\nmodel to solve both of the above-mentioned two problems.

The\nexperiments also show that even when the missing ratio reaches 80%, the\nproposed method can still give an accurate estimate of the unknown traffic\nvolumes with only a 10% probe vehicle penetration rate.

Compared to traditional\nrepresentations such as meshes, point clouds, or volumes they can be flexibly\nincorporated into differentiable learning-based pipelines. While recent\nimprovements to neural representations now make it possible to represent\nsignals with fine details at moderate resolutions (e.g., for images and 3D\nshapes), adequately representing large-scale or complex scenes has proven a\nchallenge. Current neural representations fail to accurately represent images\nat resolutions greater than a megapixel or 3D scenes with more than a few\nhundred thousand polygons. Here, we introduce a new hybrid implicit-explicit\nnetwork architecture and training strategy that adaptively allocates resources\nduring training and inference based on the local complexity of a signal of\ninterest. Our approach uses a multiscale block-coordinate decomposition,\nsimilar to a quadtree or octree, that is optimized during training. The network\narchitecture operates in two stages: using the bulk of the network parameters,\na coordinate encoder generates a feature grid in a single forward pass. Then,\nhundreds or thousands of samples within each block can be efficiently evaluated\nusing a lightweight feature decoder. With this hybrid implicit-explicit network\narchitecture, we demonstrate the first experiments that fit gigapixel images to\nnearly 40 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio. Notably this represents an increase in\nscale of over 1000x compared to the resolution of previously demonstrated\nimage-fitting experiments. Moreover, our approach is able to represent 3D\nshapes significantly faster and better than previous techniques; it reduces\ntraining times from days to hours or minutes and memory requirements by over an\norder of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 16:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

The\nreason is that training image-pairs are commonly created by downscaling a\nhigh-resolution image to produce a low-resolution counterpart. Deep models are\ntherefore trained to undo downscaling and do not generalize to super-resolving\nreal-world images. Several recent publications present techniques for improving\nthe generalization of learning-based SR, but are all ill-suited for real-time\napplication.\n  We present a novel approach to synthesizing training data by simulating two\ndigital-camera image-capture processes at different scales. Our method produces\nimage-pairs in which both images have properties of natural images. Training an\nSR model using this data leads to far better generalization to real-world\nimages and videos.\n  In addition, deep video-SR models are characterized by a high\noperations-per-pixel count, which prohibits their application in real-time. We\npresent an efficient CNN architecture, which enables real-time application of\nvideo SR on low-power edge-devices. We split the SR task into two sub-tasks: a\ncontrol-flow which estimates global properties of the input video and adapts\nthe weights and biases of a processing-CNN that performs the actual processing.\nSince the process-CNN is tailored to the statistics of the input, its capacity\nkept low, while retaining effectivity. Also, since video-statistics evolve\nslowly, the control-flow operates at a much lower rate than the video\nframe-rate. This reduces the overall computational load by as much as two\norders of magnitude.

The attacker maximizes load\nshed by infiltrating a number of relays and rendering the components connected\nto them inoperable. The defender responds by minimizing the load shed,\nre-dispatching using a DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) problem on the remaining\nnetwork. Though worst-case interdiction problems on the transmission grid are\nwell-studied, there remains a need for exact and scalable methods. Methods\nbased on using duality on the inner problem rely on the bounds of the dual\nvariables of the defender problem in order to reformulate the bilevel problem\nas a mixed integer linear problem. Valid dual bounds tend to be large,\nresulting in weak linear programming relaxations and making the problem\ndifficult to solve at scale. Often smaller heuristic bounds are used, resulting\nin a lower bound. In this work we also consider a lower bound, where instead of\nbounding the dual variables, we drop the constraints corresponding to Ohm's\nlaw, relaxing DCOPF to capacitated network flow. We present theoretical results\nshowing that, for uncongested networks, approximating DCOPF with network flow\nyields the same set of injections, which suggests that this restriction likely\ngives a high-quality lower bound in the uncongested case. Furthermore, we show\nthat in the network flow relaxation of the defender problem, the duals are\nbounded by 1, so we can solve our restriction exactly. Last, we see empirically\nthat this formulation scales well computationally. Through experiments on 16\nnetworks with up to 6468 buses, we find that this bound is almost always as\ntight as we can get from guessing the dual bounds, even for congested networks.\nIn addition, calculating the bound is approximately 150 times faster than\nachieving the same bound with the reformulation guessing the dual bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 16:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 21:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

To better understand\nAPSP, one often strives to obtain subcubic time algorithms for structured\ninstances of APSP and problems equivalent to it, such as the Min-Plus matrix\nproduct.\n  A natural structured version of Min-Plus product is Monotone Min-Plus product\nwhich has been studied in the context of the Batch Range Mode [SODA'20] and\nDynamic Range Mode [ICALP'20] problems. This paper improves the known\nalgorithms for Monotone Min-Plus Product and for Batch and Dynamic Range Mode,\nand establishes a connection between Monotone Min-Plus Product and the Single\nSource Replacement Paths (SSRP) problem on an $n$-vertex graph with potentially\nnegative edge weights in $\\{-M, \\ldots, M\\}$.\n  SSRP with positive integer edge weights bounded by $M$ can be solved in\n$\\tilde{O}(Mn^\\omega)$ time, whereas the prior fastest algorithm for graphs\nwith possibly negative weights [FOCS'12] runs in $O(M^{0.7519} n^{2.5286})$\ntime, the current best running time for directed APSP with small integer\nweights.

Let $\\lambda$ be the smallest constant such\nthat for every set $I$ of items, the number of bins in the optimal solution to\nG2BP for $I$ is upper bounded by $\\lambda\\operatorname{opt}(I) + c$, where\n$\\operatorname{opt}(I)$ is the number of bins in the optimal solution to 2BP\nfor $I$ and $c$ is a constant. It is known that $4/3 \\le \\lambda \\le 1.692$.\nBansal and Khan [SODA'14] conjectured that $\\lambda = 4/3$. The conjecture, if\ntrue, will imply a $(4/3+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for 2BP.\nAccording to convention, for a given constant $\\delta>0$, a rectangle is large\nif both its height and width are at least $\\delta$, and otherwise it is called\nskewed. We make progress towards the conjecture by showing $\\lambda = 4/3$ for\nskewed instance, i.e., when all input rectangles are skewed. Even for this\ncase, the previous best upper bound on $\\lambda$ was roughly 1.692. We also\ngive an APTAS for 2BP for skewed instance, though general 2BP does not admit an\nAPTAS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 17:16:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

However, it is often difficult to\nobtain full-sequence MRI images of patients owing to limitations such as time\nconsumption and high cost. The purpose of this work is to develop an algorithm\nfor target MRI sequences prediction with high accuracy, and provide more\ninformation for clinical diagnosis. Methods: We propose a deep learning based\nmulti-modal computing model for MRI synthesis with feature disentanglement\nstrategy. To take full advantage of the complementary information provided by\ndifferent modalities, multi-modal MRI sequences are utilized as input. Notably,\nthe proposed approach decomposes each input modality into modality-invariant\nspace with shared information and modality-specific space with specific\ninformation, so that features are extracted separately to effectively process\nthe input data. Subsequently, both of them are fused through the adaptive\ninstance normalization (AdaIN) layer in the decoder. In addition, to address\nthe lack of specific information of the target modality in the test phase, a\nlocal adaptive fusion (LAF) module is adopted to generate a modality-like\npseudo-target with specific information similar to the ground truth.

The key feature of the model is the replacement\nof the traditionally static couplings with a coupling function which can learn\noptimal interactions within heterogeneous oscillator populations. We apply our\napproach to the eponymous Kuramoto model and demonstrate how KuraNet can learn\ndata-dependent coupling structures that promote either global or cluster\nsynchrony. For example, we show how KuraNet can be used to empirically explore\nthe conditions of global synchrony in analytically impenetrable models with\ndisordered natural frequencies, external field strengths, and interaction\ndelays. In a sequence of cluster synchrony experiments, we further show how\nKuraNet can function as a data classifier by synchronizing into coherent\nassemblies.

Instead, our framework relies on the intrinsic geometry of $P$ and in\nparticular its canonical derivative, the deRham rotationnel, which allows us to\nparametrise the Fokker--Planck currents of measure-preserving diffusions using\npotentials. The geometric formalism can easily incorporate constraints and\nsymmetries, and deliver new important insights, for example, a new complete\nrecipe of Langevin-like diffusions that are suited to the construction of\nsamplers. We also analyse the reversibility and dissipative properties of the\ndiffusions, the associated deterministic flow on the space of measures, and the\ngeometry of Langevin processes. Our article connects ideas from various\nliterature and frames the theory of measure-preserving diffusions in its\nappropriate mathematical context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 17:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

Some recent works have proposed to decompose a\nnon-rigidly deforming scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of\ndeformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space,\nthereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they\nrepresent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field,\nwhich makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these\nrepresentations cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we\nintroduce neural blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based\non the skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human\nskeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation\ncorrespondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can\nregularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend\nweight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new\ndeformation fields to animate the human model.

In this paper we\nrevisit this statement by studying the statistics of axion physics in the\nstring landscape. We take moduli stabilisation properly into account since the\nstabilisation of the saxions is crucial to determine the physical properties of\nthe corresponding axionic partners. We focus on the model-independent case of\nclosed string axions in type IIB flux compactifications and find that their\ndecay constants and mass spectrum feature a logarithmic, instead of a\npower-law, distribution. In the regime where the effective field theory is\nunder control, most of these closed string axions are ultra-light axion-like\nparticles, while axions associated to blow-up modes can naturally play the role\nof the QCD axion. Hence, the number of type IIB flux vacua with a closed string\nQCD axion with an intermediate scale decay constant and a natural value of the\nmisalignment angle is only logarithmically suppressed. In a recent paper we\nfound that this correlates also with a logarithmic distribution of the\nsupersymmetry breaking scale, providing the intriguing indication that most, if\nnot all, of the phenomenologically interesting quantities in the string\nlandscape might feature a logarithmic distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

However,\nconstraining formation processes requires mapping the observed exoplanet\npopulation to that which initially formed in the protoplanetary disc. Numerous\nresults suggest that (internal or external) dynamical perturbation alters the\narchitectures of some exoplanetary systems. Isolating planets that have evolved\nwithout any perturbation can help constrain formation processes. We consider\nthe Kepler multiples, which have low mutual inclinations and are unlikely to\nhave been dynamically perturbed. We apply a modelling approach similar to that\nof Mulders et al. (2018), additionally accounting for the two-dimensionality of\nthe radius ($R =0.3-20\\,R_\\oplus$) and period ($P= 0.5-730$ days) distribution.\nWe find that an upper limit in planet mass of the form $M_{\\rm{lim}} \\propto\na^\\beta \\exp(-a_{\\rm{in}}/a)$, for semi-major axis $a$ and a broad range of\n$a_{\\rm{in}}$ and $\\beta$, can reproduce a distribution of $P$, $R$ that is\nindistinguishable from the observed distribution by our comparison metric. The\nindex is consistent with $\\beta= 1.5$, expected if growth is limited by\naccretion within the Hill radius. This model is favoured over models assuming a\nseparable PDF in $P$, $R$. The limit, extrapolated to longer periods, is\ncoincident with the orbits of RV-discovered planets ($a>0.2$ au,\n$M>1\\,M_{\\rm{J}}$) around recently identified low density host stars, hinting\nat isolation mass limited growth. We discuss the necessary circumstances for a\ncoincidental age-related bias as the origin of this result, concluding that\nsuch a bias is possible but unlikely.

These modifications consist of an extension to 3D, the\nability of tiles to form \"flexible\" bonds that allow bound tiles to rotate\nrelative to each other, and allowing tiles of multiple shapes within the same\nsystem. We call this new model the STAM*, and we present a series of\nconstructions within it that are capable of self-replicating behavior. Namely,\nthe input seed assemblies to our STAM* systems can encode either \"genomes\"\nspecifying the instructions for building a target shape, or can be copies of\nthe target shape with instructions built in. A universal tile set exists for\nany target shape (at scale factor 2), and from a genome assembly creates\ninfinite copies of the genome as well as the target shape. An input target\nstructure, on the other hand, can be \"deconstructed\" by the universal tile set\nto form a genome encoding it, which will then replicate and also initiate the\ngrowth of copies of assemblies of the target shape. Since the lengths of the\ngenomes for these constructions are proportional to the number of points in the\ntarget shape, we also present a replicator which utilizes hierarchical\nself-assembly to greatly reduce the size of the genomes required.

The detection of strong ionized gas emission associated with the\ntwo stars at 8 mm, when combined with previous astrometric measurements in the\nnear-infrared, provides an updated view of the binary orbit with $a=7.1\\pm0.1$\nau, $e=0.27\\pm0.1$, and $P=7.7\\pm0.2$ yr, which is about half of a previously\nreported orbital period. The binary orbital plane is proposed to be near\ncoplanar to the circumbinary disk plane (with a mutual inclination of only\n$\\Delta=8\\pm4.2$ deg; another solution with $\\Delta=113$ deg is less likely\ngiven the short re-alignment timescale).

The radial extension of the\ndisk, its asymmetric dust ring, and the presence of a disk warp could all be\nexplained by the interaction between the eccentric binary and the circumbinary\ndisk, which we assume were formed with non-zero mutual inclination.

The edge nodes have low bandwidth and may be\navailable only intermittently. There are helper nodes present in the network\nthat aid the edge nodes in the communication to the server. The edge nodes\ncommunicate the local gradient to helper nodes which relay these messages to\nthe central node after possible aggregation. Recently, schemes using repetition\ncodes and maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes, respectively known as Aligned\nMDS Coding (AMC) scheme and Aligend Repetition Coding (ARC) scheme, were\nproposed. It was observed that in AMC scheme the communication between edge\nnodes and helper nodes is optimal but with an increased cost of communication\nbetween helper and master. An upper bound on the communication cost between\nhelpers and master was obtained. In this paper, a tradeoff between\ncommunication costs at edge nodes and helper nodes is established with the help\nof pyramid codes, a well-known class of locally repairable codes. The\ncommunication costs at both the helper nodes and edge nodes are exactly\ncharacterized. Using the developed technique, the exact communication cost at\nhelper nodes can be computed for the scheme using MDS codes. In the end, we\nprovide two improved aggregation strategies for the existing AMC and ARC\nschemes, yielding significant reduction in communication cost at helpers,\nwithout changing any of the code parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 19:30:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}

A key requirement of practical PoW blockchains\nis to adapt to mining power variations over time. In this paper, we consider\nthe design of provably secure parallel-chain protocols which can adapt to such\nmining power variations.\n  The Bitcoin difficulty adjustment rule adjusts the difficulty target of block\nmining periodically to get a constant mean inter-block time. While\nsuperficially simple, the rule has proved itself to be sophisticated and\nsuccessfully secure, both in practice and in theory. We show that natural\nadaptations of the Bitcoin adjustment rule to the parallel-chain case open the\ndoor to subtle, but catastrophic safety and liveness breaches. We uncover a\nmeta-design principle that allow us to design variable mining difficulty\nprotocols for three popular PoW blockchain proposals (Prism, OHIE, and\nFruitchains) inside a common rubric.\n  The principle has three components:(M1) a pivot chain, based on which blocks\nin all chains choose difficulty, (M2) a monotonicity condition for referencing\npivot chain blocks and (M3) translating additional protocol aspects from using\nlevels (depth) to using \"difficulty levels\". We show that protocols employing a\nsubset of these principles may have catastrophic failures. The security of the\ndesigns is also proved using a common rubric - the key technical challenge\ninvolves analyzing the interaction between the pivot chain and the other\nchains, as well as bounding the sudden changes in difficulty target experienced\nin non-pivot chains. We empirically investigate the responsivity of the new\nmining difficulty rule via simulations based on historical Bitcoin data, and\nfind that the protocol very effectively controls the forking rate across all\nthe chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 19:49:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 01:40:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

The power spectra of the\nlongitudinal component of velocity, averaged over field lines in the core of a\nkG magnetic flux concentration, reveal that the dominant period of oscillations\nshifts from around 6.5 minutes in the photosphere to around 4 minutes in the\nchromosphere.

The\nresulting Schr\\\"oedinger evolution is then investigated both in the vacuum and\nin the presence of a massless scalar field, though as the kinetic component of\nan inflaton. We show that, in vacuum, the morphology of localized wave packets\nis that of a non-spreading profile up to the cosmological singularity. When the\nexternal scalar field is included into the dynamics, we see that the wave\npackets acquire the surprising feature of increasing localization of the\nuniverse volume, as it expands. This result suggests that in the metric f(R)\nformulation of gravity, a spontaneous mechanism arises for the universe\nclassicization.

Here we aim to study\nthe early development of SNR in more details, paying the major attention to the\ntransition from the early-expansion stage to the Sedov stage and the role\nplayed by magnetic field in this transition. To this end, spherical\nmagneto-hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs have been performed to study the\nevolution of magnetic field in young SNRs and explore a sequence of the SNR\nevolutionary stages in the pre-radiative epoch. Remnants of three supernova\ntypes are considered, namely, SNIa, SNIc and SNIIP, that covers a wide space of\nparameters relevant for SNRs. Changes in global characteristics and development\nof spatial distributions are analysed. It is shown that the radial component of\nmagnetic field rapidly drops downstream of the forward shock. Therefore, the\nradially-aligned polarization patterns observed in few young SNRs cannot be\nreproduced in the one-dimensional MHD simulations. The period SNR takes for the\ntransition from the earliest ejecta-driven phase to the Sedov phase is long\nenough, with its distinctive physical features, headed by the energy conversion\nfrom mostly kinetic one to a fixed ratio between the thermal and kinetic\ncomponents.

In this paper, we find CO is not only limited to\nFGSM, but also happens in $\\mbox{DF}^{\\infty}$-1 adversarial training. Then, we\nanalyze the geometric properties for both FGSM and $\\mbox{DF}^{\\infty}$-1 and\nfind they have totally different decision boundaries after CO. For FGSM, a new\ndecision boundary is generated along the direction of perturbation and makes\nthe small perturbation more effective than the large one. While for\n$\\mbox{DF}^{\\infty}$-1, there is no new decision boundary generated along the\ndirection of perturbation, instead the perturbation generated by\n$\\mbox{DF}^{\\infty}$-1 becomes smaller after CO and thus loses its\neffectiveness.

Understanding the mechanisms driving these patterns would inform\nefforts to diversify the academy and shed new light on the role of hiring in\nshaping which scientific discoveries are made. Here, we investigate the degree\nto which structural mechanisms can explain hierarchy and other network\ncharacteristics observed in empirical faculty hiring networks. We study a\nfamily of adaptive rewiring network models, which reinforce institutional\nprestige within the hierarchy in five distinct ways. Each mechanism determines\nthe probability that a new hire comes from a particular institution according\nto that institution's prestige score, which is inferred from the hiring\nnetwork's existing structure. We find that structural inequalities and\ncentrality patterns in real hiring networks are best reproduced by a mechanism\nof global placement power, in which a new hire is drawn from a particular\ninstitution in proportion to the number of previously drawn hires anywhere. On\nthe other hand, network measures of biased visibility are better recapitulated\nby a mechanism of local placement power, in which a new hire is drawn from a\nparticular institution in proportion to the number of its previous hires\nalready present at the hiring institution. These contrasting results suggest\nthat the underlying structural mechanism reinforcing hierarchies in faculty\nhiring networks is a mixture of global and local preference for institutional\nprestige. Under these dynamics, we show that each institution's position in the\nhierarchy is remarkably stable, due to a dynamic competition that\noverwhelmingly favors more prestigious institutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 21:02:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

To achieve high internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs)\nin metal-free organic light emitting diode via TADF, the first triplet (T1) to\nfirst singlet (S1) reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) is promoted by\nconfiguring molecules in an electron donor-acceptor (D-A) alternation with a\nlarge di-hedral angle, which results in a small energy gap ({\\Delta}EST)\nbetween S1 and T1 levels. This allows for effective non-radiative up-conversion\nof triplet excitons to singlet excitons that fluoresce. However, this\ntraditional molecular de-sign of TADF results in broad emission spectral bands\n(full-width at half-maximum = 70-100 nm). Despite reports suggesting that\nsuppressing the D-A dihedral rotation narrows the emission band, the origin of\nemission broadening remains elusive. Indeed, our results suggest that the\nintrinsic TADF emission bandwidth is primarily determined by the charge\ntransfer character of the molecule, rather than its propensity for rotational\nmotion, which offers a renewed perspective on the rational molecular design of\norganic emitters exhibiting sharp emission spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 21:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}

This\nmay result in unfair exposure of items, thus jeopardizing producer benefits.\nAdditionally, they do not care whether consumers from diverse demographic\ngroups are equally satisfied. To address these limitations, we propose a\nmulti-objective optimization framework for fairness-aware recommendation,\nMulti-FR, that adaptively balances accuracy and fairness for various\nstakeholders with Pareto optimality guarantee. We first propose four fairness\nconstraints on consumers and producers. In order to train the whole framework\nin an end-to-end way, we utilize the smooth rank and stochastic ranking policy\nto make these fairness criteria differentiable and friendly to\nback-propagation. Then, we adopt the multiple gradient descent algorithm to\ngenerate a Pareto set of solutions, from which the most appropriate one is\nselected by the Least Misery Strategy. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat Multi-FR largely improves recommendation fairness on multiple stakeholders\nover the state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining almost the same\nrecommendation accuracy.

The fastest algorithm for solving the LCS problem exactly runs\nin essentially quadratic time in the length of the input, and it is known that\nunder the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis the quadratic running time cannot\nbe beaten. There are no such limitations for the approximate computation of the\nLCS however, except in some limited scenarios. There is also a scarcity of\napproximation algorithms. When the two given strings are over an alphabet of\nsize $k$, returning the subsequence formed by the most frequent symbol\noccurring in both strings achieves a $1/k$ approximation for the LCS. It is an\nopen problem whether a better than $1/k$ approximation can be achieved in truly\nsubquadratic time ($O(n^{2-\\delta})$ time for constant $\\delta>0$).\n  A recent result [Rubinstein and Song SODA'2020] showed that a $1/2+\\epsilon$\napproximation for the LCS over a binary alphabet is possible in truly\nsubquadratic time, provided the input strings have the same length. In this\npaper we show that if a $1/2+\\epsilon$ approximation (for $\\epsilon>0$) is\nachievable for binary LCS in truly subquadratic time when the input strings can\nbe unequal, then for every constant $k$, there is a truly subquadratic time\nalgorithm that achieves a $1/k+\\delta$ approximation for $k$-ary alphabet LCS\nfor some $\\delta>0$.

However, the hand-crafted expert knowledge-based features are still\ninsightful. These expert-curated features can increase the model's\ngeneralization and remind the model of some data characteristics, such as the\ntime interval between two patterns. It is particularly advantageous in tasks\nwith the clinically-relevant data, where the data are usually limited and\ncomplex. To keep both implicit deep features and expert-curated explicit\nfeatures together, an effective fusion strategy is becoming indispensable. In\nthis work, we focus on a specific clinical application, i.e., sleep apnea\ndetection. In this context, we propose a contrastive learning-based cross\nattention framework for sleep apnea detection (named ConCAD). The cross\nattention mechanism can fuse the deep and expert features by automatically\nassigning attention weights based on their importance. Contrastive learning can\nlearn better representations by keeping the instances of each class closer and\npushing away instances from different classes in the embedding space\nconcurrently. Furthermore, a new hybrid loss is designed to simultaneously\nconduct contrastive learning and classification by integrating a supervised\ncontrastive loss with a cross-entropy loss. Our proposed framework can be\neasily integrated into standard deep learning models to utilize expert\nknowledge and contrastive learning to boost performance.

The interface model naturally induces a residual stress\nfield into the bulk of the bubble, with possible expansion/shrinkage from a\nstress-free configuration to a natural equilibrium configuration. The\nsignificant influence of interface area strain and the coupled effect of\nstretch and curvature is observed in the numerical simulations based on\nconstrained optimization. Due to the bending rigidity related to additional\nterms, the dynamic interface tension can become negative, but not due to the\ninterface area strain. The coupled effect of interface strain and curvature\nterm observed is new and plays a dominant role in the dominant compression\nbehavior of encapsulated bubbles observed in the experiments.

However, these models are still far from\nsatisfactory when applied to real-world scenes. Based on our analyses, we\npropose a new high-quality dataset and update the previous saliency benchmark.\nSpecifically, our dataset, called Salient Objects in Clutter~\\textbf{(SOC)},\nincludes images with both salient and non-salient objects from several common\nobject categories. In addition to object category annotations, each salient\nimage is accompanied by attributes that reflect common challenges in common\nscenes, which can help provide deeper insight into the SOD problem.

While the performance\nof existing waveform extraction methods are optimal, they are not fast enough\nfor online application, which is important for multi-messenger astronomy. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate that a deep learning architecture consisting of\nConvolutional Neural Network and bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory\ncomponents can be used to extract binary black hole (BBH) GW waveforms from\nrealistic noise in a few milli-seconds. We have tested our network\nsystematically on injected GW signals, with component masses uniformly\ndistributed in the range of 10 to 80 solar masses, on Gaussian noise and LIGO\ndetector noise. We find that our model can extract GW waveforms with overlaps\nof more than 0.95 with pure Numerical Relativity templates for signals with\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than six, and is also robust against\ninterfering glitches. We then apply our model to all ten detected BBH events\nfrom the first (O1) and second (O2) observation runs, obtaining greater than\n0.97 overlaps for all ten extracted BBH waveforms with the corresponding pure\ntemplates. We discuss the implication of our result and its future applications\nto GW localization and mass estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 05:50:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 11:23:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 06:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

Since there is not any\nexplicit efficient construction of AG codes over prime fields, we consider\nconstructions over prime fields with the help of concatenation method and those\nover field extensions. Extending the Fourier analysis done by Benhamouda et\nal., concatenated algebraic geometric codes over prime fields do produce some\nnice leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes. One natural and curious question\nis whether AG codes over extension fields produce better leakage-resilient\nsecret sharing schemes than the construction based on concatenated AG codes.\nSuch construction provides several advantages compared to the construction over\nprime fields using concatenation method. First, AG codes over extension fields\ngive secret sharing schemes with smaller reconstruction for a fixed privacy\nparameter t. Second, concatenated AG codes do not enjoy strong multiplicity and\nhence they are not applicable to secure MPC schemes. It is also confirmed that\nindeed AG codes over extension fields have stronger leakage-resilience under\nsome reasonable assumptions. These three advantages strongly motivate the study\nof secret sharing schemes from AG codes over extension fields. The current\npaper has two main contributions: 1, we obtain leakage-resilient secret sharing\nschemes with constant share sizes and unbounded numbers of players. Like Shamir\nsecret scheme, our schemes enjoy multiplicity and hence can be applied to MPC.\n2, via a sophisticated Fourier Analysis, we analyze the leakage-resilience of\nsecret sharing schemes from codes over extension fields. This is of its own\ntheoretical interest independent of its application to secret sharing schemes\nfrom algebraic geometric codes over extension fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 05:59:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 May 2021 02:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

These\nclaims are at best incomplete, since the arguments presented only demonstrate\nthe existence of one set of timelike observers, the co-moving Eulerian\nobservers, who see \"nice\" physics. While these observers might see a positive\nenergy density, the WEC requires all timelike observers to see positive energy\ndensity. Therefore, one should revisit this issue. A more careful analysis\nshows that the situation is actually much grimmer than advertised -- all\nphysically reasonable warp drives will violate the null energy condition, and\nso also automatically violate the WEC, and both the strong and dominant energy\nconditions. While warp drives are certainly interesting examples of speculative\nphysics, the violation of the energy conditions, at least within the framework\nof standard general relativity, is unavoidable. Even in modified gravity,\nphysically reasonable warp drives will still violate the purely geometrical\nnull convergence condition and the timelike convergence condition which, in\nturn, will place very strong constraints on any modified-gravity warp drive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 06:25:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 23:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

Interprocedural analysis enables a more precise analysis; however, it\nis complicated due to the difficulty of constructing an accurate program call\ngraph. Current algorithms for constructing sound and precise call graphs\nanalyze complex program dependencies, therefore they might be difficult to\nscale. Their complexity stems from the kind of type-inference analysis they\nuse, in particular the use of some variations of points-to analysis. To address\nthis problem, we propose NoCFG, a new sound and scalable method for\napproximating a call graph that supports a wide variety of programming\nlanguages. A key property of NoCFG is that it works on a coarse abstraction of\nthe program, discarding many of the programming language constructs.

We propose an approximate inference framework primarily designed to\nbe computationally cheap while still achieving high approximation quality. The\nconcept, which we call Laplace Matching, involves closed-form, approximate,\nbi-directional transformations between the parameter spaces of exponential\nfamilies. These are constructed from Laplace approximations under\ncustom-designed basis transformations. The mappings can then be leveraged to\neffectively turn a latent Gaussian distribution into an approximate conjugate\nprior to a rich class of observable variables. This allows us to train latent\nGaussian models such as Gaussian Processes on non-Gaussian data at nearly no\nadditional cost. The method can be thought of as a pre-processing step which\ncan be implemented in <5 lines of code and runs in less than a second.\nFurthermore, Laplace Matching yields a simple way to group similar data points\ntogether, e.g. to produce inducing points for GPs.

Purpose: I attempt to uncover the microscopic\nmechanism for the appearance of such a low-energy $2^-$ state in $^{248}$Cf.\nFurthermore, I investigate the possible occurrence of the low-energy\n$K^\\pi=2^+$ state to elucidate the mechanism that prefers the simultaneous\nbreaking of the reflection and axial symmetry to the breaking of the axial\nsymmetry alone in this mass region. Method: I employ a nuclear EDF method: the\nSkyrme-Kohn-Sham-Bogoliubov and the quasiparticle random-phase approximation\nare used to describe the ground state and the transition to excited states.\nResults: The Skyrme-type SkM* and SLy4 functionals reproduce the fall in\nenergy, but not the absolute value, of the $K^\\pi=2^-$ state at $Z=98$, where\nthe proton 2qp excitation $[633]7/2 \\otimes [521]3/2$ plays a decisive role for\nthe peculiar isotonic dependence.

The SkM* model\npredicts the $K^\\pi=2^-$ state appears lower in energy in $^{246}$Cf than in\n$^{248}$Cf as the Fermi level of neutrons is located in between the $[622]5/2$\nand $[734]9/2$ orbitals.

The labels have been designed to consider some aspects\nrelevant to the fact-checking task, such as the tweet's check worthiness,\npositivity/negativity, and factuality. To confirm our annotated dataset's\npractical utility, we used it to train and evaluate several classification\nmodels and reported the obtained results. Though the dataset is mainly designed\nfor fake news detection, it can also be used for hate speech detection,\nopinion/news classification, dialect identification, and many other tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 09:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}

We utilise\nWord2Vec language models to examine the semantic relationships between emojis,\nidentifying clear distinctions in the emoji-emoji relationships of Anonymous\nusers.

The commonly used strategies for Node Embedding Dimension\nSelection (NEDS) based on grid search or empirical knowledge suffer from heavy\ncomputation and poor model performance. In this paper, we revisit NEDS from the\nperspective of minimum entropy principle. Subsequently, we propose a novel\nMinimum Graph Entropy (MinGE) algorithm for NEDS with graph data. To be\nspecific, MinGE considers both feature entropy and structure entropy on graphs,\nwhich are carefully designed according to the characteristics of the rich\ninformation in them.

In addition, the pattern\nspeed of the inner bar also decays faster than the outer bar with a decay\ntimescale of 4.5 Gyr for the inner part and ~12.5 Gyr for the outer parts.

In this work, we propose\nAttention Aggregation based Feature Pyramid Network (A^2-FPN), to improve\nmulti-scale feature learning through attention-guided feature aggregation. In\nfeature extraction, it extracts discriminative features by\ncollecting-distributing multi-level global context features, and mitigates the\nsemantic information loss due to drastically reduced channels.

This problem is overcome by ring- and module-based schemes such\nas Ring-LWE or Module-LWE, whose keysize can be reduced by exploiting its\nalgebraic structure, allowing for faster computations. Many rings may be chosen\nto define such cryptoschemes, but cyclotomic rings, due to their cyclic nature\nallowing for easy multiplication, are the community standard. However, there is\nstill much uncertainty as to whether this structure may be exploited to an\nadversary's benefit.

Currently, DNN models are used to deliver many Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) services that include image and natural language processing,\nspeech recognition, and robotics. Accordingly, such services utilize various\nDNN models that make it computationally intensive for deployment on the edge\ndevices alone. Thus, most AI models are offloaded to distant cloud data centers\n(CDCs), which tend to consolidate large amounts of computing and storage\nresources into one or more CDCs. Deploying services in the CDC will inevitably\nlead to excessive latencies and overall increase in power consumption. Instead,\nfog computing allows for cloud services to be extended to the edge of the\nnetwork, which allows for data processing to be performed closer to the\nend-user device. However, different from cloud data centers, fog nodes have\nlimited computational power and are highly distributed in the network. In this\npaper, using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), we formulate the\nplacement of DNN inference models, which is abstracted as a network embedding\nproblem in a Cloud Fog Network (CFN) architecture, where power savings are\nintroduced through trade-offs between processing and networking.

Fractional Brownian\nmotions, characterized by a single scaling exponent, the Hurst exponent $H$,\nprovide a convenient tool to construct synthetic signals that capture the\nstatistical properties of many processes in the physical sciences and beyond.\nHowever, in certain strongly interacting systems, e.g., turbulent flows, stock\nmarket indices, or cardiac interbeats, multiscale interactions lead to\nsignificant deviations from self-similarity and may therefore require a more\nelaborate description. In the context of turbulence, the Kolmogorov-Oboukhov\nmodel (K62) describes anomalous scaling, albeit explicit constructions of a\nturbulent signal by this model are not available yet. Here, we derive an\nexplicit formula for the joint multipoint probability density function of a\nmultifractal field.

Identifying post-merger-scale (i.e., <~a few kpc) dual SMBHs is a\ncritical pathway to understanding their dynamical evolution and successive\nmergers. While serendipitously discovering kpc-scale dual SMBHs at z<1 is\npossible, such systems are elusive at z>2, but critical to constraining the\nprogenitors of SMBH mergers. The redshift z~2 also marks the epoch of peak\nactivity of luminous quasars, hence probing this spatial regime at high\nredshift is of particular significance in understanding the evolution of\nquasars. However, given stringent resolution requirements, there is currently\nno confirmed <10 kpc physical SMBH pair at z>2. Here we report two sub-arcsec\ndouble quasars at z>2 discovered from a targeted search with a novel\nastrometric technique, demonstrating a high success rate (~50%) in this\nsystematic approach. These high-redshift double quasars could be the\nlong-sought kpc-scale dual SMBHs, or sub-arcsec gravitationally-lensed quasar\nimages. One of these double quasars (at z=2.95) was spatially resolved with\noptical spectroscopy, and slightly favors the scenario of a physical quasar\npair with a projected separation of 3.5 kpc (0.46\"). Follow-up observations of\ndouble quasars discovered by this targeted approach will be able to provide the\nfirst observational constraints on kpc-scale dual SMBHs at z>2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 14:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-16"}

The performance\nof these methods in the presence of data irregularity and high dimensionality,\nsuch as that encountered in electronic health record (EHR) data analysis, has\nbeen less studied. In this research, we describe a general formulation that\nunifies many of the existing learners through a common score function. The new\nformulation allows the incorporation of least absolute deviation (LAD)\nregression and dimension reduction techniques to counter the challenges in EHR\ndata analysis. We show that under a set of mild regularity conditions, the\nresultant estimator has an asymptotic normal distribution. Within this\nframework, we proposed two specific estimators for EHR analysis based on\nweighted LAD with penalties for sparsity and smoothness simultaneously. Our\nsimulation studies show that the proposed methods are more robust to outliers\nunder various circumstances. We use these methods to assess the blood\npressure-lowering effects of two commonly used antihypertensive therapies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 15:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}

The properties of the\nmodal oscillator can be determined by computational or experimental nonlinear\nmodal analysis. The simplification to a single-nonlinear-mode model facilitates\nqualitative and global analysis, and substantially reduces the computational\neffort required for probabilistic methods and design optimization. Important\nlimitations of this theory are that only purely mechanical systems can be\nanalyzed and that the respective nonlinear mode has to be recomputed when the\nsystem's structural properties are varied. With the theoretical extension\nproposed in this work, it becomes feasible to attach linear subsystems to the\nprimary mechanical system, and to approximate the dynamics of this coupled\nsystem using only the nonlinear mode of the primary mechanical system. The\nattachments must be described by linear ordinary or differential-algebraic\nequations with time-invariant coefficient matrices. The attachments do not need\nto be of purely mechanical nature, but may contain, for instance, electric,\nmagnetic, acoustic, thermal or aerodynamic models. This considerably extends\nthe range of utility of nonlinear modes to applications as diverse as model\nupdating or vibration energy harvesting. As long as the attachments do not\nsignificantly deteriorate the host system's modal deflection shape, it is shown\nthat their effect can be reduced to a complex-valued modal impedance and an\nimposed modal forcing term. In the present work, the proposed approach is\ncomputationally assessed for the analysis of exciter-structure interaction.\nMore specifically, the force drop typically encountered in frequency response\ntesting is revisited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 19:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

Data-driven approaches are able to speed the process up significantly by\nenabling to incorporate the effective micromechanical response in macroscale\nsimulations without the need of performing additional computations at each\nGauss point explicitly. Traditionally artificial neural networks (ANNs) have\nbeen the surrogate modeling technique of choice in the solid mechanics\ncommunity. However they suffer from severe drawbacks due to their parametric\nnature and suboptimal training and inference properties for the investigated\ndatasets in a three dimensional setting. These problems can be avoided using\nlocal approximate Gaussian process regression (laGPR). This method can allow\nthe prediction of stress outputs at particular strain space locations by\ntraining local regression models based on Gaussian processes, using only a\nsubset of the data for each local model, offering better and more reliable\naccuracy than ANNs. A modified Newton-Raphson approach is proposed to\naccommodate for the local nature of the laGPR approximation when solving the\nglobal structural problem in a FE setting. Hence, the presented work offers a\ncomplete and general framework enabling multiscale calculations combining a\ndata-driven constitutive prediction using laGPR, and macroscopic calculations\nusing an FE scheme that we test for finite-strain three-dimensional\nhyperelastic problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 14:49:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Although all these schemes\nare successful in reducing delay, ASR word error rate (WER) often severely\ndegrades after applying these delay constraining schemes. In this paper, we\npropose a novel delay constraining method, named self alignment. Self alignment\ndoes not require external alignment models. Instead, it utilizes Viterbi\nforced-alignments from the trained model to find the lower latency alignment\ndirection. From LibriSpeech evaluation, self alignment outperformed existing\nschemes: 25% and 56% less delay compared to FastEmit and constrained alignment\nat the similar word error rate.
