Dumitrescu and Pach [Graphs and Combinatorics, 2006]\nproved that it is always possible to reconfigure one edge-connected\nconfiguration of $n$ squares into any other using at most $O(n^2)$ sliding\nmoves, while keeping the configuration connected at all times.\n  For certain pairs of configurations, reconfiguration may require\n$\\Omega(n^2)$ sliding moves. However, significantly fewer moves may be\nsufficient. We prove that it is NP-hard to minimize the number of sliding moves\nfor a given pair of edge-connected configurations. On the positive side we\npresent Gather&Compact, an input-sensitive in-place algorithm that requires\nonly $O(\\bar{P} n)$ sliding moves to transform one configuration into the\nother, where $\\bar{P}$ is the maximum perimeter of the two bounding boxes. The\nsquares move within the bounding boxes only, with the exception of at most one\nsquare at a time which may move through the positions adjacent to the bounding\nboxes. The $O(\\bar{P} n)$ bound never exceeds $O(n^2)$, and is optimal (up to\nconstant factors) among all bounds parameterized by just $n$ and $\\bar{P}$. Our\nalgorithm is built on the basic principle that well-connected components of\nmodular robots can be transformed efficiently. Hence we iteratively increase\nthe connectivity within a configuration, to finally arrive at a single solid\n$xy$-monotone component.\n  We implemented Gather&Compact and compared it experimentally to the in-place\nmodification by Moreno and Sacrist\\'an [EuroCG 2020] of the Dumitrescu and Pach\nalgorithm (MSDP). Our experiments show that Gather&Compact consistently\noutperforms MSDP by a significant margin, on all types of square\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 16:28:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 16:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

A large\nclass of latent variable models, such as adversarial clustering, mixed\nmembership stochastic block models, and topic models can be cast as learning a\nlatent simplex. Bhattacharyya and Kannan (SODA, 2020) give an algorithm for\nlearning such a latent simplex in time roughly $O(k\\cdot\\textrm{nnz}(A))$,\nwhere $\\textrm{nnz}(A)$ is the number of non-zeros in $A$. We show that the\ndependence on $k$ in the running time is unnecessary given a natural assumption\nabout the mass of the top $k$ singular values of $A$, which holds in many of\nthese applications. Further, we show this assumption is necessary, as otherwise\nan algorithm for learning a latent simplex would imply an algorithmic\nbreakthrough for spectral low rank approximation.\n  At a high level, Bhattacharyya and Kannan provide an adaptive algorithm that\nmakes $k$ matrix-vector product queries to $A$ and each query is a function of\nall queries preceding it. Since each matrix-vector product requires\n$\\textrm{nnz}(A)$ time, their overall running time appears unavoidable.\nInstead, we obtain a low-rank approximation to $A$ in input-sparsity time and\nshow that the column space thus obtained has small $\\sin\\Theta$ (angular)\ndistance to the right top-$k$ singular space of $A$. Our algorithm then selects\n$k$ points in the low-rank subspace with the largest inner product with $k$\ncarefully chosen random vectors.

[...] In addition, we measure an abundance ratio A/E = 1.0 +/-\n0.1, an abundance ratio CH3OH/H2 ~ 2 x 10^{-8}, and a 12CH3OH/13CH3OH ratio 62\n+/- 3. Our analysis shows that the bulk velocities of the different transitions\nare primarily correlated with the observing epoch due to morphological changes\nin the background quasar's emission. There is a weaker correlation between bulk\nvelocities and the lower level energies of the transitions, which could be a\nsignature of temperature-velocity gradients in the absorbing gas. As a result,\nwe do not find evidence for variations of mu, and we estimate Dmu/mu = (-1.8\n+/- 1.2) x 10^{-7} at 1sigma from our multivariate linear regression. We set a\nrobust upper limit | \\Dmu/mu | < 3.6 x 10^{-7} (3sigma) for the invariance of\nmu at a look-back time of half the present age of the Universe. Our analysis\nhighlights that systematics need to be carefully taken into account in future\nradio molecular absorption studies aimed at testing Dmu/mu below the 10^{-7}\nhorizon.

A widely studied decentralized\nalgorithm for this problem is decentralized SGD (D-SGD), in which each node\naverages only with its neighbors. D-SGD is efficient in single-iteration\ncommunication, but it is very sensitive to the network topology. For smooth\nobjective functions, the transient stage (which measures the number of\niterations the algorithm has to experience before achieving the linear speedup\nstage) of D-SGD is on the order of ${\\Omega}(n/(1-\\beta)^2)$ and\n$\\Omega(n^3/(1-\\beta)^4)$ for strongly and generally convex cost functions,\nrespectively, where $1-\\beta \\in (0,1)$ is a topology-dependent quantity that\napproaches $0$ for a large and sparse network.

We show that our approach has the advantage of being independent of the\nabsolute noise level, so that only the number of halos in a given simulation\nand the representativeness of the simulated halos for real clusters limit the\naccuracy of the bias estimation.

Here, we coherently\ncontrol the NV center's spin precession to achieve ultra-sensitive,\nquantitative ac susceptometry of a 2D ferromagnet. Combining dc hysteresis with\nac susceptibility measurements varying temperature, field, and frequency, we\nilluminate the formation, mobility, and consolidation of magnetic domain walls\nin few-layer CrBr3. We show that domain wall mobility is enhanced in ultrathin\nCrBr3, with minimal decrease for excitation frequencies exceeding hundreds of\nkilohertz, and is influenced by the domain morphology and local pinning of the\nflake. Our technique extends NV magnetometry to the multi-functional ac and dc\nmagnetic characterization of wide-ranging spintronic materials at the\nnanoscale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 17:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

Seeds of mass $M_{\\mathrm{seed}}\\sim 10^3-10^{6}~M_{\\odot}/h$ are\nplaced in halos that exceed critical thresholds for star-forming, metal-poor\ngas mass and halo mass (defined as $\\tilde{M}_{\\mathrm{sf,mp}}$ and\n$\\tilde{M}_{\\mathrm{h}}$, respectively, in units of $M_{\\mathrm{seed}}$).

In this paper, we derive a novel dual prescription for\nthe generalized entropy that allows us to interpret the leading quantum\ncorrections in a geometric way with minimal input from the bulk state. The\nequivalence is proven using tools borrowed from convex optimization. The new\nprescription does not involve bulk surfaces but instead uses a generalized\nnotion of a flow, which allows for possible sources or sinks in the bulk\ngeometry. In its discrete version, our prescription can alternatively be\ninterpreted in terms of a set of Planck-thickness bit threads, which can be\neither classical or quantum. This interpretation uncovers an aspect of the\ngeneralized entropy that admits a neat information-theoretic description,\nnamely, the fact that the quantum corrections can be cast in terms of\nentanglement distillation of the bulk state. We also prove some general\nproperties of our prescription, including nesting and a quantum version of the\nmax multiflow theorem. These properties are used to verify that our proposal\nrespects known inequalities that a von Neumann entropy must satisfy, including\nsubadditivity and strong subadditivity, as well as to investigate the fate of\nthe holographic monogamy.

The remnant kick velocity and escape speed\ndistributions are similar for the BHs and neutron stars (NSs), and some NSs\nformed via electron-capture supernovae, accretion-induced collapse or\nmerger-induced collapse escape the cluster in all simulations. The escape speed\ndistributions for the WDs, on the other hand, are very dissimilar.

To maximise the impact of such incoming\ndata, the analysis methods must also step up, extracting reliable information\nfrom the available spectra. In this paper, we aim to investigate the limits and\nthe reliability of different spectral synthesis methods in the estimation of\nthe mean stellar age and metallicity. The main question this work aims to\naddress is which signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) are needed to reliably determine\nthe mean stellar age and metallicity from a galaxy spectrum and how this\ndepends on the tool used to model the spectra. To address this question we\nbuilt a set of realistic simulated spectra containing stellar and nebular\nemission, reproducing the evolution of a galaxy in two limiting cases: a\nconstant star formation rate and an exponentially declining star formation. We\ndegraded the synthetic spectra built from these two star formation histories\n(SFHs) to different S/N and analysed them with three widely used spectral\nsynthesis codes, namely FADO, STECKMAP, and STARLIGHT. For S/N < 5 all three\ntools show a large diversity in the results. The FADO and STARLIGHT tools find\nmedian differences in the light-weighted mean stellar age of ~0.1 dex, while\nSTECKMAP shows a higher value of ~0.2 dex. Detailed investigations of the\nbest-fit spectrum for galaxies with overestimated mass-weighted quantities\npoint towards the inability of purely stellar models to fit the observed\nspectra around the Balmer jump. Our results imply that when a galaxy enters a\nphase of high specific star formation rate the neglect of the nebular continuum\nemission in the fitting process has a strong impact on the estimation of its\nSFH when purely stellar fitting codes are used, even in presence of high S/N\nspectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 18:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 08:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

In this article, we\nreview works on IDS specifically for these kinds of devices from 2008 to 2018,\ncollecting a total of 51 different IDS papers. We summarise the current themes\nof the field, summarise the techniques employed to train and deploy the IDSs\nand provide a qualitative evaluations of these approaches. While these works\nprovide valuable insights and solutions for sub-parts of these constraints, we\ndiscuss the limitations of these solutions as a whole, in particular what kinds\nof attacks these approaches struggle to detect and the setup limitations that\nare unique to this kind of system. We find that although several paper claim\nnovelty of their approach little inter paper comparisons have been made, that\nthere is a dire need for sharing of datasets and almost no shared code\nrepositories, consequently raising the need for a thorough comparative\nevaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 18:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

In brief, we wish to maintain the\nconnected components of the graph under dynamic edge insertions and deletions.\nIn the sequential case, the problem has been well-studied from both theoretical\nand practical perspectives. However, much less is known about efficient\nconcurrent solutions to this problem. This is the gap we address in this paper.\n  We start from one of the classic data structures used to solve this problem,\nthe Euler Tour Tree. Our first contribution is a non-blocking single-writer\nimplementation of it. We leverage this data structure to obtain the first truly\nconcurrent generalization of dynamic connectivity, which preserves the time\ncomplexity of its sequential counterpart, but is also scalable in practice. To\nachieve this, we rely on three main techniques. The first is to ensure that\nconnectivity queries, which usually dominate real-world workloads, are\nnon-blocking. The second non-trivial technique expands the above idea by making\nall queries that do not change the connectivity structure non-blocking. The\nthird ingredient is applying fine-grained locking for updating the connected\ncomponents, which allows operations on disjoint components to occur in\nparallel.\n  We evaluate the resulting algorithm on various workloads, executing on both\nreal and synthetic graphs. The results show the efficiency of each of the\nproposed optimizations; the most efficient variant improves the performance of\na coarse-grained based implementation on realistic scenarios up to 6x on\naverage and up to 30x when connectivity queries dominate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 18:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

If the resolution limitation is not considered when\ndesigning for Large-Scale Additive Manufacturing (LSAM), difficulties can arise\nin the manufacturing process, which may require the adaptation of the\ndeposition parameters. This work incorporates the nozzle size constraint into\nTopology Optimization (TO) in order to generate optimized designs suitable to\nthe process resolution. This article proposes and compares two methods, which\nare based on existing TO techniques that enable control of minimum and maximum\nmember size, and of minimum cavity size. The first method requires the minimum\nand maximum member size to be equal to the deposition nozzle size, thus design\nfeatures of uniform width are obtained in the optimized design. The second\nmethod defines the size of the solid members sufficiently small for the\nresulting structure to resemble a structural skeleton, which can be interpreted\nas the deposition path. Through filtering and projection techniques, the thin\nstructures are thickened according to the chosen nozzle size. Thus, a topology\ntailored to the size of the deposition nozzle is obtained along with a\ndeposition proposal.

But the cost of computing 3D poses from RGB stream is high in the\nabsence of appropriate sensors. This limits the usage of aforementioned\napproaches in real-world applications requiring low latency. Then, how to best\ntake advantage of 3D Poses for recognizing ADL? To this end, we propose an\nextension of a pose driven attention mechanism: Video-Pose Network (VPN),\nexploring two distinct directions.

In order to\nensure SLAs are being met, service levels need to be monitored. One technique\nfor this involves active measurement mechanisms which employ measurement probes\nalong the network to inject synthetic traffic and compute the network\nperformance. However, these mechanisms are expensive in terms of resources\nconsumption. Thus, these mechanisms usually can cover only a fraction of what\ncould be measured, which can lead to SLA violations being missed. Besides that,\nthe definition of this fraction is a practice done by human administrators,\nwhich does not scale well and does not adapt to highly dynamic networking\npatterns. In this article, we examine the potential benefits of using P2P\ntechnology to improve the detection of SLA Violations. We first describe the\nprinciples of a P2P-based steering of active measurement mechanisms. These\nprinciples are characterized by a high degree of decentralized decision making\nacross a network using a self-organizing overlay. In a second step, we present\nmeasurement session activation strategies based on these principles. These\nstrategies do not require human intervention, are adaptive to changes in\nnetwork conditions, and independent of the underlying active measurement\ntechnology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 20:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

This paper\nintroduces a novel analytical approach that poses safe trajectory planning\nunder occlusions as a hybrid zero-sum dynamic game between the autonomous\nvehicle (evader) and an initially hidden traffic participant (pursuer). Due to\nocclusions, the pursuer's state is initially unknown to the evader and may\nlater be discovered by the vehicle's sensors. The analysis yields optimal\nstrategies for both players as well as the set of initial conditions from which\nthe autonomous vehicle is guaranteed to avoid collisions. We leverage this\ntheoretical result to develop a novel trajectory planning framework for\nautonomous driving that provides worst-case safety guarantees while minimizing\nconservativeness by accounting for the vehicle's ability to actively avoid\nother road users as soon as they are detected in future observations.

Different from\nprevious efforts on the entangled feature space, we aim to extract the\nsemantic-rich temporal correlations in the latent interpretable factorized\nrepresentation of the data. Motivated by the success of disentangled\nrepresentation learning in computer vision, we study the possibility of\nlearning semantic-rich time-series representations, which remains unexplored\ndue to three main challenges: 1) sequential data structure introduces complex\ntemporal correlations and makes the latent representations hard to interpret,\n2) sequential models suffer from KL vanishing problem, and 3) interpretable\nsemantic concepts for time-series often rely on multiple factors instead of\nindividuals. To bridge the gap, we propose Disentangle Time Series (DTS), a\nnovel disentanglement enhancement framework for sequential data. Specifically,\nto generate hierarchical semantic concepts as the interpretable and\ndisentangled representation of time-series, DTS introduces multi-level\ndisentanglement strategies by covering both individual latent factors and group\nsemantic segments. We further theoretically show how to alleviate the KL\nvanishing problem: DTS introduces a mutual information maximization term, while\npreserving a heavier penalty on the total correlation and the dimension-wise KL\nto keep the disentanglement property.

Whereas the TBA equations for $T\\bar{T}$ deformations of\nmassive theories are in principle known, the TBA equations we propose for the\ndeformations of conformal field theories (CFT's) are relatively new and require\na special factorization in rapidity variables of the CDD factor for the\nscattering of the massless particles. The latter TBA equations can be solved\nexactly and reproduce the known results for the ground state energy on a\ncylinder of circumference $R$ which were previously obtained using different\nmethods based for instance on the Burgers differential equation. Special\nattention is paid to the c-theorem in this context which is discussed in some\ndetail. For positive infra-red (IR) central charge $c_{IR}$, for flows\nconsistent with the c-theorem the ground state energy develops a (previously\nknown) square-root singularity towards the UV, which strongly suggests the\ntheories are UV incomplete in these physically important cases. We suggest that\nthe singularity indicates a tachyonic vacuum instability. Other cases with\n$c_{IR} < 0$ do not have this singularity and are interpreted as being UV\ncomplete with $c_{UV} = 0$.

Of\nparticular interest are the observed properties of transverse loop\noscillations, such as their frequency and mode of oscillation, which have\nreceived significant attention in recent years because of their seismological\ncapability. Previous studies have relied on standard data analysis techniques,\nsuch as a fast Fourier transform (FFT) and wavelet transform (WT), to correctly\nextract periodicities and identify the MHD modes. However, how these methods\ncan lead to artefacts requires investigation. We assess whether these two\ncommon spectral analysis techniques in coronal seismology can successfully\nidentify high-frequency waves from an oscillating coronal loop. We examine\nextreme ultraviolet images of a coronal loop observed by the Atmospheric\nImaging Assembly in the 171 \\AA waveband on board the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory. We perform a spectral analysis of the loop waveform and compare\nour observation with a basic simulation. The spectral FFT and WT power of the\nobserved loop waveform is found to reveal a significant signal with frequency\n2.67 mHz superposed onto the dominant mode of oscillation of the loop (1.33\nmHz), that is, the second harmonic of the loop. The simulated data show that\nthe second harmonic is completely artificial even though both of these methods\nidentify this mode as a real signal. This artificial harmonic, and several\nhigher modes, are shown to arise owing to the periodic but non-uniform\nbrightness of the loop. We further illustrate that the reconstruction of the\n2.67 mHz component in the presence of noise yields a false perception of\noscillatory behaviour that does not otherwise exist. We suggest that additional\ntechniques such as a forward model of a 3D coronal arcade are necessary to\nverify such high-frequency waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 22:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

We achieve this error\nthreshold by using the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) Gmag photometry to\nderive gray photometric zeropoint corrections, as functions of R.A. and\nDeclination, for the SDSS catalog, and use the Gaia BP-RP colour to derive\ncorrections in the ugiz bands, relative to the r-band. The quality of the\nrecalibrated photometry, tested against Pan-STARRS1, DES, CFIS and GALEX\nsurveys, indicates spatial variations of photometric zeropoints <=0.01 mag\n(RMS), with typical values of 3-7 millimag in the R.A., and 1-2 millimag in the\nDeclination directions, except for <~6 millimag scatter in the u-band.

These ribbon operators are important tools to understand\nquasi-particle excitations. It turns out that there are some subtleties in\ndefining the operators in contrast to what one would naively think. In\nparticular, one has to distinguish two classes of ribbons which we call locally\nclockwise and locally counterclockwise ribbons.

We show how\ncertain properties would fail even in the original model if we do not\ndistinguish these two classes of ribbons. Perhaps not surprisingly, under the\nnew definitions ribbon operators satisfy all properties that are expected. For\ninstance, they create quasi-particle excitations only at the end of the ribbon,\nand the types of the quasi-particles correspond to irreducible representations\nof the Drinfeld double of the input Hopf algebra. However, the proofs of these\nproperties are much more complicated than those in the case of finite groups.\nThis is partly due to the complications in dealing with general Hopf algebras\nrather than just group algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 23:49:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 18:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

The time-domain\nimplementation makes the beamformer output suitable for further use by\nreal-time applications, the nearfield focusing enables the beamforming method\nto suppress an interference even if it is in the same direction as the target\nsource, and the frequency-invariant beampattern makes the beamforming method\nsuitable for enhancing the target source over a broad frequency band.

The proposed HWENO frameworks\nenjoys several advantages. First, compared with the traditional HWENO\nframework, the proposed methods do not need to introduce additional auxiliary\nequations to update the derivatives of the unknown function $\\phi$. They are\nnow computed from the current value of $\\phi$ and the previous spatial\nderivatives of $\\phi$. This approach saves the computational storage and CPU\ntime, which greatly improves the computational efficiency of the traditional\nHWENO scheme.

Second, the fixed-point fast sweeping method is used to update the\nnumerical approximation. It is an explicit method and does not involve the\ninverse operation of nonlinear Hamiltonian, therefore any Hamilton-Jacobi\nequations with complex Hamiltonian can be solved easily. It also resolves some\nknown issues, including that the iterative number is very sensitive to the\nparameter $\\varepsilon$ used in the nonlinear weights, as observed in previous\nstudies.

Competing spreading dynamics, i.e., several epidemics spread\nsimultaneously and compete with each other, have been widely observed in the\nreal world, yet the way arbitrary-sized interactions affect competing spreading\ndynamics still lacks systematic study. This study presents a model of two\ncompeting simplicial susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemics on a\nhigher-order system represented by simplicial complex and analyzes the model's\ncritical phenomena. In the proposed model, a susceptible node can only be\ninfected by one of the two epidemics, and the transmission of infection to\nneighbors can occur through pairwise (i.e., an edge) and high-order (e.g.,\n2-simplex) interactions simultaneously.

When the\n2-simplex infection strength is weak, the model's phase diagram is consistent\nwith the simple graph, consisting of three regions: the absolute dominant\nregions for each epidemic and the epidemic-free region. With the increase of\nthe 2-simplex infection strength, a new phase region called the alternative\ndominant region emerges. In this region, the survival of one epidemic depends\non the initial conditions. Our theoretical analysis can reasonably predict the\ntime evolution and steady-state outbreak size in each region. In addition, we\nfurther explore the model's phase diagram both when the 2-simplex infection\nstrength is symmetrical and asymmetrical. The results show that the 2-simplex\ninfection strength has a significant impact on the system phase diagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 02:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

The matching stage (also known as the retrieval step) identifies a\nsmall fraction of relevant items from billion-scale item corpus in low latency\nand computational cost. Item-to-item collaborative filter (item-based CF) and\nembedding-based retrieval (EBR) have been long used in the industrial matching\nstage owing to its efficiency. However, item-based CF is hard to meet\npersonalization, while EBR has difficulty in satisfying diversity. In this\npaper, we propose a novel matching architecture, Path-based Deep Network (named\nPDN), which can incorporate both personalization and diversity to enhance\nmatching performance. Specifically, PDN is comprised of two modules: Trigger\nNet and Similarity Net. PDN utilizes Trigger Net to capture the user's interest\nin each of his/her interacted item, and Similarity Net to evaluate the\nsimilarity between each interacted item and the target item based on these\nitems' profile and CF information. The final relevance between the user and the\ntarget item is calculated by explicitly considering user's diverse interests,\n\\ie aggregating the relevance weights of the related two-hop paths (one hop of\na path corresponds to user-item interaction and the other to item-item\nrelevance). Furthermore, we describe the architecture design of a matching\nsystem with the proposed PDN in a leading real-world E-Commerce service (Mobile\nTaobao App). Based on offline evaluations and online A/B test, we show that PDN\noutperforms the existing solutions for the same task. The online results also\ndemonstrate that PDN can retrieve more personalized and more diverse relevant\nitems to significantly improve user engagement.

Following the idea, in this paper, we\npresent a neural network model called the Recurrent Correlational Network,\nwhere detection and tracking are jointly performed over a multi-frame\nrepresentation learned through a single, trainable, and end-to-end network. The\nframework exploits a convolutional long short-term memory network for learning\ninformative appearance changes for detection, while the learned representation\nis shared in tracking for enhancing its performance. In experiments with\ndatasets containing images of scenes with small flying objects, such as birds\nand unmanned aerial vehicles, the proposed method yielded consistent\nimprovements in detection performance over deep single-frame detectors and\nexisting motion-based detectors. Furthermore, our network performs as well as\nstate-of-the-art generic object trackers when it was evaluated as a tracker on\na bird image dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 03:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

In this work, we propose a class of channels which,\ninitially, cannot violate the LGI (in the form of the temporal Bell inequality)\nbut can violate it after the application of stochastic pre- and post-\noperations (SPPOs). As a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate the\nstochastic pre- and post- operations in an amplitude-damping channel with\nphotonic qubits. We denote the above phenomenon as hidden nonmacrorealistic\nchannels. We also discuss the relationship between this hidden\nnonmacrorealistic channels (in terms of the temporal Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt\n(CHSH) inequality) and the strongly nonlocality-breaking channel, which breaks\nthe hidden spatial CHSH nonlocality for arbitrary states. In general, if the\nchannel satisfies hidden nonmacrorealism, it is not a strongly CHSH\nnonlocality-breaking channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 04:47:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 07:31:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 05:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

With the help of deep learning and reinforcement learning, people have\nproposed various policies to solve these traffic-related problems, such as\nsmart traffic signal control systems and taxi dispatching systems. People\nusually validate these policies in a city simulator, since directly applying\nthem in the real city introduces real cost. However, these policies validated\nin the city simulator may fail in the real city if the simulator is\nsignificantly different from the real world. To tackle this problem, we need to\nbuild a real-like traffic simulation system. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose to learn the human routing model, which is one of the most essential\npart in the traffic simulator. This problem has two major challenges. First,\nhuman routing decisions are determined by multiple factors, besides the common\ntime and distance factor. Second, current historical routes data usually covers\njust a small portion of vehicles, due to privacy and device availability\nissues. To address these problems, we propose a theory-guided residual network\nmodel, where the theoretical part can emphasize the general principles for\nhuman routing decisions (e.g., fastest route), and the residual part can\ncapture drivable condition preferences (e.g., local road or highway). Since the\ntheoretical part is composed of traditional shortest path algorithms that do\nnot need data to train, our residual network can learn human routing models\nfrom limited data. We have conducted extensive experiments on multiple\nreal-world datasets to show the superior performance of our model, especially\nwith small data. Besides, we have also illustrated why our model is better at\nrecovering real routes through case studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 05:07:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 09:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

In this line of work, given an auction setting\nwith $m$ items and $n$ bidders, the goal is to find the smallest $n' \\geq n$\nsuch that selling the items to $n'$ bidders through a simple auction generates\n(almost) the same revenue as the optimal auction.\n  Recently, Feldman, Friedler, and Rubinstein [EC, 2018] showed that an\narbitrarily large constant fraction of the optimal revenue from selling $m$\nitems to a single bidder can be obtained via simple auctions with a constant\nnumber of bidders. However, their techniques break down even for two bidders,\nand can only show a bound of $n' = n \\cdot O(\\log \\frac{m}{n})$.\n  Our main result is that $n' = O(n)$ bidders suffice for all values of $m$ and\n$n$. That is, we show that, for all $m$ and $n$, an arbitrarily large constant\nfraction of the optimal revenue from selling $m$ items to $n$ bidders can be\nobtained via simple auctions with $O(n)$ bidders.

In this paper, we present a strong\norientation for $S_{n,k}$ that combines approaches suggested by Cheng and\nLipman [Journal of Interconnection Networks (2002)] for $S_{n,k}$ with the one\nproposed by Fujita [The First International Symposium on Computing and\nNetworking (CANDAR 2013)] for $S_n$. Next, we propose a distributed routing\nalgorithm for $\\overrightarrow{S_{n,k}}$ inspired by an algorithm proposed by\nKumar, Rajendraprasad and Sudeep [Discrete Applied Mathematics (2021)] for\n$\\overrightarrow{S_n}$. With the aid of both the orientation scheme and the\nrouting algorithm, we show that $\\overrightarrow{\\text{diam}}(S_{n,k}) \\leq\n\\lfloor \\frac{n+k}{2} \\rfloor + 2k + 6 - \\delta(n,k)$ where $\\delta(n,k)$ is a\nnon-negative function. The function $\\delta(n,k)$ takes on values $2k-n$, $0$,\nand $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-3k}{2} \\right\\rfloor$ respectively for three disjoint\nintervals $k>\\frac{n}{2}$, $\\frac{n}{3} < k \\leq \\frac{n}{2}$ and $k\\leq\n\\frac{n}{3}$. For every value of $n$, $k$, our upper bound performs better than\nall known bounds in literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 06:51:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 15:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Addressing reachability queries on\nsuch datasets is important for a wide range of applications (surveillance,\npublic health, social networks, etc.) A spatiotemporal reachability query\nidentifies whether a physical item (or information etc.) could have been\ntransferred from the source object $O_S$ to the target object $O_T$ during a\ntime interval $I$ (either directly, or through a chain of intermediate\ntransfers). In previous research on spatiotemporal reachability queries, the\nnumber of such transfers is not limited, and the weight of a piece of\ntransferred information remains the same. This paper introduces novel\nreachability queries, which assume a scenario of information decay. Such\nqueries arise when the value of information that travels through the chain of\nintermediate objects decreases with each transfer. To address such queries\nefficiently over large spatiotemporal datasets, we introduce the RICCdecay\nalgorithm. Further, the decay scenario leads to an important extension: if\nthere are many different sources of information, the aggregate value of\ninformation an object can obtain varies. As a result, we introduce a top-k\nreachability problem, identifying the k objects with the highest accumulated\ninformation. We also present the RICCtopK algorithm that can efficiently\ncompute top-k reachability with transfer decay queries. An experimental\nevaluation shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithms over previous\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 07:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

For satisfying the\ndiversity requirements of different users, i.e. the minimum rate requirement\nfor cellular user and the reliability requirement for D2D user, we attempt to\nmaximize the cellular user's throughput whilst ensuring a chance constraint for\nD2D user. Then, a robust resource allocation framework is proposed for solving\nthe highly intractable chance constraint about D2D reliability requirement,\nwhere the CSI uncertainties are represented as a deterministic set and the\nreliability requirement is enforced to hold for any uncertain CSI within it.\nThen, a symmetrical-geometry-based learning approach is developed to model the\nuncertain CSI into polytope, ellipsoidal and box.

We present the first detailed analysis of the astrophysical parameters\nof the poorly studied Sco-Cen member HD 152384 and its circumstellar\nenvironment. Methods. We analyze newly obtained optical-near-IR XSHOOTER\nspectra, as well as archival TESS data, of HD 152384. In addition, we use\nliterature photometric data to construct a detailed spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of the star. Results. The photospheric absorption lines in\nthe spectrum of HD 152384 are characteristic of a A0 V star, for which we\nderive a stellar mass of 2.1 +/- 0.1 M_sun and a stellar age > 4.5 Myr.\nSuperimposed on the photospheric absorption, the optical spectrum also displays\ndouble-peaked emission lines of Ca II, Fe I, Mg I and Si I, typical of\ncircumstellar disks. Notably, all Hydrogen and Helium lines appear strictly in\nabsorption. A toy model shows that the observed emission line profiles can be\nreproduced by emission from a compact (radius < 0.3 au) disk seen at an\ninclination of ~24 degrees. Further evidence for the presence of circumstellar\nmaterial comes from the detection of a moderate infrared excess in the SED,\nsimilar to those found in extreme debris disk systems. Conclusions. We conclude\nthat HD 152384 is surrounded by a tenuous circumstellar disk which, although\nrich in refractory elements, is highly depleted of volatile elements. To the\nbest of our knowledge such a disk is unique within the group of young stars.\nHowever, it is reminiscent of the disks seen in some white dwarfs, which have\nbeen attributed to the disruption of rocky planets.

The\ndistribution of full-sibs obtainedamong the sampling sites was used to estimate\nindividual dispersal distances within families. Our results showed that T.\npolycolpus sibs tend to be aggregated within sites but not withinhost\nindividuals. We detected important upstream-to-downstream dispersal events of\nT.polycolpusbetween sites (modal distance: 25.4 km; 95% CI [22.9, 27.7]),\nbecoming scarcer as the geographic distance from their family core location\nincreases. Such a dispersal pattern likely contributes to the strong\nisolation-by-distance observed at the river scale. We also detected some\ndownstream-to-upstream dispersal events (modal distance: 2.6 km; 95% CI\n[2.2-23.3]) that likely result from movementsof infected hosts.Within each\nsite, the dispersal of free-living infective larvae among hosts likely\ncontributes to increasing genetic diversity on hosts, possibly fostering the\nevolutionary potential of T. polycolpus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 08:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

This allows us to characterize the stars dynamically, and\nin particular to select a sub-sample that belongs to the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus\n(GSE) accretion event. We are thus able to provide also the MDF of GSE.\nConclusions. The metal-weak tail derived in our study is very similar to that\nderived in the H3 survey and in the Hamburg/ESO Survey. This allows us to\naverage the three MDFs and provide an error bar for each metallicity bin.\nInasmuch the GSE structure is representative of the progenitor galaxy that\ncollided with the Milky Way, that galaxy appears to be strongly deficient in\nmetal-poor stars compared to the Milky Way, suggesting that the metal-weak tail\nof the latter has been largely formed by accretion of low mass galaxies rather\nthan massive galaxies, such as the GSE progenitor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 08:36:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 09:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

This paper presents I2C2W, a novel scene text\nrecognition technique that is tolerant to geometric and photometric degradation\nby decomposing scene text recognition into two inter-connected tasks. The first\ntask focuses on image-to-character (I2C) mapping which detects a set of\ncharacter candidates from images based on different alignments of visual\nfeatures in an non-sequential way. The second task tackles character-to-word\n(C2W) mapping which recognizes scene text by decoding words from the detected\ncharacter candidates. The direct learning from character semantics (instead of\nnoisy image features) corrects falsely detected character candidates\neffectively which improves the final text recognition accuracy greatly.\nExtensive experiments over nine public datasets show that the proposed I2C2W\noutperforms the state-of-the-art by large margins for challenging scene text\ndatasets with various curvature and perspective distortions.

Instead,\nAI-based approaches are needed which leverage on a model of the non-faulty\nsystem and which search for a set of reconfiguration operations which will\nestablish a valid behavior again.\n  This work presents a novel algorithm which solves three main challenges: (i)\nOnly a model of the non-faulty system is needed, i.e. the faulty behavior does\nnot need to be modeled. (ii) It discretizes and reduces the search space which\noriginally is too large -- mainly due to the high number of continuous system\nvariables and control signals. (iii) It uses a SAT solver for propositional\nlogic for two purposes: First, it defines the binary concept of validity.\nSecond, it implements the search itself -- sacrificing the optimal solution for\na quick identification of an arbitrary solution.

We demonstrate our approach by using an acoustic\nscrew dislocation to tie a knot in a sessile droplet. We observe an inversion\nof the knot chirality (measured by the hydrodynamic helicity) as the\ntopological charge of the screw dislocation is increased. Combined with recent\nprogress in acoustic field synthesis, this work opens a window to study more\ncomplex hydrodynamic knot topologies at a broader range of space and\ntimescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 10:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

Nowadays, significant improvements have been\nobtained by deep learning networks. Still, object detection is considered one\nof the leading open issues within computer vision.\n  The current scenario is constantly evolving, and new models and techniques\nare appearing trying to improve this field.

In this regard, we consider several\nentropic dark energy models - like Tsallis entropic DE, the R\\'{e}nyi entropic\nDE, and the Sharma-Mittal entropic DE - and showed that they are indeed\nequivalent with the generalized HDE. Such equivalence between the entropic DE\nand the generalized HDE is extended to the scenario where the respective\nexponents of the entropy functions are allowed to vary with the expansion of\nthe universe.

The escape rate averaged over the disorder configurations is\nfound to exhibit a maximum for intermediate coupling strengths, before\nsaturating at a lower value in the collective strong coupling limit - a \"cavity\nprotection\" effect.

In\nthis article, with the Levy random fields as the starting point, e construct a\nnew Bayesian nonparametric, nonstationary and nonseparable dynamic spatio-\ntemporal model with the additional realistic property that the lagged\nspatio-temporal correlations converge to zero as the lag tends to infinity.\nAlthough our Bayesian model seems to be intricately structured and is\nvariable-dimensional with respect to each time index, we are able to devise a\nfast and efficient parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for\nBayesian inference. Our simulation experiment brings out quite encouraging\nperformance from our Bayesian Levy-dynamic approach. We finally apply our\nBayesian Levy-dynamic model and methods to a sea surface temperature dataset\nconsisting of 139,300 data points in space and time. Although not big data in\nthe true sense, this is a large and highly structured data by any standard.\nEven for this large and complex data, our parallel MCMC algorithm, implemented\non 80 processors, generated 110,000 MCMC realizations from the Levy-dynamic\nposterior within a single day, and the resultant Bayesian posterior predictive\nanalysis turned out to be encouraging. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect\nthat with significantly more computing resources, it is feasible to analyse\nterabytes of spatio-temporal data with our new model and methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 11:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Methods: Three-dimensional numerical\nsimulations convection in Cartesian geometry are used. The convection zone (CZ)\nis embedded between two stably stratified layers. Statistics and transport\nproperties of up- and downflows are studied separately. Results: The rms\nvelocity increases with decreasing Prandtl number. At the same time the filling\nfactor of downflows decreases and leads to stronger downflows at lower Prandtl\nnumbers, and to a strong dependence of overshooting on the Prandtl number.\nVelocity power spectra do not show marked changes as a function of Prandtl\nnumber. At the highest Reynolds numbers the velocity power spectra are\ncompatible with the Bolgiano-Obukhov $k^{-11/5}$ scaling. The horizontally\naveraged convected energy flux ($\\overline{F}_{\\rm conv}$) is independent of\nthe Prandtl number within the CZ. However, the upflows (downflows) are the\ndominant contribution to the convected flux at low (high) Prandtl number. These\nresults are similar to those from Rayleigh-Ben\\'ard convection in the low\nPrandtl number regime where convection is vigorously turbulent but inefficient\nat transporting energy. Conclusions: The current results indicate a strong\ndependence of convective overshooting and energy flux on the Prandtl number.\nNumerical simulations of astrophysical convection often use Prandtl number of\nunity. The current results suggest that this can lead to misleading results and\nthat the astrophysically relevant low Prandtl number regime is qualitatively\ndifferent from the parameters regimes explored in typical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 11:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

The\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model is used to self-consistently calculate the\neffects the plasma pressure induces on the magnetic field used to confine the\nplasma. Such MHD calculations serve as input for the assessment of a number of\nimportant physics questions. The VMEC code is the most widely used to evaluate\n3D ideal-MHD equilibria, as prominently present in stellarators. However,\nconsidering the computational cost, it is rarely used in large-scale or online\napplications. Access to fast MHD equilbria is a challenging problem in fusion\nresearch, one which machine learning could effectively address. In this paper,\nwe present artificial neural network (NN) models able to quickly compute the\nequilibrium magnetic field of W7-X. Magnetic configurations that extensively\ncover the device operational space, and plasma profiles with volume averaged\nnormalized plasma pressure $\\langle \\beta \\rangle$ ($\\beta$ = $\\frac{2 \\mu_0\np}{B^2}$) up to 5% and non-zero net toroidal current are included in the data\nset. By using convolutional layers, the spectral representation of the magnetic\nflux surfaces can be efficiently computed with a single network. To discover\nbetter models, a Bayesian hyper-parameter search is carried out, and 3D\nconvolutional neural networks are found to outperform feed-forward\nfully-connected neural networks. The achieved normalized root-mean-squared\nerror ranges from 1% to 20% across the different scenarios. The model inference\ntime for a single equilibrium is on the order of milliseconds. Finally, this\nwork shows the feasibility of a fast NN drop-in surrogate model for VMEC, and\nit opens up new operational scenarios where target applications could make use\nof magnetic equilibria at unprecedented scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 12:19:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 08:40:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

Current systems for DDA rely on expensive\ndata mining, or on hand-crafted rules designed for particular domains, and\nusually adapts to keep players in the flow, leaving no room for the designer to\npresent content that is purposefully easy or difficult. This paper presents\nFast Bayesian Content Adaption (FBCA), a system for DDA that is agnostic to the\ndomain and that can target particular difficulties. We deploy this framework in\ntwo different domains: the puzzle game Sudoku, and a simple Roguelike game. By\nmodifying the acquisition function's optimization, we are reliably able to\npresent a content with a bespoke difficulty for players with different skill\nlevels in less than five iterations for Sudoku and fifteen iterations for the\nsimple Roguelike. Our method significantly outperforms simpler DDA heuristics\nwith the added benefit of maintaining a model of the user. These results point\ntowards a promising alternative for content adaption in a variety of different\ndomains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 12:56:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 22:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

With both phonon-drag\nand band transport contributions, the CPASS coefficients are computed based on\nthe Boltzmann transport theory. The spin accumulations by the CPASS effect\nquadratically increase with temperature gradient, and vary with the chemical\npotential modulation, thus enabling highly efficient and tunable spin\ngeneration. The CPASS effect provides a promising explanation on the\nchiral-induced spin selectivity effect and opportunities for designing advanced\nspintronic devices based on nonmagnetic chiral materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 12:57:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2022 12:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

However, it is more difficult\nto acquire customers in financial advertising (e.g., credit card advertising)\nthan in traditional advertising.

To enhance the generalization ability, we build a\nsynthetic single-object grasp dataset including 150 commodities of various\nshapes, and a multi-object cluttered scene dataset including 100k point clouds\nwith robust, dense grasp poses and mask annotations. Experiments conducted on\nYumi IRB-1400 Robot demonstrate that the model trained on our dataset performs\nwell in real environments and outperforms previous methods by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 13:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

SANM solves such systems in a fully\nautomated manner. SANM also extends ANM to support many nonquadratic operators,\nincluding intricate ones such as singular value decomposition. Furthermore,\nSANM generalizes ANM to support the implicit homotopy form. Moreover, SANM\nachieves high computing performance via optimized system design and\nimplementation.\n  We deploy SANM to solve forward and inverse elastic force equilibrium\nproblems and controlled mesh deformation problems with a few constitutive\nmodels.

We study the complexity of consensus-related questions, with a\nparticular focus on Kemeny and its qualitative version Slater. The simplest of\nthese questions is the problem of determining whether a ranking is a consensus,\nand we show that this problem is coNP-complete. We also study the natural\nquestion of the complexity of manipulative actions that have a specific\nconsensus as a goal. Though determining whether a ranking is a Kemeny consensus\nis hard, the optimal action for manipulators is to simply vote their desired\nconsensus. We provide evidence that this simplicity is caused by the\ncombination of election system (Kemeny), manipulative action (manipulation),\nand manipulative goal (consensus). In the process we provide the first\ncompleteness results at the second level of the polynomial hierarchy for\nelectoral manipulation and for optimal solution recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 14:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

To see what kind of trajectories might occur\nwe explore the domain of support of the propagators associated with the wave\nequations. For a minimally coupled massless scalar field the domain of support\nin curved space is shown to not be restricted to the light cone, while for a\nconformally coupled massless scalar field the curved space domain is only\nrestricted to the light cone if it propagates in a conformal to flat\nbackground. Consequently, eikonalization does not in general lead to null\ngeodesics for curved space massless rays even though it does lead to straight\nline trajectories in flat spacetime. Equal remarks apply to the massless\nconformal invariant Maxwell equations.

The main aim of this thesis is to understand the nature of some\nscalar and vector mesonic states which still remain puzzling. In this thesis we\ninvestigate two nonets of $q\\bar{q}$ excited vector mesons. Within an effective\nQFT model we evaluate various decay channels of these states and compare the\nresults with experimental data from PDG. Moreover, we make predictions for a\nnot-yet observed $s\\bar{s}$ state in $1$ $^3D_1$ nonet. Some non-conventional\nmesons can be understood by the mechanism of dynamical generation. We show that\nthe inclusion of a single conventional $q\\bar{q}$ seed in the relativistic QFT\nLagrangian may cause the appearance of an additional associated state as a\ndynamically generated companion pole.

For example, the theta body of the\nexclusivity graph can be associated with the set of correlations achieved by\nquantum theory. Following the CSW approach, one may think that the theta body\nof the CHSH graph, is equal to the quantum set of the CHSH Bell inequality, but\nis this really true? All assumptions about the CHSH inequalities come from Bell\nscenarios, while CSW approach only demands the exclusivity structure of a\nnon-contextuality (NC) scenario. To deal with the extra structure related to\nthe presence of different players in a Bell scenario like CHSH, the\ncolored-graph approach was introduced. Does it make any difference to think\nabout CHSH as a Bell scenario or a more general NC scenario? The Bell CHSH\ninequality is represented by a bicolored graph and the NC CHSH inequality by a\nsimple graph, which is the shadow of the colored graph. In general, we have\nthat the theta body of the colored graph is a subset of the theta body of its\nshadow graph in the same way that the Lov\\`asz number, which corresponds to the\nquantum bound, of the simple graph is greater than or equal to the Lov\\`asz\nnumber of the colored graph. In the case of the CHSH inequality, we have that\nthe Lov\\`asz numbers are equal. Does this accident also hold for the\ncorresponding quantum sets? Is it true that the theta bodies are equal, which\nwould mean that every correlation reached by quantum theory applied to the CHSH\nNC scenario could also be obtained at the in principle more restrictive CHSH\nBell scenario? In this paper our answer to such a question is negativ.

Extant works have taken the neighborhood formation as the critical\ninformation to reveal the inherent dynamics of network structures, and\nsuggested encoding temporal edge formation sequences to capture the historical\ninfluences of neighbors. In this paper, however, we argue that the edge\nformation can be attributed to a variety of driving factors including the\ntemporal influence, which is better referred to as multiple aspects. As a\nmatter of fact, different node aspects can drive the formation of distinctive\nneighbors, giving birth to the multi-aspect embedding that relates to but goes\nbeyond a temporal scope. Along this vein, we propose a Mixture of Hawkes-based\nTemporal Network Embeddings (MHNE) model to capture the aspect-driven\nneighborhood formation of networks. In MHNE, we encode the multi-aspect\nembeddings into the mixture of Hawkes processes to gain the advantages in\nmodeling the excitation effects and the latent aspects. Specifically, a graph\nattention mechanism is used to assign different weights to account for the\nexcitation effects of history events, while a Gumbel-Softmax is plugged in to\nderive the distribution over the aspects. Extensive experiments on 8 different\ntemporal networks have demonstrated the great performance of the multi-aspect\nembeddings obtained by MHNE in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 14:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

There are typically two different approaches to inferring the mass\nformation history (MFH) of a given galaxy from its luminosity in different\nbands. Non-parametric methods are known for their flexibility and accuracy,\nwhile parametric models are more computationally efficient. Aims. In this work\nwe propose an alternative, based on a polynomial expansion around the present\ntime, that combines the advantages of both techniques. Methods. In our\napproach, the MFH is decomposed through an orthonormal basis of N polynomials\nin lookback time. To test the proposed framework, synthetic observations are\ngenerated from models based on common analytical approximations (exponential,\ndelayed-$\\tau$, and Gaussian star formation histories), as well as cosmological\nsimulations for the Illustris-TNG suite. A normalized distance is used to\nmeasure the quality of the fit, and the input MFH is compared with the\npolynomial reconstructions both at the present time and through cosmic\nevolution. Our polynomial expansion is also compared with widely used\nparametric and non-parametric methods such as CIGALE anda PROSPECTOR.

Functional data exhibiting unmatched boundaries typically\narise from dynamical systems with variable evolution rates such as COVID-19\ninfection rate curves associated with different geographical regions. In this\ncase, it is more natural to model such data with sliding boundaries and use\npartial matching, i.e., only a part of a function is matched to another\nfunction.

We develop a Bayesian method\ndesigned to sift high-energy photon events from multiple sources with\noverlapping point spread functions, leveraging the differences in their\nspatial, spectral, and temporal signatures. The method probabilistically\nassigns each event to a given source.

During Sector 21, the planet TIC 172900988b\ntransited the primary star and then 5 days later it transited the secondary\nstar. The binary is itself eclipsing, with a period of P = 19.7 days and an\neccentricity of e = 0.45. Archival data from ASAS-SN, Evryscope, KELT, and\nSuperWASP reveal a prominent apsidal motion of the binary orbit, caused by the\ndynamical interactions between the binary and the planet. A comprehensive\nphotodynamical analysis of the TESS, archival and follow-up data yields stellar\nmasses and radii of M1 = 1.2384 +/- 0.0007 MSun and R1 = 1.3827 +/- 0.0016 RSun\nfor the primary and M2 = 1.2019 +/- 0.0007 MSun and R2 = 1.3124 +/- 0.0012 RSun\nfor the secondary.

For\nexample, two different applications might use very different JSON\nrepresentations, or two PDF-writing applications might make use of very\ndifferent areas of the PDF specification to realize the same rendered content.\nThe complexity arising from these distinct origins can lead to large,\ndifficult-to-understand attack surfaces, presenting a security concern when\nconsidering both exfiltration and data schizophrenia. Grammar inference can aid\nin describing the practical language generator behind examples of a data\nformat. However, most grammar inference research focuses on natural language,\nnot data formats, and fails to support crucial features such as type recursion.\nWe propose a novel set of mechanisms for grammar inference, RL-GRIT, and apply\nthem to understanding de facto data formats. After reviewing existing grammar\ninference solutions, it was determined that a new, more flexible scaffold could\nbe found in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Within this work, we lay out the many\nalgorithmic changes required to adapt RL from its traditional, sequential-time\nenvironment to the highly interdependent environment of parsing. The result is\nan algorithm which can demonstrably learn recursive control structures in\nsimple data formats, and can extract meaningful structure from fragments of the\nPDF format. Whereas prior work in grammar inference focused on either regular\nlanguages or constituency parsing, we show that RL can be used to surpass the\nexpressiveness of both classes, and offers a clear path to learning\ncontext-sensitive languages. The proposed algorithm can serve as a building\nblock for understanding the ecosystems of de facto data formats.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 23:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

We enforce fairness as a model\nselection step in which we choose the value of a ridge penalty to control the\neffect of sensitive attributes. We then estimate the parameters of the model\nconditional on the chosen penalty value. Our proposal is mathematically simple,\nwith a solution that is partly in closed form, and produces estimates of the\nregression coefficients that are intuitive to interpret as a function of the\nlevel of fairness. Furthermore, it is easily extended to generalised linear\nmodels, kernelised regression models and other penalties; and it can\naccommodate multiple definitions of fairness.\n  We compare our approach with the regression model from Komiyama et al.\n(2018), which implements a provably-optimal linear regression model; and with\nthe fair models from Zafar et al. (2019). We evaluate these approaches\nempirically on six different data sets, and we find that our proposal provides\nbetter goodness of fit and better predictive accuracy for the same level of\nfairness.
