This paper describes the development of a novel class of\ncompact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting abnormal patterns\nand electrodes in EEGs for epilepsy. The designed model is inspired by a CNN\ndeveloped for brain-computer interfacing called multichannel EEGNet (mEEGNet).\nUnlike the EEGNet, the proposed model, mEEGNet, has the same number of\nelectrode inputs and outputs to detect abnormal patterns. The mEEGNet was\nevaluated with a clinical dataset consisting of 29 cases of juvenile and\nchildhood absence epilepsy labeled by a clinical expert. The labels were given\nto paroxysmal discharges visually observed in both ictal (seizure) and\ninterictal (nonseizure) durations. Results showed that the mEEGNet detected\nabnormalities with the area under the curve, F1-values, and sensitivity\nequivalent to or higher than those of existing CNNs. Moreover, the number of\nparameters is much smaller than other CNN models.

Typically, retailers select a\nsubset of items, corresponding to an \"assortment\" of brands to carry, and make\neach selected item available for purchase at its brand-recommended price.\nDespite the tremendous importance in practice, the best method for selling\nthese fixed-price items is not well understood, as retailers have begun\nexperimenting with making certain items available only through a lottery.\n  In this paper we analyze the maximum possible revenue that can be earned in\nthis setting, given that the buyer's preference is private but drawn from a\nknown distribution. In particular, we introduce a Bayesian mechanism design\nproblem where the buyer has a random ranking over fixed-price items and an\noutside option, and the seller optimizes a (randomized) allocation of up to one\nitem. We show that allocations corresponding to assortments are suboptimal in\ngeneral, but under many commonly-studied Bayesian priors for buyer rankings\nsuch as the MNL and Markov Chain choice models, assortments are in fact\noptimal. Therefore, this large literature on assortment optimization has much\ngreater significance than appreciated before -- it is not only computing\noptimal assortments; it is computing the economic limit of the seller's revenue\nfor these fixed-price substitute items.\n  We derive several further results -- a more general sufficient condition for\nassortments being optimal that captures choice models beyond Markov Chain, a\nproof that Nested Logit choice models cannot be captured by Markov Chain but\ncan be partially captured by our condition, and suboptimality gaps for\nassortments when our condition does not hold. Finally, we show that our\nmechanism design problem provides the tightest-known LP relaxation for\nassortment optimization under the ranking distribution model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 16:12:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 13:25:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 16:18:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 04:14:05 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 16:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

In a general assignment problem, a group of agents expresses\npreferences over a set of items, and the task is to allocate items to agents in\nan \"optimal\" way. A verification variant of this problem includes an allocation\nas part of the input, and the question becomes whether this allocation is\n\"optimal\". In this paper, we generalize the verification variant to the setting\nwhere each agent is equipped with multiple incomplete preference lists: Each\nlist (called a layer) is a ranking of items in a possibly different way\naccording to a different criterion.\n  In particular, we introduce three multi-layer verification problems, each\ncorresponds to an optimality notion that weakens the notion of global\noptimality (that is, pareto optimality in multiple layers) in a different way.\nInformally, the first notion requires that, for each group of agents whose size\nis exactly some input parameter k, the agents in the group will not be able to\ntrade their assigned items among themselves and benefit in at least alpha\nlayers; the second notion is similar, but it concerns all groups of size at\nmost k rather than exactly k; the third notion strengthens these notions by\nrequiring that groups of k agents will not be part of possibly larger groups\nthat benefit in at least alpha layers. We study the three problems from the\nperspective of parameterized complexity under several natural parameterizations\nsuch as the number of layers, the number of agents, the number of items, the\nnumber of allocated items, the maximum length of a preference list, and more.\nWe present an almost comprehensive picture of the parameterized complexity of\nthe problems with respect to these parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 16:12:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 17:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

In the $\\gamma\n\\rightarrow \\infty$ limit, the model becomes an extended $q$-state clock model\nthat reduces to the ordinary $q$-state clock model when $q$ is an integer and\notherwise is a continuation of the clock model for noninteger $q$. By shifting\nthe $2\\pi$ integration interval, the number of angles selected can change\ndiscontinuously and two cases need to be considered.

Both the specific heat and the magnetic\nsusceptibility show a double-peak structure for fractional $q$. In case $1$,\nthe small-$\\beta$ peak is associated with a crossover, and the large-$\\beta$\npeak is associated with an Ising critical point, while both peaks are\ncrossovers in case $2$.

In this paper, we\nwant to study the radio morphology of the galaxy, decouple thermal from\nnonthermal emission, and extract the star formation rate.

We observed\nthe Andromeda galaxy with the Sardinia Radio Telescope at 6.6 GHz with very\nhigh sensitivity and angular resolution, and an unprecedented sky coverage.\nUsing new 6.6 GHz data and Effelsberg radio telescope ancillary data, we\nconfirm that, globally, the spectral index is $\\sim 0.7-0.8$, while in the star\nforming regions it decreases to $\\sim 0.5$. By disentangling (gas) thermal and\nnonthermal emission, we find that at 6.6 GHz, thermal emission follows the\ndistribution of HII regions around the ring. Nonthermal emission within the\nring appears smoother and more uniform than thermal emission because of\ndiffusion of the cosmic ray electrons away from their birthplaces. This causes\nthe magnetic fields to appear almost constant in intensity. Furthermore, we\ncalculated a map of the star formation rate based on the map of thermal\nemission. Integrating within a radius of $R_{max}=15$ kpc, we obtained a total\nstar formation rate of $0.19 \\pm 0.01$ $M_{\\odot}$/yr in agreement with\nprevious results in the literature.

X-ray\nphotoemission spectroscopy (XPS) in particular, can provide information about\nthe electronic and vibrational many-body interactions in a solid as these are\nreflected in the detailed energy distribution of the photoelectrons. Ultrafast\npump-probe techniques add a new dimension to such studies, introducing the\nability to probe a transient state of the many-body system. Here we use a free\nelectron laser to investigate the effect of a transiently excited electron gas\non the core level spectrum of graphene, showing that it leads to a large\nbroadening of the C 1s peak. Confirming a decade-old prediction, the broadening\nis found to be caused by an exchange of energy and momentum between the\nphotoemitted core electron and the hot electron system, rather than by\nvibrational excitations. This interpretation is supported by a line shape\nanalysis that accounts for the presence of the excited electrons. Fitting the\nspectra to this model directly yields the electronic temperature of the system,\nin agreement with electronic temperature values obtained from valence band\ndata.

Although developing\nhand-crafted interactions is effective for a small number of datasets, it\ngenerally requires laborious and tedious architecture engineering for extensive\nscenarios. In recent years, several neural architecture search (NAS) methods\nhave been proposed for designing interactions automatically. However, existing\nmethods only explore limited types and connections of operators for interaction\ngeneration, leading to low generalization ability. To address these problems,\nwe propose a more general automated method for building powerful interactions\nnamed AutoPI. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: AutoPI\nadopts a more general search space in which the computational graph is\ngeneralized from existing network connections, and the interactive operators in\nthe edges of the graph are extracted from representative hand-crafted works. It\nallows searching for various powerful feature interactions to produce higher\nAUC and lower Logloss in a wide variety of applications. Besides, AutoPI\nutilizes a gradient-based search strategy for exploration with a significantly\nlow computational cost. Experimentally, we evaluate AutoPI on a diverse suite\nof benchmark datasets, demonstrating the generalizability and efficiency of\nAutoPI over hand-crafted architectures and state-of-the-art NAS algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 17:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

If the cancellation between contributions from a\nsmall-size instanton and another Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking occurs with\nhigh accuracy, the potential can be flattened enough near its maximum to\nachieve hilltop inflation. This comes at the cost of severe fine-tuning of\ntheir relative size and phase, but it also allows us to relate the high quality\nproblem of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry to the fine-tuning problem of the hilltop\ninflation. There are two classes of such axion hilltop inflation, each giving a\ndifferent relation between the axion mass at the minimum and the decay\nconstant. The first class predicts the relation $m_\\phi \\sim 10^{-6}f_\\phi$,\nand the axion can decay via the gluon coupling and reheat the universe. Most of\nthe predicted parameter region will be covered by various experiments such as\nCODEX, DUNE, FASER, LHC, MATHUSLA, and NA62 where the production and decay\nproceed through the same coupling that induced reheating.

We\nstudy $f(R)$ gravity models which can lead to an effective description of dark\nenergy implemented by quintessence fields in Einstein gravity, using the\nEinstein frame-Jordan frame duality. For a family of viable quintessence\nmodels, the reconstruction of the $f(R)$ function in the Jordan frame consists\nof two parts.

Second, we obtain an asymptotic\nsolution for $f(R)$, consistent with the late time limit of the Einstein frame\nif the quintessence field drives the universe. We show that for certain class\nof viable quintessence models, the Jordan frame universe grows to a maximum\nfinite size, after which it begins to collapse back. Thus, there is a\npossibility that in the late time limit where the Einstein frame universe\ncontinues to expand, the Jordan frame universe collapses.

When the ac drive is parallel to the funnel axis, the\nskyrmion flows in the easy direction and its average velocity is quantized.

The size of the spatial unit--or spatial scale--that is most\nappropriate for a particular health outcome is unknown and its choice\ninextricably impacts the estimated health effect. A related issue is the lack\nof knowledge of the temporal scale--or the length of exposure time that is\nnecessary for the BEF to render its full effect on the health outcome. The\nproposed STAP model enables investigators to estimate both the spatial and\ntemporal scales for a given BEF in a data-driven fashion, thereby providing a\nflexible solution for measuring the relationship between outcomes and spatial\nproximity to point-referenced exposures. Simulation studies verify the validity\nof our method for estimating the scales as well as the association between\navailability of BEFs' and health outcomes.

Although collective activity can be modified through\nimposed measures to control epidemic progression, spontaneous changes can also\narise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk\nof contagion. Here we introduce a stochastic epidemic model that implements\npopulation responses driven by individual- and time-dependent risk-taking\npropensity. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of\nmultiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude without the need to consider\nexternal modulation of parameters. Successive waves tune the effective\nreproduction number to its critical value $R=1$. This process is a consequence\nof the interplay of the fractions of susceptible and infected population and\nthe average risk-taking propensity, as shown by a mean-field approach. The\nproposed mechanism also shows how, under the threat of contagion, the\ndistribution of individual risk propensities evolves towards a well-defined\nprofile. Successive waves trigger selective sweeps of risk-taking propensity at\na pace determined by individual risk reaction rates. This kind of collective,\nself-generated pressure, may therefore shape risk-aversion profiles associated\nto epidemics in human groups. The final state is self-organized and generic,\nindependent of the parameter values. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in\nhuman behavior can, by themselves, explain major qualitative and quantitative\nfeatures of the epidemic process, as the emergence of multiple waves and the\ntendency to remain around $R=1$ observed worldwide after the first few waves of\nCOVID-19.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 21:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

OSCAR uses operator splitting methods to\nseparate the viscous drag and the surface tension forces. Different time-steps\nare used for the viscous drag steps, controlled by the injection velocity, and\nfor the capillary relaxation steps, controlled by the velocity of capillary\nwaves. Although OSCAR induces an additional numerical error of order 0 in time\nresulting from the splitting, it is well suited for simulations at low\ncapillary number. First, the splitting error decreases with the capillary\nnumber and at low capillary number, the relaxation steps converge before\nreaching their last iteration, resulting in a large speed-up (here up to 250x)\ncompared to standard time-stepping methods. The method is implemented in\nGeoChemFoam, our OpenFOAM-based CFD solver. Convergence, accuracy and\nefficiency are demonstrated on three benchmark cases: (1) the steady motion of\nan air bubble in a straight 2D microchannel, (2) injection of supercritical CO2\nin a 3D constricted channel leading to a snap-off, and (3) water drainage in a\n2D oil-wet micromodel representing a porous media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 21:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

For large wavelength and high field experiments\nat nanoscale structures this assumption may break down by predicting energies\nbeyond the true classical energy limits. Here we provide generalized\ncalculations for these cutoff energies by taking into account the spatial field\ndrop-off. The modified cutoff energies vary significantly from the uniform\nfield results even with ponderomotive amplitudes still an order of magnitude\nbelow the field drop-off scale. Electron emission and scattering energy as a\nfunction of the time-of-ionization is considered for the nanotip ($\\sim1/r^2$)\nfield profile. The cutoff energies as a function of the adiabaticity parameter\n$\\delta$, which may be easily calculated for given wavelength, apex field\nstrength, and nanostructure scale, are then determined through maximization for\nnanotip, nanoblade ($\\sim1/r$), and exponential field profiles.

The electron emission energy cutoff also attains an additional factor\nof $U_p$ due to the smooth integrated ponderomotive force in the adiabatic\ndrop-off and very long pulse regime.

Predicting\nthe effect that nanostructuring has on thermal conductivity requires models,\nsuch as the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), that capture the non-diffusive\ntransport of phonons. Although the BTE has been well validated against several\nkey experiments, notably those on nanoporous materials, its applicability is\ncomputationally expensive. Several effective model theories have been put\nforward to estimate the effective thermal conductivity; however, most of them\nare either based on simple geometries, e.g., thin films, or simplified material\ndescriptions such as the gray-model approximation. To fill this gap, we propose\na model that takes into account the whole mean-free-path (MFP) distribution as\nwell as the complexity of the material's boundaries in infinitely thick films\nwith extruded porosity using uniparameter logistic regression.

Filters are space efficient, but can make bounded one-sided errors: with\ntunable probability epsilon, they may report that a query element is stored in\nthe filter when it is not. This is called a false positive. Recent research has\nfocused on designing methods for dynamically adapting filters to false\npositives, reducing the number of false positives when some elements are\nqueried repeatedly.\n  Ideally, an adaptive filter would incur a false positive with bounded\nprobability epsilon for each new query element, and would incur o(epsilon)\ntotal false positives over all repeated queries to that element. We call such a\nfilter support optimal.\n  In this paper we design a new Adaptive Cuckoo Filter and show that it is\nsupport optimal (up to additive logarithmic terms) over any n queries when\nstoring a set of size n. Our filter is simple: fixing previous false positives\nrequires a simple cuckoo operation, and the filter does not need to store any\nadditional metadata. This data structure is the first practical data structure\nthat is support optimal, and the first filter that does not require additional\nspace to fix false positives.\n  We complement these bounds with experiments showing that our data structure\nis effective at fixing false positives on network traces, outperforming\nprevious Adaptive Cuckoo Filters.\n  Finally, we investigate adversarial adaptivity, a stronger notion of\nadaptivity in which an adaptive adversary repeatedly queries the filter, using\nthe result of previous queries to drive the false positive rate as high as\npossible. We prove a lower bound showing that a broad family of filters,\nincluding all known Adaptive Cuckoo Filters, can be forced by such an adversary\nto incur a large number of false positives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 02:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

Since these two areas are vast and not recent, each one has\nalready been covered separately by several reviews. After a general historical\nintroduction, and a needed quick review of processes like the stellar\nnucleosynthesis which gives the base to understand the interstellar formation\nof simple chemical compounds (H2, CO, NH3 and H2O), we focus on a number of\ntopics which are at the crossing of the two areas, Dynamics and Astrochemistry.\nAstrochemistry is a flourishing field which intends to study the presence and\nformation of molecules as well as the influence of them into the structure,\nevolution and dynamics of astronomical objects. The progress in the knowledge\non the existence of new complex molecules and of their process of formation\noriginates from the observational, experimental and theoretical areas which\ncompose the field. The interfacing areas include star formation, protoplanetary\ndisks, the role of the spiral arms and the chemical abundance gradients in the\ngalactic disk. It often happens that the physical conditions in some regions of\nthe ISM are only revealed by means of molecular observations. To organise a\nclassification of chemical evolution processes, we discuss about how\nastrochemistry can act in three different contexts: i. the chemistry of the\nearly universe, including external galaxies, ii. star forming regions, and iii.\nAGB stars and circumstellar envelopes. We mention that our research is\nstimulated by plans for instruments and projects, such as the on-going LLAMA,\nwhich consists in the construction of a 12m sub-mm radio telescope in the\nAndes. Thus, modern and new facilities can play a key role in new discoveries\nnot only in astrochemistry but also in radio astronomy and related areas.\nFurthermore, the research of the origin of life is also a stimulating\nperspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 03:14:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

Using simple cluster expansion model Hamiltonians parametrized on\ndensity functional theory data, we compute transport properties explicitly\nincluding local interactions between the two atomic species and compare them\nwith the non-interacting diffusion model for disordered, random alloys.\nSurprisingly, we find that although these alloys thermodynamically behave as\nnearly random solid solutions, their kinetic properties deviate significantly\nfrom the behavior predicted by diffusion models for non-interacting systems. We\nattribute these differences in transport properties to the local interactions\nthat create a rather corrugated potential energy landscape and consequently\ngive rise to energetically non-degenerate end-states of diffusion processes\nwhich cannot be realized in a non-interacting disordered or other simpler\ndiffusion models. The findings emphasize the limitations of the widely known\nnon-interacting disordered diffusion model for such systems. Furthermore, we\nexplain that changes in mobility in these alloys is predominantly due to\nchanges in the correlation factor caused by the local interactions. Our work\nthus highlights the importance of explicitly including local interactions when\nassessing the transport properties of thermodynamically nearly disordered\nalloys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 03:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

We model dots\nbased on recent qubit experiments, which straddle the boundary between strongly\ninteracting and weakly interacting systems, and display a rich and diverse\nrange of behaviors. Our calculations show that strong electron-electron\ninteractions, induced by weak confinement, can significantly suppress the\nlow-lying, singlet-triplet (ST) excitation energy. However, when the\nvalley-orbit interactions caused by interfacial disorder are weak, the ST\nsplitting can approach its noninteracting value, even when the\nelectron-electron interactions are strong and Wigner-molecule behavior is\nobserved. These results have important implications for the rational design and\nfabrication of quantum dot qubits with predictable properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 06:12:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 17:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

The model learned\nfrom historical interactions with imbalanced item distribution will amplify the\nimbalance by over-recommending items from the major groups. Addressing this\nissue is essential for a healthy ecosystem of recommendation in the long run.\nExisting works apply bias control to the ranking targets (e.g., calibration,\nfairness, and diversity), but ignore the true reason for bias amplification and\ntrade-off the recommendation accuracy.\n  In this work, we scrutinize the cause-effect factors for bias amplification,\nidentifying the main reason lies in the confounder effect of imbalanced item\ndistribution on user representation and prediction score. The existence of such\nconfounder pushes us to go beyond merely modeling the conditional probability\nand embrace the causal modeling for recommendation. Towards this end, we\npropose a Deconfounded Recommender System (DecRS), which models the causal\neffect of user representation on the prediction score. The key to eliminating\nthe impact of the confounder lies in backdoor adjustment, which is however\ndifficult to do due to the infinite sample space of the confounder. For this\nchallenge, we contribute an approximation operator for backdoor adjustment\nwhich can be easily plugged into most recommender models. Lastly, we devise an\ninference strategy to dynamically regulate backdoor adjustment according to\nuser status. We instantiate DecRS on two representative models FM and NFM, and\nconduct extensive experiments over two benchmarks to validate the superiority\nof our proposed DecRS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 06:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

A 7-layer\nencoder-decoder-based convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed and\ntrained to learn the proposed biological model. As such, the model could\ngenerate post-radiation FDG-PET image outcome predictions with possible\ntime-series transition from pre-radiotherapy image states to post-radiotherapy\nstates.

However, most existing methods usually randomly select the negative\nsamples from the original graph to enhance the training data without\nconsidering the noise. In addition, most of these methods only focus on the\nexplicit graph structures and cannot fully capture complex semantics of edges\nsuch as various relationships or asymmetry.

To ensure parameter privacy, we propose a filter design\nframework which consists of two components: a randomizer and a nonlinear\ntransformation. The randomizer takes the private parameter as input and\nrandomly generates a pseudo parameter. The nonlinear mapping transforms the\nmeasurements such that the joint p.d.f. of the filter's output depends on the\npseudo parameter rather than the private parameter. It also ensures that the\njoint p.d.f. of the filter's output belongs to the same family of distributions\nas that of the measurements. The nonlinear transformation has a\nfeedforward-feedback structure that allows real-time and causal generation of\nthe disguised measurements with low complexity using a recursive structure. The\ndesign of the randomizer is formulated as an optimization problem subject to a\nprivacy constraint, in terms of mutual information, and it is shown that the\noptimal randomizer is the solution of a convex optimization problem. Using\ninformation-theoretic inequalities, we show that the performance of any\nestimator of the private parameter, based on the output of the privacy filter,\nis limited by the privacy constraint. The structure of the nonlinear\ntransformation is studied in the special cases of independent and identically\ndistributed, Markovian, and Gauss-Markov measurements. Our results show that\nthe privacy filter in the Gauss-Markov case can be implemented as two one-step\nahead Kalman predictors and a set of minimum mean square error predictors. The\nKalman predictors significantly reduce the complexity of computing the\ndisguised measurements. A numerical example on occupancy privacy in a building\nautomation system illustrates the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 08:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

In this work, the impacts of two diagnostic schemes to\ndetermine the performance of quantum Otto heat engines are compared: In one\nscheme, the energy of the engine's working substance is measured after each\nstroke (repeated measurements), and in the other one, the energies after each\nstroke are recorded in one or two pointer states and measured only after the\ncompletion of a prescribed number of cycles (repeated contacts). A single\npointer state suffices if one is only interested in either work or heat. For\njoint work and heat diagnostics, two pointers are needed. These schemes are\napplied to Otto engines, whose working substance consists of a two-level\nsystem. Depending on the engine protocol, the duration of a single cycle may be\ninfinite or finite. Because in the repeated contact scheme, the number of\nmeasurements is drastically reduced compared to the repeated measurement\nscheme, the quantum coherence after and during the contact diagnostics is much\nbetter maintained than repeated measurements that destroy any coherence at the\nend of each stroke. We demonstrate that maximum power, reliability, and\nefficiency of the engine in the presence of repeated contacts typically\noutperform these figures of merit of repeated measurements. Due to the improved\ncoherence persistence, heat engines with a finite cycle duration require a\nlarger number of cycles to reach a periodically asymptotic state. Overall, our\nresults document the importance of taking into account the particular nature of\ndiagnostic tools for monitoring and testing purposes but also for feedback\ncontrol, both in theory and experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 08:57:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 23:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

In this paper, we propose a formal\napproach based on runtime enforcement to ensure specification compliance in\nnetworks of controllers, possibly compromised by colluding malware that may\ntamper with actuator commands, sensor readings, and inter-controller\ncommunications. Our approach relies on an ad-hoc sub-class of Ligatti et al.'s\nedit automata to enforce controllers represented in Hennessy and Regan's Timed\nProcess Language. We define a synthesis algorithm that, given an alphabet $P$\nof observable actions and a timed correctness property $e$, returns a monitor\nthat enforces the property $e$ during the execution of any (potentially\ncorrupted) controller with alphabet $P$, and complying with the property $e$.\nOur monitors correct and suppress incorrect actions coming from corrupted\ncontrollers and emit actions in full autonomy when the controller under\nscrutiny is not able to do so in a correct manner. Besides classical\nrequirements, such as transparency and soundness, the proposed enforcement\nenjoys deadlock- and diverge-freedom of monitored controllers, together with\nscalability when dealing with networks of controllers.

In this article, we proved the minimum buffer length for the optimal\nsolution to the reordering buffer management problem in the offline setting.\nWith the assumption that color selection is always made when the buffer is\nfull, selecting the most frequent color from the buffer given the smallest\nbuffer size $k$ that satisfies either $o_1 < 2 \\cdot \\lceil \\frac{k}{\\sigma}\n\\rceil$ OR $o_2 < \\lceil \\frac{k}{\\sigma} \\rceil$ guarantees the optimal\nsolution, where $o_1$ and $o_2$ represent respectively the frequency of the\nmost and the second most frequent colors in the input sequence $\\mathcal{X}$,\nand $\\sigma$ is the number of distinct colors appearing in $\\mathcal{X}$.

This\nis made increasingly complex in the presence of moving humans or livestock.\nThese environments require a robot to be adaptive in its immediate plans,\naccounting for the state of nearby individuals and the response that they might\nhave to the robot's actions. Additionally, in order to achieve longer-term\ngoals, consideration of the limited on-board resources available to the robot\nis required, especially for extended missions such as weeding an agricultural\nfield. To achieve efficient long-term autonomy, it is thus crucial to\nunderstand the impact that online dynamic updates to an energy efficient\noffline plan might have on resource usage whilst navigating through crowds or\nherds. To address these challenges, a hierarchical planning framework is\nproposed, integrating an online local dynamic path planner with an offline\nlonger-term objective-based planner. This framework acts to achieve long-term\nautonomy through awareness of both dynamic responses of individuals to a\nrobot's motion and the limited resources available. This paper details the\nhierarchical approach and its integration on a robotic platform, including a\ncomprehensive description of the planning framework and associated perception\nmodules. The approach is evaluated in real-world trials on farms, requiring\nboth consideration of limited battery capacity and the presence of nearby\nmoving individuals. These trials additionally demonstrate the ability of the\nframework to adapt resource use through variation of the local dynamic planner,\nallowing adaptive behaviour in changing environments.

Examples of such behavior\nare plentiful among rare-earth borides, such as RB$_6$ or RB$_{12}$ ($R$ = rare\nearth). In this work, for example, we use torque magnetometry to measure\nanisotropic field-angular phase diagrams of La-doped cerium hexaborides,\nCe$_{1-x}$La$_x$B$_6$ ($x$ = 0, 0.18, 0.28, 0.5).

However, this task is usually beyond the reach of available\ntheoretical approaches, because the ordered phases can be noncollinear, possess\nlarge magnetic unit cells, involve higher-order multipoles of 4f ions rather\nthan simple dipoles, or just lack sufficient microscopic characterization.

Transitions between\ndifferent crystal-field ground states, calculated using this minimal model for\nthe parent compound CeB6, possess field-directional anisotropy that strikingly\nresembles the experimental phase diagrams.

The first arises from the recent realization that the most\nprominent solution that uses cardinal utilities, namely the Hylland-Zeckhauser\n(HZ) mechanism, is intractable; computation of even an approximate equilibrium\nis PPAD-complete. The second is the extreme paucity of models that use cardinal\nutilities. Our paper addresses both these issues by proposing\nNash-bargaining-based matching market models. Since the Nash bargaining\nsolution is captured by a convex program, efficiency follows. In addition, it\npossesses several desirable game-theoretic properties. Our approach yields a\nrich collection of models: for one-sided as well as two-sided markets, for\nFisher as well as Arrow-Debreu settings, and for a wide range of utility\nfunctions, all the way from linear to Leontief. We give very fast\nimplementations for these models using Frank-Wolfe and Cutting Plane\nalgorithms. These help solve large instances with several thousand agents and\ngoods in a matter of minutes on a PC, even for a one-sided matching market\nunder piecewise-linear concave utility functions and a two-sided matching\nmarket under linear utility functions. In contrast, using HZ, going beyond even\n$n = 10$ is prohibitive. Several new ideas were needed, beyond the standard\nmethods, to obtain these implementations.

They are typically pronounced for localized orbitals and enhanced\nin low-dimensional systems, so two-dimensional (2D) transition metal compounds\ncould be a good platform to study their effects. Recently, a new class of 2D\ntransition metal compounds, the MoSi$_2$N$_4$-family materials, have been\ndiscovered, and some of them exhibit intrinsic magnetism. Here, taking\nmonolayer VSi$_{2}$P$_{4}$ as an example from the family, we investigate the\nimpact of correlation effects on its physical properties, based on the\nfirst-principles calculations. We find that different correlation strength can\ndrive the system into a variety of interesting ground states, with rich\nmagnetic, topological and valley features. With increasing correlation\nstrength, while the system favors a ferromagnetic semiconductor state for most\ncases, the magnetic anisotropy and the band gap type undergo multiple\ntransitions, and in the process, the band edges can form single, two or three\nvalleys for electrons or holes. Remarkably, there is a quantum anomalous Hall\n(QAH) insulator phase, which has a unit Chern number. The boundary of the QAH\nphase correspond to the half-valley semimetal state with fully valley polarized\nbulk carriers. We further show that for phases with the out-of-plane magnetic\nanisotropy, the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and orbital character of\nvalleys enable an intrinsic valley polarization for electrons but not for\nholes. This electron valley polarization can be switched by reversing the\nmagnetization direction, providing a new route of magnetic control of\nvalleytronics.

Using the numerical\nrenormalization group method we analyze the behavior of the (spin) Seebeck\neffect, heat conductance and figure of merit for different model parameters of\nthe molecule. We show that the thermopower strongly depends on the strength and\ntype of the exchange interaction as well as the molecule's magnetic anisotropy.\nWhen the molecule is coupled to ferromagnetic leads, the thermoelectric\nproperties reveal an interplay between the spin-resolved tunneling processes\nand intrinsic magnetic properties of the molecule. Moreover, in the case of\nfinite spin accumulation in the leads, the system exhibits the spin Seebeck\neffect. We demonstrate that a considerable spin Seebeck effect can develop when\nthe molecule exhibits an easy-plane magnetic anisotropy, while the sign of the\nspin thermopower depends on the type and magnitude of the molecule's exchange\ninteraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 12:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

However, due to the remote\nlocation of cloud servers, IoT devices often suffer from intermittent Wide Area\nNetwork (WAN) latency which makes execution of delay-critical IoT applications\ninconceivable. To overcome this, service providers (SPs) often deploy multiple\nfog nodes (FNs) at the network edge that helps in executing offloaded\ncomputations from IoT devices with improved user experience. As the FNs have\nlimited resources, matching IoT services to FNs while ensuring minimum latency\nand energy from an end-user's perspective and maximizing revenue and tasks\nmeeting deadlines from an SP's standpoint is challenging. Therefore in this\npaper, we propose a student project allocation (SPA) based efficient task\noffloading strategy called SPATO that takes into account key parameters from\ndifferent stakeholders. Thorough simulation analysis shows that SPATO is able\nto reduce the offloading energy and latency respectively by 29% and 40% and\nimproves the revenue by 25% with 99.3% of tasks executing within their\ndeadline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 12:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

Currently, deep learning-based SISR approaches\nhave been widely discussed in medical image processing, because of their\npotential to achieve high-quality, high spatial resolution images without the\ncost of additional scans. However, most existing methods are designed for\nscale-specific SR tasks and are unable to generalise over magnification scales.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach for medical image arbitrary-scale\nsuper-resolution (MIASSR), in which we couple meta-learning with generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) to super-resolve medical images at any scale of\nmagnification in (1, 4]. Compared to state-of-the-art SISR algorithms on\nsingle-modal magnetic resonance (MR) brain images (OASIS-brains) and\nmulti-modal MR brain images (BraTS), MIASSR achieves comparable fidelity\nperformance and the best perceptual quality with the smallest model size.

The goal is to estimate the support of the reflectivity\nfunction of a remote scene from measurements of the backscattered wave field.\nThe proposed imaging methodology is based on the coherent interferometric\n(CINT) approach that exploits the local empirical cross correlations of the\nmeasurements of the wave field. The standard CINT images are known to be robust\n(statistically stable) with respect to the random medium, but the stability\ncomes at the expense of a loss of resolution. This paper shows that a two-point\nCINT function contains the information needed to obtain statistically stable\nand high-resolution images. Different methods to build such images are\npresented, theoretically analyzed and compared with the standard imaging\napproaches using numerical simulations. The first method involves a\nphase-retrieval step to extract the reflectivity function from the modulus of\nits Fourier transform. The second method involves the evaluation of the leading\neigenvector of the two-point CINT imaging function seen as the kernel of a\nlinear operator. The third method uses an optimization step to extract the\nreflectivity function from some cross products of its Fourier transform.

The generalization to other imaging setups,\nwith passive or active arrays of sensors, is discussed briefly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 21:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

In\nparticular, we present a proper Riemann-Hilbert problem that generates the\nunique causal solution to the Cauchy problem, that is, the solution vanishes\noutside of the light cone. Inside the light cone, we relate the leading-order\nasymptotics to self-similar solutions that satisfy a system of ordinary\ndifferential equations related to the Painlev\\'e-III (PIII) equation. We\nidentify these solutions and show that they are related to a family of PIII\nsolutions recently discovered in connection with several limiting processes\ninvolving the focusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. We fully explain a\nresulting boundary layer phenomenon in which, even for smooth initial data (an\nincident pulse), the solution makes a sudden transition over an infinitesimally\nsmall propagation distance.

As a necessity, there is a need to track users who came in contact\nwith users having travel history, asymptomatic and not yet symptomatic, but\nthey can be in the future. To solve this problem, the present work proposes a\nsolution for contact tracing based on assisted GPS and cloud computing\ntechnologies. An application is developed to collect each user's assisted GPS\ncoordinates once all the users install this application. This application\nperiodically sends assisted GPS data to the cloud. To determine which devices\nare within the permissible limit of 5m, we perform clustering over assisted GPS\ncoordinates and track the clusters for about t mins to allow the measure of\nspread. We assume that it takes around 3 or 5 mins to get the virus from an\ninfected object. For clustering, the proposed M way like tree data structure\nstores the assisted GPS coordinates in degree, minute, and second format. Thus,\nevery user is mapped to a leaf node of the tree. We split the \"seconds\" part of\nthe assisted GPS location into m equal parts, which amount to d meter in\nlatitude(longitude). Hence, two users who are within d meter range will map to\nthe same leaf node. Thus, by mapping assisted GPS locations every t mins, we\ncan find out how many users came in contact with a particular user for at least\nt mins.
