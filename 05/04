The observations of Jupiter's gravity\nfield by Juno combined with the constraints on its atmospheric composition\nappear to be incompatible with such a profile. In this letter, we show that the\nabove assumption stems from an incorrect understanding of the\nSchwarzschild-Ledoux criterion, which is only valid on a local scale. In order\nto fulfil the buoyancy stability condition, the density gradient with pressure\nin a non-adiabatic region must indeed rise more steeply than the {\\it local}\nadiabatic density gradient. However, the density gradient can be smaller than\nthe one corresponding to the outer adiabat at the same pressure because of the\nhigher temperature in an inhomogeneously stratified medium. Deep enough, the\ndensity can therefore be lower than the one corresponding to the outer adiabat.\nWe show that this is permitted only if the slope of the local adiabat becomes\nshallower than the slope of the outer adiabat at the same pressure, as found in\nrecent Jupiter models due to the increase of both specific entropy and\nadiabatic index with depth. We examine the dynamical stability of this\nstructure and show that it is stable against non-adiabatic perturbations. The\npossibility of such unconventional density profile in Jupiter complicates\nfurther our understanding of the internal structure and evolution of\n(extrasolar) giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 16:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

However, polyp segmentation is a\nchallenging task due to the diverse shape, size, color, and texture of polyps,\nshuttle difference between polyp and its background, as well as low contrast of\nthe colonoscopic images. To address these challenges, we propose a feature\nenhancement network for accurate polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images.\nSpecifically, the proposed network enhances the semantic information using the\nnovel Semantic Feature Enhance Module (SFEM). Furthermore, instead of directly\nadding encoder features to the respective decoder layer, we introduce an\nAdaptive Global Context Module (AGCM), which focuses only on the encoder's\nsignificant and hard fine-grained features. The integration of these two\nmodules improves the quality of features layer by layer, which in turn enhances\nthe final feature representation. The proposed approach is evaluated on five\ncolonoscopy datasets and demonstrates superior performance compared to other\nstate-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 16:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

This linear dynamical system is said to be\nasymptotically stable if all of the eigenvalues of A lie in the open left-half\nof the complex plane. In this case, the matrix A is said to be Hurwitz stable\nor shortly a stable matrix. In practice, stability of a system can be violated\nbecause of arbitrarily small perturbations such as modeling errors. In such\ncases, one deals with the robust stability of the system rather than its\nstability. The system above is said to be robustly stable if the system, as\nwell as all of its arbitrarily small perturbations, are stable. To measure the\nrobustness of the system subject to perturbations, a quantity of interest is\nthe stability radius or in other words distance to instability. In this paper\nwe focus on the estimation of the structured real stability radius for\nlarge-scale systems. We propose a subspace framework to estimate the structured\nreal stability radius and prove that our new method converges at a quadratic\nrate in theory. Our method benefits from a one-sided interpolatory model order\nreduction technique, in a sense that the left and the right subspaces are the\nsame. The quadratic convergence of the method is due to the certain Hermite\ninterpolation properties between the full and reduced problems.

The rate achieved using a linear chain of quantum repeaters\nequipped with quantum memories, probabilistic Bell state measurements (BSMs)\nand switches used for spatial multiplexing, but no quantum error correction,\nwas shown to surpass the direct-transmission capacity. However, this rate still\ndecays exponentially with the end-to-end distance, viz., $R \\sim e^{-s{\\alpha\nL}}$, with $s < 1$. We show that the introduction of temporal multiplexing -\ni.e., the ability to perform BSMs among qubits at a repeater node that were\nsuccessfully entangled with qubits at distinct neighboring nodes at {\\em\ndifferent} time steps - leads to a sub-exponential rate-vs.-distance scaling,\ni.e., $R \\sim e^{-t\\sqrt{\\alpha L}}$, which is not attainable with just spatial\nor spectral multiplexing.

We\nfind the generated SR field matches the true HR result at percent level down to\nscales of k ~ 10 h/Mpc. We also identify and inspect dark matter halos and\ntheir substructures. Our SR model generate visually authentic small-scale\nstructures, that cannot be resolved by the LR input, and are in good\nstatistical agreement with the real HR results. The SR model performs\nsatisfactorily on the halo occupation distribution, halo correlations in both\nreal and redshift space, and the pairwise velocity distribution, matching the\nHR results with comparable scatter, thus demonstrating its potential in making\nmock halo catalogs. The SR technique can be a powerful and promising tool for\nmodelling small-scale galaxy formation physics in large cosmological volumes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 17:08:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

In this paper,\nwe study the privacy-utility tradeoff by taking maximal leakage as the privacy\nmeasure and the expected Hamming distortion as the utility measure. We study\nthree different but related problems. First, we assume that the data-generating\ndistribution (i.e., the prior) is known, and we find the optimal privacy\nmechanism that achieves the smallest distortion subject to a constraint on\nmaximal leakage. Then, we assume that the prior belongs to some set of\ndistributions, and we formulate a min-max problem for finding the smallest\ndistortion achievable for the worst-case prior in the set, subject to a maximal\nleakage constraint. Lastly, we define a partial order on privacy mechanisms\nbased on the largest distortion they generate. Our results show that when the\nprior distribution is known, the optimal privacy mechanism fully discloses\nsymbols with the largest prior probabilities, and suppresses symbols with the\nsmallest prior probabilities. Furthermore, we show that sets of priors that\ncontain more uniform distributions lead to larger distortion, while privacy\nmechanisms that distribute the privacy budget more uniformly over the symbols\ncreate smaller worst-case distortion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 17:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

The contributions of this paper include a quantitative\nbehavior model of fear of COVID-19, impact of government interventions on\nconsumer behavior, and impact of consumer behavior on consumer choice and hence\ndemand for goods. It brings together multiple models for disease progression,\nconsumer behavior and demand estimation-thus bridging the gap between disease\nprogression and consumer demand. We use panel regression to understand the\ndrivers of demand during the pandemic and Bayesian inference to simplify the\nregulation landscape that can help build scenarios for resilient demand\nplanning. We illustrate this resilient demand planning model using a specific\nexample of gas retailing. We find that demand is sensitive to fear of COVID-19:\nas the number of COVID-19 cases increase over the previous week, the demand for\ngas decreases -- though this dissipates over time. Further, government\nregulations restrict access to different services, thereby reducing mobility,\nwhich in itself reduces demand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 17:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

This paper aims to\nrenew the interest in partial protection and re-adapt it to the context of\nelastic optical networks. The evolutionary perspective we lay out in this paper\nidentifies a new route for achieving greater spectral efficiency in a pragmatic\nway by simply differentiating the protection services for each demand rather\nthan the uniform treatment for all demands. In doing so, we present a new\nresearch problem entitled, routing, modulation level, spectrum and protection\nservice assignment which is an extension of the well-established one, that is,\nrouting, modulation level, and spectrum assignment as the (partial) protection\nservice for each demand is taken into account and optimized.

A common approach is to optimize a performance\nfunction defined by a choice of an aerodynamic model, e.g., turbulence RANS\nmodel, and at nominal operating conditions. Practical experience indicates that\nsuch a deterministic approach may result in considerably sub-optimal designs\nwhen the adopted aerodynamic model does not lead to accurate flow predictions\nor when the actual operating conditions differ from those considered in the\ndesign. One approach to address this shortcoming is to consider an average or\nrobust design, wherein the statistical moments of the performance function,\ngiven the uncertainty in the operating conditions and the aerodynamic model, is\noptimized. However, when the number of uncertain inputs is large or the\nperformance function exhibits significant variability, an accurate evaluation\nof these moments may require a large number of forward and/or adjoint solves,\nat each iteration of a gradient-based scheme. This, in turn, renders the design\ncomputationally expensive, if not infeasible. To tackle this difficulty, we\nconsider a variant of the stochastic gradient descent method where, in each\noptimization iteration, a stochastic approximation of the objective,\nconstraints, and their gradients are generated. This is done via a small number\nof forward/adjoint solves corresponding to random selections of the uncertain\nparameters and aerodynamic model. The methodology is applied to the robust\noptimization of the standard NACA-0012 subject to parametric and turbulence\nmodel uncertainty. With a cost that is a small factor larger than that of the\ndeterministic approach, the stochastic gradient approach significantly improves\nthe performance (mean and variance) of the aerodynamic design for a wide range\nof operating conditions and turbulence models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 17:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

Crucially, in such systems the interplay between\nsymmetry-protected topology and the corresponding symmetry defects can provide\na variety of bulk probes to reveal their topological nature. For example, bulk\ncrystallographic defects, such as disclinations and dislocations, have been\nshown to bind fractional charges and/or robust localized bound states in\ninsulators protected by crystalline symmetries.

Underlying the symmetries is a ladder structure\nwhich can be used to construct the full tower of solutions, and derive their\ngeneral properties: (1) solutions that decay with radius spontaneously break\nthe symmetries, and must diverge at the horizon; (2) solutions regular at the\nhorizon respect the symmetries, and take the form of a finite polynomial that\ngrows with radius. Taken together, these two properties imply that static\nresponse coefficients -- and in particular Love numbers -- vanish.

Since the components of wide binaries are known to be stars of common\norigins, they constitute ideal laboratories for testing the usefulness of\nchemical clocks for the age dating of field stars. We determined the abundances\nof a new sample of 5 binaries and collected data for other 31 systems from the\nliterature in order to test the applicability of chemical clocks.

To test this\nhypothesis, a matched case-control study can be performed, in which suicide\ncase subjects are compared to living controls who are similar in observed\ncovariates in terms of their retrospective exposure to firearms at home. In\nthis application, cases can be defined using a broad case definition (suicide)\nor a narrow case definition (suicide occurred at home). The broad case\ndefinition offers a larger number of cases but the narrow case definition may\noffer a larger effect size.

The proper\nfunctioning of bike-sharing systems is, nevertheless, dependent on a balanced\ngeographical distribution of bicycles throughout a day.

Still, recent\ncontributions from deep learning and distance-based predictors show limited\nsuccess on forecasting bike sharing demand. This consistent observation is\nhypothesized to be driven by: i) the strong dependence between demand and the\nmeteorological and situational context of stations; and ii) the absence of\nspatial awareness as most predictors are unable to model the effects of\nhigh-low station load on nearby stations.\n  This work proposes a comprehensive set of new principles to incorporate both\nhistorical and prospective sources of spatial, meteorological, situational and\ncalendrical context in predictive models of station demand.

Clinicians or\ntrained raters assess tremor severity with TETRAS scores by observing patients.\nLacking quantitative measures, inter- or intra- observer variabilities are\nalmost inevitable as the distinction between adjacent tremor scores is subtle.\nMoreover, clinician assessments also require patient visits, which limits the\nfrequency of disease progress evaluation. Therefore it is beneficial to develop\nan automated assessment that can be performed remotely and repeatably at\npatients' convenience for continuous monitoring. In this work, we proposed to\ntrain a deep neural network (DNN) with rank-consistent ordinal regression using\n276 clinical videos from 36 essential tremor patients. The videos are coupled\nwith clinician assessed TETRAS scores, which are used as ground truth labels to\ntrain the DNN. To tackle the challenge of limited training data, optical flows\nare used to eliminate irrelevant background and statistic objects from RGB\nframes. In addition to optical flows, transfer learning is also applied to\nleverage pre-trained network weights from a related task of tremor frequency\nestimate. The approach was evaluated by splitting the clinical videos into\ntraining (67%) and testing sets (0.33%). The mean absolute error on TETRAS\nscore of the testing results is 0.45, indicating that most of the errors were\nfrom the mismatch of adjacent labels, which is expected and acceptable. The\nmodel predications also agree well with clinical ratings. This model is further\napplied to smart phone videos collected from a PD patient who has an implanted\ndevice to turn \"On\" or \"Off\" tremor. The model outputs were consistent with the\npatient tremor states. The results demonstrate that our trained model can be\nused as a means to assess and track tremor severity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 19:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Focusing on the early nebular phase, at a SN age of\n200d, we conduct a systematic study of the polarization signatures associated\nwith a 56Ni `blob' that breaks spherical symmetry. Our ansatz, supported by\nnonLTE radiative transfer calculations, is that the primary role of such a 56Ni\nblob is to boost the local density of free electrons, which is otherwise\nreduced following recombination in SNe II. Using 2D polarized radiation\ntransfer modeling, we explore the influence of such an electron-density\nenhancement, varying its magnitude N_e_fac, its velocity location V_blob, and\nits spatial extent. For plausible N_e_fac values of a few tens, a high-velocity\nblob can deliver a continuum polarization P_cont of 0.5-1.0% at 200d. Our\nsimulations reproduce the analytic scalings for P_cont, and in particular the\nlinear growth with the blob radial optical depth. The most constraining\ninformation is, however, carried by polarized line photons. For a high V_blob,\nthe polarized spectrum appears as a replica of the full spectrum, scaled down\nby a factor 100 to 1000 (i.e., 1/P_cont), and redshifted by an amount\nV_blob(1-cos(alpha_los)), where alpha_los is the line of sight angle. As V_blob\nis reduced, the redshift decreases and the replication deteriorates. Lines\nwhose formation region overlap with the blob appear weaker and narrower in the\npolarized flux. Because of its dependence on inclination (~ sin^2 alpha_los),\nthe polarization preferentially reveals asymmetries in the plane perpendicular\nto the line of sight. With the adequate choice of electron-density enhancement,\nsome of these results may apply to asymmetric explosions in general, or to the\npolarization signatures from newly-formed dust in the outer ejecta.

Uni-directional interactions -- where\none individual has the opportunity to contribute altruistically to another, but\nnot conversely -- arise in real-world populations as the result of\norganizational hierarchies, social stratification, popularity effects, and\nendogenous mechanisms of network growth.

The goal is to uncover {\\it additional latent\nstructure} that will in turn lead to computationally efficient algorithms when\nthe new structured matrix approximations are employed in the place of the\noriginal operator. Our approach has three steps: map the structured matrix to\ntensors, use tensor compression algorithms, and map the compressed tensors back\nto obtain two different matrix representations -- sum of Kronecker products and\nblock low-rank format. The use of tensor decompositions enables us to uncover\nlatent structure in the problem and leads to compressed representations of the\noriginal matrix that can be used efficiently in applications.

In this study, we investigate the\nperformance of several deep-learning approaches for automated measurement of\ntotal lung volume from chest radiographs. 7621 posteroanterior and lateral view\nchest radiographs (CXR) were collected from patients with chest CT available.\nSimilarly, 928 CXR studies were chosen from patients with pulmonary function\ntest (PFT) results. The reference total lung volume was calculated from lung\nsegmentation on CT or PFT data, respectively. This dataset was used to train\ndeep-learning architectures to predict total lung volume from chest\nradiographs. The experiments were constructed in a step-wise fashion with\nincreasing complexity to demonstrate the effect of training with CT-derived\nlabels only and the sources of error. The optimal models were tested on 291 CXR\nstudies with reference lung volume obtained from PFT. The optimal deep-learning\nregression model showed an MAE of 408 ml and a MAPE of 8.1\\% and Pearson's r =\n0.92 using both frontal and lateral chest radiographs as input. CT-derived\nlabels were useful for pre-training but the optimal performance was obtained by\nfine-tuning the network with PFT-derived labels. We demonstrate, for the first\ntime, that state-of-the-art deep learning solutions can accurately measure\ntotal lung volume from plain chest radiographs. The proposed model can be used\nto obtain total lung volume from routinely acquired chest radiographs at no\nadditional cost and could be a useful tool to identify trends over time in\npatients referred regularly for chest x-rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 21:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

A common strategy is to use the OLS fit of the outcome\non the treatment indicators coupled with the robust standard errors clustered\nat the whole-plot level. It does not give consistent estimator for the causal\neffects of interest when the whole-plot sizes vary. Another common strategy is\nto fit the linear mixed-effects model of the outcome with Normal random effects\nand errors. It is a purely model-based approach and can be sensitive to\nviolations of parametric assumptions. In contrast, the design-based inference\nassumes no outcome models and relies solely on the controllable randomization\nmechanism determined by the physical experiment. We first extend the existing\ndesign-based inference based on the {\\htf} estimator to the Hajek estimator,\nand establish the finite-population central limit theorem for both under\nsplit-plot randomization.

Particles also escape into\nthe space away from the Sun to be detected as SEP events. Therefore, the\nsignificant NSEP vs. Ng correlation (correlation coefficient 0.77) is\nconsistent with the common shock origin for the two proton populations.\nFurthermore, the underlying CMEs have properties akin to those involved in\nground level enhancement (GLE) events indicating the presence of high-energy\n(up to GeV) particles required for SGRE. We show that the observed gamma-ray\nflux is an underestimate in limb events (central meridian distance > 60\ndegrees) because SGRE sources are partially occulted when the emission is\nspatially extended.

Here, we probe the CDW phase transition by the mechanical\nresonances of suspended 2H-TaS2 and 2H-TaSe2 membranes and study the effect of\ndisorder on the CDW state. Pristine flakes show the transition near the\nreported values of 75 K and 122 K respectively. We then study the effect of\ndegradation on 2H-TaS2 which displays an enhancement of $T_{CDW}$ up to 129 K\nafter degradation in ambient air. Finally, we study a sample with local\ndegradation and observe that multiple phase transitions occur at 87 K, 103 K\nand 118 K with a hysteresis in temperature in the same membrane. The observed\nspatial variations in the Raman spectra suggest that variations in crystal\nstructure cause domains with different transition temperatures which could\nresult in the hysteresis. This work shows the potential of using nanomechanical\nresonance to characterize the CDW in suspended 2D materials and demonstrate\nthat degradation can have a large effect on transition temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 23:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

We propose to address this challenge in the\nrecently introduced replica-mean-field (RMF) limit. In this limit, networks are\nmade of infinitely many replicas of the finite network of interest, but with\nrandomized interactions across replicas. Such randomization renders certain\nexcitatory networks fully tractable at the cost of neglecting activity\ncorrelations, but with explicit dependence on the finite size of the neural\nconstituents. However, metastable dynamics typically unfold in networks with\nmixed inhibition and excitation. Here, we extend the RMF computational\nframework to point-process-based neural network models with exponential\nstochastic intensities, allowing for mixed excitation and inhibition. Within\nthis setting, we show that metastable finite-size networks admit multistable\nRMF limits, which are fully characterized by stationary firing rates.\nTechnically, these stationary rates are determined as the solutions of a set of\ndelayed differential equations under certain regularity conditions that any\nphysical solutions shall satisfy. We solve this original problem by combining\nthe resolvent formalism and singular-perturbation theory. Importantly, we find\nthat these rates specify probabilistic pseudo-equilibria which accurately\ncapture the neural variability observed in the original finite-size network. We\nalso discuss the emergence of metastability as a stochastic bifurcation, which\ncan be interpreted as a static phase transition in the RMF limits. In turn, we\nexpect to leverage the static picture of RMF limits to infer purely dynamical\nfeatures of metastable finite-size networks, such as the transition rates\nbetween pseudo-equilibria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 00:22:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 05:04:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 19:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

In this article, we\nstudy the problem of deriving revenue adequate prices for an electricity\nmarket-clearing model with uncertainties resulting from the use of variable\nrenewable energy sources (VRES). To handle the uncertain nature of the problem,\nwe use a chance-constrained optimization (CCO) approach, which has recently\nbecome very popular choice when constructing dispatch electricity models with\npenetration of VRES (or other sources of uncertainty). Then, we show how prices\nthat satisfy revenue adequacy in expectation for the market administrator, and\ncost recovery in expectation for all conventional and VRES generators, can be\nobtained from the optimal dual variables associated with the deterministic\nequivalent of the CCO market-clearing model.

In this paper, we define a novel one-shot human\nparsing (OSHP) task that requires parsing humans into an open set of classes\ndefined by any test example. During training, only base classes are exposed,\nwhich only overlap with part of the test-time classes. To address three main\nchallenges in OSHP, i.e., small sizes, testing bias, and similar parts, we\ndevise an End-to-end One-shot human Parsing Network (EOP-Net). Firstly, an\nend-to-end human parsing framework is proposed to parse the query image into\nboth coarse-grained and fine-grained human classes, which builds a strong\nembedding network with rich semantic information shared across different\ngranularities, facilitating identifying small-sized human classes. Then, we\npropose learning momentum-updated prototypes by gradually smoothing the\ntraining time static prototypes, which helps stabilize the training and learn\nrobust features. Moreover, we devise a dual metric learning scheme which\nencourages the network to enhance features' both representational capability\nand transferability. Therefore, our EOP-Net can learn representative features\nthat can quickly adapt to the novel classes and mitigate the testing bias\nissue. In addition, we employ a contrastive loss at the prototype level,\nthereby enforcing the distances among the classes in the fine-grained metric\nspace to discriminate similar parts. We tailor three existing popular human\nparsing benchmarks to the OSHP task. Experiments on the new benchmarks\ndemonstrate that EOP-Net outperforms representative one-shot segmentation\nmodels by large margins, which serves as a strong baseline for further research\non this new task.

To address this we\nwill either need to use blockciphers which inherently have longer keys or use\nkey-length extension techniques which employ a blockcipher to construct a more\nsecure blockcipher that uses longer keys.\n  We consider the latter approach and revisit the FX and double encryption\nconstructions. Classically, FX is known to be secure, while double encryption\nis no more secure than single encryption due to a meet-in-the-middle attack. We\nprovide positive results, with concrete and tight bounds, for both of these\nconstructions against quantum attackers in ideal models.\n  For FX, we consider a partially-quantum model, where the attacker has quantum\naccess to the ideal primitive, but only classic access to FX. We provide two\nresults for FX in this model. The first establishes the security of FX against\nnon-adaptive attackers. The second establishes security against general\nadaptive attacks for a variant of FX using a random oracle in place of an ideal\ncipher. This result relies on the techniques of Zhandry (CRYPTO '19) for lazily\nsampling a quantum random oracle. An extension to perfectly lazily sampling a\nquantum random permutation, which would help resolve the adaptive security of\nstandard FX, is an important but challenging open question. We introduce\ntechniques for partially-quantum proofs without relying on analyzing the\nclassical and quantum oracles separately, which is common in existing work.\nThis may be of broader interest.\n  For double encryption we apply a technique of Tessaro and Thiruvengadam (TCC\n'18) to establish that security reduces to the difficulty of solving the list\ndisjointness problem, which we are able to reduce through a chain of results to\nthe known quantum difficulty of the element distinctness problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 01:40:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 18:58:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Motivated by\ncompetitive analysis in online learning, as a criterion for controller design\nwe introduce the dynamic regret, defined as the difference between the LQR cost\nof a causal controller (that has only access to past disturbances) and the LQR\ncost of the \\emph{unique} clairvoyant one (that has also access to future\ndisturbances) that is known to dominate all other controllers. The regret\nitself is a function of the disturbances, and we propose to find a causal\ncontroller that minimizes the worst-case regret over all bounded energy\ndisturbances. The resulting controller has the interpretation of guaranteeing\nthe smallest regret compared to the best non-causal controller that can see the\nfuture. We derive explicit formulas for the optimal regret and for the\nregret-optimal controller for the state-space setting. These explicit solutions\nare obtained by showing that the regret-optimal control problem can be reduced\nto a Nehari extension problem that can be solved explicitly. The regret-optimal\ncontroller is shown to be linear and can be expressed as the sum of the\nclassical $H_2$ state-feedback law and an $n$-th order controller ($n$ is the\nstate dimension), and its construction simply requires a solution to the\nstandard LQR Riccati equation and two Lyapunov equations. Simulations over a\nrange of plants demonstrate that the regret-optimal controller interpolates\nnicely between the $H_2$ and the $H_\\infty$ optimal controllers, and generally\nhas $H_2$ and $H_\\infty$ costs that are simultaneously close to their optimal\nvalues.

Coarctation of\nthe aorta provides a high SSR hemodynamic environment, while the aortic\naneurysm is exposed to low SSR. We propose a method to calculate the SSR\nthresholds for the diseased aorta. Results show that the upstream near-wall\narea of the diseased location is an ideal injection location for the\nmicro-carriers, which could be activated by the abnormal SSR. Released\nnanoparticle drugs would be successfully targeted delivered to the aortic\ndiseased wall. Besides, the high diffusivity of the micro-carriers and\nnanoparticle drugs has a significant impact on the surface drug concentrations\nof the diseased aortic walls, especially for aortic aneurysms. This study\npreliminary demonstrates the feasibility of shear-activated targeted\nnanoparticle drug delivery in the treatment of aortic diseases and provides a\ntheoretical basis for developing the drug delivery system and novel therapy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 02:09:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 14:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

In the evolution of 2D superfluid turbulence in a uniform\ndisk-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), it was discovered that a pair of OV\nclusters with opposite signs can form without any energy input. This striking\nspontaneous order was explained as due to a vortex evaporative-heating\nmechanism, i.e., annihilations of vortex-antivortex pairs which remove the\nlowest-energy vortices and thereby boost the mean energy per vortex. However,\nin our search for exotic OV states in a boundaryless 2D spherical BEC, we found\nthat OV clusters never form despite the annihilations of vortex pairs. Our\nanalysis reveals that contrary to the general belief, vortex-pair annihilation\nemits intense sound waves, which damp the motion of all vortices and hence\nsuppress the formation of OV clusters. We also present unequivocal evidences\nshowing that the true mechanism underlying the observed spontaneous OV state is\nthe escaping of vortices from the BEC boundary.

This paper aims to\ntackle this dilemma by evaluating the tradeoff between location privacy and\nsecurity in LBS. In particular, we investigate the impact of applying location\ndata privacy-preservation techniques on the performance of two detectors,\nnamely a Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN),\nand a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

Further experiments reveal that DBSCAN is not\nscalable to large size datasets containing millions of trips, because of the\nlarge number of computations needed for clustering trips. On the other hand,\nDBSCAN only requires less than 10 percent of the data used by RNN to achieve\nsimilar performance when applied to vehicle data without obfuscation,\ndemonstrating that clustering-based methods can be easily applied to small\ndatasets.

In large-scale problems, computing an optimal low-rank approximation\ncan be prohibitively expensive. Matrix sketching addresses this by reducing the\ninput matrix to a smaller, but representative matrix via a low-dimensional\nlinear embedding. If the sketch matrix produced by the embedding captures\nsufficient geometric properties of the original matrix, then a near-optimal\napproximation may be obtained. Much of the work done in matrix sketching has\ncentered on random projection. Alternatively, in this work, deterministic\nmatrix sketches which generate coarse representations, compatible with the\ncorresponding PDE solve, are considered in the computation of the singular\nvalue decomposition and matrix interpolative decomposition. The deterministic\nsketching approaches in this work have many advantages over randomized\nsketches. Broadly, randomized sketches are data-agnostic, whereas the proposed\nsketching methods exploit structures within data generated in complex PDE\nsystems. These deterministic sketches are often faster, require access to a\nsmall fraction of the input matrix, and do not need to be explicitly\nconstructed. A novel single-pass, i.e., requiring one read over the input,\npower iteration algorithm is also presented. The power iteration method is\nparticularly effective in improving low-rank approximations when the singular\nvalue decay of data is slow. Finally, theoretical error bounds and estimates,\nas well as numerical results across three application problems, are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 03:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Experimental\nresults using the patient cohort collected by the China National Center for\nBioinformation (CNCB) showed that the proposed COVID-Net CT-S networks, by\nleveraging volumetric features, can achieve significantly improved severity\nassessment performance when compared to traditional severity assessment\nnetworks that learn and leverage 2D visual features to characterize COVID-19\nseverity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 04:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Therefore, it is essential to compute an appropriate basis with an\nefficient numerical procedure when applying ROM to nonlinear problems. In this\npaper, we propose an online adaptive basis technique to increase the quality of\nROM while decreasing the computational costs in nonlinear problems. In the\nproposed method, the adaptive basis is defined by the low-rank update\nformulation, and two auxiliary vectors are set to implement this low-rank\ncondition. To simultaneously tackle the issues of accuracy and the\ncomputational cost of the ROM basis, the auxiliary vectors are algebraically\nderived by optimizing a local residual operator. As a result, the reliability\nof ROM is significantly improved with a low computational cost because the\nerror information can be contained without inverse operations of the full model\ndimension required in conventional approaches. The other feature of the\nproposed iterative algorithm is that the number of the initial incremental ROM\nbasis could be varied, unlike in the typical online adaptive basis approaches.\nIt may provide a fast and effective spanning process of the high-quality ROM\nsubspace in the iteration step. A detailed derivation process of the proposed\nmethod is presented, and its performance is evaluated in various nonlinear\nnumerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 04:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

With this geomorphology problem as the test domain, we\ndemonstrate a pipeline for detecting, localizing, and precisely mapping fragile\ngeologic features distributed on a landscape. To do so, we first carry out a\nlawn-mower search pattern in the survey region from a high elevation using an\nUnpiloted Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Once a potential PBR target is detected by a\ndeep neural network, we track the bounding box in the image frames using a\nreal-time tracking algorithm. The location and occupancy of the target in world\ncoordinates are estimated using a sampling-based filtering algorithm, where a\nset of 3D points are re-sampled after weighting by the tracked bounding boxes\nfrom different camera perspectives. The converged 3D points provide a prior on\n3D bounding shape of a target, which is used for UAV path planning to closely\nand completely map the target with Simultaneous Localization and Mapping\n(SLAM).

At first, there always exist\nenough field redefinitions to bring the vertex into abelian form where there\nare some corrections to the gauge transformations but the gauge algebra is\nundeformed. At second, with the further (as a rule higher derivative) field\nredefinitions one can bring the vertex into trivially gauge invariant form\nexpressed in terms of the gauge invariant objects of the free theory.\n  Our aim in this work is to show (using a simple example) how these general\nproperties are realised in the so-called Fradkin-Vasiliev formalism and to see\nthe effects (if any) that the presence of massless field, and hence of some\nunbroken gauge symmetries, can produce.

Such models commonly predict Uranus to be brighter and, recently,\nNeptune to be fainter than observed. In this work, we investigate the influence\nof a thermally conductive boundary layer on the evolution of Uranus- and\nNeptune-like planets. This thermal boundary layer (TBL) is assumed to be\nlocated deep in the planet, and be caused by a steep compositional gradient\nbetween a H-He-dominated outer envelope and an ice-rich inner envelope. We\ninvestigate the effect of TBL thickness, thermal conductivity, and the time of\nTBL formation on the planet's cooling behaviour. The calculations were\nperformed with our recently developed tool based on the Henyey method for\nstellar evolution. We make use of state-of-the-art equations of state for\nhydrogen, helium, and water, as well as of thermal conductivity data for water\ncalculated via ab initio methods. We find that even a thin conductive layer of\na few kilometres has a significant influence on the planetary cooling. In our\nmodels, Uranus' measured luminosity can only be reproduced if the planet has\nbeen near equilibrium with the solar incident flux for an extended time. For\nNeptune, we find a range of solutions with a near constant effective\ntemperature at layer thicknesses of 15 km or larger, similar to Uranus.

Thanks to this regularity, cuts are eliminated via\na natural construction. The second reason is that the system generates\nefficient proofs. Indeed, we show that a certain class of tautologies due to\nStatman, which cannot have better than exponential cut-free proofs in the\nsequent calculus, have polynomial cut-free proofs in our system. We achieve\nthis by using the same construction that we use for cut elimination.

The durations of these states show a wide variety\nranging from several seconds to hours at a time.

An online VR\nvoltage setpoint tuning strategy is developed to reduce excessive tap changes\nand avoid large voltage fluctuations without retrofitting existing VR\ncontrollers.

Actual distribution\nfeeder topologies and load and PV time-series data are used to verify the\nperformance of the algorithm. Because the method is a rule-based approach, it\nruns extremely fast, requires fewer measurements, and requires no retrofit to\nthe existing VR control mechanisms.

While the principles of classical physics were long found to be\nunaccommodating for a causally effective consciousness, the inherent\nindeterminism of quantum physics, together with its characteristic dichotomy\nbetween quantum states and quantum observables, provides a fertile ground for\nthe physical modeling of consciousness. Here, we utilize the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, together with the Planck--Einstein relation between energy and\nfrequency, in order to determine the appropriate quantum dynamical timescale of\nconscious processes. Furthermore, with the help of a simple two-qubit toy model\nwe illustrate the importance of non-zero interaction Hamiltonian for the\ngeneration of quantum entanglement and manifestation of observable correlations\nbetween different measurement outcomes.

The presence of\nnon-zero interaction Hamiltonian, however, allows for decoherence of the\nindividual quantum subsystems along with their mutual interaction and quantum\nentanglement. The presented results show that quantum coherence of individual\nsubsystems cannot be used for cognitive binding because it is a physical\nmechanism that leads to separability and non-interaction.

We show that under general\nconsistency conditions on the regression operator estimator, which hold for\ncertain functional principal component based estimators, consistent estimation\nof the conditional distribution can be achieved, both when $Y$ is an element of\na separable Hilbert space, and when $Y$ is an element of the Banach space of\ncontinuous functions. The latter results imply that sets $A$ that specify path\nproperties of $Y$, which are of interest in applications, can be considered.\nThe proposed methods are studied in several simulation experiments, and data\nanalyses of electricity price and pollution curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 10:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

An intersection digraph is reflexive\nif $S_v\\cap T_v\\neq \\emptyset$ for every vertex $v$. Compared to well-known\nundirected intersection graphs like interval graphs and permutation graphs, not\nmany algorithmic applications on intersection digraphs have been developed.\nMotivated by the successful story on algorithmic applications of intersection\ngraphs using a graph width parameter called mim-width, we introduce its\ndirected analogue called `bi-mim-width' and prove that various classes of\nreflexive intersection digraphs have bounded bi-mim-width. In particular, we\nshow that as a natural extension of $H$-graphs, reflexive $H$-digraphs have\nlinear bi-mim-width at most $12|E(H)|$, which extends a bound on the linear\nmim-width of $H$-graphs [On the Tractability of Optimization Problems on\n$H$-Graphs.

A prediction model developed for one machine many not perform\nwell in another similar machine. This is usually due to lack of\ngeneralizability of data-driven models. To increase generalizability of\npredictive models, this research integrates the data mining with\nfirst-principle knowledge.

The proposed process is widely accepted by wind\nenergy predictive maintenance practitioners because of its simplicity and\nefficiency.

However, several\nchallenges remain for problems where the solution manifold of the parameterized\nsystem cannot be well approximated by linear subspaces. While the online\nefficiency of these model reduction methods is very convincing for problems\nwith a rapid decay of the Kolmogorov n-width, there are still major drawbacks\nand limitations. Most importantly, the construction of the reduced system in\nthe offline phase is extremely CPU-time and memory consuming for large scale\nand multi scale systems. For practical applications, it is thus necessary to\nderive model reduction techniques that do not rely on a classical\noffline/online splitting but allow for more flexibility in the usage of\ncomputational resources. A promising approach with this respect is model\nreduction with adaptive enrichment.

Purpose: Investigate the\ndependence of IVIM parameters on the B_0field strength when using a bi- or\ntriexponential model. Field Strength/Sequence: 20 volunteers were examined at\ntwo field strengths (1.5 and 3T). Diffusion-weighted images of the abdomen were\nacquired at 24 b-values ranging from 0.2 to 500 s/mm2. Assessment: ROIs were\nmanually drawn in the liver. Data were fitted with a bi- and a triexponential\nIVIM model. Resulting parameters were compared between both field strengths.\nResults: At b-values below 6s/mm2, the triexponential model provided better\nagreement with the data than the biexponential model.

This paper proposes a re-ranking network\nto predict the correlations between the probe and top-ranked neighbor samples.\nSpecifically, all the feature embeddings of query and gallery images are\nexpanded and enhanced by a linear combination of their neighbors, with the\ncorrelation prediction serving as discriminative combination weights. The\ncombination process is equivalent to moving independent embeddings toward the\nidentity centers, improving cluster compactness. For correlation prediction, we\nfirst aggregate the contextual information for probe's k-nearest neighbors via\nthe Transformer encoder. Then, we distill and refine the probe-related features\ninto the Contextual Memory cell via attention mechanism. Like humans that\nretrieve images by not only considering probe images but also memorizing the\nretrieved ones, the Contextual Memory produces multi-view descriptions for each\ninstance. Finally, the neighbors are reconstructed with features fetched from\nthe Contextual Memory, and a binary classifier predicts their correlations with\nthe probe.

While\nperturbations in the velocity field have been shown to explain turbulent\ntransitions, a physical explanation of why flows become turbulent, based on the\nforces felt by the fluid particles, has remained elusive. In this work a new\ntheory is proposed that attempts to explain the transition of fluid flow from\nlaminar to turbulent as explained by the fluid material undergoing failure. In\na vaguely similar sense to how fractures can occur in solids once the balance\nof momentum exceeds the capacity of the material, so too in a fluid, after\nsufficient kinetic energy has been achieved by a fluid packet, the viscous\nforces are unable to maintain the laminar behavior and the fluid packets\nreceive a boost as the stored energy in the viscous bonds are transferred to\nthe kinetic energy of the fluid. This new model is described in terms of fluid\npackets and the forces on a mass element and commonly-known turbulent flows are\nused as examples to test the theory. Predicted flow profiles from the theory\nmatch the experimental observations of averaged flow profiles and a new\nequation to predict the onset of turbulence for any flow is presented. This\nprocess of the fluid undergoing failure can be seen as a natural continuation\nof the prevailing wisdom of turbulence when viewed from a different frame of\nreference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 12:36:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 May 2021 15:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

In\nparticular, motivated by the advances in parameterized algorithms, we focus on\nproblems on decomposable graphs. For example, for the problem of detecting a\nHamiltonian cycle, we build upon the rank-based approach from [Bodlaender et\nal., Inf. Comput.'15] and design isolation schemes that use\n  - $O(t\\log n + \\log^2{n})$ random bits on graphs of treewidth at most $t$;\n  - $O(\\sqrt{n})$ random bits on planar or $H$-minor free graphs; and\n  - $O(n)$-random bits on general graphs.\n  In all these schemes, the weights are bounded exponentially in the number of\nrandom bits used. As a corollary, for every fixed $H$ we obtain an algorithm\nfor detecting a Hamiltonian cycle in an $H$-minor-free graph that runs in\ndeterministic time $2^{O(\\sqrt{n})}$ and uses polynomial space; this is the\nfirst algorithm to achieve such complexity guarantees. For problems of more\nlocal nature, such as finding an independent set of maximum size, we obtain\nisolation schemes on graphs of treedepth at most $d$ that use $O(d)$ random\nbits and assign polynomially-bounded weights.\n  We also complement our findings with several unconditional and conditional\nlower bounds, which show that many of the results cannot be significantly\nimproved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 12:46:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Such a lattice is formed\nby, e.g., a single layer of graphane or the graphite surfaces as well as (111)\nsurface of face-cubic center crystals. In the present work, an extension of the\nlattice gas model to $S=1/2$ fermionic particles on the two-dimensional\ntriangular (hexagonal) lattice is analyzed. In such a model, each lattice site\ncan be occupied not by only one particle, but by two particles, which interact\nwith each other by onsite $U$ and intersite $W_{1}$ and $W_{2}$ (nearest and\nnext-nearest-neighbor, respectively) density-density interaction. The\ninvestigated hamiltonian has a form of the extended Hubbard model in the atomic\nlimit (i.e., the zero-bandwidth limit). In the analysis of the phase diagrams\nand thermodynamic properties of this model with repulsive $W_{1}>0$, the\nvariational approach is used, which treats the onsite interaction term exactly\nand the intersite interactions within the mean-field approximation. The ground\nstate ($T=0$) diagram for $W_{2}\\leq0$ as well as finite temperature ($T>0$)\nphase diagrams for $W_{2}=0$ are presented. Two different types of charge order\nwithin $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ unit cell can occur. At $T=0$, for $W_{2}=0$\nphase separated states are degenerated with homogeneous phases (but $T>0$\nremoves this degeneration), whereas attractive $W_2<0$ stabilizes phase\nseparation at incommensurate fillings. For $U/W_{1}<0$ and $U/W_{1}>1/2$ only\nthe phase with two different concentrations occurs (together with two different\nphase separated states occurring), whereas for small repulsive $0<U/W_{1}<1/2$\nthe other ordered phase also appears (with tree different concentrations in\nsublattices). The qualitative differences with the model considered on\nhypercubic lattices are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 13:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

The CCT has the advantage that it is analytic\nand exact.

The underlying rationale for using\nRHEM in studies of coauthor networks is that scientific collaboration is\nintrinsically polyadic, that is, it typically involves teams of any size.\nConsequently, RHEM specify publication rates associated with hyperedges\nrepresenting groups of scientists of any size. Going beyond previous work on\nRHEM for meeting data, we adapt this model family to settings in which\nrelational hyperevents have a dedicated outcome, such as a scientific paper\nwith a measurable impact (e.g., the received number of citations). Relational\noutcome can on the one hand be used to specify additional explanatory variables\nin RHEM since the probability of coauthoring may be influenced, for instance,\nby prior (shared) success of scientists. On the other hand relational outcome\ncan also serve as a response variable in models seeking to explain the\nperformance of scientific teams. To tackle the latter we propose relational\nhyperevent outcome models (RHOM) that are closely related with RHEM to the\npoint that both model families can specify the likelihood of scientific\ncollaboration - and the expected performance, respectively - with the same set\nof explanatory variables allowing to assess, for instance, whether variables\nleading to increased collaboration also tend to increase scientific impact. For\nillustration, we apply RHEM to empirical coauthor networks comprising more than\n350,000 published papers by scientists working in three scientific disciplines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 15:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

Earlier works in\nthis field either focused on modeling explicit buyer fitment feedback or\nmodeling of only a single aspect of the problem (e.g., specific category,\nbrand, etc.). More recent works proposed richer models, either content-based or\nsequence-based, better accounting for content-based aspects of the problem or\nbetter modeling the buyer's online journey. However, both these approaches fail\nin certain scenarios: either when encountering unseen items (sequence-based\nmodels) or when encountering new users (content-based models).\n  To address the aforementioned gaps, we propose PreSizE - a novel deep\nlearning framework which utilizes Transformers for accurate size prediction.\nPreSizE models the effect of both content-based attributes, such as brand and\ncategory, and the buyer's purchase history on her size preferences. Using an\nextensive set of experiments on a large-scale e-commerce dataset, we\ndemonstrate that PreSizE is capable of achieving superior prediction\nperformance compared to previous state-of-the-art baselines. By encoding item\nattributes, PreSizE better handles cold-start cases with unseen items, and\ncases where buyers have little past purchase data. As a proof of concept, we\ndemonstrate that size predictions made by PreSizE can be effectively integrated\ninto an existing production recommender system yielding very effective features\nand significantly improving recommendations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 15:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Of particular interest is the relationship between Bayesian\nevidence and the flexibility penalty due to Priebe and Rougier. For the case of\nan exponential family in canonical form equipped with a conjugate prior for the\ncanonical parameter, flexibility may be exactly decomposed into the usual BIC\nlikelihood penalty and a $O_p(1)$ term, the latter of which we explicitly\ncompute. We also investigate the asymptotics of Bayes factors for linearly\nnested canonical exponential families equipped with conjugate priors; in\nparticular, we find the exact rates at which Bayes factors correctly diverge in\nfavor of the correct model: linearly and logarithmically in the number of\nobservations when the full and nested models are true, respectively. Such\ntheoretical considerations for the general case permit us to fully express the\nasymptotic behavior of flexibility and Bayes factors for the\nvariance-covariance structure selection problem when we assume that the prior\nfor the model precision is a member of the gamma/Wishart family of\ndistributions or is uninformative.

For regression methods, trust is\nincreased if they approximate the true input-output relationships and perform\naccurately outside the bounds of the training data. But often performance\noff-test-set is poor, especially when data is sparse. This is because the\nconditional average, which in many scenarios is a good approximation of the\n`ground truth', is only modelled with conventional Minkowski-r error measures\nwhen the data set adheres to restrictive assumptions, with many real data sets\nviolating these. To combat this there are several methods that use prior\nknowledge to approximate the `ground truth'. However, prior knowledge is not\nalways available, and this paper investigates how error measures affect the\nability for a regression method to model the `ground truth' in these scenarios.\nCurrent error measures are shown to create an unhelpful bias and a new error\nmeasure is derived which does not exhibit this behaviour. This is tested on 36\nrepresentative data sets with different characteristics, showing that it is\nmore consistent in determining the `ground truth' and in giving improved\npredictions in regions beyond the range of the training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 15:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Hardware/software (HW/SW) co-design optimizes the hardware and\nsoftware in concert and produces high-quality solutions. There are two main\nchallenges in the co-design flow. First, multiple methods exist to partition\ntensor computation and have different impacts on performance and energy\nefficiency. Besides, the hardware part must be implemented by the intrinsic\nfunctions of spatial accelerators. It is hard for programmers to identify and\nanalyze the partitioning methods manually. Second, the overall design space\ncomposed of HW/SW partitioning, hardware optimization, and software\noptimization is huge. The design space needs to be efficiently explored.\n  To this end, we propose an agile co-design approach HASCO that provides an\nefficient HW/SW solution to dense tensor computation.

We critically evaluate the\nlink between the modelled variables in TKTD models and the observations from\nlaboratory ecotoxicity tests. For the endpoint reproduction, this link is far\nfrom trivial. The relevant TKTD models for sub-lethal effects are based on\nDynamic-Energy Budget (DEB) theory, which specifies a continuous investment\nflux into reproduction. In contrast, experimental tests score egg or offspring\nrelease by the mother. The link between model and data is particularly\ntroublesome when a species reproduces in discrete clutches, and even more so\nwhen eggs are incubated in the mother's brood pouch (and release of neonates is\nscored in the test).

We\ndiscuss these and other issues with reproduction data, reflect on their\npotential impact on DEB-TKTD analysis, and provide preliminary recommendations\nto correct them.

Various sensors and field devices play a central role,\nas they generate a vast amount of real-time data that can provide insights into\nmanufacturing. The synergy of complex event processing (CEP) and machine\nlearning (ML) has been developed actively in the last years in IIoT to identify\npatterns in heterogeneous data streams and fuse raw data into tangible facts.\nIn a traditional compute-centric paradigm, the raw field data are continuously\nsent to the cloud and processed centrally. As IIoT devices become increasingly\npervasive and ubiquitous, concerns are raised since transmitting such amount of\ndata is energy-intensive, vulnerable to be intercepted, and subjected to high\nlatency. The data-centric paradigm can essentially solve these problems by\nempowering IIoT to perform decentralized on-device ML and CEP, keeping data\nprimarily on edge devices and minimizing communications.

While these concepts promise great\nbenefits to travelers, their heavy reliance on technology raises equity\nconcerns as socially disadvantaged population groups can be left out in an era\nof on-demand mobility. This paper investigates the potential uptake of MOD\ntransit services (integrated fixed-route and on-demand services) among\ntravelers living in low-income communities. Specially, we analyze people's\nlatent attitude towards three shared-use mobility services, including\nride-hailing services, fixed-route transit, and MOD transit. We conduct a\nlatent class cluster analysis of 825 survey respondents sampled from low-income\nneighborhoods in Detroit and Ypsilanti, Michigan. We identified three latent\nsegments: shared-mode enthusiast, shared-mode opponent, and fixed-route transit\nloyalist. People from the shared-mode enthusiast segment often use ride-hailing\nservices and live in areas with poor transit access, and they are likely to be\nthe early adopters of MOD transit services. The shared-mode opponent segment\nmainly includes vehicle owners who lack interests in shared mobility options.\nThe fixed-route transit loyalist segment includes a considerable share of\nlow-income individuals who face technological barriers to use the MOD transit.\nWe also find that males, college graduates, car owners, people with a mobile\ndata plan, and people living in poor-transit-access areas have a higher level\nof preferences for MOD transit services. We conclude with policy\nrecommendations for developing more accessible and equitable MOD transit\nservices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 15:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-12"}
