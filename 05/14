While state-of-the-art quantum\nsimulators are in principle able to simulate quantum dynamics well outside the\ndomain of classical computers, they are noisy and limited in the variability of\nthe initial state of the dynamics and the observables that can be measured.\nDespite these limitations, here we show that such a quantum simulator can be\nused to in-effect solve for the dynamics of a many-body system. We develop an\nefficient numerical technique that facilitates classical simulations in regimes\nnot accessible to exact calculations or other established numerical techniques.\nThe method is based on approximations that are well suited to describe\nlocalized one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems. Since this new method does not\nhave an error estimate and the approximations do not hold in general, we use a\nneutral-atom Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulator with $L_{\\text{exp}}\\simeq290$\nlattice sites to benchmark its performance in terms of accuracy and convergence\nfor evolution times up to $700$ tunnelling times. We then use these\napproximations in order to derive a simple prediction of the behaviour of\ninteracting Bloch oscillations for spin-imbalanced Fermi-Hubbard systems, which\nwe show to be in quantitative agreement with experimental results. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that the convergence of our method is the slowest when the\nentanglement depth developed in the many-body system we consider is neither too\nsmall nor too large. This represents a promising regime for near-term\napplications of quantum simulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 16:03:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 19:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

This state is characterized by sudden\ntransitions between metastable jammed states, involving the partial\nmicromechanical rearrangement of the granular medium. Using numerical\nsimulations of two-dimensional granular media under quasistatic biaxial\ncompression, we show that the dynamics in the stable evolution state is\ncharacterized by scale-free avalanches well before the macromechanical\nstationary flow regime traditionally linked to a self-organized critical state.\nThis, together with the non-uniqueness and the non-monotony of macroscopic\ndeformation curves, suggests that the statistical avalanche properties and the\nsusceptibilities of the system cannot be reduced to a function of the\nmacromechanical state. The associated scaling exponents are non-universal and\ndepend on the interactions between particles. For stiffer particles (or samples\nat low confining pressure) we find distributions of avalanche properties\ncompatible with the predictions of mean-field theory. The scaling exponents\ndecrease below the mean-field values for softer interactions between particles.\nThese lower exponents are consistent with observations for amorphous solids at\ntheir critical point. We specifically discuss the relationship between\nmicroscopic and macroscopic variables, including the relation between the\nexternal stress drop and the internal potential energy released during kinetic\navalanches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 16:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Multi-spectral observations from Voyager,\nground-based observatories, and space telescopes have revealed a delicately\nbanded atmosphere punctuated by storms, waves, and dark vortices, evolving\nslowly under the seasonal influence of Uranus' extreme axial tilt. Condensables\nlike methane and hydrogen sulphide play a crucial role in shaping circulation,\nclouds, and storm phenomena via latent heat release through condensation,\nstrong equator-to-pole gradients suggestive of equatorial upwelling and polar\nsubsidence, and through forming stabilising layers that may decouple different\ncirculation and convective regimes as a function of depth. Weak vertical mixing\nand low atmospheric temperatures associated with Uranus' negligible internal\nheat means that stratospheric methane photochemistry occurs in a unique\nhigh-pressure regime, decoupled from the influx of external oxygen. The low\nhomopause also allows for the formation of an extensive ionosphere. Finally,\nthe atmosphere provides a window on the bulk composition of Uranus - the\nice-to-rock ratio, supersolar elemental and isotopic enrichments inferred from\nremote sensing and future \\textit{in situ} measurements - providing key\ninsights into its formation and subsequent migration. This review reveals the\nstate of our knowledge of the time-variable circulation, composition,\nmeteorology, chemistry, and clouds on this enigmatic `Ice Giant,' summarising\ninsights from more than three decades of observations, and highlighting key\nquestions for the next generation of planetary missions. As a\nhydrogen-dominated, intermediate-sized, and chemically-enriched world, Uranus\ncould be our closest and best example of atmospheric processes on a class of\nworlds that may dominate the census of planets beyond our own Solar System.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 16:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

We study: 1) the\nexpected rate of lensing at current detector sensitivity and the implications\nof a non-observation of strong lensing or a stochastic gravitational-wave\nbackground on the merger-rate density at high redshift; 2) how the\ninterpretation of individual high-mass events would change if they were found\nto be lensed; 3) the possibility of multiple images due to strong lensing by\ngalaxies or galaxy clusters; and 4) possible wave-optics effects due to\npoint-mass microlenses. Several pairs of signals in the multiple-image analysis\nshow similar parameters and, in this sense, are nominally consistent with the\nstrong lensing hypothesis. However, taking into account population priors,\nselection effects, and the prior odds against lensing, these events do not\nprovide sufficient evidence for lensing. Overall, we find no compelling\nevidence for lensing in the observed gravitational-wave signals from any of\nthese analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 16:12:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 13:31:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 17:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Maximum likelihood and\nbootstrap estimation procedures are discussed and the finite-sample behavior of\nthese estimates is assessed through Monte Carlo experiments. In these\nsimulations, both methods perform well in terms of estimation bias and standard\nerrors, even with relatively small sample sizes. Moreover, we show that for\nnon-Gaussian data, for t-Student and Generalized errors distributions, the\nparameters of the model can be estimated precisely by maximum likelihood. The\nproposed IMA model is compared to the continuous autoregressive moving average\n(CARMA) models, exhibiting good performance. Finally, the practical application\nand usefulness of the proposed model are illustrated with two real-life data\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 16:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

Here we apply an improved first-principles-based theory,\nreferred to as generalized mode-coupling theory (GMCT), to sticky hard spheres.\nThis theoretical framework seeks to go beyond MCT by hierarchically expanding\nthe dynamics in higher-order density correlation functions -- an approach that\nmay become exact if sufficiently many correlations are taken into account. We\npredict the phase diagrams from the first few levels of the GMCT hierarchy and\nthe dynamics-related critical exponents, all of which are much closer to the\nempirical observations than MCT. Notably, the prominent reentrant glassy\ndynamics, the glass-glass transition, and the higher-order bifurcation\nsingularity classes ($A_3$ and $A_4$) of sticky hard spheres are found to be\npreserved within GMCT at arbitrary order. Moreover, we demonstrate that when\nthe hierarchical order of GMCT increases, the effect of the short-ranged\nattractive interactions becomes more evident in the dynamics.

Past research indicates that\nzone refining is an efficient and scalable way to purify NaI. In particular, K\nand Rb -- two elements with radioisotopes that can cause scintillation\nbackgrounds -- can be efficiently removed by zone refining. However, zone\nrefining has never been demonstrated for ultra-high purity NaI which became\ncommercially available recently. In this article, we show that many common\nmetallic impurities can be efficiently removed via zone refining. A numerical\nmodel for predicting the final impurity distribution was developed and used to\nfit the ICP-MS measurement data to determine the segregation coefficient and\nthe initial concentration. Under this scheme, the segregation coefficient for K\nis estimated to be 0.57, indicating that zone refining is still effective in\nremoving K from ultra-high purity NaI. As zone refining tends to move the\nimpurities to one end, elements with concentrations too low to be measured\ndirectly in the unprocessed powder can potentially be detected in the end due\nto the enrichment. We also present an analysis technique to estimate the\ninitial concentrations of impurities with partial data, which effectively\nenhances the sensitivity of the spectrometer. Using this technique, the initial\nconcentration of $^{85}$Rb is estimated to be between 5 ppt and 14 ppt at 90%\nCL, at least 14 times lower than the detection limit of ICP-MS and 7 times\nlower than the current most stringent limit set by the DAMA collaboration by\ndirect counting of radioactive $^{87}$Rb.

Recent approaches have focused on\nquantifying parameter uncertainty, but approaches to end-to-end training of\nDNNs with epistemic input data uncertainty are more limited and largely\nproblem-specific. In this work, we present a DNN optimized with gradient-based\nmethods capable to quantify input and parameter uncertainty by means of\ninterval analysis, which we call Deep Interval Neural Network (DINN). We\nperform experiments on an air pollution dataset with sensor uncertainty and\nshow that the DINN can produce accurate bounded estimates from uncertain input\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 17:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

To do so, we first optimize\na powerful compression model with adversarial training which learns to\nreconstruct its inputs via a discrete latent bottleneck and thereby effectively\nstrips the latent representation of high-frequency details such as texture.\nSubsequently, we train an autoregressive transformer model to learn the\ndistribution of the discrete image representations conditioned on a tokenized\nversion of the layouts. Our experiments show that the resulting system is able\nto synthesize high-quality images consistent with the given layouts. In\nparticular, we improve the state-of-the-art FID score on COCO-Stuff and on\nVisual Genome by up to 19% and 53% and demonstrate the synthesis of images up\nto 512 x 512 px on COCO and Open Images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 17:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

The core among these methods is intra-image\ninvariance learning. Two different transformations of one image instance are\nconsidered as a positive sample pair, where various tasks are designed to learn\ninvariant representations by comparing the pair. Analogically, for video data,\nrepresentations of frames from the same video are trained to be closer than\nframes from other videos, i.e. intra-video invariance. However, cross-video\nrelation has barely been explored for visual representation learning. Unlike\nintra-video invariance, ground-truth labels of cross-video relation is usually\nunavailable without human labors. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive\nlearning method which explores the cross-video relation by using\ncycle-consistency for general image representation learning. This allows to\ncollect positive sample pairs across different video instances, which we\nhypothesize will lead to higher-level semantics. We validate our method by\ntransferring our image representation to multiple downstream tasks including\nvisual object tracking, image classification, and action recognition.

Here we investigate experimentally feasible settings\nin which a few superconducting qubits are coupled to a bath of photons evolving\non the hyperbolic lattice. We compare our numerical results for finite lattices\nwith analytical results for continuous hyperbolic space on the Poincar\\'{e}\ndisk. We find good agreement between the two descriptions in the\nlong-wavelength regime. We show that photon-qubit bound states have a\ncurvature-limited size. We propose to use a qubit as a local probe of the\nhyperbolic bath, for example by measuring the relaxation dynamics of the qubit.\nWe find that, although the boundary effects strongly impact the photonic\ndensity of states, the spectral density is well described by the continuum\ntheory. We show that interactions between qubits are mediated by photons\npropagating along geodesics. We demonstrate that the photonic bath can give\nrise to geometrically-frustrated hyperbolic quantum spin models with\nfinite-range or exponentially-decaying interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 18:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

Although relational\nsystems are still predominant, the interest in NoSQL systems is continuously\nincreasing. In this scenario, polyglot persistence is envisioned as the\ndatabase architecture to be prevalent in the future.\n  Multi-model database tools normally use a generic or unified metamodel to\nrepresent schemas of the data model that they support. Such metamodels\nfacilitate developing utilities, as they can be built on a common\nrepresentation. Also, the number of mappings required to migrate databases from\na data model to another is reduced, and integrability is favored.\n  In this paper, we present the U-Schema unified metamodel able to represent\nlogical schemas for the four most popular NoSQL paradigms (columnar, document,\nkey-value, and graph) as well as relational schemas. We will formally define\nthe mappings between U-Schema and the data model defined for each paradigm.

IoT devices are\ngetting cheaper, smaller. They are becoming more and more computationally and\nenergy-efficient.

For any IoT-based video analytics application, few key points\nrequired, such as cost-effectiveness, widespread use, flexible design, accurate\nscene detection, reusability of the framework. Video-based smart doorbell\nsystem is one such application domain for video analytics where many commercial\nofferings are available in the consumer market. However, such existing\nofferings are costly, monolithic, and proprietary. Also, there will be a\ntrade-off between accuracy and portability. To address the foreseen problems,\nI'm proposing a distributed framework for video analytics with a use case of a\nsmart doorbell system. The proposed framework uses AWS cloud services as a base\nplatform and to meet the price affordability constraint, the system was\nimplemented on affordable Raspberry Pi. The smart doorbell will be able to\nrecognize the known/unknown person with at most accuracy. The smart doorbell\nsystem is also having additional detection functionalities such as harmful\nweapon detection, noteworthy vehicle detection, animal/pet detection. An iOS\napplication is specifically developed for this implementation which can receive\nthe notification from the smart doorbell in real-time. Finally, the paper also\nmentions the classical approaches for video analytics, their feasibility in\nimplementing with this use-case, and comparative analysis in terms of accuracy\nand time required to detect an object in the frame is carried out.

From an alternative perspective, we propose a deep neural\nnetwork based automatic method to construct an improved estimator from existing\nones. Theoretical properties are studied to provide guidance on applicability\nof our estimator to seek potential improvement. Simulation studies demonstrate\nthat the proposed method has considerable finite-sample efficiency gain as\ncompared with several common estimators. In the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment\nTrial (ACTT) as an important application, our ensemble estimator essentially\ncontributes to a more ethical and efficient adaptive clinical trial with fewer\npatients enrolled. The proposed framework can be generally applied to various\nstatistical problems, and can be served as a reference measure to guide\nstatistical research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 19:26:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 21:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

To elucidate this connection, we measure the structural and\nphotometric properties of the host galaxies of ~5000 SDSS quasars at 0.2<z<1\nusing five-band (grizy) optical imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru\nStrategic Program. An automated analysis tool is used to forward-model the\nblended emission of the quasar as characterized by the point spread function\nand the underlying host galaxy as a two-dimensional Sersic profile. In\nagreement with previous studies, quasars are preferentially hosted by massive\nstar-forming galaxies with disk-like light profiles. Furthermore, we find that\nthe size distribution of quasar hosts is broad at a given stellar mass and the\naverage values exhibit a size-stellar mass relation as seen with inactive\ngalaxies. In contrast, the sizes of quasar hosts are more compact than inactive\nstar-forming galaxies on average, but not as compact as quiescent galaxies of\nsimilar stellar masses. This is true irrespective of quasar properties\nincluding bolometric luminosity, Eddington ratio, and black hole mass. These\nresults are consistent with a scenario in which galaxies are concurrently\nfueling a SMBH and building their stellar bulge from a centrally-concentrated\ngas reservoir. Alternatively, quasar hosts may be experiencing a compaction\nprocess in which stars from the disk and inflowing gas are responsible for\ngrowing the bulge. In addition, we confirm that the host galaxies of type-1\nquasars have a bias of being closer towards face-on, suggesting that\ngalactic-scale dust can contribute to obscuring the broad-line region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 22:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

Our algorithmic tools and\nimplementations efficiently handle portfolios with 10000 assets, and compute\nmoments of order k up to 40 in a few seconds, thus handling real-life\nscenarios. We focus on the long-only strategy which is the most common type of\ninvestment, i.e. on portfolios whose weights are non-negative and sum up to 1;\nour approach is readily generalizable. Thus, we leverage a geometric\nrepresentation of the stock market, where the investment set defines a simplex\npolytope.

The SG-dominated grid is\ntraditionally analyzed in a mechanical-centric view which ignores fast\nelectrical dynamics and focuses on the torque-speed dynamics. By contrast,\nanalysis of the emergent IBR-dominated grid usually takes the\nelectrical-centric view which focuses on the voltage-current interaction. In\nthis article, a port-mapping method is proposed to fill the gap between these\napproaches and combine them in a unified model.

The\nsource of the quasi-static speckles is hardware aberrations that are not\ncompensated by the adaptive optics system. These aberrations are called\nnon-common path aberrations (NCPA). In 2013, Frazin showed how, in principle,\nsimultaneous millisecond (ms) telemetry from the wavefront sensor (WFS) and the\nscience camera behind a stellar coronagraph can be used as input into a\nregression scheme that simultaneously and self-consistently estimates the NCPA\nand the sought-after image of the planetary system (the exoplanet image). The\nphysical principle underlying the regression method is rather simple: the\nwavefronts, which are measured by the WFS, modulate the speckles caused by the\nNCPA and therefore can be used as probes of the optical system. The most\nimportant departure from realism in the author's 2013 article was the\nassumption that the WFS made error-free measurements. The simulations in Part I\nprovide results on the joint regression on the NCPA and the exoplanet image\nfrom three different methods, called the ideal, the naive, and the\nbias-corrected estimators. The ideal estimator is not physically realizable but\nis a useful as a benchmark for simulation studies, but the other two are, at\nleast in principle. This article provides the regression equations for all\nthree of these estimators as well as a supporting technical discussion.\nBriefly, the naive estimator simply uses the noisy WFS measurements without any\nattempt to account for the errors, and the bias-corrected estimator uses\nstatistical knowledge of the wavefronts to treat errors in the WFS\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 23:23:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 21:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

The accretion ring is a\nplace where matter inflowing from a companion star sojourns for a while to\nbifurcate to accretion and excretion flows due to angular momentum transfer in\nit. The matter in the accretion ring rotates along the Keplerian circular orbit\ndetermined by the intrinsic specific angular momentum of the inflowing matter\nand forms a thick ring-envelope. Two internal flows are expected to appear in\nthe thick envelope. One is a mass spreading flow bifurcating to a thick\naccretion flow and a thick excretion flow, as a result of the angular momentum\ntransfer within the ring-envelope. The other is a cooling flow toward the\nenvelope center governed by radiative cooling under an effect of X-ray\nirradiation. This cooling flow eventually forms a core in the torus, from which\na thin accretion disk and a thin excretion disk spread out as a result of the\nangular momentum transfer there again. Evaluating and comparing the time scales\nfor the two internal flows, the accretion ring is shown to generally originate\na two-layer accretion flow in which a thin accretion disk is sandwiched by a\nthick accretion flow, unless the accretion rate is very low. Properties of the\nthin excretion disk and the thick excretion flow are also investigated. The\nthin excretion disk is expected to terminate at a distance 4 times as large as\nthe accretion ring radius and to form another ring there, unless tidal effects\nfrom the companion star exist.

A prominent example is shared\nregisters, which have crash-tolerant implementations on top of message-passing\nsystems, allowing the advantages of shared memory to carry over to\nmessage-passing. Yet linearizable registers do not always behave properly when\nused inside randomized programs. A strengthening of linearizability, called\nstrong linearizability, has been shown to preserve probabilistic behavior, as\nwell as other hypersafety properties. In order to exploit composition and\nabstraction in message-passing systems, it is crucial to know whether there\nexist strongly-linearizable implementations of registers in message-passing.\nThis paper answers the question in the negative: there are no\nstrongly-linearizable fault-tolerant message-passing implementations of\nmulti-writer registers, max-registers, snapshots or counters. This result is\nproved by reduction from the corresponding result by Helmi et al.

There is great\ninterest in both the HPC and high-performance data analytics communities in\nunderstanding the roles these devices may play in the data paths of upcoming\nsystems.\n  This paper focuses on characterizing both the networking and computing\naspects of NVIDIA's new BlueField-2 SmartNIC when used in an Ethernet\nenvironment. For the networking evaluation we conducted multiple transfer\nexperiments between processors located at the host, the SmartNIC, and a remote\nhost. These tests illuminate how much processing headroom is available on the\nSmartNIC during transfers. For the computing evaluation we used the stress-ng\nbenchmark to compare the BlueField-2 to other servers and place realistic\nbounds on the types of offload operations that are appropriate for the\nhardware.\n  Our findings from this work indicate that while the BlueField-2 provides a\nflexible means of processing data at the network's edge, great care must be\ntaken to not overwhelm the hardware. While the host can easily saturate the\nnetwork link, the SmartNIC's embedded processors may not have enough computing\nresources to sustain more than half the expected bandwidth when using\nkernel-space packet processing. From a computational perspective, encryption\noperations, memory operations under contention, and on-card IPC operations on\nthe SmartNIC perform significantly better than the general-purpose servers used\nfor comparisons in our experiments.

These models fail to\naccount for important aspects of YSR states induced by transition-metal\nimpurities, including the effects of higher quantum spins coupled to several\nconduction-electron channels, crystal or ligand-field effects, and magnetic\nanisotropy. We introduce and explore a zero-bandwidth model, which incorporates\nthese aspects, is readily solved numerically, and analytically tractable in\nseveral limiting cases. The principal simplification of the model is to neglect\nKondo renormalizations of the exchange couplings between impurity spin and\nconduction electrons. Nevertheless, we find excellent correspondence in those\ncases, in which we can compare our results to existing\nnumerical-renormalization-group calculations. We apply the model to obtain and\nunderstand phase diagrams as a function of pairing strength and magnetic\nanisotropy as well as subgap excitation spectra. The single-channel case is\nmost relevant for transition-metal impurities embedded into metallic\ncoordination complexes on superconducting substrates, while the multi-channel\ncase models transition-metal adatoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 05:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

We find that the SPOD\neigenspectra of both wakes exhibit a low-rank behavior and the relative\ncontribution of low-rank modes to total fluctuation energy increases with\n$x/D$. The vortex shedding (VS) mechanism, which corresponds to $St \\approx\n0.11-0.13$ in both wakes, is active and dominant throughout the domain in both\nwakes. The continual downstream decay of the SPOD eigenspectrum peak at the VS\nmode, which is a prominent feature of the unstratified wake, is inhibited by\nbuoyancy, particularly for $Fr = 2$. The energy at and near the VS frequency is\nfound to appear in the outer region of the wake when the downstream distance\nexceeds $Nt = Nx/U = 6 - 8$. Visualizations show that unsteady internal gravity\nwaves (IGWs) emerge at the same $Nt = 6 - 8$. A causal link between the VS\nmechanism and the unsteady IGW generation is also established using the\nSPOD-based reconstruction and analysis of the pressure-transport term. These\nIGWs are also picked up in SPOD analysis as a structural change in the shape of\nthe leading SPOD eigenmode. The $Fr = 2$ wake shows layering in the wake core\nat {$Nt > 15$} which is captured by the leading SPOD eigenmodes of the VS\nfrequency at downstream locations $x/D > 30$. The VS mode of the $Fr = 2$ wake\nis streamwise-coherent, consisting of V-shaped structures at $x/D \\gtrsim 30$.\nOverall, we find that the coherence of wakes, initiated by the VS mode at the\nbody, is prolonged by buoyancy to far downstream.

In meta-RL, the specification (such as reward\nfunction) of current task is hidden from the agent. In addition, states are\nhidden within each task owing to sensor noise or limitations in realistic\nenvironments. Therefore, the meta-RL agent faces the challenge of specifying\nboth the hidden task and states based on small amount of experience. To address\nthis, we propose estimating disentangled belief about task and states,\nleveraging an inductive bias that the task and states can be regarded as global\nand local features of each task. Specifically, we train a hierarchical\nstate-space model (HSSM) parameterized by deep neural networks as an\nenvironment model, whose global and local latent variables correspond to task\nand states, respectively. Because the HSSM does not allow analytical\ncomputation of posterior distribution, i.e., belief, we employ amortized\ninference to approximate it. After the belief is obtained, we can augment\nobservations of a model-free policy with the belief to efficiently train the\npolicy. Moreover, because task and state information are factorized and\ninterpretable, the downstream policy training is facilitated compared with the\nprior methods that did not consider the hierarchical nature. Empirical\nvalidations on a GridWorld environment confirm that the HSSM can separate the\nhidden task and states information. Then, we compare the meta-RL agent with the\nHSSM to prior meta-RL methods in MuJoCo environments, and confirm that our\nagent requires less training data and reaches higher final performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 06:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-17"}

The frequency of the OsC modes that excite envelope $g$-modes is\napproximately given by $\\sigma\\sim |m\\Omega_c|$ in the inertial frame and hence\n$\\sigma_{m=-2}\\approx2\\sigma_{m=-1}$ where $m$ is the azimuthal wavenumber of\nthe modes and $\\Omega_c$ is the rotation frequency of the core. We find that\nthe modal properties of OsC modes do not strongly depend on the mass of the\nstars.\n  We discuss angular momentum transport by OsC modes in resonance with envelope\n$g$-modes in the main sequence stars. We suggest that angular momentum transfer\ntakes place from the core to the envelope and that the OsC modes may help the\nstars rotate uniformly and keep the rotation frequency of the core low during\ntheir evolution as main sequence stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 06:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

The decrease of the integrated magnetic\ntension force (above the location of the overlying reconnection) is due to the\nremoval of overlying confinement by the enhanced overlying reconnection between\nthe MFR and the overlying fields at the apex HFT, thus engines the slow rise of\nthe MFR with a nearly constant velocity. Once the MFR reaches the regime of\ntorus instability, another HFT immediately forms at the dip region under the\nMFR, followed by the explosive flare reconnection. The integrated resultant\nforce (above the location of the flare reconnection) exponentially increases,\nwhich drives the exponential fast rise of the MFR. The system enters the\npropagation phase, once its apex reaches the height of about one solar radius\nabove the photosphere. The simulation reproduces the main processes of one\ngroup of prominence eruptions especially those occurring on the quiet Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 07:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Recently, modeling skeletons as\nspatio-temporal graphs with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) has been\nreported to solidly advance the state-of-the-art performance. However,\nGCN-based approaches exclusively learn from raw skeleton data, and are expected\nto extract the inherent structural information on their own. This paper\ndescribes REGINA, introducing a novel way to REasoning Graph convolutional\nnetworks IN Human Action recognition. The rationale is to provide to the GCNs\nadditional knowledge about the skeleton data, obtained by handcrafted features,\nin order to facilitate the learning process, while guaranteeing that it remains\nfully trainable in an end-to-end manner. The challenge is to capture\ncomplementary information over the dynamics between consecutive frames, which\nis the key information extracted by state-of-the-art GCN techniques.

The approach works by tracking control and data\ndependencies, and propagating changes through the dependencies when making an\nupdate. Extensively studied in the sequential setting, some results on parallel\nself-adjusting computation exist, but are either only applicable to limited\nclasses of computations, such as map-reduce, or are ad-hoc systems with no\ntheoretical analysis of their performance.\n  In this paper, we present the first system for parallel self-adjusting\ncomputation that applies to a wide class of nested parallel algorithms and\nprovides theoretical bounds on the work and span of the resulting dynamic\nalgorithms. As with bounds in the sequential setting, our bounds relate a\n\"distance\" measure between computations on different inputs to the cost of\npropagating an update. However, here we also consider parallelism in the\npropagation cost. The main innovation in the paper is in using Series-Parallel\ntrees (SP trees) to track sequential and parallel control dependencies to allow\npropagation of changes to be applied safely in parallel.

The flexoelectric coupling increases significantly the\namplitude of a small out-of-plane polarization component in the stripe domains,\nand the \"up\" or \"down\" direction of the component is defined by the sign of the\nflexoelectric coefficients.Concerning the vortex-antivortex pairs, their\nantivortices with in-plane anti-circulation have smooth wide dipolar cores\nthrough the entire film, whose shape and other features are almost insensitive\nto the coupling.The vortices with in-plane vorticity have spike-like cores with\nan out-of-plane quadrupolar moment induced by the flexoelectric coupling.

While traditional approaches are largely\ntransductive, recent graph neural networks (GNNs) integrate node features with\nnetwork structures, thus enabling inductive node classification models that can\nbe applied to new nodes or even new graphs in the same feature space. However,\ninter-graph differences still exist across graphs within the same domain. Thus,\ntraining just one global model (e.g., a state-of-the-art GNN) to handle all new\ngraphs, whilst ignoring the inter-graph differences, can lead to suboptimal\nperformance.\n  In this paper, we study the problem of inductive node classification across\ngraphs. Unlike existing one-model-fits-all approaches, we propose a novel\nmeta-inductive framework called MI-GNN to customize the inductive model to each\ngraph under a meta-learning paradigm. That is, MI-GNN does not directly learn\nan inductive model; it learns the general knowledge of how to train a model for\nsemi-supervised node classification on new graphs. To cope with the differences\nacross graphs, MI-GNN employs a dual adaptation mechanism at both the graph and\ntask levels. More specifically, we learn a graph prior to adapt for the\ngraph-level differences, and a task prior to adapt for the task-level\ndifferences conditioned on a graph. Extensive experiments on five real-world\ngraph collections demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 09:16:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 14:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Thus our results support the idea that\nlarge scale polarization alignments could originate from coherent alignments of\nAGN axes.

Interpretable and computationally efficient Galerkin models\ncan be thus obtained, since a reduced number of triadic interactions needs to\nbe computed to evaluate the right hand side of the model. To find the basis\nfunctions, a subspace rotation technique is used, whereby a set of Proper\nOrthogonal Decomposition (POD) modes is rotated into a POD subspace of larger\ndimension using coordinates associated to low-energy dissipative scales to\nalter energy paths and the structure of the triadic interaction coefficient\ntensor. This rotation is obtained as the solution of a non-convex optimisation\nproblem that maximises the energy captured by the new basis, promotes sparsity\nand ensures long-term temporal stability of the sparse Galerkin system.

Generalizing an observation of Fried, for all\ndiscrete countable monoids M, we show that M-subshift/SFT systems are precisely\nthe expansive dynamical M-systems, where S_1/S_2 denotes the class of systems\nobtained by quotienting subshifts in S_1 by (relative) subshifts in S_2.

The NMR peak corresponding to the adsorbed\nspecies shows a clear change of chemical shift as the applied potential\ndifference is varied. This variation in chemical shift is thought to originate\nfrom a combination of ion reorganisation in the pores and changes in ring\ncurrent shifts due to the changes of electronic density in the carbon. While\nprevious Density Functional Theory calculations suggested that the electronic\ndensity has a large effect, the relative contributions of these two effects is\nchallenging to untangle.

In this scenario, fluctuations of\nradiations are generated by an energy exchange between axions and radiations,\nwhich results in the correlation between the primordial axion fluctuations and\nthe CMB anisotropies. Consequently, the cosmological observations stringently\nconstrain a model of the axion and the early history of the universe. In\nparticular, we need a large energy fraction $\\Omega_A^{}$ of the axion at the\nQCD phase transition, but it must become tiny at the present universe to\nsuppress the isocurvature power spectrum. One of natural cosmological scenarios\nto realize such a situation is the thermal inflation which can sufficiently\ndilute the axion abundance. Thermal inflation occurs in various models. In this\npaper, we focus on a classically conformal (CC) $B$-$L$ model with a QCD axion.\nIn this model, the early universe undergoes a long supercooling era of the\n$B$-$L$ and electroweak symmetries, and thermal inflation naturally occurs.\nThus it can be a good candidate for the axion-CMB scenario. But the axion\nabundance at the QCD transition is shown to be insufficient in the original CC\n$B$-$L$ model. To overcome the situation, we extend the model by introducing\n$N$ scalar fields $S$ (either massive or massless) and consider a novel\ncosmological history such that the $O(N)$ and the $B$-$L$ sectors evolve almost\nseparately in the early universe.

Recent\nadvances in quantum information processing have elucidated the potential for\nquantum simulators to exhibit memory advantages for such tasks. Heretofore, the\nfocus has been on lossless memory compression, wherein the advantage is\ntypically in terms of lessening the amount of information tracked by the model,\nwhile -- arguably more practical -- reductions in memory dimension are not\nalways possible. Here we address the case of lossy compression for quantum\nstochastic modelling of continuous-time processes, introducing a method for\ncoarse-graining in quantum state space that drastically reduces the requisite\nmemory dimension for modelling temporal dynamics whilst retaining near-exact\nstatistics. In contrast to classical coarse-graining, this compression is not\nbased on sacrificing temporal resolution, and brings memory-efficient,\nhigh-fidelity stochastic modelling within reach of present quantum\ntechnologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 13:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 11:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

Ideal forecasts of a future event behave as\nmartingales, sequen- tially updating the forecast to leverage the available\ninformation as the future event approaches. The threshold martingale introduced\nhere measures the proportion of the forecast distribution lying below a\nthreshold. In addition to being calibrated, a threshold martingale has\nquadratic variation that accumulates to a total determined by a quantile of the\ninitial forecast distribution. Deviations from calibration or to- tal\nvolatility signal problems in the underlying model. Calibration adjustments are\nwell-known, and we augment these by introducing a martingale filter that\nimproves volatility while guaranteeing smaller mean squared error. Thus,\npost-processing can rectify problems with calibration and volatility without\nrevisiting the original forecast- ing model. We apply threshold martingales\nfirst to forecasts from simulated models and then to models that predict the\nwinner in professional basketball games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 13:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-17"}

The test suite includes 1) tests written\nfor the target package and usually hosted in its development repository, and 2)\ntests selected from dependent packages. The former tests allow assessing the\ncode coverage of the target package, while the latter ones can increase code\ncoverage by exploiting third-party tests that also exercise code in the target\npackage. We use TESA to assess the code coverage of 500 popular npm packages.\nThen, we demonstrate that TESA can significantly increase code coverage by\nincluding tests from dependent packages. Finally, we show that the test suites\nassembled by TESA increase the effectiveness of existing dynamic program\nanalyses to identify performance issues that are not detectable when only\nexecuting the developer's tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 14:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-17"}

Building upon these models, we study the\ninterplay between the structure of academic collaborations, academic\nperformance, and academic mobility at different career stages. We take into\naccount both purely academic mobility (i.e., the number of affiliation changes)\nand geographical mobility (i.e., physical relocations to different countries).\nFor our investigation, we rely on a dataset comprising the geo-referenced\npublications of a group of 81,500 authors extracted from Scopus, one of the\nbiggest repositories of academic knowledge. Our main finding is that there is a\nclear correlation between the structure of co-authorship ego networks and\nacademic performance indices: the more one publishes and the higher their\nimpact, the larger their collaboration network. However, we observe a capacity\nbound effect, whereby, beyond a certain point, higher performances become\nincreasingly less correlated with large collaboration networks. We also find\nthat international academic migrants are better at growing their networks than\nresearchers that only migrate within the same country, but the latter seem to\nbe better in exploiting their collaboration to achieve higher impact.

As\nthis is infeasible for certain populations, an objective measure of speech\nintelligibility is required. Recently, brain imaging data has been used to\nestablish a relationship between stimulus and brain response. Linear models\nhave been successfully linked to speech intelligibility but require per-subject\ntraining. We present a deep-learning-based model incorporating dilated\nconvolutions that operates in a match/mismatch paradigm. The accuracy of the\nmodel's match/mismatch predictions can be used as a proxy for speech\nintelligibility without subject-specific (re)training. Approach: We evaluated\nthe performance of the model as a function of input segment length, EEG\nfrequency band and receptive field size while comparing it to multiple baseline\nmodels. Next, we evaluated performance on held-out data and finetuning.\nFinally, we established a link between the accuracy of our model and the\nstate-of-the-art behavioral MATRIX test. Main results: The dilated\nconvolutional model significantly outperformed the baseline models for every\ninput segment length, for all EEG frequency bands except the delta and theta\nband, and receptive field sizes between 250 and 500 ms. Additionally,\nfinetuning significantly increased the accuracy on a held-out dataset. Finally,\na significant correlation (r=0.59, p=0.0154) was found between the speech\nreception threshold estimated using the behavioral MATRIX test and our\nobjective method. Significance: Our method is the first to predict the speech\nreception threshold from EEG for unseen subjects, contributing to objective\nmeasures of speech intelligibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 14:12:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 11:20:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 16:34:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 16:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

This two-step solution involves two independently trained\nmodels, which may not be well compatible with each other. A small estimation\nerror of the first step could cause a severe performance drop of the second\none. While on the other hand, the first step can only utilize limited\ninformation from the LR image, which makes it difficult to predict a highly\naccurate blur kernel. Towards these issues, instead of considering these two\nsteps separately, we adopt an alternating optimization algorithm, which can\nestimate the blur kernel and restore the SR image in a single model.\nSpecifically, we design two convolutional neural modules, namely\n\\textit{Restorer} and \\textit{Estimator}. \\textit{Restorer} restores the SR\nimage based on the predicted kernel, and \\textit{Estimator} estimates the blur\nkernel with the help of the restored SR image. We alternate these two modules\nrepeatedly and unfold this process to form an end-to-end trainable network. In\nthis way, \\textit{Estimator} utilizes information from both LR and SR images,\nwhich makes the estimation of the blur kernel easier.

Breakdown energy is observed to scale with slip,\nwhich is often attributed to enhanced fault weakening with continued slip or at\nhigh slip rates, possibly caused by flash heating and thermal pressurization.\nHowever, breakdown energy varies by more than six orders of magnitude, which is\nphysically irreconcilable with prevailing material properties. We present a\ndynamic model that demonstrates that breakdown energy scaling can occur despite\nconstant fracture energy and does not require thermal pressurization or other\nenhanced weakening. Instead, earthquake breakdown energy scaling occurs simply\ndue to scale-invariant stress drop overshoot, which is affected more directly\nby the overall rupture mode -- crack-like or pulse-like -- rather than from a\nspecific slip-weakening relationship. Our findings suggest that breakdown\nenergy may be used to discern crack-like earthquakes from self-healing pulses\nwith negative breakdown energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 15:28:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

Compared to other types of malicious cyber attacks, DoS and DDoS\nattacks are particularly more challenging to combat. With their ability to mask\nthemselves as legitimate traffic, developing methods to detect these types of\nattacks on a packet or flow level, has proven to be a difficult task. In this\npaper, we explore the potential of Variational Autoencoders to serve as a\ncomponent within an intelligent security solution that differentiates between\nnormal and malicious traffic. Two methods based on the ability of Variational\nAutoencoders to learn latent representations from network traffic flows are\nproposed. The first method resorts to a classifier based on the latent\nencodings obtained from Variational Autoencoders learned from traffic traces.\nThe second method is rather an anomaly detection method where the Variational\nAutoencoder is used to learn the abstract feature representations of\nexclusively legitimate traffic. Then anomalies are filtered out by relying on\nthe reconstruction loss of the Variational Autoencoder.\n  Both of the proposed methods have been thoroughly tested on two separate\ndatasets with a similar feature space. The results show that both methods are\npromising, with a slight superiority of the classifier based method over the\nanomaly based one.\n  %that the first method is able to successfully detect individual traffic\nflows with high precision on the training and validation data, slightly less\nsuccessfully on the test data.

Deep generative models, such as variational\nautoencoders (VAEs), are a popular approach for creating such synthetic\ndatasets from original data. Despite the success of VAEs, there are limitations\nwhen it comes to the bimodal and skewed marginal distributions. These deviate\nfrom the unimodal symmetric distributions that are encouraged by the normality\nassumption typically used for the latent representations in VAEs. While there\nare extensions that assume other distributions for the latent space, this does\nnot generally increase flexibility for data with many different distributions.\nTherefore, we propose a novel method, pre-transformation variational\nautoencoders (PTVAEs), to specifically address bimodal and skewed data, by\nemploying pre-transformations at the level of original variables. Two types of\ntransformations are used to bring the data close to a normal distribution by a\nseparate parameter optimization for each variable in a dataset. We compare the\nperformance of our method with other state-of-the-art methods for synthetic\ndata generation. In addition to the visual comparison, we use a utility\nmeasurement for a quantitative evaluation. The results show that the PTVAE\napproach can outperform others in both bimodal and skewed data generation.\nFurthermore, the simplicity of the approach makes it usable in combination with\nother extensions of VAE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 15:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-17"}

At a technical level, the problem\narises from the fact that there is a no distributive law between the powerset\nmonad and the distribution monad - as noticed some twenty years ago by Plotkin.\nMore recently, it has become clear that there is a distributive law of the\nmultiset monad over the distribution monad. This article elaborates the details\nof this distributivity and shows that there is a rich underlying theory\nrelating multisets and probability distributions. It is shown that the new\ndistributive law, called parallel multinomial law, can be defined in (at least)\nfour equivalent ways. It involves putting multinomial distributions in parallel\nand commutes with hypergeometric distributions. Further, it is shown that this\ndistributive law commutes with a new form of zipping for multisets. Abstractly,\nthis can be described in terms of monoidal structure for a fixed-size multiset\nfunctor, when lifted to the Kleisli category of the distribution monad.\nConcretely, an application of the theory to sampling semantics is included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 15:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-17"}

The number of degrees of freedom of a conventional mechanism, also\ncalled mobility, is the number of independent coordinates needed to define a\nconfiguration of the mechanism. Due to the different operating principle, such\ndefinition of degree of freedom or mobility cannot be directly applied to\ncompliant mechanisms. While those terms are not able to denote a property of a\ngiven compliant mechanism, they are meaningful when applied to the design of a\ncompliant mechanism. Compliant mechanisms are, however, mostly seen as elastic\nstructures, for which the term degree of freedom is used in a different\nmeaning. In order to avoid ambiguities, the term pseudo-mobility (already\nintroduced in previous published work) will be used to denote the number of\nscalar parameters needed to identify one single desired deformation, i.e. one\nsingle deformation for which the compliant mechanism is designed. Many\nsynthesis approaches exist for compliant mechanisms with single pseudo-mobility\n(commonly referred to as \"single degree of freedom mechanisms\"). In the case of\ncompliant mechanisms with multiple pseudo-mobility (multiple-degree of freedom\nmechanisms), only synthesis approaches for relatively simple mechanisms exist\nso far, while systems for more complex tasks like shape adaptation are not\ncovered. In addition, only certain cases of transverse loads are included in\nthe synthesis with these approaches. In this paper, a novel optimization\nalgorithm is presented that addresses these two shortcomings. The algorithm is\ntested on a simple mechanism with one translation and one rotation kinematic\ndegree of freedom, a compliant parallel mechanism for pure translation and a\nshape-adaptive structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 10:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

Spectrotemporal features in signals are conventionally estimated using\nshort-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transform (WT). However, both\nmethods may not offer the most robust or compact representation despite their\nwidespread use in biomedical contexts. The presented method, DASAR, improves\nprecise frequency identification and tracking of interpretable frequency\ncomponents with a parsimonious set of parameters. DASAR achieves these\ncharacteristics by assuming that the biomedical time-varying spectrum comprises\nseveral independent stochastic oscillators with (piecewise) time-varying\nfrequencies. Local stationarity can be assumed within dyadic subdivisions of\nthe recordings, while the stochastic oscillators can be modeled with an\naggregation of second-order autoregressive models (ASAR). DASAR can provide a\nmore accurate representation of the (highly contrasted) EEG and fNIRS frequency\nranges by increasing the estimation accuracy in user-defined spectrum region of\ninterest (SROI). A mental arithmetic experiment on a hybrid EEG-fNIRS was\nconducted to assess the efficiency of the method. Our proposed technique, STFT,\nand WT were applied on both biomedical signals to discover potential\noscillators that improve the discrimination between the task condition and its\nbaseline. The results show that DASAR provided the highest spectrum\ndifferentiation and it was the only method that could identify Mayer waves as\nnarrow-band artifacts at 97.4-97.5 mHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 16:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

The antenna comprises of a L-shaped element which is coupled with a\nground shorted parasitic resonator to generate three resonant modes for\ntri-band operation. The L-shaped element which is placed on top of the\nsubstrate is fed by a 50$\\Omega$ microstrip feed line and is responsible for\nthe generation of a wide band at 5.5 GHz. The parasitic resonator is placed on\nthe other side of the substrate and is directly connected to the ground plane.\nThe presence of the parasitic resonator gives rise to two additional resonant\nbands at 2.3 GHz and 3.5 GHz. Thus, together the two elements generate three\nresonant bands to cover WLAN, WiMAX and Bluetooth bands of operation. A\nthorough parametric study has been performed on the antenna and it has been\nfound that the three bands can be tuned by varying certain dimensions of the\nantenna. Hence, the same design can be used for frequencies in adjacent bands\nas well with minor changes in its dimensions.
