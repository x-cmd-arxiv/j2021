Therefore, estimating the AR model parameters (ARPs) of a\nreference reverberation is a crucial task. Although a few recent\ndeep-learning-based approaches have shown promising performance, their\nnon-end-to-end training scheme prevents them from fully exploiting the\npotential of deep neural networks. This motivates the introduction of\ndifferentiable artificial reverberation (DAR) models, allowing loss gradients\nto be back-propagated end-to-end. However, implementing the AR models with\ntheir difference equations \"as is\" in the deep learning framework severely\nbottlenecks the training speed when executed with a parallel processor like GPU\ndue to their infinite impulse response (IIR) components. We tackle this problem\nby replacing the IIR filters with finite impulse response (FIR) approximations\nwith the frequency-sampling method. Using this technique, we implement three\nDAR models -- differentiable Filtered Velvet Noise (FVN), Advanced Filtered\nVelvet Noise (AFVN), and Delay Network (DN). For each AR model, we train its\nARP estimation networks for analysis-synthesis (RIR-to-ARP) and blind\nestimation (reverberant-speech-to-ARP) task in an end-to-end manner with its\nDAR model counterpart.

We compare\nthe X-ray-burst models with the burst parameters of a clocked burster\nassociated with GS 1826-24. We find a monotonic correlation between the NS\nradius and the light-curve profile. A larger radius shows a higher recurrence\ntime and a large peak luminosity. In contrast, the dependence of light curves\non the NS mass becomes more complicated, where the neutrino cooling suppresses\nthe efficiency of nuclear ignition. We also constrain the EOS and mass of GS\n1826-24, i.e., stiffer EOSs, corresponding to larger NS radii, are not\npreferred due to too-high peak luminosity. The EOS and the cooling and heating\nof NSs are important to discuss the theoretical and observational properties of\nX-ray bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 16:27:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 12:30:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 06:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

We take into account the nonlinearities of the EH\nprocess and derive closed-form analytical expressions for the harvested direct\ncurrent (DC) under a generalized Nakagami-m block fading model. We show that,\nin this framework, both the peak-to-average-power-ratio of the received signal\nand the harvested DC, depend on the parameters of the transmitted waveform.\nFurthermore, we investigate the case of deterministic unmodulated chaotic\nwaveforms and demonstrate that, in the absence of a correlator, modulation does\nnot affect the achieved harvested DC. On the other hand, it is shown that for\nscenarios with a correlator-aided receiver, DCSK significantly outperforms the\nunmodulated case. Based on this observation, we propose a novel DCSK-based\nsignal design, which further enhances the WPT capability of the proposed\narchitecture; corresponding analytical expressions for the harvested DC are\nalso derived. Our results demonstrate that the proposed architecture and the\nassociated signal design, can achieve significant EH gains in DCSK-based WPT\nsystems.

Traditional model reduction methods\ndecompose the field into a set of modes with fixed spatial support but\ntime-varying amplitudes. However, this fixed basis cannot resolve the mean flow\ndeformation due to variable Reynolds stresses, a central feature of Stuart's\nnonlinear stability mechanism, without the further assumption of weakly\nnonlinear interactions. Here, we introduce a parametric modal basis that\ndepends on the instantaneous value of the unsteady aerodynamic center of\npressure, which quantifies the degree to which the rotational symmetry of the\nwake is broken. Thus, the modes naturally interpolate between the unstable\nsymmetric state and the nonlinear equilibrium. We estimate the modes from\nexperimental measurements of the base pressure distribution by reducing the\nsymmetry via phase alignment and averaging conditioned on the center of\npressure. The amplitude dependence of the symmetric mode deviates significantly\nfrom the polynomial scaling predicted by weakly nonlinear analysis, confirming\nthat the parametric basis is crucial for capturing the effect of strongly\nnonlinear interactions. We also introduce a second model term capturing\naxisymmetric fluctuations associated with the mean-field deformation. We then\napply the Langevin regression system identification method to construct a\nstochastically forced nonlinear model for these two generalized mode\ncoefficients.

Our dataset contains 981\nmanually-generated tables and an auto-generated dataset of 1980 tables\nproviding over 180K statement and over 16M evidence annotations. SEM-TAB-FACTS\nfeatured two sub-tasks. In sub-task A, the goal was to determine if a statement\nis supported, refuted or unknown in relation to a table. In sub-task B, the\nfocus was on identifying the specific cells of a table that provide evidence\nfor the statement. 69 teams signed up to participate in the task with 19\nsuccessful submissions to subtask A and 12 successful submissions to subtask B.\nWe present our results and main findings from the competition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 17:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

It\nis known that Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs govern the solution of such optimization\nproblems when the noise model is additive. In this work, we address certain\nnon-additive noise models and show that they are also related to\nHamilton-Jacobi PDEs. These findings allow us to establish new connections\nbetween additive and non-additive noise imaging models. Specifically, we study\nhow the solutions to these optimization problems depend on the parameters and\nthe observed images. We show that the optimal values are ruled by some\nHamilton-Jacobi PDEs, while the optimizers are characterized by the spatial\ngradient of the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs. Moreover, we use these\nrelations to investigate the asymptotic behavior of the variational model as\nthe parameter goes to infinity, that is, when the influence of the noise\nvanishes. With these connections, some non-convex models for non-additive noise\ncan be solved by applying convex optimization algorithms to the equivalent\nconvex models for additive noise. Several numerical results are provided for\ndenoising problems with Poisson noise or multiplicative noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 17:21:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 19:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

We are using our large and highly complete\nCLASSIX survey of X-ray luminous galaxy clusters detected in the ROSAT All Sky\nSurvey to trace the matter distribution in the local Universe and to explore\nthe size of the flattened local density structure associated with the Local\nSupercluster. The Local Supercluster is oriented almost perpendicular to the\nGalactic plane. Since Galactic extinction increases towards the Galactic plane,\nobjects are on average more easily visible perpendicular to the plane than\nclose to it, also producing an apparent concentration of objects along the\nLocal Supercluster. We can correct for this bias by a careful treatment of the\nsurvey selection function. We find a significant overdensity of clusters in a\nflattened structure along the Supergalactic plane with a thickness of about 50\nMpc and an extent of about 100 Mpc radius. Structures at a distance larger than\n100 Mpc are not correlated to the Local Supercluster any more. The matter\ndensity contrast of the local superstructure to the surroundings is about a\nfactor of 1.3 - 2.3. Within the Supergalactic plane the matter is concentrated\nmostly in two superclusters, the Perseus-Pisces Chain and Hydra-Centaurus\nsupercluster. We have shown in our earlier work that the local Universe in a\nregion with a radius of 100 - 170 Mpc has a lower density than the cosmic mean.\nFor this reason, the Local Supercluster is not overdense with respect to the\ncosmic mean density. Therefore this local superstructure will not collapse as a\nwhole in the future, but rather fragment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 17:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Such physical\ncharacteristics have played an essential role in security and other related\nareas. However, presentation attacks, also known as spoofing techniques, can\nbypass biometric authentication systems using artefacts such as printed images,\nartificial eyes, textured contact lenses, etc. Many liveness detection methods\nthat improve the security of these systems have been proposed. The first\nInternational Iris Liveness Detection competition, where the effectiveness of\nliveness detection methods is evaluated, was first launched in 2013, and its\nlatest iteration was held in 2020. This paper proposes a serial architecture\nbased on a MobileNetV2 modification, trained from scratch to classify bona fide\niris images versus presentation attack images. The bona fide class consists of\nlive iris images, whereas the attack presentation instrument classes are\ncomprised of cadaver, printed, and contact lenses images, for a total of four\nscenarios. All the images were pre-processed and weighted per class to present\na fair evaluation. This proposal won the LivDet-Iris 2020 competition using\ntwo-class scenarios. Additionally, we present new three-class and four-class\nscenarios that further improve the competition results. This approach is\nprimarily focused in detecting the bona fide class over improving the detection\nof presentation attack instruments. For the two, three, and four classes\nscenarios, an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 4.04\\%, 0.33\\%, and 4,53\\% was obtained\nrespectively. Overall, the best serial model proposed, using three scenarios,\nreached an ERR of 0.33\\% with an Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate\n(APCER) of 0.0100 and a Bona Fide Classification Error Rate (BPCER) of 0.000.\nThis work outperforms the LivDet-Iris 2020 competition results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 17:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

Firstly, the conservative\nand non-conservative sectors of the dynamics can be governed by incompatible\nfree energies; when both sectors are present, this is the leading-order TRS\nviolation, captured in its simplest form by 'Model AB'. Second, the diffusive\ndynamics can break TRS in its own right. This happens only at higher order in\nthe gradient expansion (but is the leading behaviour without reactions present)\nand is captured by 'Active Model B+' (AMB+). Each of the two mechanisms can\nlead to microphase separation, by quite different routes. Here we introduce\nModel AB+, for which both mechanisms are simultaneously present, and show that\nfor slow reaction rates the system can undergo a new type of hierarchical\nmicrophase separation, whereby a continuous phase of fluid 1 contains large\ndroplets of fluid 2 within which small droplets of fluid 1 are continuously\ncreated and then absorbed into the surrounding fluid-1 phase.

Through a\ncombination of microscale structure-function experiments and modeling, we\ndevelop a rigidity percolation framework to explain the structural origins of\ncartilage shear mechanics. This framework provides a new quantitative\nunderstanding for how the known degradative events in osteoarthritis determine\nthe mechanical changes that are a hallmark of this disease. As such, this work\nprovides a road map for understanding disease progression and in combination\nwith non-invasive techniques such as MRI will enable more effective diagnosis\nand treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 17:51:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

We prove that the new framework is still globally convergent for\nsolving the SDP. To solve the iPGM subproblem of projecting a given point onto\nthe feasible set of the SDP, we design a two-phase algorithm with phase one\nusing a symmetric Gauss-Seidel based accelerated proximal gradient method\n(sGS-APG) to generate a good initial point, and phase two using a modified\nlimited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) method to obtain an accurate solution.

Agents with common memory architectures\nstruggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or\neven to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor\ntasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention\nMemory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores\nmemories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing\nhigh-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing\ndetailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can\ntherefore \"mentally time-travel\" -- remember past events in detail without\nattending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM\nsubstantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks\nrequiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include\nrecalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to\nnavigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining\nnew object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much\nlonger than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a\nmeta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves\nagent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that\npreviously required specialized architectures).

Generalization is definitely important in applications\nwhere the possible test inputs are known but plentiful or simply unknown, but\nthere are also cases where the possible inputs are few and unlabeled but known\nbeforehand.

One\nway for this heating to occur is through generation of a turbulent cascade by\njet-inflated bubbles. Measurements of the X-ray intensity power spectra show\nevidence of this cascade in different regions of the cluster, constraining the\nrole of driving mechanisms. We analyze feedback simulations of the Perseus\ncluster to constrain the effect of the jet activity on the intensity\nfluctuations and kinematics of the cluster atmosphere. We find that, within the\ninner 60 kiloparsecs, the power spectra of the predicted surface brightness\nfluctuations are broadly consistent with those measured by Chandra and that\neven a single episode of jet activity can generate a long-lasting imprint on\nthe intensity fluctuations in the innermost region of the cluster. AGN-driven\nmotions within the same region approach the values reported by Hitomi during\nand right after the AGN episode. However, the line-of-sight velocity dispersion\nexcited by the jet in simulations underpredicts the Hitomi measurement. This\nindicates that driving a volume-filling sustained level of turbulence requires\nseveral episodes of jet activity, and/or additional processes drive turbulence\noutside the 60-kpc sphere. This also suggests that sharp edges of the bubbles\nin the innermost region of the cluster contribute substantially to the\nintensity of fluctuations, consistent with the Perseus observations in the\ninner 30-kpc region.

With the\nrapid development of these services in the last two decades, users have\naccumulated a massive amount of behavior data. Richer sequential behavior data\nhas been proven to be of great value for sequential recommendation. However,\ntraditional sequential models fail to handle users' lifelong sequences, as\ntheir linear computational and storage cost prohibits them from performing\nonline inference. Recently, lifelong sequential modeling methods that borrow\nthe idea of memory networks from NLP are proposed to address this issue.\nHowever, the RNN-based memory networks built upon intrinsically suffer from the\ninability to capture long-term dependencies and may instead be overwhelmed by\nthe noise on extremely long behavior sequences. In addition, as the user's\nbehavior sequence gets longer, more interests would be demonstrated in it. It\nis therefore crucial to model and capture the diverse interests of users. In\norder to tackle these issues, we propose a novel lifelong incremental\nmulti-interest self attention based sequential recommendation model, namely\nLimaRec. Our proposed method benefits from the carefully designed\nself-attention to identify relevant information from users' behavior sequences\nwith different interests. It is still able to incrementally update users'\nrepresentations for online inference, similarly to memory network based\napproaches.

We remove this\nassumption by developing an algorithm for IRL in partially observable Markov\ndecision processes (POMDPs). The algorithm addresses several limitations of\nexisting techniques that do not take the information asymmetry between the\nexpert and the learner into account. First, it adopts causal entropy as the\nmeasure of the likelihood of the expert demonstrations as opposed to entropy in\nmost existing IRL techniques, and avoids a common source of algorithmic\ncomplexity. Second, it incorporates task specifications expressed in temporal\nlogic into IRL. Such specifications may be interpreted as side information\navailable to the learner a priori in addition to the demonstrations and may\nreduce the information asymmetry. Nevertheless, the resulting formulation is\nstill nonconvex due to the intrinsic nonconvexity of the so-called forward\nproblem, i.e., computing an optimal policy given a reward function, in POMDPs.\nWe address this nonconvexity through sequential convex programming and\nintroduce several extensions to solve the forward problem in a scalable manner.\nThis scalability allows computing policies that incorporate memory at the\nexpense of added computational cost yet also outperform memoryless policies.

We\npresent two adversarial attack vectors that more accurately reflect the label\nnoise that may be encountered in real-world settings, and demonstrate that\nunder our multimodal noisy labels model, state-of-the-art approaches for\nlearning from noisy labels are defeated by adversarial label attacks. Finally,\nwe propose a multi-stage, labeler-aware, model-agnostic framework that reliably\nfilters noisy labels by leveraging knowledge about which data partitions were\nlabeled by which labeler, and show that our proposed framework remains robust\neven in the presence of extreme adversarial label noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 19:58:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2021 01:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

AADI is not an anchor-free method, instead, it can convert the\nscale and aspect ratio of anchors from a continuous space to a discrete space,\nwhich greatly alleviates the problem of anchors' designation.

In active materials, non-linear dynamics and long-range interactions\nbetween particles prohibit closed-form descriptions of the system's dynamics\nand prevent explicit solutions to optimal control problems. Due to fundamental\nchallenges in solving for explicit control strategies, RL has emerged as an\napproach to derive control strategies for far-from-equilibrium active matter\nsystems. However, an important open question is how the mathematical structure\nand the physical properties of the active matter systems determine the\ntractability of RL for learning control policies. In this work, we show that RL\ncan only find good strategies to the canonical active matter task of mixing for\nsystems that combine attractive and repulsive particle interactions. Using\nmathematical results from dynamical systems theory, we relate the availability\nof both interaction types with the existence of hyperbolic dynamics and the\nability of RL to find homogeneous mixing strategies.

In this paper,\nwe formulate a logical truth which we call the productivity principle. Bertrand\nRusell was the first one to formulate this principle, but in a restricted form\nand with a different purpose. The principle explicates a logical mechanism that\nlies behind paradoxical multitudes and is understandable as well as any simple\nlogical truth. However, it does not explain the concept of set. It only sets\nlogical bounds of the concept within the framework of the classical two-valued\n$\\in$ - language. The principle behaves as a logical regulator of any theory we\nformulate to explain and describe sets. It provides tools to identify\nparadoxical classes inside the theory. We show how the known paradoxical\nclasses follow from the productivity principle and how the principle gives us a\nuniform way to generate new paradoxical classes. In the case of $ZFC$ set\ntheory, the productivity principle shows that the limitation of size principles\nare of a restrictive nature and that they do not explain which classes are\nsets. The productivity principle, as a logical regulator, can have a definite\nheuristic role in the development of a consistent set theory.

Recently proposed mask estimation algorithms leverage machine\nlearning approaches to distinguish between target speech and reverberant\nreflections. However, the spectro-temporal structure of speech is highly\nvariable and dependent on the underlying phoneme. One way to potentially\novercome this variability is to leverage explicit knowledge of phonemic\ninformation during mask estimation. This study proposes a phoneme-based mask\nestimation algorithm, where separate mask estimation models are trained for\neach phoneme. Sentence recognition tests were conducted in normal hearing\nlisteners to determine whether a phoneme-based mask estimation algorithm is\nbeneficial in the ideal scenario where perfect knowledge of the phoneme is\navailable.

Previous\nworks on SFDA mainly focus on aligning the cross-domain distributions. However,\nthey ignore the generalization ability of the pretrained source model, which\nlargely influences the initial target outputs that are vital to the target\nadaptation stage. To address this, we make the interesting observation that the\nmodel accuracy is highly correlated with whether or not attention is focused on\nthe objects in an image. To this end, we propose a generic and effective\nframework based on Transformer, named TransDA, for learning a generalized model\nfor SFDA. Specifically, we apply the Transformer as the attention module and\ninject it into a convolutional network. By doing so, the model is encouraged to\nturn attention towards the object regions, which can effectively improve the\nmodel's generalization ability on the target domains. Moreover, a novel\nself-supervised knowledge distillation approach is proposed to adapt the\nTransformer with target pseudo-labels, thus further encouraging the network to\nfocus on the object regions. Experiments on three domain adaptation tasks,\nincluding closed-set, partial-set, and open-set adaption, demonstrate that\nTransDA can greatly improve the adaptation accuracy and produce\nstate-of-the-art results.

Here,\nwe focus on our in-house analysis of the outermost planet, for which the\nstarshade's higher throughput and lower noise floor present a factor of ~4\nimprovement in signal-to-noise ratio over the narrow-field HLC. We find that,\nalthough the RV detection was marginal, the precursor RV data enable the mass\nand orbit to be constrained with only 2 epochs of starshade imaging. Including\nthe HLC images in the analysis results in improved measurements over RV + SS\nalone, with the greatest gains resulting from images taken at epochs near\nmaximum elongation. Combining the two epochs of SS imaging with the RV + HLC\ndata resulted in a factor of ~2 better orbit and mass determinations over RV +\nHLC alone. The Roman CGI, combined with precursor RV data and later mission SS\nimaging, form a powerful trifecta in detecting exoplanets and determining their\nmasses, albedos, and system configurations. While the Roman CGI will break new\nscientific and technological ground with direct imaging of giant exoplanets\nwithin ~5 AU of V~5 and brighter stars, a Roman Starshade Rendezvous mission\nwould additionally enable the detection of planets out to ~8 AU in those\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 23:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

A particular challenge in\nimplementing SpGEMM kernels has been the pressure placed on DRAM memory. One\napproach to tackle this problem is to use an inner product method for the\nSpGEMM kernel implementation. While the inner product produces fewer\nintermediate results, it can end up saturating the memory bandwidth, given the\nhigh number of redundant fetches of the input matrix elements. Using an outer\nproduct-based SpGEMM kernel can reduce redundant fetches, but at the cost of\nincreased overhead due to extra computation and memory accesses for\nproducing/managing partial products.\n  In this thesis, we introduce a novel SpGEMM kernel implementation based on\nthe row-wise product approach. We leverage atomic instructions to merge\nintermediate partial products as they are generated. The use of atomic\ninstructions eliminates the need to create partial product matrices.\n  To evaluate our row-wise product approach, we map an optimized SpGEMM kernel\nto a custom accelerator designed to accelerate graph-based applications. The\ntargeted accelerator is an experimental system named PIUMA, being developed by\nIntel. PIUMA provides several attractive features, including fast context\nswitching, user-configurable caches, globally addressable memory, non-coherent\ncaches, and asynchronous pipelines. We tailor our SpGEMM kernel to exploit many\nof the features of the PIUMA fabric.\n  This thesis compares our SpGEMM implementation against prior solutions, all\nmapped to the PIUMA framework.

This architecture results in computationally efficient\nrapid scene exploration. Recent progress in self-attention-based Vision\nTransformers, an alternative to the traditionally convolution-reliant computer\nvision systems. However, the Transformer models do not explicitly model the\nfoveated properties of the visual system nor the interaction between eye\nmovements and the classification task.

Using\nsquare pooling regions or biologically-inspired radial-polar pooling regions,\nour proposed model pools the image features from the convolution backbone and\nuses the pooled features as an input to transformer layers. It decides on\nsubsequent fixation location based on the attention assigned by the Transformer\nto various locations from past and present fixations.

Crouzeix's conjecture states that the globally minimal value\nof the Crouzeix ratio is 0.5, regardless of the matrix order and polynomial\ndegree, and it is known that 1 is a frequently occurring locally minimal value.\nMaking use of a heavy-tailed distribution to initialize our optimization\ncomputations, we demonstrate for the first time that the Crouzeix ratio has\nmany other locally minimal values between 0.5 and 1.

Non-interest income, capital ratio, and GDP growth have been found to\nhave a significant relationship with ROA. In addition to non-interest income,\nmarket share, bank size, and real exchange rates are significant explaining\nvariables if profitability is measured as NIM. The only significant determinant\nof profitability measured by ROE is market share.

It also covers an extensive and recent data set. Banking sector\nstakeholders may find great value from the outputs of this paper. Regulators\nand policymakers may find this useful in undertaking analyses in setting policy\nrates, banking industry stability, and impact assessment of critical policy\nmeasures before and after the enactment, etc. Investors and the bank management\nare to use the findings of this paper in analyzing the real drivers of\nprofitability of the banks they are contemplating to invest and managing on a\ndaily basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 2021 03:35:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 18:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

Successful TLS requires identifying\nan appropriate set of key dates (the timeline length) to cover. However, doing\nso is challenging as the right length can change from one topic to another.\nExisting TLS solutions either rely on an event-agnostic fixed length or an\nexpert-supplied setting. Neither of the strategies is desired for real-life TLS\nscenarios. A fixed, event-agnostic setting ignores the diversity of events and\ntheir development and hence can lead to low-quality TLS. Relying on\nexpert-crafted settings is neither scalable nor sustainable for processing many\ndynamically changing events. This paper presents a better TLS approach for\nautomatically and dynamically determining the TLS timeline length. We achieve\nthis by employing the established elbow method from the machine learning\ncommunity to automatically find the minimum number of dates within the time\nseries to generate concise and informative summaries.

Existing methods rely on theoretical assumptions that the observation\ntimes have equal or i.i.d. spacings, and that common estimators, such as the\nperiodogram peak, are consistent and asymptotically normal. In practice,\nhowever, these assumptions are unrealistic as observation times usually exhibit\ndeterministic patterns -- e.g., the nightly observation cycle in astronomy --\nthat imprint nuisance periodicities in the data. These nuisance signals also\naffect the finite-sample distribution of estimators, which can substantially\ndeviate from normality. Here, we propose a set identification method, fusing\nideas from randomization inference and partial identification. In particular,\nwe develop a sharp test for any periodicity value, and then invert the test to\nbuild a confidence set. This approach is appropriate here because the\nconstruction of confidence sets does not rely on assumptions of regular or\nwell-behaved asymptotics. Notably, our inference is valid in finite samples\nwhen our method is fully implemented, while it can be asymptotically valid\nunder an approximate implementation designed to ease computation. Empirically,\nwe validate our method in exoplanet detection using radial velocity data. In\nthis context, our method correctly identifies the periodicity of the confirmed\nexoplanets in our sample. For some other, yet unconfirmed detections, we show\nthat the statistical evidence is weak, which illustrates the failure of\ntraditional statistical techniques. Last but not least, our method offers a\nconstructive way to resolve these identification issues via improved\nobservation designs. In exoplanet detection, these designs suggest meaningful\nimprovements in identifying periodicity even when a moderate amount of\nrandomization is introduced in scheduling radial velocity measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 2021 05:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

Most advanced state-of-the-art online solvers leverage ideas of Monte\nCarlo Tree Search (MCTS). These solvers rapidly converge to the most promising\nbranches of the belief tree, avoiding the suboptimal sections. Most of these\nalgorithms are designed to utilize straightforward access to the state reward\nand assume the belief-dependent reward is nothing but expectation over the\nstate reward. Thus, they are inapplicable to a more general and essential\nsetting of belief-dependent rewards. One example of such reward is differential\nentropy approximated using a set of weighted particles of the belief. Such an\ninformation-theoretic reward introduces a significant computational burden. In\nthis paper, we embed the paradigm of simplification into the MCTS algorithm.

However, previous works mainly focus\non the overall robustness of the model, and the in-depth analysis on the role\nof each class involved in adversarial training is still missing. In this paper,\nwe propose to analyze the class-wise robustness in adversarial training. First,\nwe provide a detailed diagnosis of adversarial training on six benchmark\ndatasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, STL-10 and ImageNet.\nSurprisingly, we find that there are remarkable robustness discrepancies among\nclasses, leading to unbalance/unfair class-wise robustness in the robust\nmodels. Furthermore, we keep investigating the relations between classes and\nfind that the unbalanced class-wise robustness is pretty consistent among\ndifferent attack and defense methods. Moreover, we observe that the stronger\nattack methods in adversarial learning achieve performance improvement mainly\nfrom a more successful attack on the vulnerable classes (i.e., classes with\nless robustness). Inspired by these interesting findings, we design a simple\nbut effective attack method based on the traditional PGD attack, named\nTemperature-PGD attack, which proposes to enlarge the robustness disparity\namong classes with a temperature factor on the confidence distribution of each\nimage. Experiments demonstrate our method can achieve a higher attack rate than\nthe PGD attack. Furthermore, from the defense perspective, we also make some\nmodifications in the training and inference phase to improve the robustness of\nthe most vulnerable class, so as to mitigate the large difference in class-wise\nrobustness.

This points to another angle on\nevaluating software success, from the perspective of self-sustaining and\nself-governing communities.\n  To uncover the dynamics of how a project at a nascent development stage\ngradually evolves into a sustainable one, here we apply a socio-technical\nnetwork modeling perspective to a dataset of Apache Software Foundation\nIncubator (ASFI), sustainability-labeled projects. To identify and validate the\ndeterminants of sustainability, we undertake a mix of quantitative and\nqualitative studies of ASFI projects' socio-technical network trajectories. We\ndevelop interpretable models which can forecast a project becoming sustainable\nwith more than 93 percent accuracy, within 8 months of incubation start. Based\non the interpretable models we describe a strategy for real-time monitoring and\nsuggesting actions, which can be used by projects to correct their\nsustainability trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 2021 08:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

Many defenses against backdoor attacks have been proposed. However,\nexisting defense works require high computational overhead or backdoor attack\ninformation such as the trigger size, which is difficult to satisfy in\nrealistic scenarios. In this paper, a novel backdoor detection method based on\nadversarial examples is proposed. The proposed method leverages intentional\nadversarial perturbations to detect whether an image contains a trigger, which\ncan be applied in both the training stage and the inference stage (sanitize the\ntraining set in training stage and detect the backdoor instances in inference\nstage). Specifically, given an untrusted image, the adversarial perturbation is\nadded to the image intentionally. If the prediction of the model on the\nperturbed image is consistent with that on the unperturbed image, the input\nimage will be considered as a backdoor instance. Compared with most existing\ndefense works, the proposed adversarial perturbation based method requires low\ncomputational resources and maintains the visual quality of the images.\nExperimental results show that, the backdoor detection rate of the proposed\ndefense method is 99.63%, 99.76% and 99.91% on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and\nGTSRB datasets, respectively.

In addition, it is also demonstrated that the proposed method can\nachieve high defense performance against backdoor attacks under different\nattack settings (trigger transparency, trigger size and trigger pattern).\nCompared with the existing defense work (STRIP), the proposed method has better\ndetection performance on all the three datasets, and is more efficient than\nSTRIP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 2021 09:33:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 12:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

The traditional approaches are based on the explicit\nsimilarity computation between the compact node representation by embedding\neach node into a low-dimensional space. In order to efficiently handle the\nintensive similarity computation in link prediction, the hashing technique has\nbeen successfully used to produce the node representation in the Hamming space.\nHowever, the hashing-based link prediction algorithms face accuracy loss from\nthe randomized hashing techniques or inefficiency from the learning to hash\ntechniques in the embedding process.

Here, user-specific data collected via\nmobile apps offer new opportunities to obtain more accurate estimates and to\nanalyze how vectors' individual preferences affect propagule flows. However,\ndata voluntarily reported via apps may lack some trip records, adding a\nsignificant layer of uncertainty. We show how the benefits of app-based data\ncan be exploited despite this drawback.\n  Based on data collected via an angler app, we built a stochastic model for\nangler traffic in the Canadian province Alberta.

The results indicate that anglers' local\npreferences and their tendency to revisit previous destinations reduce the\nnumber of long inter-waterbody trips potentially dispersing whirling disease.\nAccording to our model, anglers revisit their previous destination in 64% of\ntheir trips, making these trips irrelevant for the spread of whirling disease.\nFurthermore, 54% of fishing trips end in individual-specific spatially\ncontained areas with mean radius of 54.7km. Finally, although the fraction of\ntrips that anglers report was unknown, we were able to estimate the total\nyearly number of fishing trips in Alberta, matching an independent empirical\nestimate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 2021 12:37:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 20:01:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 17:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

The proper density of the EBL photons increases\nwith $z$ due to expansion of the Universe whereas evolution of radiation\nsources contributing to the EBL leads to a decrease in the density with\nincreasing $z$.

Meanwhile, researchers are actively\nworking on improving the security of embedded devices. However, previous work\nignores the insecurity caused by a special category of devices, i.e., the\nEnd-of-Life (EoL in short) devices. Once a product becomes End-of-Life, vendors\ntend to no longer maintain its firmware or software, including providing bug\nfixes and security patches. This makes EoL devices susceptible to attacks. For\ninstance, a report showed that an EoL model with thousands of active devices\nwas exploited to redirect web traffic for malicious purposes. In this paper, we\nconduct the first measurement study to shed light on the (in)security of EoL\ndevices. To this end, our study performs two types of analysis, including the\naliveness analysis and the vulnerability analysis. The first one aims to detect\nthe scale of EoL devices that are still alive. The second one is to evaluate\nthe vulnerabilities existing in (active) EoL devices. We have applied our\napproach to a large number of EoL models from three vendors (i.e., D-Link,\nTp-Link, and Netgear) and detect the alive devices in a time period of ten\nmonths. Our study reveals some worrisome facts that were unknown by the\ncommunity. For instance, there exist more than 2 million active EoL devices.\nNearly 300,000 of them are still alive even after five years since they became\nEoL. Although vendors may release security patches after the EoL date, however,\nthe process is ad hoc and incomplete. As a result, more than 1 million active\nEoL devices are vulnerable, and nearly half of them are threatened by high-risk\nvulnerabilities. Attackers can achieve a minimum of 2.79 Tbps DDoS attack by\ncompromising a large number of active EoL devices.

We conduct extensive\nexperiments and the results show that the LPF (1) brings a significant\nimprovement over various VQA models, (2) achieves competitive performance on\nthe bias-sensitive VQA-CP v2 benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 2021 13:48:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 09:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

Structural changes to the NTK during training reflect feature learning\nand underlie the superior performance of networks outside of the static kernel\nregime. In this work, we seek to theoretically understand kernel alignment, a\nprominent and ubiquitous structural change that aligns the NTK with the target\nfunction. We first study a toy model of kernel evolution in which the NTK\nevolves to accelerate training and show that alignment naturally emerges from\nthis demand. We then study alignment mechanism in deep linear networks and two\nlayer ReLU networks. These theories provide good qualitative descriptions of\nkernel alignment and specialization in practical networks and identify factors\nin network architecture and data structure that drive kernel alignment. In\nnonlinear networks with multiple outputs, we identify the phenomenon of kernel\nspecialization, where the kernel function for each output head preferentially\naligns to its own target function. Together, our results provide a mechanistic\nexplanation of how kernel alignment emerges during NN training and a normative\nexplanation of how it benefits training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 2021 13:50:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 01:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

Armed\nwith these basic tools, the {\\it dual} and the so-called {\\it loose dual\nproblem} of (P) are defined, and then stable strong duality results between\nthese pairs of primal-dual problems are established. The results just obtained\nare then applied to a general class (CCCV) of composed vector optimization\nproblems with cone-constrained. For this classes of problems, four perturbation\nmappings are suggested. Each of these mappings yields several forms of vector\nFarkas lemmas and two forms of dual problems for (CCVP). Concretely, one of the\nsuggested perturbation mapping give rises to well-known {\\it Lagrange} and {\\it\nloose Lagrange dual problems} for (CCVP) while each of the three others, yields\ntwo kinds of Fenchel-Lagrange dual problems for (CCVP). Stable strong duality\nfor these pairs of primal-dual problems are proved.

Frequency dependence of\nthe ACS is weak irrespective of the magnetic field orientation but significant\neffects of field orientation with respect to the CuO2 planes and field\nmagnitude on real and imaginary components of fundamental ACS were observed.\nThe height of the loss peak saturates as full penetration of magnetic field is\nachieved. The peak temperature, Tp, in \\c{hi}\" shifts to lower temperatures\nwith increasing magnetic field amplitude for both HIIc and HIIab. The value of\nTp depends on the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the\ncrystallographic axes, illustrating the anisotropy in the magnetic flux\ndynamics.

The maximum value of the loss peak and its position with\nrespect to \\c{hi}' in the Cole-Cole plot are largely consistent with the Bean\ncritical state model. Slightly increased peak value in comparison to the\npredicted peak value within the Bean critical state model is probably due to a\nweak field dependence of Jc.

Due to the inherent structural properties (e.g.,\nsparsity) existing in many signals of interest, compressive sensing (CS)\ntechnology has been extensively used for data collection in IoT to improve both\naccuracy and energy efficiency. Apart from the existing works which leverage CS\nas a channel coding scheme to deal with data loss during transmission, some\nrecent results have started to employ CS as a source coding strategy. The\nfrequently used projection matrices in these CS-based source coding schemes\ninclude dense random matrices (e.g., Gaussian matrices or Bernoulli matrices)\nand structured matrices (e.g., Toeplitz matrices). However, these matrices are\neither difficult to be implemented on resource-constrained IoT sensor nodes or\nhave limited applicability. To address these issues, in this paper, we design a\nnovel simple and efficient projection matrix, named sparse Gaussian matrix,\nwhich is easy and resource-saving to be implemented in practical IoT\napplications.

Consumer side measurement of the impact of a\ntreatment variant can be done via simple online A/B testing. Producer side\nmeasurement is more challenging because the producer experience depends on the\ntreatment assignment of the consumers. Existing approaches for producer side\nmeasurement are either based on graph cluster-based randomization or on certain\ntreatment propagation assumptions.

Analyzing the\ncausal impact of these policies in reducing the spread of COVID-19 is important\nfor future policy-making. The main challenge here is the existence of\nunobserved confounders (e.g., vigilance of residents). Besides, as the\nconfounders may be time-varying during COVID-19 (e.g., vigilance of residents\nchanges in the course of the pandemic), it is even more difficult to capture\nthem. In this paper, we study the problem of assessing the causal effects of\ndifferent COVID-19 related policies on the outbreak dynamics in different\ncounties at any given time period.

Several thermodynamic theories attempt to\nexplain the separation from the Fourier regime in such kind of systems. Here we\ndevelop a two temperature model to describe the non-Fourier regime from the\nprinciples of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The basic assumption is the\nexistence of two well separated length scales in the system, namely, one\nrelated with the matrix dimension (bulk) and the other with the characteristic\nlength of the internal structure. Two Fourier type coupled transport equations\nare obtained for the temperatures which describe the heat conduction in each of\nthe length scales. Recent experimental results from several groups on the\nthermal response of different structured materials are satisfactorily\nreproduced by using the coupling parameter as a fitting parameter. The\nsimilarities and differences of the present formalism with other theories are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 22:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-03"}

It has been increasingly widely adopted as a tool in the\nsocial sciences, including political science, digital humanities and\nsociological research in general. One desirable property of topic models is to\nallow users to find topics describing a specific aspect of the corpus. A\npossible solution is to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into topic\nmodeling, but this requires a specification from domain experts. We propose a\nnovel query-driven topic model that allows users to specify a simple query in\nwords or phrases and return query-related topics, thus avoiding tedious work\nfrom domain experts. Our proposed approach is particularly attractive when the\nuser-specified query has a low occurrence in a text corpus, making it difficult\nfor traditional topic models built on word cooccurrence patterns to identify\nrelevant topics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmodel in comparison with both classical topic models and neural topic models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 22:49:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 11:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

The algorithm\ndiscretizes partial derivatives at scattered points using radial basis\nfunctions as interpolants. Higher-order polynomials are appended to\npolyharmonic splines (PHS-RBF) and a collocation method is used to derive the\ninterpolation coefficients. The interpolating kernels are then differentiated\nand the partial-differential equations are satisfied by collocation at the\nscattered points. The PHS-RBF interpolation is shown to be exponentially\nconvergent with discretization errors decreasing as a high power of a\nrepresentative distance between points. We present here a semi-implicit\nalgorithm for time-dependent and steady state fluid flows in complex domains.\nAt each time step, several iterations are performed to converge the momentum\nand continuity equations. A Poisson equation for pressure corrections is\nformulated by imposing divergence free condition on the iterated velocity\nfield. At each time step, the momentum and pressure correction equations are\nrepeatedly solved until the velocities and pressure converge to a pre-specified\ntolerance. We have demonstrated the convergence and discretization accuracy of\nthe algorithm for two model problems and simulated three other complex\nproblems. In all cases, the algorithm is stable for Courant numbers in excess\nof ten. The algorithm has the potential to accurately and efficiently solve\nmany fluid flow and heat transfer problems in complex domains.

Separate DL models were trained on 70\\% of the processed data for\n\"Local\" protocols as well as 93 American College of Radiology (\"ACR\") protocols\nand 48 \"General\" protocols. The DL Models were assessed in an \"auto-protocoling\n(AP)\" inference mode which returns the top recommendation and in a \"clinical\ndecision support (CDS)\" inference mode which returns up to 10 protocols for\nradiologist review. The accuracy of each protocol recommendation was computed\nand analyzed based on the difference between the normalized output score of the\ncorresponding neural net for the top two recommendations.\n  Results: The top predicted protocol in AP mode was correct for 82.8%, 73.8%,\nand 69.3% of the test cases for \"General\", \"ACR\", and \"Local\" protocol classes,\nrespectively. Higher levels of accuracy over 96% were obtained for all protocol\nclasses in CDS mode. However, at current validation performance levels, the\nproposed models offer modest, positive, financial impact on large-scale imaging\nnetworks.\n  Conclusions: DL-based protocol automation is feasible and can be tuned to\nroute substantial fractions of exams for auto-protocoling, with higher accuracy\nwith more general protocols. Economic analyses of the tested algorithms\nindicate that improved algorithm performance is required to yield a practical\nexam auto-protocoling tool for sub-specialized imaging exams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 18:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

However, most existing\ncontinuum theories only partially account for the morphometry. We propose here\na unifying approach to link the strength of porous materials with the necessary\nand sufficient microstructural information, using Minkowski functionals, as per\nHadwiger's theorem. A morphometric strength law is inferred from synthetic\nmicrostructures with a wide range of porosities and heterogeneities, through\nqualitative 2D phase-field simulations. Namely, the damage is modeled at the\nmicrostructural level by tracking the solid-pore interfaces under mechanical\nloading.

This paper\nmakes a novel contribution towards formally analyzing PSN in NoC systems. We\npresent a probabilistic model checking approach to observe the PSN in a generic\n2x2 mesh NoC with a uniform random traffic load. Key features of PSN are\nmeasured at the behavioral level. To tackle state explosion, we apply\nincremental abstraction techniques, including a novel probabilistic choice\nabstraction, based on observations of NoC behavior. The Modest Toolset is used\nfor probabilistic modeling and verification. Results are obtained for several\nflit injection patterns to reveal their impacts on PSN.
