In a recent\ncalculation by \\cite{Johansson2018}, the current-induced spin polarization or\nEdelstein effect has been predicted, within the semiclassical Boltzmann theory,\nto be strongly amplified in a Weyl semimetal TaAs due to the existence of the\nFermi arcs. Motivated by this result, we calculate the Edelstein response of an\neffective model for an inversion-symmetry-breaking Weyl semimetal in the\npresence of an interface using linear response theory. The scatterings from\nscalar impurities are included and the vertex corrections are computed within\nthe self-consistent ladder approximation. At chemical potentials close to the\nWeyl points, we find the surface states have a much stronger response near the\ninterface than the bulk states by about one to two orders of magnitude. At\nhigher chemical potentials, the surface states' response near the interface\ndecreases to be about the same order of magnitude as the bulk states' response.\nWe attribute this phenomenon to the decoupling between the Fermi arc states and\nbulk states at energies close to the Weyl points. The surface states which are\neffectively dispersing like a one-dimensional chiral fermion become nearly\nnondissipative. This leads to a large surface vertex correction and, hence, a\nstrong enhancement of the surface states' Edelstein response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 16:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

This metastability has important cosmological\nimplications, because large fluctuations in the Higgs field could trigger\nvacuum decay in the early universe. For the false vacuum to survive,\ninteractions which stabilize the Higgs during inflation -- e.g., inflaton-Higgs\ninteractions or non-minimal couplings to gravity -- are typically necessary.\nHowever, the post-inflationary preheating dynamics of these same interactions\ncould also trigger vacuum decay, thereby recreating the problem we sought to\navoid. This dynamics is often assumed catastrophic for models exhibiting scale\ninvariance since these generically allow for unimpeded growth of fluctuations.\nIn this paper, we examine the dynamics of such \"massless preheating\" scenarios\nand show that the competing threats to metastability can nonetheless be\nbalanced to ensure viability. We find that fully accounting for both the\nbackreaction from particle production and the effects of perturbative decays\nreveals a large number of disjoint \"islands of (meta)stability\" over the\nparameter space of couplings. Ultimately, the interplay among Higgs-stabilizing\ninteractions plays a significant role, leading to a sequence of dynamical\nphases that effectively extend the metastable regions to large Higgs-curvature\ncouplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 16:31:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 11:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

We present a novel model-agnostic approach that derives rules\nto globally explain the behavior of classification models trained on numerical\nand/or categorical data.

Condition variables allow threads to block and\nwait until a certain condition holds, and also enable threads to wake up their\nblocked peers notifying them about a change to the state of shared data. Quite\noften such notifications are delivered to all threads, while only a small\nnumber of specific threads is interested in it. This results in so-called\nfutile wakeups, where threads receiving the notification wake up and resume\ntheir execution only to realize that the condition they are waiting for does\nnot hold and they need to wait again. Those wakeups cause numerous context\nswitches, increase lock contention and cache pressure, translating into lots of\nwasted computing cycles and energy.\n  In this work, we propose to delegate conditions on which threads are waiting\nto the thread sending notifications. This enables the latter to evaluate the\nconditions and send the notification(s) only to the relevant thread(s),\npractically eliminating futile wakeups altogether.

We propose AlterRep, an intervention-based method to address\nthis question. For any linguistic feature of a given sentence, AlterRep\ngenerates counterfactual representations by altering how the feature is\nencoded, while leaving intact all other aspects of the original representation.\nBy measuring the change in a model's word prediction behavior when these\ncounterfactual representations are substituted for the original ones, we can\ndraw conclusions about the causal effect of the linguistic feature in question\non the model's behavior. We apply this method to study how BERT models of\ndifferent sizes process relative clauses (RCs).

In this paper we present ultra deep images of the compact group of\ngalaxies HCG 86 as part of the VEGAS survey. Aims. Our main goals are to\nestimate the amount of intragroup light (IGL), to study the light and color\ndistributions in order to address the main formation process of the IGL\ncomponent in groups of galaxies. Methods. We derived the azimuthally averaged\nsurface brightness profiles in the g,r and i bands with g - r and r - i average\ncolors and color profiles for all group members. By fitting the light\ndistribution, we have extrapolated the contribution of the stellar halos plus\nthe diffuse light from the brightest component of each galaxy. The results are\ncompared with theoretical predictions. Results. The long integration time and\nwide area covered make our data deeper than previous literature studies of the\nIGL in compact groups of galaxies and allow us to produce an extended (~160\nkpc) map of the IGL, down to a surface brightness level of about 30\nmag/arcsec^2 in the g band. The IGL in HCG 86 is mainly in diffuse form and has\naverage colors of g - r ~ 0.8 mag and r - i ~ 0.4 mag. The fraction of IGL in\nHCG 86 is ~ 16% of the total luminosity of the group, and this is consistent\nwith estimates available for other compact groups and loose groups of galaxies\nof similar virial masses. A weak trend is present between the amount of IGL and\nthe early-type to late-type galaxy ratio. Conclusions. By comparing the IGL\nfraction and colors with those predicted by simulations, the amount of IGL in\nHCG 86 would be the result of the disruption of satellites at an epoch of z ~\n0.4. At this redshift, observed colors are consistent with the scenario where\nthe main contribution to the mass of the IGL comes from the\nintermediate-massive galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 17:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

In exoplanet searches with radial velocity data, the most common\nstatistical significance metrics are the Bayes factor and the false alarm\nprobability (FAP).

We define a significance metric called the\nfalse inclusion probability (FIP) based on the posterior probability of\npresence of a planet.

Our framework relates quantum cost\ngradient operators, derived from the cost and mixing Hamiltonians, to classical\ncost difference functions that reflect cost function neighborhood structure. By\nconsidering QAOA circuits from the Heisenberg picture, we derive exact general\nexpressions for expectation values as series expansions in the algorithm\nparameters, cost gradient operators, and cost difference functions. This\nenables novel interpretability and insight into QAOA behavior in various\nparameter regimes. For single-level QAOA1 we show the leading-order changes in\nthe output probabilities and cost expectation value explicitly in terms of\nclassical cost differences, for arbitrary cost functions. This demonstrates\nthat, for sufficiently small positive parameters, probability flows from lower\nto higher cost states on average. By selecting signs of the parameters, we can\ncontrol the direction of flow. We use these results to derive a classical\nrandom algorithm emulating QAOA1 in the small-parameter regime, i.e., that\nproduces bitstring samples with the same probabilities as QAOA1 up to small\nerror. For deeper QAOAp circuits we apply our framework to derive analogous and\nadditional results in several settings. In particular we show QAOA always beats\nrandom guessing.

A novel element of our framework is\nthe use of transport-Lagrangian (TL) distances between observed and model\npredicted waveforms to specify a loss function, and the use of this loss to\ndefine a generalized belief update via a Gibbs posterior.

We compare\nthe findings of our theoretical investigation with multi-wavelength\nobservations using various measures of variability. While no single-varying\nparameter simulation can explain all multi-wavelength variability properties,\nchanges in the electron luminosity and external radiation field in PKS 2155-304\nand 3C 273, respectively, can account for most of them.

In each round, a vertex $u$ is presented to the\nplayer independently and uniformly at random. The player then adaptively\nselects a vertex $v$ and adds the edge $uv$ to the graph. For a fixed monotone\ngraph property, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy\nthis property with high probability in as few rounds as possible.\n  We focus on the problem of constructing a subgraph isomorphic to an\narbitrary, fixed graph $G$. Let $\\omega = \\omega(n)$ be any function tending to\ninfinity as $n \\to \\infty$. In (Omri Ben-Eliezer et al. \"Semi-random graph\nprocess\". In: Random Structures & Algorithms 56.3 (2020), pp. 648-675) it was\nproved that asymptotically almost surely one can construct $G$ in less than\n$n^{(d-1)/d} \\omega$ rounds where $d \\ge 2$ is the degeneracy of $G$.

We prove this conjecture here.\n  We also consider a natural generalization of the process to $s$-uniform\nhypergraphs, the semi-random hypergraph process in which $r \\ge 1$ vertices are\npresented at random, and the player then selects $s-r \\ge 1$ vertices to form\nan edge of size~$s$. Our results for graphs easily generalize to hypergraphs\nwhen $r=1$; the threshold for constructing a fixed $s$-uniform hypergraph $G$\nis, again, determined by the degeneracy of $G$.

The\ntacit assumption is that the laws of physics are fundamental and that the\nnotion of information is derived from these laws. Here we take the opposite\nview: the laws of physics are an application of the rules for processing\ninformation. In this dissertation we apply the Entropic Dynamics (ED) framework\nto construct a quantum dynamics for scalar fields in space-time. We begin by\nconsidering a toy model consisting of many interacting particles, resulting in\nthe familiar Schrodinger equation for non-relativistic particles. Using a\nsimilar methodology, we construct a theory of quantum scalar fields in flat\nspace-time that is relativistic, but not manifestly so. Here we also discuss a\nnovel way in which the ED of quantum scalar fields appears to evade the\nso-called Wallstrom objection. To go further towards constructing a manifestly\ncovariant quantum ED of fields on a curved space-time, both fixed and\ndynamical, we borrow from the \"many-time\" approaches of P. Weiss, P. Dirac, K.\nKuchar, and C. Teitelboim. For a fixed background the result is a manifestly\ncovariant ED of scalar fields that is in the spirit of the covariant quantum\ntheories proposed by S. Tomonaga and J. Schwinger. However, the formalism is\nsufficiently flexible so as to allow for the possibility of modeling the back\nreaction of the quantum matter fields on a fully dynamical classical\nbackground. The simplest realization of this classical-quantum interaction\nshares some formal similarity to semi-classical gravity models, and the\nsemi-classical Einstein equations, in particular. We consider such a theory and\ndiscuss its plausibility as a candidate for a quantum gravity theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 19:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

We first discuss the structure of the nilpotent networks stemming\nfrom T-brane deformations in 4D $\\mathcal{N}=1$ theories and then go to the\nstringy origins of 6D superconformal field theories to realize deformations\nassociated with T-branes in terms of simple combinatorial data. We then analyze\nnon-perturbative generalizations of orientifold 3-planes (i.e. S-folds) in\norder to produce different 4D $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories. Afterwards, we turn our\nattention towards a few dualities found at strong coupling. For instance,\nabelian T-duality is known to be a full duality in string theory between type\nIIA and type IIB. Its nonabelian generalization, Poisson-Lie T-duality, has\nonly been conjectured to be so. We show that Poisson-Lie symmetric\n$\\sigma$-models are at least two-loop renormalizable and their\n$\\beta$-functions are invariant under Poisson-Lie T-duality. Finally, we review\nrecent progress leading to phenomenologically relevant dualities between\nM-theory on local $G_2$ spaces and F-theory on locally elliptically fibered\nCalabi-Yau fourfolds. In particular, we find that the 3D $\\mathcal{N}=1$\neffective field theory defined by M-theory on a local $Spin(7)$ space unifies\nthe Higgs bundle data associated with 4D $\\mathcal{N}=1$ M-theory and F-theory\nvacua. We finish with some comments on 3D interfaces at strong coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 21:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

The status update and harvested energy packets are assumed to arrive at\nthe transmitter according to independent Poisson processes, and the service\ntime of each status update is assumed to be exponentially distributed. We\nquantify the freshness of status updates when they reach the destination using\nthe concept of Age of Information (AoI). Unlike most of the existing analyses\nof AoI focusing on the evaluation of its average value when the transmitter is\nnot subject to energy constraints, our analysis is focused on understanding the\ndistributional properties of AoI through the characterization of its moment\ngenerating function (MGF). In particular, we use the stochastic hybrid systems\n(SHS) framework to derive closed-form expressions of the MGF of AoI under\nseveral queueing disciplines at the transmitter, including non-preemptive and\npreemptive in service/waiting strategies. Using these MGF results, we further\nobtain closed-form expressions for the first and second moments of AoI in each\nqueueing discipline. We demonstrate the generality of this analysis by\nrecovering several existing results for the corresponding system with no energy\nconstraints as special cases of the new results. Our numerical results verify\nthe analytical findings, and demonstrate the necessity of incorporating the\nhigher moments of AoI in the implementation/optimization of real-time status\nupdate systems rather than just relying on its average value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 21:32:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 00:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

But the resource budget can vary substantially\nacross different devices. Even on a single device, the affordable budget can\nchange with different scenarios, and repeatedly training networks for each\nrequired budget would be incredibly expensive. Therefore, in this work, we\npropose a general method called MutualNet to train a single network that can\nrun at a diverse set of resource constraints. Our method trains a cohort of\nmodel configurations with various network widths and input resolutions. This\nmutual learning scheme not only allows the model to run at different\nwidth-resolution configurations but also transfers the unique knowledge among\nthese configurations, helping the model to learn stronger representations\noverall. MutualNet is a general training methodology that can be applied to\nvarious network structures (e.g., 2D networks: MobileNets, ResNet, 3D networks:\nSlowFast, X3D) and various tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection,\nsegmentation, and action recognition), and is demonstrated to achieve\nconsistent improvements on a variety of datasets. Since we only train the model\nonce, it also greatly reduces the training cost compared to independently\ntraining several models. Surprisingly, MutualNet can also be used to\nsignificantly boost the performance of a single network, if dynamic resource\nconstraint is not a concern. In summary, MutualNet is a unified method for both\nstatic and adaptive, 2D and 3D networks.

In normal conditions apoptosis is repressed, until it is\nirreversibly induced by an appropriate signal. In adult organisms apoptosis is\na natural way to dispose of damaged cells, and its disruption or excess is\nassociated with cancer and autoimmune diseases. Apoptosis is regulated by a\ncomplex signaling network controlled by caspases, specialized enzymes that\ndigest essential cellular components and promote the degradation of genomic\nDNA. In this work we propose an effective description of the signaling network\nfocused on caspase-3 as a readout of cell fate. We integrate intermediate\nnetwork interactions into a nonlinear feedback function acting on caspase-3 and\nintroduce the effect of pro-apoptotic stimuli and regulatory elements as a\nsaturating activation function. We find that the theory has a robust bistable\nregime where two possible states coexist, representing survival and cell death\nfates. For a broad range of parameters, strong stimuli can induce an\nirreversible switch to the death fate. We use the theory to explore dynamical\nstimulation conditions and determine how cell fate depends on different stimuli\npatterns. This analysis reveals a critical relation between transient stimuli\nintensity and duration to trigger irreversible apoptosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 22:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

While optical network designs and planning lie at the\nheart of achieving fiber capacity efficiency and/or operational efficiency, its\ncombinatorial nature makes it computationally hard to reach optimal solutions\nfor realistic scenarios. Therefore, the well-established way that have been\ntaken for granted by not-so-small number of research papers is that an\noptimization model based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is first\nproposed and then due to the intractability of such combinatorial model, an\nheuristic algorithm is offered as an approximation. The solution-quality\ncomparison between the MILP and heuristic is then carried out on small-scale\ninstances including topologies and traffic tests to verify the efficacy of the\nproposed heuristic and the next step is to use such allegedly verified\nheuristic for optical network designs of realistic scenarios. This approach may\nnevertheless leave a critical vulnerability as there is no guarantee that one\nperforms well in small tests will generalize adequately for large-scale cases,\na common pitfall widely referred as the peril of extrapolation and/or\noverfitting.

While they are effective for this task, the\ncomplex nature of neural networks makes their output difficult to verify and\npredict, limiting their use in safety-critical systems. For this reason, recent\nwork has focused on combining techniques in formal methods and reachability\nanalysis to obtain guarantees on the closed-loop performance of neural network\ncontrollers. However, these techniques do not scale to the high-dimensional and\ncomplicated input space of image-based neural network controllers. In this\nwork, we propose a method to address these challenges by training a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to map states to plausible input images. By\nconcatenating the generator network with the control network, we obtain a\nnetwork with a low-dimensional input space.

We guarantee that the controller will keep the aircraft\non the runway and guide the aircraft towards the center of the runway.

This paper presents a novel\nlightweight compression technique designed specifically to quantize and\ncompress the features output by the intermediate layer of a split DNN, without\nrequiring any retraining of the network weights. Mathematical models for\nestimating the clipping and quantization error of ReLU and leaky-ReLU\nactivations at this intermediate layer are developed and used to compute\noptimal clipping ranges for coarse quantization. We also present a modified\nentropy-constrained design algorithm for quantizing clipped activations. When\napplied to popular object-detection and classification DNNs, we were able to\ncompress the 32-bit floating point intermediate activations down to 0.6 to 0.8\nbits, while keeping the loss in accuracy to less than 1%. When compared to\nHEVC, we found that the lightweight codec consistently provided better\ninference accuracy, by up to 1.3%. The performance and simplicity of this\nlightweight compression technique makes it an attractive option for coding an\nintermediate layer of a split neural network for edge/cloud applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 00:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

In our approach, a 3D scene is\nrepresented as a light field, i.e., a set of rays, each of which has a\ncorresponding color when reaching the image plane. For efficient novel view\nrendering, we adopt a two-plane parameterization of the light field, where each\nray is characterized by a 4D parameter. We then formulate the light field as a\n4D function that maps 4D coordinates to corresponding color values. We train a\ndeep fully connected network to optimize this implicit function and memorize\nthe 3D scene. Then, the scene-specific model is used to synthesize novel views.\nDifferent from previous light field approaches which require dense view\nsampling to reliably render novel views, our method can render novel views by\nsampling rays and querying the color for each ray from the network directly,\nthus enabling high-quality light field rendering with a sparser set of training\nimages. Per-ray depth can be optionally predicted by the network, thus enabling\napplications such as auto refocus.

We consider its quantum\ncounterpart, the private simultaneous quantum messages (PSQM) model, and\nexamine the advantages of quantum communication and prior entanglement of this\nmodel. In the PSQM model, $k$ parties $P_1,\\ldots,P_k$ initially share a common\nrandom string (or entangled states in a stronger setting), and they have\nprivate classical inputs $x_1,\\ldots, x_k$. Every $P_i$ generates a quantum\nmessage from the private input $x_i$ and the shared random string (entangled\nstates), and then sends it to the referee $R$. Receiving the messages, $R$\ncomputes $F(x_1,\\ldots,x_k)$. Then, $R$ learns nothing except for\n$F(x_1,\\ldots,x_k)$ as the privacy condition. We obtain the following results\nfor this PSQM model. (1) We demonstrate that the privacy condition inevitably\nincreases the communication cost in the two-party PSQM model as well as in the\nclassical case presented by Applebaum, Holenstein, Mishra, and Shayevitz.

Nevertheless, most existing methods do not sufficiently exploit the\ndiscriminative power of semantic information when learning the hash codes,\nwhile often involving time-consuming training procedure for handling the\nlarge-scale dataset. To tackle these issues, we formulate the learning of\nsimilarity-preserving hash codes in terms of orthogonally rotating the semantic\ndata so as to minimize the quantization loss of mapping such data to hamming\nspace, and propose an efficient Fast Discriminative Discrete Hashing (FDDH)\napproach for large-scale cross-modal retrieval. More specifically, FDDH\nintroduces an orthogonal basis to regress the targeted hash codes of training\nexamples to their corresponding semantic labels, and utilizes \"-dragging\ntechnique to provide provable large semantic margins. Accordingly, the\ndiscriminative power of semantic information can be explicitly captured and\nmaximized. Moreover, an orthogonal transformation scheme is further proposed to\nmap the nonlinear embedding data into the semantic subspace, which can well\nguarantee the semantic consistency between the data feature and its semantic\nrepresentation. Consequently, an efficient closed form solution is derived for\ndiscriminative hash code learning, which is very computationally efficient. In\naddition, an effective and stable online learning strategy is presented for\noptimizing modality-specific projection functions, featuring adaptivity to\ndifferent training sizes and streaming data. The proposed FDDH approach\ntheoretically approximates the bi-Lipschitz continuity, runs sufficiently fast,\nand also significantly improves the retrieval performance over the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

The objective is to find the most efficient way of combining\ninformation across data stream so that detection is possible under the smallest\ndetectable change magnitude. The challenge comes from the sparsity of\nchange-points when only a small fraction of data streams undergo change at any\npoint in time. The most successful approach to the sparsity issue so far has\nbeen the application of hard thresholding such that only local scores from data\nstreams exhibiting significant changes are considered and added. However the\nidentification of an optimal threshold is a difficult one. In particular it is\nunlikely that the same threshold is optimal for different levels of sparsity.\nWe propose here a sparse likelihood score for identifying a sparse signal. The\nscore is a likelihood ratio for testing between the null hypothesis of no\nchange against an alternative hypothesis in which the change-points or signals\nare barely detectable. By the Neyman-Pearson Lemma this score has maximum\ndetection power at the given alternative. The outcome is that we have a scoring\nof data streams that is successful in detecting at the boundary of the\ndetectable region of signals and change-points. The likelihood score can be\nseen as a soft thresholding approach to sparse signal and change-point\ndetection in which local scores that indicate small changes are down-weighted\nmuch more than local scores indicating large changes. We are able to show\nsecond-order optimality of the sparsity likelihood score in the sense of\nachieving successful detection at the minimum detectable order of change\nmagnitude as well as at the minimum detection asymptotic constant with respect\nthis order of change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 04:20:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 03:53:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

It is desirable to\ndevelop image quality assessment (IQA) methods that can not only evaluate and\ncompare SISR algorithms, but also guide their future development. In this\npaper, we assess the quality of SISR generated images in a two-dimensional (2D)\nspace of structural fidelity versus statistical naturalness. This allows us to\nobserve the behaviors of different SISR algorithms as a tradeoff in the 2D\nspace. Specifically, SISR methods are traditionally designed to achieve high\nstructural fidelity but often sacrifice statistical naturalness, while recent\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) based algorithms tend to create more\nnatural-looking results but lose significantly on structural fidelity.\nFurthermore, such a 2D evaluation can be easily fused to a scalar quality\nprediction.

Self-supervised learning is an emerging\nalternative for lowering the reference data requirement facilitating\nunsupervised learning. Currently available self-supervised CT denoising works\nare either dependent on foreign domain or pretexts are not very task-relevant.\nTo tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel self-supervised\nlearning approach, namely Self-Supervised Window-Leveling for Image DeNoising\n(SSWL-IDN), leveraging an innovative, task-relevant, simple, yet effective\nsurrogate -- prediction of the window-leveled equivalent. SSWL-IDN leverages\nresidual learning and a hybrid loss combining perceptual loss and MSE, all\nincorporated in a VAE framework. Our extensive (in- and cross-domain)\nexperimentation demonstrates the effectiveness of SSWL-IDN in aggressive\ndenoising of CT (abdomen and chest) images acquired at 5\\% dose level only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 07:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

It is\ndemonstrated that the model assumptions of Poisson distribution and statistical\nindependence of the frequency of single and clustered DNA lesions are\ndispensable for multi-event distributions, because they follow from the Poisson\ndistribution of the number of tracks affecting the considered target volume. It\nis also shown that making these assumptions for the single-event distributions\nof the number of lethal and sublethal lesions within a cell would lead to an\nessentially exponential dose dependence of survival for practically relevant\nvalues of the absorbed dose.

In this paper, we\nused an end-to-end Deep Multi-Scale Hierarchical Network (DMSHN) model for\ndirect Bokeh effect rendering of images captured from the monocular camera. To\nfurther improve the perceptual quality of such effect, a stacked model\nconsisting of two DMSHN modules is also proposed. Our model does not rely on\nany pretrained network module for Monocular Depth Estimation or Saliency\nDetection, thus significantly reducing the size of model and run time. Stacked\nDMSHN achieves state-of-the-art results on a large scale EBB! dataset with\naround 6x less runtime compared to the current state-of-the-art model in\nprocessing HD quality images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 08:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

Previous approaches tackle this problem by\nimplicit feature interaction and fusion between visual and linguistic\nmodalities in a one-stage manner. However, human tends to solve the referring\nproblem in a progressive manner based on informative words in the expression,\ni.e., first roughly locating candidate entities and then distinguishing the\ntarget one. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Progressive Comprehension\n(CMPC) scheme to effectively mimic human behaviors and implement it as a CMPC-I\n(Image) module and a CMPC-V (Video) module to improve referring image and video\nsegmentation models. For image data, our CMPC-I module first employs entity and\nattribute words to perceive all the related entities that might be considered\nby the expression. Then, the relational words are adopted to highlight the\ntarget entity as well as suppress other irrelevant ones by spatial graph\nreasoning. For video data, our CMPC-V module further exploits action words\nbased on CMPC-I to highlight the correct entity matched with the action cues by\ntemporal graph reasoning. In addition to the CMPC, we also introduce a simple\nyet effective Text-Guided Feature Exchange (TGFE) module to integrate the\nreasoned multimodal features corresponding to different levels in the visual\nbackbone under the guidance of textual information. In this way, multi-level\nfeatures can communicate with each other and be mutually refined based on the\ntextual context. Combining CMPC-I or CMPC-V with TGFE can form our image or\nvideo version referring segmentation frameworks and our frameworks achieve new\nstate-of-the-art performances on four referring image segmentation benchmarks\nand three referring video segmentation benchmarks respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 08:55:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

Digital pathology has aroused widespread interest in modern\npathology. The key of digitalization is to scan the whole slide image (WSI) at\nhigh magnification.

We design a strategy to scan slides with low resolution (5X)\nand a super-resolution method is proposed to restore the image details when in\ndiagnosis. The method is based on a multi-scale generative adversarial network,\nwhich sequentially generates three high-resolution images such as 10X, 20X and\n40X. Results. The peak-signal-to-noise-ratio of 10X to 40X generated images are\n24.16, 22.27 and 20.44, and the structural-similarity-index are 0.845, 0.680\nand 0.512, which are better than other super-resolution networks.

We\ndemonstrated remarkable speedup in the execution time of C++ source codes with\nthe help of optimization flags provided by FOGA when compared to the state of\nthe art framework OpenTuner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 11:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

We propose a novel approach\nfor obtaining precise I/O lower bounds on a general class of programs, which we\ncall Simple Overlap Access Programs (SOAP). SOAP analysis covers a wide variety\nof algorithms, from ubiquitous computational kernels to full scientific\ncomputing applications. Using the red-blue pebble game and combinatorial\nmethods, we are able to bound the I/O of the SOAP-induced Computational\nDirected Acyclic Graph (CDAG), taking into account multiple statements,\ninput/output reuse, and optimal tiling. To deal with programs that are outside\nof our representation (e.g., non-injective access functions), we describe\nmethods to approximate them with SOAP. To demonstrate our method, we analyze 38\ndifferent applications, including kernels from the Polybench benchmark suite,\ndeep learning operators, and -- for the first time -- applications in\nunstructured physics simulations, numerical weather prediction stencil\ncompositions, and full deep neural networks. We derive tight I/O bounds for\nseveral linear algebra kernels, such as Cholesky decomposition, improving the\nexisting reported bounds by a factor of two.

CPDP\ntrained classifiers based on labeled data sets of one project to predict fault\nin another project. Goals: Software Defect Prediction (SDP) data sets consist\nof manually designed static features, which are software metrics. In CPDP,\nsource and target project data divergence is the major challenge in achieving\nhigh performance. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network\n(GAN)-based data transformation to reduce data divergence between source and\ntarget projects. Method: We apply the Generative Adversarial Method where label\ndata sets are choosing as real data, while target data sets are choosing as\nfake data.

This\nclosure problem is a deep and unsolved problem of statistical physics whose\nsolution requires to go beyond the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic\nstate, as fluctuations in turbulent flows are strongly related to the geometry\nof this flow. This links the dissipation to the space dependence of the average\nvelocity field. Based on the idea that dissipation in fully developed\nturbulence is by singular events resulting from an evolution described by the\nEuler equations, it has been recently observed that the closure problem is\nstrongly restricted, and that it implies that the turbulent stress is a non\nlocal function (in space) of the average velocity field, an extension of\nclassical Boussinesq theory of turbulent viscosity. The resulting equations for\nthe turbulent stress are derived here in one of the simplest possible physical\nsituation, the turbulent Poiseuille flow between two parallel plates. In this\ncase the integral kernel giving the turbulent stress, as function of the\naveraged velocity field, takes a simple form leading to a full analysis of the\naveraged turbulent flow in the limit of a very large Reynolds number. In this\nlimit one has to match a viscous boundary layer, near the walls bounding the\nflow, and an outer solution in the bulk of the flow. This asymptotic analysis\nis non trivial because one has to match solution with logarithms.

The goal is to schedule all jobs within a fixed time period such\nthat the peak load (the maximum total energy requirement at any time) is\nminimized. This problem has recently received significant attention due to its\nrelevance in smart-grids. Theoretically, the problem is related to the\nclassical strip packing problem (SP). In SP, a given set of axis-aligned\nrectangles must be packed into a fixed-width strip, such that the height of the\nstrip is minimized. NPDM can be modeled as strip packing with slicing and\nstacking constraint: each rectangle may be cut vertically into multiple slices\nand the slices may be packed into the strip as individual pieces. The stacking\nconstraint forbids solutions where two slices of the same rectangle are\nintersected by the same vertical line. Nonpreemption enforces the slices to be\nplaced in contiguous horizontal locations (but may be placed at different\nvertical locations).\n  We obtain a $(5/3+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the problem. We also\nprovide an asymptotic efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme (AEPTAS)\nwhich generates a schedule for almost all jobs with energy consumption\n$(1+\\epsilon)OPT$.

In addition, we show how to split\nschedules generated by the AEPTAS into few segments and to rearrange the\ncorresponding jobs to insert the thin container mentioned above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 13:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-18"}

Variational regularization\ndescribes a broad and important class of methods that are used to obtain\nreliable solutions to inverse problems, whereby one solves a modified problem\nthat incorporates prior knowledge. Hybrid projection methods combine iterative\nprojection methods with variational regularization techniques in a synergistic\nway, providing researchers with a powerful computational framework for solving\nvery large inverse problems. Although the idea of a hybrid Krylov method for\nlinear inverse problems goes back to the 1980s, several recent advances on new\nregularization frameworks and methodologies have made this field ripe for\nextensions, further analyses, and new applications. In this paper, we provide a\npractical and accessible introduction to hybrid projection methods in the\ncontext of solving large (linear) inverse problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 13:21:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 18:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

Existing\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) based methods suffer from the following\nthree major issues: 1) unstable training introducing strong ghost artifacts in\nthe generated faces, 2) unpaired training leading to unexpected changes in\nfacial attributes such as genders and races, and 3) non-bijective age mappings\nincreasing the uncertainty in the face transformation. To overcome these\nissues, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed AgeFlow, to integrate the\nadvantages of both flow-based models and GANs. The proposed AgeFlow contains\nthree parts: an encoder that maps a given face to a latent space through an\ninvertible neural network, a novel invertible conditional translation module\n(ICTM) that translates the source latent vector to target one, and a decoder\nthat reconstructs the generated face from the target latent vector using the\nsame encoder network; all parts are invertible achieving bijective age\nmappings. The novelties of ICTM are two-fold. First, we propose an\nattribute-aware knowledge distillation to learn the manipulation direction of\nage progression while keeping other unrelated attributes unchanged, alleviating\nunexpected changes in facial attributes. Second, we propose to use GANs in the\nlatent space to ensure the learned latent vector indistinguishable from the\nreal ones, which is much easier than traditional use of GANs in the image\ndomain. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over existing\nGANs-based methods on two benchmarked datasets.

We present various results building up to the study of the\nentanglement entropy of de Sitter horizons using causal sets. We begin by\nobtaining causal set analogs of Green functions for this field. First we\nconstruct the retarded Green function in a Riemann normal neighborhood (RNN) of\nan arbitrary curved spacetime. Then, we show that in de Sitter and patches of\nanti-de Sitter spacetimes the construction can be done beyond the RNN. This\nallows us to construct the QFT vacuum on the causal set using the\nSorkin-Johnston construction. We calculate the SJ vacuum on a causal set\napproximated by de Sitter spacetime, using numerical techniques. We find that\nthe causal set SJ vacuum does not correspond to any of the known Mottola-Allen\nvacua of de Sitter spacetime. This has potential phenomenological consequences\nfor early universe physics. Finally, we study the spacetime entanglement\nentropy for causal set de Sitter horizons. The entanglement entropy of de\nSitter horizons is of particular interest. As in the case of nested causal\ndiamonds in 2d Minkowski spacetime, we find that the causal set naturally gives\na volume law of entropy, both for nested causal diamonds in 4d Minkowski\nspacetime as well as 2d and 4d de Sitter spacetimes.
