Unlike classical methods which are based on\nestimating the (limiting) distribution of an estimator, the HulC is often\nsimpler to use and effectively bypasses this step. In comparison to the\nbootstrap, the HulC requires fewer regularity conditions and succeeds in many\nexamples where the bootstrap provably fails. Unlike subsampling, the HulC does\nnot require knowledge of the rate of convergence of the estimators on which it\nis based. The validity of the HulC requires knowledge of the (asymptotic)\nmedian-bias of the estimators. We further analyze a variant of our basic\nmethod, called the Adaptive HulC, which is fully data-driven and estimates the\nmedian-bias using subsampling. We show that the Adaptive HulC retains the\naforementioned strengths of the HulC. In certain cases where the underlying\nestimators are pathologically asymmetric the HulC and Adaptive HulC can fail to\nprovide useful confidence sets. We propose a final variant, the Unimodal HulC,\nwhich can salvage the situation in cases where the distribution of the\nunderlying estimator is (asymptotically) unimodal. We discuss these methods in\nthe context of several challenging inferential problems which arise in\nparametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric inference. Although our focus\nis on validity under weak regularity conditions, we also provide some general\nresults on the width of the HulC confidence sets, showing that in many cases\nthe HulC confidence sets have near-optimal width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 May 2021 16:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

To address this issue, this work elaborates a methodology\nintended to determine a sustainable electricity system that can endure extreme\nweather conditions, which are likely to occur. First, using hourly production\nand demand data from the last decade, along with estimates of new uses of\nelectricity, a worst-case scenario is constructed, including the storage\ncapacity and additional photovoltaic power which are needed to serve the demand\non an hourly basis. Next, several key parameters which may have a significant\ninfluence on the LCOE are considered, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out\nto determine their real impact, significance and potential trends. The proposed\nmethodology is then applied to the Spanish system. The results show that, under\nthe hypotheses and conditions considered in this paper, it is possible to\ndesign a decarbonized electricity system that, taking advantage of existing\nsustainable assets, satisfies the long-term needs by providing a reliable\nsupply at an average cost significantly lower than current market prices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 May 2021 17:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

To examine the structure\nof when and where memorization occurs in a deep network, we use a recently\ndeveloped replica-based mean field theoretic geometric analysis method. We find\nthat all layers preferentially learn from examples which share features, and\nlink this behavior to generalization performance. Memorization predominately\noccurs in the deeper layers, due to decreasing object manifolds' radius and\ndimension, whereas early layers are minimally affected. This predicts that\ngeneralization can be restored by reverting the final few layer weights to\nearlier epochs before significant memorization occurred, which is confirmed by\nthe experiments. Additionally, by studying generalization under different model\nsizes, we reveal the connection between the double descent phenomenon and the\nunderlying model geometry. Finally, analytical analysis shows that networks\navoid memorization early in training because close to initialization, the\ngradient contribution from permuted examples are small.

A temperature threshold for a transition between anomalous and\nnormal diffusive behaviors is located, yielding a new phase diagram for the\nsystem. In the low-temperature regime, the system exhibits an apparent negative\ndifferential mobility due to persistent, long-time subdiffusion at low-bias; at\nhigh temperature (or critical bias,) the system rapidly approaches normal\ndiffusion below an intermediate barrier height, $U_o \\sim k_B T$. By\nconsideration of numerical results, comparison to the overdamped case, and the\nrelated Kramers multistable escape problems, it is demonstrated that the\nlow-bias non-monotonic temperature dependence of the diffusivity, persistent\nsubdiffusion, and negative differential mobility can be traced to inertial\neffects, which are evident in the oscillatory modes of the velocity power\nspectra at low bias. In the giant diffusion regime, the velocity power spectra\nexhibit coupling between the ``locked\" and ``running\" states, with a\ncharacteristic frequency corresponding to the principal frequency of the limit\ncycles of a damped, driven plane pendulum near critical bias. Non-linear second\nharmonic generation, corresponding to oscillatory transient anomalous\ndiffusivity, is observed with increasing bias and decreasing temperature,\nfurther emphasizing that the low-noise diffusion problem converges to\nnoise-free dynamics, complementing analytic results for the average velocity\n[L.

In applications where the data arrives sequentially such as\nstreaming video completion, the missing entries of the tensor need to be\ndynamically recovered in a streaming fashion. Traditional streaming tensor\ncompletion algorithms treat the entire visual data as a tensor, which may not\nwork satisfactorily when there is a big change in the tensor subspace along the\ntemporal dimension, such as due to strong motion across the video frames. In\nthis paper, we develop a novel patch tracking-based streaming tensor ring\ncompletion framework for visual data recovery. Given a newly incoming frame,\nsmall patches are tracked from the previous frame. Meanwhile, for each tracked\npatch, a patch tensor is constructed by stacking similar patches from the new\nframe. Patch tensors are then completed using a streaming tensor ring\ncompletion algorithm, and the incoming frame is recovered using the completed\npatch tensors. We propose a new patch tracking strategy that can accurately and\nefficiently track the patches with missing data. Further, a new streaming\ntensor ring completion algorithm is proposed which can efficiently and\naccurately update the latent core tensors and complete the missing entries of\nthe patch tensors. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the proposed algorithms compared with both batch and streaming\nstate-of-the-art tensor completion methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 May 2021 20:33:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 17:05:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 04:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

To address these\nchallenges, we propose LEArnable Pruning (LEAP), an effective method to\ngradually prune the model based on thresholds learned by gradient descent.\nDifferent than previous learnable pruning methods, which utilize $L_0$ or $L_1$\npenalty to indirectly affect the final pruning ratio, LEAP introduces a novel\nregularization function, that directly interacts with the preset target pruning\nratio. Moreover, in order to reduce hyperparameter tuning, a novel adaptive\nregularization coefficient is deployed to control the regularization penalty\nadaptively. With the new regularization term and its associated adaptive\nregularization coefficient, LEAP is able to be applied for different pruning\ngranularity, including unstructured pruning, structured pruning, and hybrid\npruning, with minimal hyperparameter tuning.

Our approach monitors the inner\nworkings of a neural network and learns a density estimator of the activation\ndistribution.

To deal with the\nhigh-dimensional activation-space of typical segmentation networks, we\nsubsample them to obtain a homogeneous spatial and layer-wise coverage. The\nsubsampling pattern is chosen once per monitored model and kept fixed for all\ninputs. Since the attacker has access to neither the detection model nor the\nsampling key, it becomes harder for them to attack the segmentation network, as\nthe attack cannot be backpropagated through the detector.

It can, however, take days to provide the\ndiagnosis, and false negative rate is relatively high. Imaging, in particular\nchest computed tomography (CT), can assist with diagnosis and assessment of\nthis disease. Nevertheless, it is shown that standard dose CT scan gives\nsignificant radiation burden to patients, especially those in need of multiple\nscans. In this study, we consider low-dose and ultra-low-dose (LDCT and ULDCT)\nscan protocols that reduce the radiation exposure close to that of a single\nX-Ray, while maintaining an acceptable resolution for diagnosis purposes. Since\nthoracic radiology expertise may not be widely available during the pandemic,\nwe develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based framework using a collected\ndataset of LDCT/ULDCT scans, to study the hypothesis that the AI model can\nprovide human-level performance. The AI model uses a two stage capsule network\narchitecture and can rapidly classify COVID-19, community acquired pneumonia\n(CAP), and normal cases, using LDCT/ULDCT scans. The AI model achieves COVID-19\nsensitivity of 89.5% +\\- 0.11, CAP sensitivity of 95% +\\- 0.11, normal cases\nsensitivity (specificity) of 85.7% +\\- 0.16, and accuracy of 90% +\\- 0.06.

To fill this gap, here we introduce the first\nframework for phase-field modeling of rough rock fractures. The framework\ntransforms a displacement-jump-based discrete constitutive model for\ndiscontinuities into a strain-based continuous model, without any additional\nparameter, and then casts it into a phase-field formulation for frictional\ninterfaces. We illustrate the framework by constructing a particular\nphase-field form employing a rock joint model originally formulated for\ndiscrete modeling. The results obtained by the new formulation show excellent\nagreement with those of a well-established discrete method for a variety of\nproblems ranging from shearing of a single discontinuity to compression of\nfractured rocks. It is further demonstrated that the phase-field formulation\ncan well simulate complex crack growth from rough discontinuities.\nConsequently, our phase-field framework provides an unprecedented bridge\nbetween a discrete constitutive model for rough discontinuities -- common in\nrock mechanics -- and the continuous finite element method -- standard in\ncomputational mechanics -- without any algorithm to explicitly represent\ndiscontinuity geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 01:19:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2021 02:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

The proposed method\ncontains four major modules, a panorama image detection module, a multimodality\ndata fusion module, a data association module and a trajectory inference model.\nWe evaluate the proposed method on the JRDB dataset, where the MMPAT achieves\nthe top performance in both the detection and tracking tasks and significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (15.7 and 8.5\nimprovement in terms of AP and MOTA, respectively).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 03:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

Currently, one\nof the most significant limitations in this field is the lack of a large\nrealistic benchmark. In this work, we contribute a large, realistic long-term\nperson re-identification benchmark, named as DeepChange. It has several unique\ncharacteristics: (1) Realistic and rich personal appearance (e.g., clothes and\nhair style) and variations: Highly diverse clothes change and styles, with\nvarying reappearing gaps in time from minutes to seasons, different weather\nconditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, windy, rainy, snowy, extremely cold) and\nevents (e.g., working, leisure, daily activities). (2) Rich camera setups: Raw\nvideos were recorded by 17 outdoor varying resolution cameras operating in a\nreal-world surveillance system.

Though this is desired for certain optimization problems\nsuch as in deep learning, it causes issues when the goal is to find the global\nminimum, especially if the global minimum resides in a sharp valley.\n  Illustrated with a simple motivating example, we show that the fundamental\nreason is that the difference in the Lipschitz constants of multiple terms in\nthe loss function causes stochastic gradient descent to experience different\nvariances at different minima.

The measured surface tension relaxations with time\nin the regimes of adsorption from vapor and evaporation from drop combined with\nthe equations of state provide quantitative information on the change of\nadsorption because of the volatile amphiphile mass transfer across the surface.\nThe theoretical analysis of the diffusion and barrier mechanisms in the case of\nadsorption from vapor to the aqueous drop shows that the mixed\nbarrier-diffusion control in the vapor and diffusion control in the drop\ndescribe experimental data.

In the absence of a magnetic field, the viscosity\nof ferrofluid depends on the volume concentration of magnetic nanoparticles\nincluding surfactant layers. However, under the influence of a stationary\nmagnetic field, the viscosity of ferrofluid depends on the angle between the\napplied magnetic field and vorticity in the flow. If this angle is 90o, then\nthere is a maximum increase in the viscosity. If the magnetic field and the\nvorticity in the flow are parallel to each other, then there is no change in\nthe viscosity since the applied magnetic field does not change the speed of the\nrotation of magnetic nanoparticles in the fluid. The viscosity of ferrofluid in\nthe presence of an alternating magnetic field demonstrates interesting\nbehavior. When field frequency matches with the relaxation time, known as\nresonance condition, then there is no impact of an alternating magnetic field\nin the viscosity of ferrofluid. If the frequency of an alternating magnetic\nfield is less than resonance frequency, then an alternating magnetic field\nincreases the viscosity of ferrofluid. Using higher frequency than resonance\ncondition reduces the viscosity of ferrofluid and researchers reported this\nincident as the negative viscosity effect.

In\nthis paper, a deep reinforcement learning approach is proposed to optimize\nfunction splitting in vRAN. A learning paradigm is developed that optimizes the\nlocation of functions in the RAN. These functions can be placed either at a\ncentral/cloud unit (CU) or a distributed unit (DU). This problem is formulated\nas constrained neural combinatorial reinforcement learning to minimize the\ntotal network cost. In this solution, a policy gradient method with Lagrangian\nrelaxation is applied that uses a stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) neural\nnetwork architecture to approximate the policy. Then, a sampling technique with\na temperature hyperparameter is applied for the inference process. The results\nshow that our proposed solution can learn the optimal function split decision\nand solve the problem with a $0.4\\%$ optimality gap.

Moreover, the scarcity\nof manual annotation in organ vessels poses another challenge. In this paper,\nto address the above issues, we propose a hierarchical deep network where an\nattention mechanism localizes the low-contrast capillary regions guided by the\nwhole vessels, and enhance the spatial activation in those areas for the\nsub-type vessels.

It is important to study the behavior of\nSNNs trained with unsupervised learning methods such as spike-timing dependent\nplasticity (STDP) on video classification tasks, including mechanisms to model\nmotion information using spikes, as this information is critical for video\nunderstanding. This paper presents multiple methods of transposing temporal\ninformation into a static format, and then transforming the visual information\ninto spikes using latency coding. These methods are paired with two types of\ntemporal fusion known as early and late fusion, and are used to help the\nspiking neural network in capturing the spatio-temporal features from videos.\nIn this paper, we rely on the network architecture of a convolutional spiking\nneural network trained with STDP, and we test the performance of this network\nwhen challenged with action recognition tasks. Understanding how a spiking\nneural network responds to different methods of movement extraction and\nrepresentation can help reduce the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs.

We assume the supersonic neutral solar wind\nas the source of PUIs gyrating about the magnetic field in the outer\nheliosheath. These PUIs become energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) via charge\nexchange with interstellar hydrogen, and a portion of these ENAs are detected\nby spacecraft such as the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX}. To evaluate\nthe possibility of identifying the KHI on HP from ENA observations, we assume\nthat an imprint of the KHI may be displayed in spatial and temporal variations\nin the observed ENA profile. As an alternative to ENA, the column density of\nPUIs integrated across the HP is calculated. The KH-inducing vortex forces not\nonly background protons but also PUIs to roll up deep in the inner heliosheath.\nThe KH vortex also results in the emission of magnetosonic pulses that sweep\nPUIs in the outer heliosheath and lead to their local confinement. These\neffects elongate the PUIs spatial distribution in the direction normal to the\nHP. The appearance of the local confined structure in the PUIs column density\nis consequently confirmed, and this feature can be confirmed as the KHI\nevolution.

One prominent example is the real-time\ntime-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT), a widely used framework\nfor the first principle description of many-electron dynamics in chemical and\nmaterials systems. Practical rt-TDDFT calculations often avoid the direct\nsimulation of the von Neumann equation, and solve instead a set of\nSchr\\\"odinger equations, of which the dynamics is equivalent to that of the von\nNeumann equation. However, the time step size employed by the Schr\\\"odinger\ndynamics is often much smaller. In order to improve the time step size and the\noverall efficiency of the simulation, we generalize a recent work of the\nparallel transport (PT) dynamics for simulating pure states [An, Lin,\nMultiscale Model. Simul. 18, 612, 2020] to general quantum states. The PT\ndynamics provides the optimal gauge choice, and can employ a time step size\ncomparable to that of the von Neumann dynamics. Going beyond the linear and\nnear adiabatic regime in previous studies, we find that the error of the PT\ndynamics can be bounded by certain commutators between Hamiltonians, density\nmatrices, and their derived quantities. Such a commutator structure is not\npresent in the Schr\\\"odinger dynamics. We demonstrate that the parallel\ntransport-implicit midpoint (PT-IM) method is a suitable method for simulating\nthe PT dynamics, especially when the spectral radius of the Hamiltonian is\nlarge. The commutator structure of the error bound, and numerical results for\nmodel rt-TDDFT calculations in both linear and nonlinear regimes, confirm the\nadvantage of the PT dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 07:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

It is very\nchallenging because the blur kernel is spatially varying and difficult to\nestimate by traditional methods. Due to its great breakthrough in low-level\ntasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been introduced to the defocus\ndeblurring problem and achieved significant progress. However, they apply the\nsame kernel for different regions of the defocus blurred images, thus it is\ndifficult to handle these nonuniform blurred images. To this end, this study\ndesigns a novel blur-aware multi-branch network (BaMBNet), in which different\nregions (with different blur amounts) should be treated differentially. In\nparticular, we estimate the blur amounts of different regions by the internal\ngeometric constraint of the DP data, which measures the defocus disparity\nbetween the left and right views. Based on the assumption that different image\nregions with different blur amounts have different deblurring difficulties, we\nleverage different networks with different capacities (\\emph{i.e.} parameters)\nto process different image regions. Moreover, we introduce a meta-learning\ndefocus mask generation algorithm to assign each pixel to a proper branch.

In this paper, we present ShieldScatter, a lightweight system that\nattaches low-cost tags to single-antenna devices to shield the system from\nactive attacks. The key insight of ShieldScatter is to intentionally create\nmulti-path propagation signatures with the careful deployment of tags. These\nsignatures can be used to construct a sensitive profile to identify the\nlocation of the signals' arrival, and thus detect the threat. In addition, we\nalso design a tag-random scheme and a multiple receivers combination approach\nto detect a powerful attacker who has the strong priori knowledge of the\nlegitimate user.

In\nthis paper, we consider a partially supervised setting, where cheap image-level\nannotations are provided for all the training data, and the costly per-voxel\nannotations are only available for a subset of them. We propose an Inductive\nAttention Guidance Network (IAG-Net) to jointly learn a global image-level\nclassifier for normal/PDAC classification and a local voxel-level classifier\nfor semi-supervised PDAC segmentation. We instantiate both the global and the\nlocal classifiers by multiple instance learning (MIL), where the attention\nguidance, indicating roughly where the PDAC regions are, is the key to bridging\nthem: For global MIL based normal/PDAC classification, attention serves as a\nweight for each instance (voxel) during MIL pooling, which eliminates the\ndistraction from the background; For local MIL based semi-supervised PDAC\nsegmentation, the attention guidance is inductive, which not only provides\nbag-level pseudo-labels to training data without per-voxel annotations for MIL\ntraining, but also acts as a proxy of an instance-level classifier.\nExperimental results show that our IAG-Net boosts PDAC segmentation accuracy by\nmore than 5% compared with the state-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 08:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

The vast\nmajority burn up harmlessly during the descent, but the larger objects survive,\noccasionally experiencing intense fragmentation events, and reach the ground.\nThese events can pose a threat for a village or a small city; therefore, models\nof asteroid fragmentation, along with accurate post-breakup trajectory and\nstrewn field estimation, are needed to enable a reliable risk assessment. In\nthis work, a methodology to describe meteoroids entry, fragmentation, descent,\nand strewn field is presented by means of a continuum approach. At breakup, a\nmodified version of the NASA Standard Breakup Model is used to generate the\ndistribution of the fragments in terms of their area-to-mass ratio and ejection\nvelocity. This distribution, combined with the meteoroid state, is directly\npropagated using the continuity equation coupled with the non-linear entry\ndynamics. At each time step, the probability density evolution of the fragments\nis reconstructed using GMM interpolation. Using this information is then\npossible to estimate the meteoroid's ground impact probability. This approach\ndeparts from the current state-of-the-art models: it has the flexibility to\ninclude large fragmentation events while maintaining a continuum formulation\nfor a better physical representation of the phenomenon. The methodology is also\ncharacterised by a modular structure, so that updated asteroids fragmentation\nmodels can be readily integrated into the framework, allowing a continuously\nimproving prediction of re-entry and fragmentation events. The propagation of\nthe fragments' density and its reconstruction, currently considering only one\nfragmentation point, is first compared against Monte Carlo simulations, and\nthen against real observations. Both deceleration due to atmospheric drag and\nablation due to aerothermodynamics effects have been considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 08:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

In this paper, we propose a new\nframework, with the interaction between the scene and the human motion taken\ninto account. Considering the uncertainty of human motion, we formulate this\ntask as a generative task, whose objective is to generate plausible human\nmotion conditioned on both the scene and the human initial position. This\nframework factorizes the distribution of human motions into a distribution of\nmovement trajectories conditioned on scenes and that of body pose dynamics\nconditioned on both scenes and trajectories. We further derive a GAN based\nlearning approach, with discriminators to enforce the compatibility between the\nhuman motion and the contextual scene as well as the 3D to 2D projection\nconstraints.

The fitting\nanalyses presented in these works indicate a preference for values of the\neffective gravitational coupling appearing in the Friedmann equation, $G$,\nabout $4-9\\%$ larger than Newton's constant (as measured on Earth), and mildy\nevolving with the expansion of the universe.

The ability to explain models decisions also allows to\nprovide diagnosis in addition to the model decision, which is highly valuable\nin scenarios such as fault detection. Unfortunately, high-performance models do\nnot exhibit the necessary transparency to make their decisions fully\nunderstandable. And the black-boxes approaches, which are used to explain such\nmodel decisions, suffer from a lack of accuracy in tracing back the exact cause\nof a model decision regarding a given input.

This paper proposes an improved CNNs\narchitecture called PF-Net, which encourages the first convolutional layer to\nimplement more personalized filters than SincNet.

To quantify the \"touristicity\" of a venue we exploited some\nindicators such as the size of the Wikipedia page for the city hosting the\nvenue and other indexes from reports of the World Economic Forum.\nResults/Findings: We found out that the two aspects are related, and the\ncorrelation with conference impact is stronger when considering country-wide\ntouristic indicators, such as the Travel&Tourism Competitiveness Index.\nMore-over the almost linear correlation with the Tourist Service Infrastructure\nindex attests the specific importance of tourist/accommodation facilities in a\ngiven country.

In\nparticular, we systematically explore the opportunities that come with\ndecoupling memory and CPU resource allocations and also enabling the use of\ndifferent VM types. We find a rich trade-off space between performance and\ncost. The provider can use this in a number of ways: from exposing all these\nparameters to the user, to eliciting preferences for performance and cost from\nusers, or by simply offering the same performance with lower cost. This\nflexibility can also enable the provider to optimize its resource utilization\nand enable a cost-effective service with predictable performance.\n  Our results show that, by decoupling memory and CPU allocation, there is\npotential to have up to 40% lower execution cost than the preset coupled\nconfigurations that are the norm in current serverless offerings. Similarly,\nmaking the correct choice of VM instance type can provide up to 50% better\nexecution time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that providers can utilize\ndifferent instance types for the same functions to maximize resource\nutilization while providing performance within 10-20% of the best resource\nconfiguration for each respective function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 09:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

However, 3DMM has restricted representation power due to\nthe limited number of 3D scans and the global linear basis. To address the\nlimitations of 3DMM, we propose a straightforward learning-based method that\nreconstructs a 3D face mesh through Free-Form Deformation (FFD) for the first\ntime. FFD is a geometric modeling method that embeds a reference mesh within a\nparallelepiped grid and deforms the mesh by moving the sparse control points of\nthe grid. As FFD is based on mathematically defined basis functions, it has no\nlimitation in representation power. Thus, we can recover accurate 3D face\nmeshes by estimating appropriate deviation of control points as deformation\nparameters. Although both 3DMM and FFD are parametric models, it is difficult\nto predict the effect of the 3DMM parameters on the face shape, while the\ndeformation parameters of FFD are interpretable in terms of their effect on the\nfinal shape of the mesh.

They enable scalable approximate posterior inference in\nlatent-variable models using variational inference (VI). A VAE posits a\nvariational family parameterized by a deep neural network called an encoder\nthat takes data as input. This encoder is shared across all the observations,\nwhich amortizes the cost of inference. However the encoder of a VAE has the\nundesirable property that it maps a given observation and a\nsemantics-preserving transformation of it to different latent representations.\nThis \"inconsistency\" of the encoder lowers the quality of the learned\nrepresentations, especially for downstream tasks, and also negatively affects\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose a regularization method to enforce\nconsistency in VAEs. The idea is to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence between the variational distribution when conditioning on the\nobservation and the variational distribution when conditioning on a random\nsemantic-preserving transformation of this observation. This regularization is\napplicable to any VAE. In our experiments we apply it to four different VAE\nvariants on several benchmark datasets and found it always improves the quality\nof the learned representations but also leads to better generalization. In\nparticular, when applied to the Nouveau Variational Auto-Encoder (NVAE), our\nregularization method yields state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and\nCIFAR-10. We also applied our method to 3D data and found it learns\nrepresentations of superior quality as measured by accuracy on a downstream\nclassification task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 10:26:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 19:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

A crucial prerequisite of these systems is time series\nmatching, which still is a challenging problem. A time series is a\nhigh-dimensional data type, its representation is storage-, and its comparison\nis time-consuming. Among the representation techniques that tackle these\nchallenges, the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) is the current state of\nthe art. This technique reduces a time series to a low-dimensional space by\nsegmenting it and discretizing each segment into a small symbolic alphabet.\nHowever, SAX ignores the deterministic behavior of time series such as cyclical\nrepeating patterns or trend component affecting all segments and leading to a\ndistortion of the symbolic distribution. In this paper, we present a season-\nand a trend-aware symbolic approximation. We show that this improves the\nsymbolic distribution and increase the representation accuracy without\nincreasing its memory footprint. Most importantly, this enables a more\nefficient time series matching by providing a match up to three orders of\nmagnitude faster than SAX.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 10:44:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 08:46:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 07:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

Some research works have been done\nin automatically generating test cases to reveal unfairness in SA systems, but\nthe community still lacks tools that can monitor and uncover biased predictions\nat runtime. This paper fills this gap by proposing BiasRV, the first tool to\nraise an alarm when a deployed SA system makes a biased prediction on a given\ninput text. To implement this feature, BiasRV dynamically extracts a template\nfrom an input text and from the template generates gender-discriminatory\nmutants (semantically-equivalent texts that only differ in gender information).\nBased on popular metrics used to evaluate the overall fairness of an SA system,\nwe define distributional fairness property for an individual prediction of an\nSA system. This property specifies a requirement that for one piece of text,\nmutants from different gender classes should be treated similarly as a whole.\nVerifying the distributional fairness property causes much overhead to the\nrunning system. To run more efficiently, BiasRV adopts a two-step heuristic:\n(1) sampling several mutants from each gender and checking if the system\npredicts them as of the same sentiment, (2) checking distributional fairness\nonly when sampled mutants have conflicting results. Experiments show that\ncompared to directly checking the distributional fairness property for each\ninput text, our two-step heuristic can decrease overhead used for analyzing\nmutants by 73.81% while only resulting in 6.7% of biased predictions being\nmissed. Besides, BiasRV can be used conveniently without knowing the\nimplementation of SA systems. Future researchers can easily extend BiasRV to\ndetect more types of bias, e.g. race and occupation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 10:55:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2021 08:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

An alternative to creating large-scale high-quality\nmonolingual span-extraction training datasets is to develop multilingual\nmodeling approaches and systems which can transfer to the target language\nwithout requiring training data in that language. In this paper, in order to\nsolve the scarce availability of extractive reading comprehension training data\nin the target language, we propose a multilingual extractive reading\ncomprehension approach called XLRC by simultaneously modeling the existing\nextractive reading comprehension training data in a multilingual environment\nusing self-adaptive attention and multilingual attention.

Although deep learning played a major role in the\nrecent success of acne detection, there are still several challenges such as\ncolor shift by inconsistent illumination, variation in scales, and high density\ndistribution. To address these problems, we propose an acne detection network\nwhich consists of three components, specifically: Composite Feature Refinement,\nDynamic Context Enhancement, and Mask-Aware Multi-Attention. First, Composite\nFeature Refinement integrates semantic information and fine details to enrich\nfeature representation, which mitigates the adverse impact of imbalanced\nillumination. Then, Dynamic Context Enhancement controls different receptive\nfields of multi-scale features for context enhancement to handle scale\nvariation. Finally, Mask-Aware Multi-Attention detects densely arranged and\nsmall acne by suppressing uninformative regions and highlighting probable acne\nregions. Experiments are performed on acne image dataset ACNE04 and natural\nimage dataset PASCAL VOC 2007.

In\nthis paper, we study Markov decision processes (MDP) with the specification\ncombining all these three types. The derived policy maximizes the reward among\nall policies ensuring the LTL specification with the given probability and\nadhering to the steady-state constraints.

Daniel and Hauswirth have\nconstructed a one-parameter family of complete, cmc $1/2$ annuli that are\nsymmetric about a reflection in the horizontal plane $\\mathbb{H}^2 \\times\n\\{0\\}$, the horizontal catenoids. In this thesis we prove that these catenoids\nconverge to a singular limit of two tangent horocylinders as the neck size\ntends to zero.

We show that on carefully\nchosen weighted H\\\"older spaces the Jacobi operator can be inverted, modulo a\nfinite-dimensional subspace, and provided the neck size of the horizontal\ncatenoid is sufficiently small.

The created PINN\nmodels account for variable fluid properties, species- and heat-diffusion and\nconvection. Both the mentioned PINN architectures were trained using different\nhyperparameter settings, such as network width and depth to find the\nbest-performing configuration. It is shown that the segregated-network PINN\napproach results in on-average 62% lower losses when compared to the\nsingle-network PINN architecture for the given problem. Furthermore, the\nsingle-network variant struggled to ensure species mass conservation in\ndifferent areas of the computational domain, whereas, the segregated approach\nsuccessfully maintained species conservation. The PINN predicted velocity,\ntemperature and species profiles for a given set of boundary conditions were\ncompared to results generated using OpenFOAM software. Both the single- and\nsegregated-network PINN models produced accurate results for temperature and\nvelocity profiles, with average percentage difference relative to the CFD\nresults of approximately 7.5% for velocity and 8% for temperature. The mean\nerror percentages for the species mass fractions are 9\\% for the single-network\nmodel and 1.5% for the segregated-network approach. To showcase the\napplicability of PINNs for surrogate modelling of multi-species problems, a\nparameterised version of the segregated-network PINN is trained which could\nproduce results for different water vapour inlet velocities. The normalised\nmean absolute percentage errors, relative to the OpenFOAM results, across three\npredicted cases for velocity and temperature are approximately 7.5% and 2.4%\nfor water vapour mass fraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 12:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

Self-adaptation of\nsuch applications is a crucial subject that needs to be addressed in a way that\nrespects human goals and human values.

Their strategic placement is of ultimate\nimportance because it is not economically viable to install measurement systems\non every node and branch of a power grid, though they need to be monitored. An\noverwhelming number of strategies have been developed to meet oftentimes\nmultiple conflicting objectives. The prime challenge in formulating the problem\nlies in developing a heuristic or an optimization model that, though\nmathematically tractable and constrained in cost, leads to trustworthy\ntechnical solutions. Further, large-scale, long-term deployments pose\nadditional challenges because the boundary conditions change as technologies\nevolve. For instance, the advent of new technologies in sensing and\nmeasurement, as well as in communications and networking, might impact the cost\nand performance of available solutions and shift initially set conditions.\nAlso, the placement strategies developed for transmission grids might not be\nsuitable for distribution grids, and vice versa, because of unique\ncharacteristics; therefore, the strategies need to be flexible, to a certain\nextent, because no two power grids are alike. Despite the extensive literature\non the present topic, the focus of published works tends to be on a specific\nsubject, such as the optimal placement of measurements to ensure observability\nin transmission grids. There is a dearth of work providing a comprehensive\npicture for developing optimal placement strategies.

In most cases, strip waveguides are the\npreferred solution to maximize the light interaction with the waveguide\nsurroundings. However, the only two degrees of freedom in Si strip waveguides\nare the width and thickness, resulting in limited flexibility in evanescent\nfield control. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new strategy that exploits\nmetamaterial engineering of the waveguide core and cladding to control the\nindex contrast in the vertical and horizontal directions, independently. The\nproposed dual-material geometry yields a substantially increased calculated\noverlap with the air (0.35) compared to the best-case scenario for a strip\nwaveguide (0.3). To experimentally demonstrate the potential of this approach,\nwe have implemented dual-metamaterial ring resonators, operating with the\ntransverse-magnetic polarized mode in 220-nm-thick waveguides with air as\nupper-cladding. Micro-ring resonators implemented with strip and\ndual-metamaterial waveguides exhibit the same measured quality factors, near\n30,000.

Hundreds of\npapers have either proposed new feature attribution methods, discussed or\nharnessed these tools in their work. However, despite humans being the target\nend-users, most attribution methods were only evaluated on proxy\nautomatic-evaluation metrics (Zhang et al. 2018; Zhou et al. 2016; Petsiuk et\nal. 2018). In this paper, we conduct the first user study to measure\nattribution map effectiveness in assisting humans in ImageNet classification\nand Stanford Dogs fine-grained classification, and when an image is natural or\nadversarial (i.e., contains adversarial perturbations). Overall, feature\nattribution is surprisingly not more effective than showing humans nearest\ntraining-set examples.

In these recommendation systems, warm users\n(items) have privileged collaborative signals of interaction records compared\nto cold start users (items), and these Collaborative Filtering (CF) signals are\nshown to have competing performance for recommendation. Many researchers\nproposed to learn the correlation between collaborative signal embedding space\nand the attribute embedding space to improve the cold start recommendation, in\nwhich user and item categorical attributes are available in many online\nplatforms. However, the cold start recommendation is still limited by two\nembedding spaces modeling and simple assumptions of space transformation. As\nuser-item interaction behaviors and user (item) attributes naturally form a\nheterogeneous graph structure, in this paper, we propose a privileged graph\ndistillation model~(PGD).

Here, we consider a new secular\ndynamics for the inner planets, with the aim of retaining a fundamental set of\ninteractions responsible for their chaotic behaviour, while being consistent\nwith the predictions of the most precise orbital solutions currently available.\nWe exploit the regularity in the secular motion of the outer planets, to\npredetermine a quasi-periodic solution for their orbits. This reduces the\nsecular phase space to the degrees of freedom dominated by the inner planets.\nOn top of that, the smallness of the inner planet masses and the absence of\nstrong mean-motion resonances permits to restrict ourselves to first-order\nsecular averaging. The resulting dynamics can be integrated numerically in a\nvery efficient way through Gauss's method, while computer algebra allows for\nanalytical inspection of planet interactions, once the Hamiltonian is truncated\nat a given total degree in eccentricities and inclinations.

Most of these papers assume that the function\nmapping shared representations to predictions is linear, for both source and\ntarget tasks. In practice, researchers in deep learning use different numbers\nof extra layers following the pretrained model based on the difficulty of the\nnew task. This motivates us to ask whether diversity can be achieved when\nsource tasks and the target task use different prediction function spaces\nbeyond linear functions.

The question is whether\nnon-explosion, with possibly additional assumptions, implies strong\ncompleteness. Strong completeness of an SDE implies that its solution depends\ncontinuously on the initial condition, opening up possibility for numerical\nsolutions, and the existence of a perfect Cocycle (a basic assumption on random\ndynamical systems). This was known only for compact manifolds and for linear\nstate spaces, methods for either are not applicable to a general space. We also\nobtain existence of the global smooth solution flow of SDEs on $R^n$ (sometimes\nallowing substantial growth of the derivative of the coefficients, removing the\nglobal Lipschitz continuity condition). Non-explosion, the $C_0$-property, and\nthe derivative flow are studied.\n  We showed Bismut-Witten Laplacians are essentially self-adjojnt, paving the\nway for studying theirs semigroups acting on functions and on differential\nforms.

The existence\nof an approximating sequence of one qubit quantum gates is guaranteed by the\nSolovay-Kitaev theorem, which implies sub-optimal algorithms to establish it\nexplicitly.

We\ndesign an algorithm to find such patterns by pursuing the insensitivity in the\nfeature space. A direct application of the dominant patterns is the Universal\nAdversarial Perturbations(UAPs). Numerical experiments show that the found\ndominant patterns defeat state-of-the-art UAP methods, especially in label-free\nsettings.

Polarization signals from some LABs have been discovered, and\nthis is commonly interpreted as strong evidence supporting that the extended\nLy-alpha emission originates from the resonance scattering. The Monte Carlo\nLy-alpha radiative transfer code LaRT is updated to investigate the\npolarization of Ly-alpha using the Stokes vector formalism. We apply LaRT to a\nfew models to explore the fundamental polarization properties of Ly-alpha.\nInterestingly, individual Ly-alpha photon packets are found to be almost\ncompletely polarized by a sufficient number of scatterings (N_scatt > 10^4-10^5\nin a static medium) or Doppler shifts induced by gas motion, even starting from\nunpolarized light. It is also found that the polarization pattern can exhibit a\nnon-monotonically increasing pattern in some cases, besides the commonly-known\ntrend that the polarization monotonically increases with radius. The\npolarization properties are primarily determined by the degree of polarization\nof individual photon packets and the anisotropy of the Ly-alpha radiation\nfield, which are eventually controlled by the medium's optical depth and\nvelocity field. If once Ly-alpha photon packets achieve ~100% polarization, the\nradial profile of polarization appears to correlate with the surface brightness\nprofile. A steep surface brightness profile tends to yield a rapid increase of\nthe linear polarization near the Ly-alpha source location.

Such\nflexibility has many benefits; however, it also requires solving the problem of\nfinding the optimal splits of functions of the BSs in such a way that minimizes\nthe total network cost. The underlying vRAN system is complex and precise\nmodelling of it is not trivial. Formulating the functional split problem to\nminimize the cost results in a combinatorial problem that is provably NP-hard,\nand solving it is computationally expensive. In this paper, a constrained deep\nreinforcement learning (RL) approach is proposed to solve the problem with\nminimal assumptions about the underlying system. Since in deep RL, the action\nselection is the outcome of inference of a neural network, it can be done in\nreal-time while training to update the neural networks can be done in the\nbackground. However, since the problem is combinatorial, even for a small\nnumber of functions, the action space of the RL problem becomes large.\nTherefore, to deal with such a large action space, a chain rule-based\nstochastic policy is exploited in which a long short-term memory (LSTM)\nnetwork-based sequence-to-sequence model is applied to estimate the policy that\nis selecting the functional split actions. However, the utilized policy is\nstill limited to an unconstrained problem, and each split decision is bounded\nby vRAN's constraint requirements. Hence, a constrained policy gradient method\nis leveraged to train and guide the policy toward constraint satisfaction.\nFurther, a search strategy by greedy decoding or temperature sampling is\nutilized to improve the optimality performance at the test time.

We thus incorporate estimation methods into scheduling to\npredict the gradient norm.

It is found that accounting for crown and root\nplasticity creates more realistic links between spatial and non-spatial models\nthan simply ignoring spatial structure. The article reviews also the connection\nbetween distance-independent models and size distributions, and how\ndistributions evolve over time and relate to whole-stand descriptions. In\naddition, some ways in which stand-level knowledge feeds back into detailed\nindividual-tree formulations are demonstrated. The presentation intends to be\naccessible to non-specialists.\n  Study implications: Introducing plasticity improves the representation of\nphysio-ecological processes in spatial modelling.

The\nautomatic classification of smart contracts can provide blockchain users with\nkeyword-based contract searching and helps to manage smart contracts\neffectively. Current research on smart contract classification focuses on\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) solutions which are based on contract source\ncode. However, more than 94% of smart contracts are not open-source, so the\napplication scenarios of NLP methods are very limited. Meanwhile, NLP models\nare vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

Our experimental studies on over 3,300 real-world Ethereum smart\ncontracts show that our model can classify smart contracts without source code\nand has better performance than baseline models.

Prior\nCSI-based indoor positioning work has relied on non-parametric approaches using\ndigital signal-processing (DSP) and, more recently, parametric approaches\n(e.g., fully supervised ML methods). However these do not handle the complexity\nof real-world environments well and do not meet requirements for large-scale\ncommercial deployments: the accuracy of DSP-based method deteriorates\nsignificantly in non-line-of-sight conditions, while supervised ML methods need\nlarge amounts of hard-to-acquire centimeter accuracy position labels. In\ncontrast, WiCluster is precise, requires weaker label-information that can be\neasily collected, and works well in non-line-of-sight conditions. Our first\ncontribution is a novel dimensionality reduction method for charting. It\ncombines a triplet-loss with a multi-scale clustering-loss to map the\nhigh-dimensional CSI representation to a 2D/3D latent space. Our second\ncontribution is two weakly supervised losses that map this latent space into a\nCartesian map, resulting in meter-accuracy position results.
