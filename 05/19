Through the process,\nthe authors establish the equivalence between the SDRT method and the\nFlux-Reconstruction (FR) approach under the assumption of the linearity of the\nflux and the mesh uniformity. Such a connection allows to build a new family of\nFR schemes for two and three-dimensional simplexes and also to recover the\nwell-known FR-SD method with tensor-product elements. In addition, a thorough\nanalysis of the numerical dissipation and dispersion of both aforementioned\nschemes and the nodal Discontinuous Galerkin FR (FR-DG) method with two and\nthree-dimensional elements is proposed through the use of the combined-mode\nFourier approach. SDRT is shown to possess an enhanced temporal linear\nstability regarding the FR-DG. On the contrary, SDRT displays larger\ndissipation and dispersion errors with respect to FR-DG. Finally, the study is\nconcluded with a set of numerical experiments, the linear advection-diffusion\nproblem, the Isentropic Euler Vortex and the Taylor-Green Vortex (TGV). The\nlatter test case shows that SDRT schemes present a non-linear unstable behavior\nwith simplex elements and certain polynomial degrees. For the sake of\ncompleteness, the matrix form of the SDRT method is developed and the\ncomputational performance of SDRT with respect to FR schemes is evaluated using\nGPU architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 16:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

However, due to\nthe high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these\ntasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies\nin predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing\nfeature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order\ncross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing\nmethods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model\narchitecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with\nequal weights. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel\narchitecture Deep Cross Attentional Product Network (DCAP), which keeps cross\nnetwork's benefits in modeling high-order feature interactions explicitly at\nthe vector-wise level. Beyond that, it can differentiate the importance of\ndifferent cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head\nattention mechanism and Product Neural Network (PNN), allowing practitioners to\nperform a more in-depth analysis of user behaviors. Additionally, our proposed\nmodel can be easily implemented and train in parallel. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets.

This paper proposes a\nTransprecise Object Detector (TOD) which maximises the real-time object\ndetection accuracy on an edge device by selecting an appropriate Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN) on the fly with negligible computational overhead. TOD makes two\nkey contributions over the state of the art: (1) TOD leverages characteristics\nof the video stream such as object size and speed of movement to identify\nnetworks with high prediction accuracy for the current frames; (2) it selects\nthe best-performing network based on projected accuracy and computational\ndemand using an effective and low-overhead decision mechanism. Experimental\nevaluation on a Jetson Nano demonstrates that TOD improves the average object\ndetection precision by 34.7 % over the YOLOv4-tiny-288 model on average over\nthe MOT17Det dataset. In the MOT17-05 test dataset, TOD utilises only 45.1 % of\nGPU resource and 62.7 % of the GPU board power without losing accuracy,\ncompared to YOLOv4-416 model. We expect that TOD will maximise the application\nof edge devices to real-time object detection, since TOD maximises real-time\nobject detection accuracy given edge devices according to dynamic input\nfeatures without increasing inference latency in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 16:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Its wide deployment, however, must first address the tension between\ninference accuracy and resource (compute/network) cost. This has led to the\ndevelopment of video analytics pipelines (VAPs), which reduce resource cost by\ncombining DNN compression/speedup techniques with video processing heuristics.\nOur measurement study on existing VAPs, however, shows that today's methods for\nevaluating VAPs are incomplete, often producing premature conclusions or\nambiguous results. This is because each VAP's performance varies substantially\nacross videos and time (even under the same scenario) and is sensitive to\ndifferent subsets of video content characteristics.\n  We argue that accurate VAP evaluation must first characterize the complex\ninteraction between VAPs and video characteristics, which we refer to as VAP\nperformance clarity. We design and implement Yoda, the first VAP benchmark to\nachieve performance clarity. Using primitive-based profiling and a carefully\ncurated benchmark video set, Yoda builds a performance clarity profile for each\nVAP to precisely define its accuracy/cost tradeoff and its relationship with\nvideo characteristics. We show that Yoda substantially improves VAP evaluations\nby (1) providing a comprehensive, transparent assessment of VAP performance and\nits dependencies on video characteristics; (2) explicitly identifying\nfine-grained VAP behaviors that were previously hidden by large performance\nvariance; and (3) revealing strengths/weaknesses among different VAPs and new\ndesign opportunities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 17:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

LightGBM has the R2 score of 0.94, 0.94,\nand 0.94 for 1-day ahead, 15-day ahead, and 30-day ahead prediction. Similarly,\nExtra Trees (ET) has an R2 score of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.85 for 1-day ahead,\n15-day ahead, and 30 day ahead prediction. In case of the test dataset,\nLightGBM has R2 score of 0.94, 0.94, and 0.94 for 1-day ahead, 15-day ahead and\n30-day ahead prediction. ET has R2 score of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.85 for 1-day\nahead, 15-day ahead, and 30-day ahead prediction. A similar R2 score for both\ntraining and the test dataset suggests that the machine learning models\ndeveloped in this paper are robust. Since the LightGBM algorithm outperforms ET\nfor all the windows tested, it is taken as the final algorithm. Note that the\nperformance of both methods does not decrease significantly as the forecast\nhorizon increases. Likewise, the proposed method outperforms the numerical\napproaches included in this paper in the test dataset.

However, the NV centre is a poor source of coherent single photons\nowing to a long radiative lifetime, a small branching ratio into the\nzero-phonon line (ZPL) and a poor extraction efficiency out of the high-index\nhost material. In principle, these three shortcomings can be addressed by\nresonant coupling to a single mode of an optical cavity. Utilising the\nweak-coupling regime of cavity electrodynamics, resonant coupling between the\nZPL and a single cavity-mode enhances the transition rate and branching ratio\ninto the ZPL. Furthermore, the cavity channels the light into a well-defined\nmode thereby facilitating detection with external optics. Here, we present an\nopen Fabry-Perot microcavity geometry containing a single-crystal diamond\nmembrane, which operates in a regime where the vacuum electric field is\nstrongly confined to the diamond membrane.

Although the process is\ngeneric and can be used for a variety of TCOs and wide-bandgap semiconductors,\nwe focus herein on Indium Doped Tin Oxide (ITO) as the most extended in the\nprevious applications. This protocol combines widely applied deposition\ntechniques such as thermal evaporation for the formation of organic nanowires\nserving as 1D and 3D soft templates, deposition of polycrystalline layers by\nmagnetron sputtering, and removal of the template by simply annealing under\nmild vacuum conditions. The process variables are tuned to control the\nstoichiometry, morphology, and alignment of the ITO nanotubes and nanotrees.\nFour-probe characterization reveals the improved lateral connectivity of the\nITO nanotrees and applied on individual nanotubes shows resistivities as low as\n3.5 +/- 0.9 x 10-4 {\\Omega}.cm, a value comparable to single-crystalline\ncounterparts. The assessment of diffuse reflectance and transmittance in the\nUV-VIS range confirms the viability of the supported ITO nanotubes as a random\noptical media working as strong scattering layers. Further ability to form ITO\nnanotrees opens the path for practical applications as ultra-broadband\nabsorbers in the NIR. The demonstrated low resistivity and optical properties\nof these ITO nanostructures open the way for their use in LEDs, IR shield,\nenergy harvesting, nanosensors, and photoelectrochemical applications\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 18:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

Thus, increasing the amount of renewable energy is a\nkey step to carbon neutrality. However, integrating a large amount of\nfluctuating renewable generation is a significant challenge for power grid\noperating and planning. Grid reliability, i.e., an ability to meet operational\nconstraints under power fluctuations, is probably the most important of them.\nIn this paper, we propose computationally efficient and accurate methods to\nestimate the probability of failure, i.e. reliability constraints violation,\nunder a known distribution of renewable energy generation. To this end, we\ninvestigate an importance sampling approach, a flexible extension of\nMonte-Carlo methods, which adaptively changes the sampling distribution to\ngenerate more samples near the reliability boundary. The approach allows to\nestimate failure probability in real-time based only on a few dozens of random\nsamples, compared to thousands required by the plain Monte-Carlo.

We develop and examine the mathematical properties of two\ndistinct informationally light strategies, a novel global strategy and local\nstrategy, that yield higher degree nodes in virtually any network structure. We\nfurther identify a novel network property called Inversity, whose sign\ndetermines which of the two strategies, local or global, will be most effective\nfor a network. We demonstrate that local and global strategies obtain a\nseveral-fold improvement in node degree relative to a random selection\nbenchmark for generated and real networks (including contact, affiliation and\nonline networks).

We present observations and new results that help rationalize the\napplication of these areas to queueing systems.\n  We prove that the MaxWeight and BackPressure policies are an application of\nBlackwell's Approachability Theorem. This connects queueing theoretic results\nwith adversarial learning. We then discuss the requirements of statistical\nlearning for service parameter estimation. As an example, we show how queue\nsize regret can be bounded when applying a perceptron algorithm to classify\nservice. Next, we discuss the role of state information in improved decision\nmaking. Here we contrast the roles of epistemic information (information on\nuncertain parameters) and aleatoric information (information on an uncertain\nstate).

Ad-hoc networks are generally modeled using random geometric graphs\n(RGGs).

A source node at the origin encodes $k$\ndata packets of information into $n\\ (>k)$ coded packets and transmits them to\nall its one-hop neighbors. The encoding is such that, any node that receives at\nleast $k$ out of the $n$ coded packets can retrieve the original $k$ data\npackets.

Our baseline achieves $86.36\\%$ top-1\nclassification accuracy on CUB-200-2011 dataset by utilizing random crop\naugmentation during training and center crop augmentation during testing. In\nthis work, we explore the usefulness of various pretext tasks, specifically,\nrotation, pretext invariant representation learning (PIRL), and deconstruction\nand construction learning (DCL) for FGVC.

We introduce an efficient on-lattice implementation with\nfinite particle volume and analyse its behaviour for three different geometries\nwith reflective boundary conditions. For sufficiently fine lattices, the model\nbehaviour does not differ between off-lattice and on-lattice implementation.\nThe reflective boundary conditions introduce an alignment of the particles with\nthe boundary for low levels of noise. Numerical sensitivity analysis of the\nswarming behaviour results in a detailed characterisation of the on-lattice\nVicsek model for confined geometries with reflective boundary conditions. In a\nchannel geometry, the boundary alignment causes swarms to move along the\nchannel. In a box, the edges act as swarm traps and the trapping shows a\ndiscontinuous noise dependence.

The latter corresponds\nto various engineering systems that involve purely cubic restoring force and\nabsence of linear stiffness even under the assumption of small oscillations,\nsuch as pre-tensioned metal wires and springs, and compliant structural\ncomponents made of polymer materials. This, in contrast to previous studies\nwhere the equivalent potential well could be treated as linear at first\napproximation under the assumption of small perturbations. Due to the strong\nnonlinearity of the current potential well, traditional analytical methods are\ninapplicable for describing the transient bounded and escape dynamics of the\nparticle. The latter is analyzed in the framework of isolated resonance\napproximation by canonical transformation to action-angle (AA) variables and\nthe corresponding reduced resonance manifold (RM). The escape envelope is\nformulated analytically. Surprisingly, despite the essential nonlinearity of\nthe well, it exhibits a universal property of a sharp minimum due to the\nexistence of multiple intersecting escape mechanisms. Unlike previous studies,\nthree underlying mechanisms that govern the transient dynamics of the particle\nwere identified: two maximum mechanisms and a saddle mechanism. The first two\ncorrespond to a gradual increase in the system's response amplitude for a\nproportional increase in the excitation intensity, and the latter corresponds\nto an abrupt increase in the system's response and therefore more potentially\nhazardous. The response of the particle is described in terms of energy-based\nresponse curves. The maximal transient energy is predicted analytically over\nthe space of excitation parameters and described using iso-energy contours. All\ntheoretical predictions are in complete agreement with numerical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 19:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

The popularity of an image can be\naffected by several factors, such as visual content, aesthetic quality, user,\npost metadata, and time. Thus, considering all these factors is essential for\naccurately predicting image popularity. In addition, the efficiency of the\npredictive model also plays a crucial role. In this study, motivated by\nmultimodal learning, which uses information from various modalities, and the\ncurrent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in various fields, we\npropose a deep learning model, called visual-social convolutional neural\nnetwork (VSCNN), which predicts the popularity of a posted image by\nincorporating various types of visual and social features into a unified\nnetwork model.

The representations\nare extracted from the final hidden state of the encoder and lie in the latent\nspace. A latent space transformation is applied for enhancing the quality of\nthe representations. Thus the clustering algorithm can easily separate samples\nbased on the features of these representations. Multiple filters are trained by\nthe features from their corresponding clusters, and the heterogeneity of the\ntraining data can be resolved accordingly. We conduct two sets of comparative\nexperiments on semantic parsing and machine translation, using the Geo-query\ndataset and Multi30k English-French to demonstrate the enhancement our model\nhas made respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 21:42:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 16:40:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 14:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

The CNN is trained with large\nsimulated datasets of intensity maps. The AGILE complex observing pattern due\nto the so-called 'spinning mode' is studied to prepare datasets to test and\nevaluate the CNN. A GRB emission model is defined from the Second Fermi-LAT GRB\ncatalogue and convoluted with the AGILE observing pattern. Different p-value\ndistributions are calculated evaluating with the CNN millions of\nbackground-only maps simulated varying the background level. The CNN is then\nused on real data to analyse the AGILE-GRID data archive, searching for GRB\ndetections using the trigger time and position taken from the Swift-BAT,\nFermi-GBM, and Fermi-LAT GRB catalogues. From these catalogues, the CNN detects\n21 GRBs with a significance $\\geq 3 \\sigma$, while the Li&Ma method detects\nonly two GRBs.

In particular, we explore the use of Gauss-Legendre\nand tanh-sinh methods and demonstrate that the quadrature algorithm inherits\ntheir high-order convergence rates. Under the action of $h$-refinement with $q$\nfixed, the quadrature schemes yield an order of accuracy of $2q$, where $q$ is\nthe one-dimensional node count; numerical experiments demonstrate up to 22nd\norder. Under the action of $q$-refinement with the geometry fixed, the\nconvergence is approximately exponential, i.e., doubling $q$ approximately\ndoubles the number of accurate digits of the computed integral.

We begin by\nreviewing the electronic structure of magic angle graphene's flat bands, in a\nlimit that exposes their peculiar band topology and geometry. We highlight how\nsimilarities between the flat bands and the lowest Landau level give insight\ninto the effect of interactions. For example, at certain fractional fillings,\nwe note the promise for realizing fractional Chern states. At integer fillings,\nthis approach points to flavor ordered insulators, which can be captured by a\nsigma-model in its ordered phase. Unexpectedly, topological textures of the\nsigma model carry electric charge which allows us to extend the same theory to\ndescribe the doped phases away from integer filling. We show how this approach\ncan lead to superconductivity on disordering the sigma model, and estimate the\nT$_c$ for the superconductor. We highlight the important role played by an\neffective super-exchange coupling both in pairing and in setting the effective\nmass of Cooper pairs.

The similarity\nbetween the query case and retrieved similar cases is determined by visual\nfeatures extracted from pathologically abnormal regions. However, the\nmanifestation of these regions often lacks specificity, i.e., different\ndiseases can have the same manifestation, and different manifestations may\noccur at different stages of the same disease. To combat the manifestation\nambiguity in medical instance retrieval, we propose a novel deep framework\ncalled Y-Net, encoding images into compact hash-codes generated from\nconvolutional features by feature aggregation. Y-Net can learn highly\ndiscriminative convolutional features by unifying the pixel-wise segmentation\nloss and classification loss. The segmentation loss allows exploring subtle\nspatial differences for good spatial-discriminability while the classification\nloss utilizes class-aware semantic information for good semantic-separability.\nAs a result, Y-Net can enhance the visual features in pathologically abnormal\nregions and suppress the disturbing of the background during model training,\nwhich could effectively embed discriminative features into the hash-codes in\nthe retrieval stage. Extensive experiments on two medical image datasets\ndemonstrate that Y-Net can alleviate the ambiguity of pathologically abnormal\nregions and its retrieval performance outperforms the state-of-the-art method\nby an average of 9.27\\% on the returned list of 10.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 01:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

Although\nthe three attacks were discovered in SSE several years ago, none of them has\nbeen well addressed in static power state systems. In this research, we propose\ntwo robust defense approaches against the above three efficient FDI attacks on\nDSE. Compared to existing approaches, our proposed approaches have three major\ndifferences and significant strengths: (1) they defend against the three FDI\nattacks on dynamic power state estimation rather than static power state\nestimation, (2) they give a robust estimator that can accurately extract a\nsubset of attack-free sensors for power state estimation, and (3) they adopt\nthe little-known Mahalanobis distance in the consistency check of power sensor\nmeasurements, which is different from the Euclidean distance used in all the\nexisting studies on power state estimation. We mathematically prove that the\nMahalanobis distance is not only useful but also much better than the Euclidean\ndistance in the consistency check of power sensor measurements. Our time\ncomplexity analysis shows that the two proposed robust defense approaches are\nefficient. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproaches, we compare them with the three well-known approaches: the least\nsquare approach, the Imhotep-SMT approach, and the MEE-UKF approach. Our\nextensive experiments show that the proposed approaches further reduce the\nestimation error by two orders of magnitude and four orders of magnitude\ncompared to the Imhotep-SMT approach and the least square approach,\nrespectively.

We begin by\naddressing the problem of how to make accurate estimates for optimistic\nestimators. We model these estimators as picking bottom-to-top paths in a\ncardinality estimation graph (CEG), which contains sub-queries as nodes and\nweighted edges between sub-queries that represent average degrees. We outline a\nspace of heuristics to make an optimistic estimate in this framework and show\nthat effective heuristics depend on the structure of the input queries. We\nobserve that on acyclic queries and queries with small-size cycles, using the\nmaximum-weight path is an effective technique to address the well known\nunderestimation problem for optimistic estimators. We show that on a large\nsuite of datasets and workloads, the accuracy of such estimates is up to three\norders of magnitude more accurate in mean q-error than some prior heuristics\nthat have been proposed in prior work. In contrast, we show that on queries\nwith larger cycles these estimators tend to overestimate, which can partially\nbe addressed by using minimum weight paths and more effectively by using an\nalternative CEG. We then show that CEGs can also model the recent pessimistic\nestimators. This surprising result allows us to connect two disparate lines of\nwork on optimistic and pessimistic estimators, adopt an optimization from\npessimistic estimators to optimistic ones, and provide insights into the\npessimistic estimators, such as showing that there are alternative\ncombinatorial solutions to the linear programs that define them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 01:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

Recent studies proposed\ndepths in a weighted product of two terms, describing the above two types of\nrandomness, respectively. In this paper, we propose to unify these two\nrandomnesses under one framework by a smoothing procedure. Basically, we\ntransform the point process observations into functions using conventional\nkernel smoothing methods, and then adopt the well-known functional $h$-depth\nand its modified, center-based, version to describe the center-outward rank in\nthe original data. To do so, we define a proper metric on the point processes\nwith smoothed functions. We then propose an efficient algorithm to estimated\nthe defined \"center\".

This chaotic system has five\ndimensions, which exhibit complex chaotic dynamics, thus enabling the\nutilization of chaotic signals in cryptography. A mathematical analysis is\npresented to demonstrate the dynamic characteristics of the proposed\nhyperchaotic system. A novel digital implementation of the proposed system is\npresented.

In this paper, we\npropose Graph Meta Embedding (GME) models that can rapidly learn how to\ngenerate desirable initial embeddings for new ad IDs based on graph neural\nnetworks and meta learning. Previous works address this problem from the new ad\nitself, but ignore possibly useful information contained in existing old ads.\nIn contrast, GMEs simultaneously consider two information sources: the new ad\nand existing old ads. For the new ad, GMEs exploit its associated attributes.\nFor existing old ads, GMEs first build a graph to connect them with new ads,\nand then adaptively distill useful information. We propose three specific GMEs\nfrom different perspectives to explore what kind of information to use and how\nto distill information. In particular, GME-P uses Pre-trained neighbor ID\nembeddings, GME-G uses Generated neighbor ID embeddings and GME-A uses neighbor\nAttributes.

Furthermore, these studies stated that\nreduced rainfall during the rainy season due to the El Nino Southern\nOscillation (ENSO) and the continuous increase in the maximum and average\ntemperatures were some of the effects of climate change in the Lake Toba\ncatchment area.

Despite its widespread use, few studies have\ndiscussed the influence of such softening on generalization. Here, we\ntheoretically show that the KL divergence loss focuses on the logit matching\nwhen tau increases and the label matching when tau goes to 0 and empirically\nshow that the logit matching is positively correlated to performance\nimprovement in general. From this observation, we consider an intuitive KD loss\nfunction, the mean squared error (MSE) between the logit vectors, so that the\nstudent model can directly learn the logit of the teacher model. The MSE loss\noutperforms the KL divergence loss, explained by the difference in the\npenultimate layer representations between the two losses. Furthermore, we show\nthat sequential distillation can improve performance and that KD, particularly\nwhen using the KL divergence loss with small tau, mitigates the label noise.\nThe code to reproduce the experiments is publicly available online at\nhttps://github.com/jhoon-oh/kd_data/.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 04:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

We developed a machine learning\nalgorithm, based on a deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), for continuous\nmanagement of oxygen flow rate for critical ill patients under intensive care,\nwhich can identify the optimal personalized oxygen flow rate with strong\npotentials to reduce mortality rate relative to the current clinical practice.\nBasically, we modeled the oxygen flow trajectory of COVID-19 patients and their\nhealth outcomes as a Markov decision process. Based on individual patient\ncharacteristics and health status, a reinforcement learning based oxygen\ncontrol policy is learned and real-time recommends the oxygen flow rate to\nreduce the mortality rate. We assessed the performance of proposed methods\nthrough cross validation by using a retrospective cohort of 1,372 critically\nill patients with COVID-19 from New York University Langone Health ambulatory\ncare with electronic health records from April 2020 to January 2021. The mean\nmortality rate under the RL algorithm is lower than standard of care by 2.57%\n(95% CI: 2.08- 3.06) reduction (P<0.001) from 7.94% under the standard of care\nto 5.37 % under our algorithm and the averaged recommended oxygen flow rate is\n1.28 L/min (95% CI: 1.14-1.42) lower than the rate actually delivered to\npatients. Thus, the RL algorithm could potentially lead to better intensive\ncare treatment that can reduce mortality rate, while saving the oxygen scarce\nresources. It can reduce the oxygen shortage issue and improve public health\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 04:49:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 00:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

However, many SVD-based applications\ncannot be well supported by existing federated SVD solutions. The crux is that\nthese solutions, adopting either differential privacy (DP) or homomorphic\nencryption (HE), suffer from accuracy loss caused by unremovable noise or\ndegraded efficiency due to inflated data.\n  In this paper, we propose FedSVD, a practical lossless federated SVD method\nover billion-scale data, which can simultaneously achieve lossless accuracy and\nhigh efficiency. At the heart of FedSVD is a lossless matrix masking scheme\ndelicately designed for SVD: 1) While adopting the masks to protect private\ndata, FedSVD completely removes them from the final results of SVD to achieve\nlossless accuracy; and 2) As the masks do not inflate the data, FedSVD avoids\nextra computation and communication overhead during the factorization to\nmaintain high efficiency. Experiments with real-world datasets show that FedSVD\nis over 10000 times faster than the HE-based method and has 10 orders of\nmagnitude smaller error than the DP-based solution on SVD tasks. We further\nbuild and evaluate FedSVD over three real-world applications: principal\ncomponents analysis (PCA), linear regression (LR), and latent semantic analysis\n(LSA), to show its superior performance in practice.

Sketch-based conditions can effectively describe the\ngeometry of faces, including the contours of facial components, hair\nstructures, as well as salient edges (e.g., wrinkles) on face surfaces but lack\neffective control of appearance, which is influenced by color, material,\nlighting condition, etc. To have more control of generated results, one\npossible approach is to apply existing disentangling works to disentangle face\nimages into geometry and appearance representations.

The resulting\nmethod can either extract the geometry and appearance representations from face\nimages, or directly extract the geometry representation from face sketches.\nSuch representations allow users to easily edit and synthesize face images,\nwith decoupled control of their geometry and appearance.

However, the large volume of intermediate results generated\nduring inference poses a significant challenge to the accelerator design for\nresource-constraint FPGA. Due to the limited on-chip storage, partial results\nof intermediate layers are frequently transferred back and forth between\non-chip memory and off-chip DRAM, leading to a non-negligible increase in\nlatency and energy consumption. In this paper, we propose block convolution, a\nhardware-friendly, simple, yet efficient convolution operation that can\ncompletely avoid the off-chip transfer of intermediate feature maps at\nrun-time. The fundamental idea of block convolution is to eliminate the\ndependency of feature map tiles in the spatial dimension when spatial tiling is\nused, which is realized by splitting a feature map into independent blocks so\nthat convolution can be performed separately on individual blocks. We conduct\nextensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed block\nconvolution on both the algorithm side and the hardware side. Specifically, we\nevaluate block convolution on 1) VGG-16, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and MobileNet-V1\nfor ImageNet classification task; 2) SSD, FPN for COCO object detection task,\nand 3) VDSR for Set5 single image super-resolution task.

Here, we investigate thermal conductivity and elastic modulus of\nnitrogenated holey graphene (C2N) using passively fitted machine-learning\ninteratomic potentials (MLIPs), which depend on computationally inexpensive\nab-initio molecular dynamics trajectories. Thermal conductivity of C2N is\ninvestigated via MLIP-based non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations\n(NEMD). At room temperature, the lattice thermal conductivity of 85.5 W/m-K and\neffective phonon mean free path of 37.16 nm are found. By carrying out uniaxial\ntension simulations, the elastic modulus, ultimate strength, and fractural\nstrain of C2N are predicted to be 390 GPa, 42 GPa, and 0.29, respectively. It\nis shown that the passively fitted MLIPs can be employed as an efficient\ninteratomic potential to obtain the thermal conductivity and elastic modulus of\nC2N utilizing classical MD simulations. Moreover, the possibility of employing\nMLIPs to simulate C2N with point defects has been investigated.

Although using the MLIP is more costly than classical\ninteratomic potentials, it could efficiently predict the thermal and mechanical\nproperties of 2D nanostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 06:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

Firstly, GMM is\nproposed to represent the probabilistic distribution functions (PDF) of\ndifferent PV modules' power outputs, and the parameter sets of which are\nobtained by Expectation Maximization algorithm. Secondly, a simplified explicit\nexpression for output power of PV modules, which highlights the influences of\ntilt and azimuth angles, is deduced based on the SPAM.

This task, among others, is frequently encountered in the\nnumerical simulation of three-phase flows when resorting to the geometric\nVolume-of-Fluid method. For two-phase flows, the recent work of Kromer & Bothe\n(doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2021.110776) addresses the positioning of a single plane\nby combining an implicit bracketing of the sought position with up to\nthird-order derivatives of the volume fraction. An analogous application of\ntheir highly efficient root-finding scheme to three-material configurations\nrequires computing the volume of a twice truncated arbitrary polyhedron. The\npresent manuscript achieves this by recursive application of the Gaussian\ndivergence theorem in appropriate form, which allows to compute the volume as a\nsum of quantities associated to the faces of the original polyhedron. With a\nsuitable choice of the coordinate origin, accounting for the sequential\ncharacter of the truncation, the volume parametrization becomes co-moving with\nrespect to the planes. This eliminates the necessity to establish topological\nconnectivity and tetrahedron decomposition after each truncation. After a\ndetailed mathematical description of the concept, we conduct a series of\ncarefully designed numerical experiments to assess the performance in terms of\npolyhedron truncations. The high efficiency of the two-phase positioning\npersists for sequential application, thereby being robust with respect to input\ndata and possible intersection topologies. In comparison to an existing\ndecomposition-based approach, the number of truncations was reduced by up to an\norder of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 07:52:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 07:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

To address this problem, a 2-user Gaussian Z-IC with secrecy\nconstraint at the receiver is considered. One of the fundamental problems here\nis how to use the secret key as a part of the encoding process. The paper\nproposes novel achievable schemes, where the schemes differ from each other\nbased on how the key has been used in the encoding process. The first\nachievable scheme uses one part of the key for one-time pad and remaining part\nof the key for wiretap coding. The encoding is performed such that the receiver\nexperiencing interference can decode some part of the interference without\nviolating the secrecy constraint. As a special case of the derived result, one\ncan obtain the secrecy rate region when the key is completely used for one-time\npad or part of the wiretap coding. The second scheme uses the shared key to\nencrypt the message using one-time pad and in contrast to the previous case no\ninterference is decoded at the receiver. The paper also derives an outer bound\non the sum rate and secrecy rate of the transmitter which causes interference.\nThe main novelty of deriving outer bound lies in the selection of side\ninformation provided to the receiver and using the secrecy constraint at the\nreceiver. The derived outer bounds are found to be tight depending on the\nchannel conditions and rate of the key. The scaling behaviour of key rate is\nalso explored for different schemes using the notion of secure GDOF. The\noptimality of different schemes is characterized for some specific cases. The\ndeveloped results show the importance of key rate splitting in enhancing the\nsecrecy performance of the system when users are operating under interference\nlimited environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 08:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

Relative to the high retail price, the wholesale price\nfor a supplier to produce high-tech components is low. Consequently, incentives\nare misaligned: the OEM faces relatively high under-stock costs and the\nsupplier faces high over-stock costs. In this paper, we examine supply\ncontracts that are intended to align the incentives between a high-tech OEM and\na supplier so that the supplier will invest adequate and yet non-verifiable\ncapacity to meet the OEM's uncertain demand. When focusing on a single\ngeneration, the manufacturer can coordinate a decentralized supply chain and\nextract all surplus by augmenting a traditional wholesale price contract with a\n\"contingent penalty\" should the supplier fail to fulfill the OEM's demand. When\nthe resulting penalty is too high to be enforceable, we consider a new class of\n\"contingent renewal\" wholesale price contracts with a stipulation: the OEM will\nrenew the contract with the incumbent supplier for the next generation only\nwhen the supplier can fulfill the demand for the current generation. By using\nnon-renewal as an implicit penalty, we show that the contingent renewal\ncontract can coordinate the supply chain.

Many traffic simulation software\npackages (Aimsun, SymuVia, Vissim, SUMO) are currently available for traffic\nimpact assessment of new technologies such as truckplatooning. However, to\nfully model and simulate the functionalities of such advanced technologies in\ndifferent simulation environments, several extensions need to be made to the\nsimulation platforms. In most cases, these extensions have to be programmed in\ndifferent programming languages (C++, Python) and each simulator has its own\nsimulator specific API. This makes it difficult to reuse software written for a\nspecific functionality in one simulation platform in a different simulation\nplatform. To overcome this issue, this paper presents a novel architecture for\ncross-platform simulation. The architecture is designed such that a specific\nfunctionality such as truck-platooning or any other functionality is made\nplatform independent. We designed a cross-platform architecture for simulating\na truck-platooning functionality using Vissim and SymuVia simulation software\nto determine the traffic flow effects of multi-brand truck platooning in the\ncontext of the EU project ENSEMBLE. In this draft paper, we present the\nstructure of the framework as well as some preliminary results from a simple\nsimulation performed with the cross-platform simulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 08:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

But they are difficult to generate due to multiple factors in practice\n(e.g., time, cost, radiation dose). To address these problems, multi-modality\nmedical image translation has aroused increasing research interest recently.\nHowever, the existing works mainly focus on translation effect of a whole image\ninstead of a critical target area or Region of Interest (ROI), e.g., organ and\nso on. This leads to poor-quality translation of the localized target area\nwhich becomes blurry, deformed or even with extra unreasonable textures. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel target-aware generative adversarial network\ncalled TarGAN, which is a generic multi-modality medical image translation\nmodel capable of (1) learning multi-modality medical image translation without\nrelying on paired data, (2) enhancing quality of target area generation with\nthe help of target area labels.

It is widely accepted\nthat a decreased HRV is associated to several risk factors and cardiovascular\ndiseases. However, a possible association between HRV and altered cerebral\nhemodynamics is still debated, suffering from HRV short-term measures and the\npaucity of high-resolution deep cerebral data. We propose a computational\napproach to evaluate the deep cerebral and central hemodynamics subject to\nphysiological alterations of HRV in an ideal young healthy patient at rest. The\ncardiovascular-cerebral model was validated and recently exploited to\nunderstand the hemodynamic mechanisms between cardiac arrythmia and cognitive\ndeficit. Three configurations (baseline, increased HRV, and decreased HRV) are\nbuilt based on the standard deviation (SDNN) of RR beats. In the cerebral\ncirculation, our results show that HRV has overall a stronger impact on\npressure than flow rate mean values but similarly alters pressure and flow rate\nin terms of extreme events. By comparing reduced and increased HRV, this latter\ninduces a higher probability of altered mean and extreme values, and is\ntherefore more detrimental at distal cerebral level. On the contrary, at\ncentral level a decreased HRV induces a higher cardiac effort without improving\nthe mechano-contractile performance, thus overall reducing the heart\nefficiency. Present results suggest that: (i) the increase of HRV per se does\nnot seem to be sufficient to trigger a better cerebral hemodynamic response;\n(ii) by accounting for both central and cerebral circulations, the optimal HRV\nconfiguration is found at baseline. Given the relation inversely linking HRV\nand HR, the presence of this optimal condition can contribute to explain why\nthe mean HR of the general population settles around the baseline value (70\nbpm).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 09:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

Moreover, novel compression algorithms have emerged.\n  In this paper, we revisit the problem of compression in disk-based\ncolumn-stores. More precisely, we study the I/O-RAM compression scheme which\nimplies that there are two types of pages of different size: disk pages\n(compressed) and in-memory pages (uncompressed). In this scheme, the buffer\nmanager is responsible for decompressing pages as soon as they arrive from\ndisk. This scheme is rather popular as it is easy to implement: several modern\ncolumn and row-stores use it.\n  We pose and address the following research questions: 1) Are heavy-weight\ncompression schemes still inappropriate for disk-based column-stores?, 2) Are\nnew light-weight compression algorithms better than the old ones?, 3) Is there\na need for SIMD-employing decompression algorithms in case of a disk-based\nsystem? We study these questions experimentally using a columnar query engine\nand Star Schema Benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 10:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

We describe in great detail a model of SMBBH system which considers\nthat both black holes have their accretion disc and additional line emitting\nregion(s).

We analyze the set of continuum and\nbroad line light curves for several full orbits of SMBBHs with different\nparameters, to test the possibility to extract the periodicity of the system.\nWe consider different levels of the signal-to-noise ratio, which is added to\nthe simulated spectra. Our analysis showed that the continuum and broad line\nprofiles emitted from an SMBBH system are strongly dependent, not only on the\nmass ratio of the components but also on the total mass of the system. We found\nthat the mean broad line profile and its rms could indicate the presence of an\nSMBBH. However, some effects caused by the dynamics of a binary system could be\nhidden due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we can conclude that the\nlong-term AGN monitoring campaigns could be beneficial for the detection of\nSMBBH candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 11:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

Such\nexponential functions play an important role in several problems in Uncertainty\nQuantification, e.g. the approximation of log-normal random fields or the\nevaluation of Bayesian posterior measures. Usually, these high-dimensional\nobjects are intractable numerically and can only be accessed pointwise in\nsampling methods. In contrast, the proposed method constructs a functional\nrepresentation of the exponential by exploiting its nature as a solution of an\nordinary differential equation. The application of a Petrov--Galerkin scheme to\nthis equation provides a tensor train representation of the solution for which\nwe derive an efficient and reliable a posteriori error estimator. Numerical\nexperiments with a log-normal random field and a Bayesian likelihood illustrate\nthe performance of the approach in comparison to other recent low-rank\nrepresentations for the respective applications. Although the present work\nconsiders only a specific differential equation, the presented method can be\napplied in a more general setting. We show that the composition of a generic\nholonomic function and a high-dimensional function corresponds to a\ndifferential equation that can be used in our method.

Herein, we reported a new kind of PCM micro\ntopological structure, design direction, and the ultra-flexible, form-stable\nand smart PCMs, polyrotaxane. The structure of polyrotaxane was fully confirmed\nby 1H nuclear magnetic resonance,attenuated total reflection-fourier transform\ninfrared and X-ray diffraction. Then the tensile properties,thermal stability\nin the air, phase change energy storage and shape memory properties of the\nfilms were systematically analyzed. The results showed that all the mechanical\nperformance, thermal stability in air and shape memory properties of\npolyrotaxanes were enhanced significantly compared to those of polyethylene\noxide (PEO). The form stability at temperatures above the melting point of PEO\nsignificantly increased with the {\\alpha}-CD addition. Further with the high\nphase transition enthalpy and excellent cycle performance, the polyrotaxane\nfilms are therefore promising sustainable and advanced form-stable phase change\nmaterials for thermal energy storage. Notably, its ultra-high flexibility,\nremolding ability and excellent shape memory properties provide a convenient\nway for the intelligent heat treatment packaging of complex and flexible\nelectronic devices.

Therefore, once\nperceptibility loss approaches its budget threshold, all points would be stock\nin the surface of hypersphere and attack would be locked in local optimality.\nTherefore, we propose a local aggressive adversarial attacks (L3A) to solve\nabove issues. Technically, we select a bunch of salient points, the high-score\nsubset of point cloud according to gradient, to perturb. Then a flow of\naggressive optimization strategies are developed to reinforce the unperceptive\ngeneration of adversarial examples toward misleading victim models. Extensive\nexperiments on PointNet, PointNet++ and DGCNN demonstrate the state-of-the-art\nperformance of our method against existing adversarial attack methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 12:22:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 02:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

Recently, contrastive learning, a self-supervised method,\nbecomes one of the most exciting learning paradigms and shows great potential\nwhen there are no labels. In this paper, we study the problem of\nself-supervised HGNNs and propose a novel co-contrastive learning mechanism for\nHGNNs, named HeCo. Different from traditional contrastive learning which only\nfocuses on contrasting positive and negative samples, HeCo employs\ncross-viewcontrastive mechanism. Specifically, two views of a HIN (network\nschema and meta-path views) are proposed to learn node embeddings, so as to\ncapture both of local and high-order structures simultaneously. Then the\ncross-view contrastive learning, as well as a view mask mechanism, is proposed,\nwhich is able to extract the positive and negative embeddings from two views.\nThis enables the two views to collaboratively supervise each other and finally\nlearn high-level node embeddings. Moreover, two extensions of HeCo are designed\nto generate harder negative samples with high quality, which further boosts the\nperformance of HeCo. Extensive experiments conducted on a variety of real-world\nnetworks show the superior performance of the proposed methods over the\nstate-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 13:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

The pivot of this work is to leverage the reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework to search objective metrics for regressing multiple\nheatmaps dynamically during the training process, thus avoiding setting\nproblem-specific target precision. We also introduce an early-stop strategy for\nactive termination of the RL agent's interaction that adapts the optimal\nprecision for separate targets considering exploration-exploitation tradeoffs.\nThis approach shows better stability in training and improved localization\naccuracy in inference. Extensive experimental results on two different\napplications of landmark localization: 1) our in-house prenatal ultrasound (US)\ndataset and 2) the publicly available dataset of cephalometric X-Ray landmark\ndetection, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our proposed\nframework is general and shows the potential to improve the efficiency of\nanatomical landmark detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 13:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

Such orbits are generally\nnon-Keplerian and orbital elements are not constants. Consequently, we use a\nmodified $N$-body integrator, which was significantly extended to include the\nmultipole expansion of the gravitational field up to the order $\\ell = 10$. Its\nconvergence was verified against the `brute-force' algorithm. We computed the\ncoefficients $C_{\\ell m},S_{\\!\\ell m}$ for Kleopatra's shape, assuming\na~constant bulk density. For solar-system applications, it was also necessary\nto implement a variable distance and geometry of observations. Our $\\chi^2$\nmetric then accounts for the absolute astrometry, the relative astrometry (2nd\nmoon with respect to 1st), angular velocities, and also silhouettes,\nconstraining the pole orientation. This allowed us to derive the orbital\nelements of Kleopatra's two moons. Using both archival astrometric data and new\nVLT/SPHERE observations (ESO LP 199.C-0074), we were able to identify the true\nperiods of the moons, $P_1 = (1.822359\\pm0.004156)\\,{\\rm d}$, $P_2 =\n(2.745820\\pm0.004820)\\,{\\rm d}$.

We also propose empirical\napplications on high-frequency FX rates, as well as on realized volatility\nseries, exploring the rough volatility concept in a forecasting perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 13:59:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 08:26:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 17:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

These methods\noften neglect individual source domains' discriminative characteristics and\ntheir relevances w.r.t. the unseen target domains, though both of which can be\nleveraged to help the model's generalization. To handle the above two issues,\nwe propose a novel method called the relevance-aware mixture of experts\n(RaMoE), using an effective voting-based mixture mechanism to dynamically\nleverage source domains' diverse characteristics to improve the model's\ngeneralization.

To address the problem, we propose\nan end-to-end graph view selection tool, G-View, which can judiciously generate\na view set from a query workload by exploring the graph properties of candidate\nviews and considering their efficacy. Specifically, given a graph query set and\na space budget, G-View translates each query to a candidate view pattern and\nchecks the query containment via a filtering-and-verification framework. G-View\nthen selects the views using a graph gene algorithm (GGA), which relies on a\nthree-phase framework that explores graph view transformations to reduce the\nview space and optimize the view benefit. Finally, G-View generates the\nextended graph views that persist all the edge-induced subgraphs to answer the\nsubgraph and supergraph queries simultaneously.

For the time\ndiscretization, the application of standard time stepping schemes that are\nbased on finite difference approximations of the time derivative is not\ndirectly possible, as the degrees of freedom may get active or inactive across\nsuch a finite difference stencil in time. In [Lehrenfeld, Olshanskii. An\nEulerian finite element method for PDEs in time-dependent domains.

In particular, regarding the humidity, the empirically least\nfavorable conditions for the survival of viral pathogens are found at\nintermediate humidities. However, the precise physico-chemical mechanisms that\ngenerate such least-favorable conditions are not understood yet. In this work,\nwe analyze the evaporation dynamics of respiratory-like droplets in air,\nsemi-levitating them on superhydrophobic substrates with minimal solid-liquid\ncontact area. Our results reveal that, compared to pure water droplets, the\nsalt dissolved in the droplets can significantly change the evaporation\nbehaviour, especially for high humidities close to and above the deliquesence\nlimit. Due to the hygroscopic properties of salt, water evaporation is\ninhibited once the salt concentration reaches a critical value that depends on\nthe relative humidity. The salt concentration in a stable droplet reaches its\nmaximum at around 75% relative humidity, generating conditions that might\nshorten the time in which pathogens remain infectious.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 14:46:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 13:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

So far, it is clear that the\nformer is strongly related to nestedness, while the latter is enhanced in\nmodular systems.

The Standard Solar Model,\nwhich gives a theoretical description of all nuclear processes which happen in\nour star, predicts that roughly 99% of the energy produced is coming from a\nseries of processes known as the \"pp chain\". Such processes have been studied\nin detail over the last years by means of neutrinos, thanks also to the\nimportant measurements provided by the Borexino experiment. The remaining 1% is\ninstead predicted to come from a separate loop-process, known as the \"CNO\ncycle\". This sub-dominant process is theoretically well understood, but has so\nfar escaped any direct observation. Another fundamental aspect is that the CNO\ncycle is indeed the main nuclear engine in stars more massive than the Sun. In\n2020, thanks to the unprecedented radio-purity and temperature control achieved\nby the Borexino detector over recent years, the first ever detection of\nneutrinos from the CNO cycle has been finally announced. The milestone result\nconfirms the existence of this nuclear fusion process in our Universe. Here,\nthe details of the detector stabilization and the analysis techniques adopted\nare reported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 15:41:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

The\nuse of different functionals and calculation methods influences the partial\ncharge distribution and the magnitude of the dipole moment of the solute, but\nnot the orientation of the dipole moment. Simulations based on the calculated\ncharge distributions show nearly the same relaxation behavior. Approximating\nthe whole solute molecule by a dipole results in the same relaxation behavior,\nbut lower solvation energies, indicating that the time scale of the Stokes\nshift does not depend on peculiarities of the solute. However, the SPC and\nTIP4P water models show too fast dynamics which can be ascribed to a too large\ndiffusion coefficient and too low viscosity. The calculated diffusion\ncoefficient and viscosity for the SWM4 and TIP4P/2005 model coincide well with\nexperimental values and the corresponding relaxation behavior is comparable to\nexperimental values.

In the present study, an agent-based\nAdversarial swarm model is developed comprising of two competing swarms, the\nAttackers and the Defenders, respectively. The Defender's aim is to protect a\npoint of interest in unbounded 2D Euclidean space referred to as the Goal. In\ncontrast, the Attacker's main task is to intercept the Goal while continually\ntrying to evade the Defenders, which gets attracted to it when they are in a\ncertain vicinity of the Goal termed as the sphere of influence, essentially a\ncircular perimeter. The interaction of the two swarms was studied from a\nDynamical systems perspective by changing the number of Agents making up each\nrespective swarm. The simulations were strongly investigated for the presence\nof chaos by evaluating the Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE), implementing phase\nspace reconstruction. The source of chaos in the system was observed to be\ninduced by the passively constrained motion of the Defender agents around the\nGoal. Multiple local equilibrium points existed for the Defenders in all the\ncases and some instances for the Attackers, indicating complex dynamics. LLEs\nfor all the trials of the Monte Carlo analysis in all the cases revealed the\npresence of chaotic and non-chaotic solutions in each case, respectively, with\nthe majority of the Defenders indicating chaotic behavior. Overall, the swarms\nexist in the 'Edge of chaos', thus revealing complex dynamical behavior. The\nfinal system state (i,e, the outcome of the interaction between the swarms in a\nparticular simulation) is studied for all the cases, which indicated the\npresence of binary final states in some. Finally, to evaluate the complexity of\nindividual swarms, Multiscale Entropy is employed, which revealed a greater\ndegree of randomness for the Defenders when compared to Attackers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 01:19:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

Since the NKE levels need not be fully\nfilled, it is argued that the concept of Dirac's Fermion Sea can be totally\nabandoned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 19:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

In this work,\nwe produce overlay targets with very small footprint, consisting of just a few\nscattering nanoparticles in two separate device layers. Using moir\\'e patterns\nto deterministically generate many overlay errors on a single chip, we\ndemonstrate successful readout of the relative displacement between the two\nlayers and show that calibration on one realization of the targets can be used\nfor overlay measurements on subsequent instances. Our results suggest using\ngreater quantities of smaller overlay targets may benefit performance both\ndirectly and through finer sampling of deformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 11:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

Meeting the contradictory\nrequirements of URLLC, i.e., ultra-reliability and low-latency, is considered\nto be very challenging, especially in bandwidth-limited scenarios. Most\ncommunication strategies rely on hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) to\nimprove reliability at the expense of increased packet latency due to the\nretransmission of failing packets. To guarantee high-reliability and very low\nlatency simultaneously, we enhance HARQ retransmission mechanism to achieve\nreliability with guaranteed packet level latency and in-time delivery. The\nproposed non-orthogonal HARQ (N-HARQ) utilizes non-orthogonal sharing of time\nslots for conducting retransmission. The reliability and delay analysis of the\nproposed N-HARQ in the finite block length (FBL) regime shows very high\nperformance gain in packet delivery delay over conventional HARQ in both\nadditive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels. We also\npropose an optimization framework to further enhance the performance of N-HARQ\nfor single and multiple retransmission cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 15:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}
