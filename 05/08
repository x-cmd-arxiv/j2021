To investigate whether the formation of mono- and poly-cyclic\nmolecules observed in cold cores could form via the bottom-up reaction of\nubiquitous carbon-chain species with, e.g. atomic hydrogen, a search is made\nfor possible intermediates in data taken as part of the GOTHAM (GBT\nObservations of TMC-1 Hunting for Aromatic Molecules) project. Markov-Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) Source Models were run to obtain column densities and\nexcitation temperatures. Astrochemical models were run to examine possible\nformation routes, including a novel grain-surface pathway involving the\nhydrogenation of C$_6$N and HC$_6$N, as well as purely gas-phase reactions\nbetween C$_3$N and both propyne (CH$_3$CCH) and allene (CH$_2$CCH$_2$), as well\nas via the reaction CN + H$_2$CCCHCCH. We report the first detection of\ncyanoacetyleneallene (H$_2$CCCHC$_3$N) in space toward the TMC-1 cold cloud\nusing the Robert C. Byrd 100 m Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Cyanoacetyleneallene\nmay represent an intermediate between less-saturated carbon-chains, such as the\ncyanopolyynes, that are characteristic of cold cores and the more\nrecently-discovered cyclic species like cyanocyclopentadiene. Results from our\nmodels show that the gas-phase allene-based formation route in particular\nproduces abundances of H$_2$CCCHC$_3$N that match the column density of\n$2\\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ obtained from the MCMC Source Model, and that the\ngrain-surface route yields large abundances on ices that could potentially be\nimportant as precursors for cyclic molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 16:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}

They can potentially enhance system\nreliability and manage price volatility by modifying the amount or time of\nelectricity consumption. This paper proposes a novel game-theoretical model\naccounting for the relationship between retailers (leaders) and consumers\n(followers) in a dynamic price environment under uncertainty. The quality and\neconomic gains brought by the proposed procedure essentially stem from the\nutilization of demand elasticity in a hierarchical decision process that\nrenders the options of different market configurations under different sources\nof uncertainty. The model is solved under two frameworks: by considering the\nretailer's market power and by accounting for an equilibrium setting based on a\nperfect competitive game. These are formulated in terms of a mathematical\nprogram with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and with a mixed-integer linear\nprogram (MILP), respectively. In particular, the retailers' market power model\nis first formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, and the MPEC is\nsubsequently derived by replacing the consumers' problem (lower level) with its\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions. In contrast, the equilibrium\nmodel is solved as a MILP by concatenating the retailer's and consumers' KKT\noptimality conditions.

We also find that\nthe magnetic braking extracts the angular momentum from the core and suppresses\nfragmentation depending on the initial strength of the magnetic field. The\nangular momentum transport by the magnetic outflows is less effective than that\nby the magnetic braking because the outflows are launched only in a late phase\nof the collapse.

In this paper, we use the large spectroscopic sample of\nmetal-poor stars from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) to identify CEMP\nstars ([C/Fe] > +0.7) in the bulge region and to derive a CEMP fraction. We\nidentify 96 new CEMP stars in the inner Galaxy, of which 62 are very metal-poor\n([Fe/H] < -2.0); this is more than a ten-fold increase compared to the seven\npreviously known bulge CEMP stars. The cumulative fraction of CEMP stars in\nPIGS is $42^{\\,+14\\,}_{\\,-13} \\%$ for stars with [Fe/H] < -3.0, and decreases\nto $16^{\\,+3\\,}_{\\,-3} \\%$ for [Fe/H] < -2.5 and $5.7^{\\,+0.6\\,}_{\\,-0.5} \\%$\nfor [Fe/H] < -2.0. The PIGS inner Galaxy CEMP fraction for [Fe/H] < -3.0 is\nconsistent with the halo fraction found in the literature, but at higher\nmetallicities the PIGS fraction is substantially lower. While this can partly\nbe attributed to a photometric selection bias, such bias is unlikely to fully\nexplain the low CEMP fraction at higher metallicities. Considering the typical\ncarbon excesses and metallicity ranges for halo CEMP-s and CEMP-no stars, our\nresults point to a possible deficiency of both CEMP-s and CEMP-no stars\n(especially the more metal-rich) in the inner Galaxy. The former is potentially\nrelated to a difference in the binary fraction, whereas the latter may be the\nresult of a fast chemical enrichment in the early building blocks of the inner\nGalaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

The radiative Auger process gives rise to weak\nred-shifted satellite peaks in the optical emission spectrum. These satellite\npeaks have been observed over a large spectral range: in the X-ray emission of\natoms; close to visible frequencies on donors in semiconductors and quantum\nemitters; and at infrared frequencies as shake-up lines in two-dimensional\nsystems. So far, all the work on the radiative Auger process has focussed on\ndetecting the spontaneous emission. However, the fact that the radiative Auger\nprocess leads to photon emission suggests that the transition can also be\noptically excited. In such an inverted radiative Auger process, excitation\nwould correspond to simultaneous photon absorption and electronic\nde-excitation.

In particular, we show that imposing girth conditions on a\nparity-check matrix is equivalent to imposing conditions on a square submatrix\nobtained from it and we show how this equivalence is particularly strong for a\nprotograph based parity-check matrix of variable node degree 2, where the\ncycles in its Tanner graph correspond one-to-one to the cycles in the Tanner\ngraph of a square submatrix obtained by adding the permutation matrices (or\nproducts of these) in the composition of the parity-check matrix. We end the\npaper with exemplary constructions of codes with various girths and computer\nsimulations. Although, we mostly assume the case of fully connected protographs\nof variable node degree 2 and 3, the results can be used for any parity-check\nmatrix/protograph-based Tanner graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 18:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

New advances in vision-based human pose-estimation\nhave opened possibilities for frequent and unobtrusive analysis of gait in\nresidential settings. This work leverages novel spatial-temporal graph\nconvolutional network (ST-GCN) architectures and training procedures to predict\nclinical scores of parkinsonism in gait from video of individuals with\ndementia. We propose a two-stage training approach consisting of a\nself-supervised pretraining stage that encourages the ST-GCN model to learn\nabout gait patterns before predicting clinical scores in the finetuning stage.\nThe proposed ST-GCN models are evaluated on joint trajectories extracted from\nvideo and are compared against traditional (ordinal, linear, random forest)\nregression models and temporal convolutional network baselines. Three 2D human\npose-estimation libraries (OpenPose, Detectron, AlphaPose) and the Microsoft\nKinect (2D and 3D) are used to extract joint trajectories of 4787 natural\nwalking bouts from 53 older adults with dementia. A subset of 399 walks from 14\nparticipants is annotated with scores of parkinsonism severity on the gait\ncriteria of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the\nSimpson-Angus Scale (SAS). Our results demonstrate that ST-GCN models operating\non 3D joint trajectories extracted from the Kinect consistently outperform all\nother models and feature sets.

For typical energies at play,\nthis process will up-scatter the CMB photons into the X-ray band, and is thus\nexpected to yield a redshift-dependent, concurrent X-ray brightening and radio\ndimming of the jet-powered structures. Here we show how a conclusive proof of\nthis effect hinges on high-resolution imaging data in which the extended lobes\ncan be distinguished from the compact hot spots where synchrotron-self-Compton\ndominates the X-ray emission regardless of redshift.

In this\nwork, we will focus on the space limited by the exit and the obstacles (i.e.\nthe vestibule structure). We analyzed two different types of vestibules: the\ntwo-entry vestibule (which consists of a single panel-like obstacle) and the\nthree-entry vestibule (which consists of two panel-like obstacles). In the\nformer, we studied the effects of varying the walls' friction coefficient\n$\\kappa_w$ and the distance from the obstacle to the exit door $d$. In the\nlatter, we varied the space between the two panels (gap). We found that the\nthree above mentioned parameters control the vestibule's density, which\nsubsequently affects the evacuation flow (fundamental diagram). We have also\nfound that reducing the distance $d$ or increasing the friction facilitates the\nformation of blocking clusters at the vestibule entries, and hence, diminishes\nthe density. If the density is too large or too low, the evacuation flow is\nsuboptimal, whereas if the density is around $2 \\pm 2$, the flow is maximized.\nOur most important result is that the density (and therefore the evacuation\nflow) can be precisely controlled by $\\kappa_w$, $d$, and the gap. Moreover,\nthe three-entry vestibule produced the highest evacuation flow for specific\nconfigurations of the gap and the distance from the panels to the door.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 18:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

With observational data, this\nassumption may be difficult to maintain, and in studies with panel data, many\nresearchers use fixed effects models to purge the data of time-constant\nunmeasured confounding. Unfortunately, traditional linear fixed effects models\nare not suitable for estimating the effects of time-varying treatments, since\nthey can only estimate lagged effects under implausible assumptions. To resolve\nthis tension, we a propose a novel inverse probability of treatment weighting\nestimator with propensity-score fixed effects to adjust for time-constant\nunmeasured confounding in marginal structural models of fixed-length treatment\nhistories. We show that these estimators are consistent and asymptotically\nnormal when the number of units and time periods grow at a similar rate.

In addition, we use dynamics randomization and adversary force\nperturbations including large human interaction forces during the training to\nfurther improve control robustness.

Contagion, or transmissibility of outcomes, complicates\nstandard conceptions of treatment interference in which an intervention\ndelivered to one individual can affect outcomes of others. Several statistical\nframeworks have been proposed to measure causal treatment effects in this\nsetting, including structural transmission models, mediation-based partnership\nmodels, and randomized trial designs. However, existing estimands for\ninfectious disease intervention effects are of limited conceptual usefulness:\nSome are parameters in a structural model whose causal interpretation is\nunclear, others are causal effects defined only in a restricted two-person\nsetting, and still others are nonparametric estimands that arise naturally in\nthe context of a randomized trial but may not measure any biologically\nmeaningful effect. In this paper, we describe a unifying formalism for defining\nnonparametric structural causal estimands and an identification strategy for\nlearning about infectious disease intervention effects in clusters of\ninteracting individuals when infection times are observed. The estimands\ngeneralize existing quantities and provide a framework for causal\nidentification in randomized and observational studies, including situations\nwhere only binary infection outcomes are observed. A semiparametric class of\npairwise Cox-type transmission hazard models is used to facilitate statistical\ninference in finite samples.

Specifically, we consider a physically-based,\nquadratic NHPP model for failures of overhead assets in electricity\ndistribution systems. The wind field velocities are provided by Forecasts of\nHurricanes using Large-Ensemble Outputs (FHLO), a framework for generating\nprobabilistic hurricane forecasts. We use FHLO in conjunction with the NHPP\nmodel, such that the hurricane forecast uncertainties represented by FHLO are\naccounted for in estimating the probability distributions of damage.\nFurthermore, we evaluate the spatial variability and extent of hurricane damage\nunder key wind field parameters (intensity, size, and asymmetries).

Increasing attention is being paid to\nridehailing platforms and connections between demand and continuous innovation\nin service features; one of these features is dynamic ride-pooling. To\ndisentangle how ridehailing impacts existing transportation networks and its\nability to support economic vitality and community livability it is essential\nto consider the distribution of demand across diverse communities. In this\npaper we expand the literature on ridehailing demand by exploring community\nvariation and spatial dependence in ridehailing use. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the diffusion and role of solo requests versus ride-pooling to shed\nlight on how different mobility services, with different environmental and\naccessibility implications, are used by diverse communities. This paper employs\na Social Disadvantage Index, Transit Access Analysis, and a Spatial Durbin\nModel to investigate the influence of both local and spatial spillover effects\non the demand for shared and solo ridehailing. The analysis of 127 million\nridehailing rides, of which 15% are pooled, confirms the presence of spatial\neffects. Results indicate that density and vibrancy variables have analogue\neffects, both direct and indirect, on demand for solo vs pooled rides.

In\nparticular, because Haskell lacks linear types, it is easy to write Quipper\nprograms that violate the non-cloning property of quantum states. In order to\nformalize relevant fragments of Quipper in a type-safe way, the Proto-Quipper\nfamily of research languages has been introduced over the last years.

To this end, we propose using an ensemble model wherein each\nspecialist module denoises noisy utterances from a distinct partition of\ntraining set speakers.

In particular, this method is inspired by the cohesion,\ncoordination, and behavior of ant colonies. As a result, these algorithms are\ndesigned to be naturally scalable to systems with numerous agents. While no\noptimality is guaranteed, the method is intended to work well in practice and\nscale better in efficacy with the number of agents present than others. The\napproach combines single-agent RL and an ant-colony-inspired decentralized,\nstigmergic algorithm for multi-agent path planning and environment\nmodification. Specifically, we apply this algorithm in a setting where agents\nmust navigate to a goal location, learning to push rectangular boxes into holes\nto yield new traversable pathways. It is shown that while the approach yields\npromising success in this particular environment, it may not be as easily\ngeneralized to others.

Because of the complexity of the results, it seems to be\ninstructive to divide our contributions to two parts. In contrast to the\nexisting literature, our effort is to advance the knowledge by allowing delay\nand past dependence, yielding essential utility to a wide range of\napplications. A long-standing question of fundamental importance pertaining to\nbiology and ecology is: What are the minimal necessary and sufficient\nconditions for long-term persistence and extinction (or for long-term\ncoexistence of interacting species) of a population? Regardless of the\nparticular applications encountered, persistence and extinction are properties\nshared by Kolmogorov systems. While there are many excellent treaties of\nstochastic-differential-equation-based Kolmogorov equations, the work on\nstochastic Kolmogorov equations with past dependence is still scarce. Our aim\nhere is to answer the aforementioned basic question. This work, Part (I), is\ndevoted to characterization of persistence, whereas its companion, Part (II)\n[45], is devoted to extinction. The main techniques used in this paper include\nthe newly developed functional It^o formula and asymptotic coupling and\nHarris-like theory for infinite dimensional systems specialized to functional\nequations. General theorems for stochastic functional Kolmogorov equations are\ndeveloped first. Then a number of applications are examined to obtain new\nresults substantially covering, improving, and extending the existing\nliterature. Furthermore, these conditions reduce to that of Kolmogorov systems\nwhen there is no past dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 01:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

Recent efforts attempted to\nincorporate attributed behavior sequence and heterogeneous network for\nextracting complex features of users and achieved significant effects on click\nfraud detection.

In this paper we\npresent a method for adaptive tuning of the low-dimensional latent space of\ndeep encoder-decoder style CNNs based on real-time feedback to quickly\ncompensate for unknown and fast distribution shifts. We demonstrate our\napproach for predicting the properties of a time-varying charged particle beam\nin a particle accelerator whose components (accelerating electric fields and\nfocusing magnetic fields) are also quickly changing with time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 03:50:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 05:02:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 13:03:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 16:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

A current challenge to fully\nunderstand this process is to predict how lipid bilayers deform upon\napplication of mechanical stress. In this context, it is now well established\nthat anionic lipids influence the function of many proteins. Here, we test the\nhypothesize that anionic lipids could indirectly modulate MS proteins by\nalteration of the lipid bilayer mechanical properties. Using all-atom molecular\ndynamics simulations, we computed the bilayer bending rigidity (K_C), the area\ncompressibility (K_A), and the surface shear viscosity ({\\eta}_m) of\nphosphocholine (PC) lipid bilayers containing or not phosphatidylserine (PS) or\nphosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) at physiological concentrations in the\nlower leaflet. Tensionless leaflets were first checked for each asymmetric\nbilayer model, and a formula for embedding an asymmetric channel in an\nasymmetric bilayer is proposed. Results from two different sized bilayers show\nconsistently that the addition of 20% surface charge in the lower leaflet of PC\nbilayer by PIP2 has minimal impact on its mechanical properties, while PS\nreduced the bilayer bending rigidity by 22%. As a comparison, supplementing the\nPIP2-enriched PC membrane with 30% cholesterol, a known rigidifying steroid\nlipid, produces a significant increase in all three mechanical constants.\nAnalysis of pairwise splay moduli suggests that the effect of anionic lipids on\nbilayer bending rigidity largely depends on the number of anionic lipid pairs\nformed during simulations. The potential implication of bilayer bending\nrigidity is discussed in the framework of mechanosensitive Piezo channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 03:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Quantum repeaters, i.e., untrusted, intermediate relay\nstations, are necessary to overcome the repeaterless bound which sets the\nfundamental rate-distance limit of repeaterless communications. In this work,\nwe introduce a continuous-variable protocol which overcomes the repeaterless\nbound and scales like the single-repeater bound using just one linear-optical\ndevice called a \"quantum scissor\", combining the entanglement distillation and\nentanglement swapping elements of previous repeater proposals into a single\nstep, thus, removing the need for quantum memories. Implementing a standard\ncontinuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol using our repeater we\npredict key rates which surpass the repeaterless bound. Our protocol works well\nfor non-ideal single-photon sources and non-ideal single-photon detectors, and\ncan tolerate some level of excess noise, making our protocol implementable with\nexisting technology. We show that our scheme can be extended to longer repeater\nchains using quantum memories, using less physical resources than previous\nschemes. Furthermore, for applications beyond key distribution, our scheme\ngeneralises to higher order and distils more entanglement at the cost of a\nreduced probability of success.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 04:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

Further, we devise a policy based on the\nprinciple of certainty equivalence, and demonstrate that under a continuous\nselection assumption and a certain regularity assumption on the TPMs, the\npolicy achieves the lower bound arbitrarily closely. Thus, while the lower\nbound is shown for all problem instances, the upper bound is shown only for\nthose problem instances satisfying the continuous selection and the regularity\nassumptions. Our achievability analysis is based on resolving the\nidentifiability problem in the context of a certain lifted countable-state\ncontrolled Markov process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 05:53:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 08:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

We address the problems of mean subtraction and DMD mode\nselection in the context of finite dimensional Koopman invariant subspaces.\n  Preprocessing of data by subtraction of the temporal mean of a time series\nhas been a point of contention in companion matrix-based DMD. This stems from\nthe potential of said preprocessing to render DMD equivalent to temporal DFT.\nWe prove that this equivalence is impossible in linearly consistent data, when\nthe order of the DMD-based representation of the dynamics exceeds the dimension\nof the system. Therefore, this parity of DMD and DFT can be indicative of an\ninadequacy of data, in the sense that the number of snapshots taken is not\nenough to represent the true dynamics of the system.\n  We then rigorously justify the practice of pruning DMD eigen-values based on\nthe norm of the respective modes. Once a minimum number of time delays has been\ntaken, DMD eigen-values corresponding to DMD modes with low norm are shown to\nbe spurious, and hence must be discarded. When dealing with mean-subtracted\ndata, the above criterion for detecting synthetic eigen-values can be applied\nif DMD is preceded by time delay embedding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 06:05:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 04:04:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 18:45:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 00:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

Specifically, we observe\nenhanced pairing fluctuations and a partial gap opening in the fermionic\nspectrum. However, the system remains non-superconducting until reaching a much\nlower temperature. In the pseudogap regime the system displays a \"gap-filling\"\nrather than \"gap-closing\" behavior, consistent with experimental observations.\nOur results provide the first unambiguous lattice model realization of a\npseudogap state in a strongly correlated system, driven by superconducting\nfluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 08:43:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 07:40:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 15:13:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

Methods. Small-scale ALMA bright features in the quiet Sun\nregion were analyzed using single-dish ALMA observations (1.21 mm, 248 GHz) and\nin an active region using interferometric ALMA measurements (3 mm, 100 GHz).\nWith the single-dish observations, a full-disk solar image is produced, while\ninterferometric measurements enable the high-resolution reconstruction of part\nof the solar disk, including the active region. The selected quiet Sun and\nactive regions are compared with the H-alpha (core and wing sum), EUV, and soft\nX-ray images and with the magnetograms. Results. In the quiet Sun region,\nenhanced emission seen in the ALMA is almost always associated with a strong\nline-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field. Four coronal bright points were identified,\nwhile other small-scale ALMA bright features are most likely associated with\nmagnetic network elements and plages. In the active region, in 14 small-scale\nALMA bright features randomly selected and compared with other images, we found\nfive good candidates for coronal bright points, two for plages, and five for\nfibrils. Two unclear cases remain: a fibril or a jet, and a coronal bright\npoint or a plage. A comparison of the H-alpha core image and the 3 mm ALMA\nimage of the analyzed active region showed that the sunspot appears dark in\nboth images (with a local ALMA radiation enhancement in sunspot umbra), the\nfour plage areas are bright in both images and dark small H-alpha filaments are\nclearly recognized as dark structures of the same shape also in ALMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 09:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Recently, deep metric\nlearning approaches that map the semantic similarity of images into an\nembedding (metric) space have been found very popular in RS. A common approach\nfor learning the metric space relies on the selection of triplets of similar\n(positive) and dissimilar (negative) images to a reference image called as an\nanchor. Choosing triplets is a difficult task particularly for multi-label RS\nCBIR, where each training image is annotated by multiple class labels. To\naddress this problem, in this paper we propose a novel triplet sampling method\nin the framework of deep neural networks (DNNs) defined for multi-label RS CBIR\nproblems. The proposed method selects a small set of the most representative\nand informative triplets based on two main steps. In the first step, a set of\nanchors that are diverse to each other in the embedding space is selected from\nthe current mini-batch using an iterative algorithm. In the second step,\ndifferent sets of positive and negative images are chosen for each anchor by\nevaluating the relevancy, hardness and diversity of the images among each other\nbased on a novel strategy. Experimental results obtained on two multi-label\nbenchmark archives show that the selection of the most informative and\nrepresentative triplets in the context of DNNs results in: i) reducing the\ncomputational complexity of the training phase of the DNNs without any\nsignificant loss on the performance; and ii) an increase in learning speed\nsince informative triplets allow fast convergence.

Hence the existence of \"fringe constrast\" or \"visibility\" in\ninterferometric observations can be used to put a limit on the possible\npresence of \\bhs along the flight path.\n  We give a formula for this effect and consider its application, particularly\nfor observations in cosmology. Under the assumption that the dark matter\nconsists of black holes, we consider sources at high z, up to the CMB. While\nthe strongest results are for the CMB as the most remote source, more nearby\nsources at high z lead to similar effects.\n  The effect increases with the baseline, and in the limiting case of the CMB\nwe find that with earth-size baselines a non-zero \"visibility\" would limit the\nmass of possible primordial black holes, to approximately $M/M_\\odot \\leq\n10^{-1}$.

For this\nreason, radio fingerprinting (RFP) is a compelling approach that leverages the\nunique imperfections in the tag's wireless circuitry to achieve large-scale\nRFID clone detection. Recent work, however, has unveiled that time-varying\nchannel conditions can significantly decrease the accuracy of the RFP process.\nWe propose the first large-scale investigation into RFP of RFID tags with\ndynamic channel conditions. Specifically, we perform a massive data collection\ncampaign on a testbed composed by 200 off-the-shelf identical RFID tags and a\nsoftware-defined radio (SDR) tag reader.

We use this rich dataset to train and\ntest several convolutional neural network (CNN)--based classifiers in a variety\nof channel conditions. Our investigation reveals that training and testing on\ndifferent channel conditions drastically degrades the classifier's accuracy.\nFor this reason, we propose a novel training framework based on federated\nmachine learning (FML) and data augmentation (DAG) to boost the accuracy.\nExtensive experimental results indicate that (i) our FML approach improves\naccuracy by up to 48%; (ii) our DA approach improves the FML performance by up\nto 31%.

It is known that any localized initial\nexcitation in a large enough linear disordered system spreads for a finite\namount of time and then halts forever. This phenomenon is called Anderson\nlocalization (AL). What happens to AL when nonlinearity is introduced is an\ninteresting question which has been considered in several studies over the past\ndecades.

As the\nspreading of initially localized wave packets is a non-equilibrium\nthermalization process related to the ergodic and chaotic properties of the\nsystem, in our work we investigate the properties of chaos studying the\nbehavior of observables related to the system's tangent dynamics.

Our results show that (1) these attacks\nproduce poisoned datasets in which the poisoned and clean data are incompatible\nand (2) our technique successfully identifies (and removes) the poisoned data.\nIn an end-to-end evaluation, our defense reduces the attack success rate to\nbelow 1% on 134 out of 165 scenarios, with only a 2% drop in clean accuracy on\nCIFAR-10 and a negligible drop in clean accuracy on GTSRB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 13:01:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 18:34:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 15:46:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 04:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

This paper demonstrates a new approach to support the prioritization\nof cycling infrastructure and cycling network design, accounting for cyclist\npreferences and the growing emphasis on 'filtered permeability' and 'Low\nTraffic Neighborhood' interventions internationally. The approach combines\ndistance decay, route calculation, and network analysis methods to examine\nwhere future cycling demand is most likely to arise, how such demand could be\naccommodated within existing street networks, and how to ensure a fair\ndistribution of investment. Although each of these methods has been applied to\ncycling infrastructure prioritization in previous research, this is the first\ntime that they have been combined, creating an integrated road segment\nprioritization approach. The approach, which can be applied to other cities, as\nshown in the Appendix, is demonstrated in a case study of Manchester, resulting\nin cycling networks that balance directness against the need for safe and\nstress-free routes under different investment scenarios. A key benefit of the\napproach from a policy perspective is its ability to support egalitarian and\ncost-effective strategic cycle network planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 14:53:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

Therefore, we derive a new\nspherically symmetric BH from the cubic form of\n$f(T)=T+\\epsilon\\Big[\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha T^2+\\frac{1}{3}\\beta T^3\\Big]$, where\n$\\epsilon<<1$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$ are constants. The new BH is characterized\nby the two constants $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in addition to $\\epsilon$. At\n$\\epsilon=0$ we return to GR. We study the physics of these new BH solutions\nvia the same procedure that was applied for the quadratic BH. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that the contribution of the higher-order torsion,\n$\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha T^2+\\frac{1}{3}\\beta T^3$, may afford an interesting\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 11:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

Applied to the recent claim that\nthe two pulses in GRB 950830 are lensed images of the same pulse, the measured\nflux ratio between the two main pulses should be the same at all energies.\nAfter summing up all the counts in both of GRB 950830's two pulses in all four\nBATSE energy bands, it was found that in energy channel 3, the second pulse\nappears somewhat weak. In comparison with the other BATSE energy channels, the\ndifference was statistically significant at above 90\\%.

One typical application of DL in IoT is device identification from\nwireless signals, namely Non-cryptographic Device Identification (NDI).\nHowever, learning components in NDI systems have to evolve to adapt to\noperational variations, such a paradigm is termed as Incremental Learning (IL).\nVarious IL algorithms have been proposed and many of them require dedicated\nspace to store the increasing amount of historical data, and therefore, they\nare not suitable for IoT or mobile applications. However, conventional IL\nschemes can not provide satisfying performance when historical data are not\navailable. In this paper, we address the IL problem in NDI from a new\nperspective, firstly, we provide a new metric to measure the degree of\ntopological maturity of DNN models from the degree of conflict of\nclass-specific fingerprints. We discover that an important cause for\nperformance degradation in IL enabled NDI is owing to the conflict of devices'\nfingerprints. Second, we also show that the conventional IL schemes can lead to\nlow topological maturity of DNN models in NDI systems. Thirdly, we propose a\nnew Channel Separation Enabled Incremental Learning (CSIL) scheme without using\nhistorical data, in which our strategy can automatically separate devices'\nfingerprints in different learning stages and avoid potential conflict.\nFinally, We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework using real\ndata from ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), an application of\nIoT in aviation. The proposed framework has the potential to be applied to\naccurate identification of IoT devices in a variety of IoT applications and\nservices.

Kardashev's proposal to evaluate the\ndevelopment of celestial civilizations by the amount of energy they are able to\nuse was adopted to translate the concept of human activity into the language of\nphysics. The discussion is limited to considering the last 500 years of history\nfrom the beginning of the scientific and technological revolutions to our\nimmediate future. The application of classical and nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics is discussed. In the framework of classical thermodynamics, two\nsystems are compared: a) the first is a hypothetical quasi-equilibrium system,\nEarth without a population. Since biological evolution becomes almost\nimperceptible for a short period of time, such a system remains in the same\npristine state for the entire period; (b) the second is our habitable planet,\nwhich is not in equilibrium due to rapid anthropogenic evolution and can be\nconsidered as a combination of the first system with human civilization. It is\nshown that in response to the development of civilization (a) the equilibrium\nof the hypothetical system is disturbed and processes are initiated aimed at\nreducing the amount of energy produced, and (b) there is a maximum on the path\nof civilization development over time. The resistance of nature will continue\nuntil a new balance is established, corresponding to a lower level of energy\nproduction.
