When monolayer graphene is\ntwisted on ABA trilayer graphene, the flat bands are not isolated, but are\nintersected by a Dirac cone with a large Fermi velocity. In contrast, graphene\ntwisted on ABC trilayer graphene (denoted AtABC) exhibits a gap between flat\nand remote bands. Since ABC trilayer graphene and twisted bilayer graphene are\nknown to host broken-symmetry phases, we further investigate the ostensibly\nsimilar magic angle AtABC system. We study the effect of electron-electron\ninteractions in AtABC using both Hartree theory and an atomic Hubbard theory to\ncalculate the magnetic phase diagram as a function of doping, twist angle, and\nperpendicular electric field. Our analysis reveals a rich variety of magnetic\norderings, including ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism, and demonstrates that a\nperpendicular electric field makes AtABC more susceptible to magnetic ordering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 16:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 13:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

By\nperforming these optimisations on the conceptual schema, a large part of the\ndatabase optimisation can be done before actually sliding down the software\ndevelopment waterfall. When optimising schemas, one would like to preserve some\nlevel of equivalence between the schemas before and after a transformation. We\ndistinguish between two classes of equivalence, one based on the mathematical\nsemantics of the conceptual schemas, and one on conceptual preference by\nhumans. As a medium for the schema transformations we use the universe of all\n(correct) conceptual schemas. A schema transformation process can then be seen\nas a journey (a schema-time worm) within this universe. The underlying theory\nis conveyed intuitively with sample transformations, and formalised within the\nframework of Object-Role Modelling.

By studying online communication along the three dimensions\nof social interactions (connectivity, interactivity and language use), the\nauthors aim to provide VCoP managers with valuable insights to improve the\nsuccess of their communities. Design/methodology/approach: Communications over\na period of seven years (April 2008 to April 2015) and between 14,000 members\nof 16 different healthcare VCoPs coexisting on the same web platform were\nanalysed. Multilevel regression models were used to reveal the main\ndeterminants of community growth over time. Independent variables were derived\nfrom social network and semantic analysis measures. Findings: Results show that\nstructural and content-based variables predict the growth of the community.\nProgressively, more people will join a community if its structure is more\ncentralised, leaders are more dynamic (they rotate more) and the language used\nin the posts is less complex. Research limitations/implications: The available\ndata set included one Web platform and a limited number of control variables.\nTo consolidate the findings of the present study, the experiment should be\nreplicated on other healthcare VCoPs. Originality/value: The study provides\nuseful recommendations for setting up and nurturing the growth of professional\ncommunities, considering, at the same time, the interaction patterns among the\ncommunity members, the dynamic evolution of these interactions and the use of\nlanguage. New analytical tools are presented, together with the use of\ninnovative interaction metrics, that can significantly influence community\ngrowth, such as rotating leadership.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 16:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

However, existing methods may suffer\npoor attribute variation disentanglement, leading to unwanted change of other\nattributes when altering the desired one. The semantic directions used by\nexisting methods are at attribute level, which are difficult to model complex\nattribute correlations, especially in the presence of attribute distribution\nbias in GAN's training set. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (IALS)\nthat performs Instance-Aware Latent-Space Search to find semantic directions\nfor disentangled attribute editing.

The grand scale of\nbiodiversity contributes to the great locomotory design and mode diversity.\nVarious creatures make use of legs, wings, fins and other means to move through\nthe world. In this report, we refer to the locomotion of general biological\nspecies as biolocomotion. We present a computational approach to detect\nbiolocomotion in unprocessed video.\n  Significantly, the motion exhibited by the body parts of a biological entity\nto navigate through an environment can be modeled by a combination of an\noverall positional advance with an overlaid asymmetric oscillatory pattern, a\ndistinctive signature that tends to be absent in non-biological objects in\nlocomotion. We exploit this key trait of positional advance with asymmetric\noscillation along with differences in an object's common motion (extrinsic\nmotion) and localized motion of its parts (intrinsic motion) to detect\nbiolocomotion. An algorithm is developed to measure the presence of these\ntraits in tracked objects to determine if they correspond to a biological\nentity in locomotion. An alternative algorithm, based on generic features\ncombined with learning is assembled out of components from allied areas of\ninvestigation, also is presented as a basis of comparison.\n  A novel biolocomotion dataset encompassing a wide range of moving biological\nand non-biological objects in natural settings is provided. Also, biolocomotion\nannotations to an extant camouflage animals dataset are provided. Quantitative\nresults indicate that the proposed algorithm considerably outperforms the\nalternative approach, supporting the hypothesis that biolocomotion can be\ndetected reliably based on its distinct signature of positional advance with\nasymmetric oscillation and extrinsic/intrinsic motion dissimilarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 16:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

We investigate\nhow prosody affects a parser that receives an entire dialogue turn as input (a\nturn-based model), instead of gold standard pre-segmented SUs (an SU-based\nmodel). In experiments on the English Switchboard corpus, we find that when\nusing transcripts alone, the turn-based model has trouble segmenting SUs,\nleading to worse parse performance than the SU-based model. However, prosody\ncan effectively replace gold standard SU boundaries: with prosody, the\nturn-based model performs as well as the SU-based model (90.79 vs. 90.65 F1\nscore, respectively), despite performing two tasks (SU segmentation and\nparsing) rather than one (parsing alone).

Although the majority of existing models\nfor the disease focus on its population dynamics, it's important to link the\nmultiple scales of the disease to gain better perspectives on its spread and\ncontrol. In this study, we formulate an immuno-epidemiological model for\ncholera linking the between-host and within-host dynamics of the disease. The\nwithin-host model utilizes time-scale methods to differentiate the pathogen\ndynamics from the dynamics of the immune response. Bifurcation analysis of the\nwithin-host system reveals the necessary conditions for the existence of both\nthe Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations. Contrary to other within-host models,\nthe current approach allows for the elimination of the pathogen after a finite\ntime.

This work considers surface growth, in which mass is\nadded to the boundary of a continuum body from the ambient medium or from\nwithin the body. In contrast to bulk growth in the interior, the description of\nsurface growth requires the addition of new continuum particles to the body.\nThis is challenging for standard continuum formulations for solids that are\nmeant for situations with a fixed amount of material. Recent approaches to\nhandle this have used time-evolving reference configurations.\n  In this work, an Eulerian approach to this problem is formulated, enabling\nthe side-stepping of the issue of constructing the reference configuration.\nHowever, this raises the complementary challenge of determining the stress\nresponse of the solid, which typically requires the deformation gradient that\nis not immediately available in the Eulerian formulation. To resolve this, the\napproach introduces additional kinematic descriptors, namely the relaxed\nzero-stress deformation and the elastic deformation; in contrast to the\ndeformation gradient, these have the important advantage that they are not\nrequired to satisfy kinematic compatibility. The resulting model has only the\ndensity, velocity, and elastic deformation as variables in the Eulerian\nsetting.\n  The introduction in this formulation of the relaxed deformation and the\nelastic deformation provides a description of surface growth whereby the added\nmaterial can bring in its own kinematic information. Loosely, the added\nmaterial \"brings in its own reference configuration\" through the specification\nof the relaxed deformation and the elastic deformation of the added material.\nThis kinematic description enables, e.g., modeling of non-normal growth using a\nstandard normal growth velocity and a simple approach to prescribing boundary\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 16:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

The proposed architecture is\nrealized on Zynq System on Chip (SoC), consisting of the ARM processor and\nFPGA, via hardware-software co-design (HSCD). Using the dynamic partial\nreconfiguration (DPR), on-the-fly switching between algorithms depending on the\nnumber of active signals in the sensed spectrum is enabled. The functionality,\nresource utilization, and execution time of the proposed architecture are\nanalyzed for various HSCD configurations, word-length, number of digitized\nsamples, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and antenna array (sparse/non-sparse).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 17:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

Despite gaining considerable interest\nin the scientific community, Psyche's composition and formation remain\nunconstrained. Originally, Psyche was considered to be almost entirely composed\nof metal due to its high radar albedo and spectral similarities to iron\nmeteorites. More recent telescopic observations suggest the additional presence\nof low-Fe pyroxene and exogenic carbonaceous chondrites on the asteroid's\nsurface. To better understand the abundances of these additional materials, we\ninvestigated visible near-infrared (0.35 - 2.5 micron) spectral properties of\nthree-component laboratory mixtures of metal, low-Fe pyroxene, and carbonaceous\nchondrite. We compared the band depths and spectral slopes of these mixtures to\nthe telescopic spectrum of (16) Psyche to constrain material abundances. We\nfind that the best matching mixture to Psyche consists of 82.5% metal, 7%\nlow-Fe pyroxene, and 10.5% carbonaceous by weight, suggesting that the asteroid\nis less metallic than originally estimated (~94%). The relatively high\nabundance of carbonaceous chondrite material estimated from our laboratory\nexperiments implies the delivery of this exogenic material through low velocity\ncollisions to Psyche's surface. Assuming that Psyche's surface is\nrepresentative of its bulk material content, our results suggest a porosity of\n35% to match recent density estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 17:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

Exoplanets within a\nsystem tend to be of similar size and mass, evenly spaced, and are often\nordered in size and mass. Small planets are frequently packed in tight\nconfigurations, while large planets often have wider orbital spacing. Together,\nthese correlations are called the peas in a pod trends in the architecture of\nplanetary systems. In this paper these trends are investigated in theoretically\nsimulated planetary systems and compared with observations. Whether these\ncorrelations emerge from astrophysical processes or the detection biases of the\ntransit method is examined. Synthetic planetary system were simulated using the\nGeneration III Bern Model. KOBE, a new computer code, simulates the geometrical\nlimitations of the transit method and applies the detection biases and\ncompleteness of the Kepler survey. This allows simulated planetary systems to\nbe compared with observations.\n  The architecture of synthetic planetary systems, observed via KOBE, show the\npeas in a pod trends in good agreement with observations. These correlations\nare also present in the theoretical underlying population, from the Bern Model,\nindicating that these trends are probably of astrophysical origin. The physical\nprocesses involved in planet formation are responsible for the emergence of\nevenly spaced planets with similar sizes and masses. The size--mass similarity\ntrends are primordial and originate from the oligarchic growth of\nprotoplanetary embryos and the uniform growth of planets at early times. Later\nstages in planet formation allows planets within a system to grow at different\nrates, thereby decreasing these correlations.

The\nabundance patterns and ages, derived from full-spectrum modeling, are examined\nas a function of stellar mass ($M_*$) and size (i.e., half-light radius;\n$R_e$). We find that both [Mg/H] and [Fe/H] do not vary with stellar mass but\nare correlated with $M_*/R_e$ for quiescent galaxies with $M_*>10^{10.5}\nM_\\odot$. Thus, at fixed mass, compact quiescent galaxies are on average more\nmetal rich. This result reinforces the picture that supernova feedback and\ngravitational potential regulate chemical enrichment. [Mg/Fe] does not vary\nwith $M_*$ or $M_*/R_e$, but there is a marginal positive relation between age\nand mass. Our results support low-redshift findings that more massive galaxies\nform their stars at earlier times. However, in contrast to low-redshift\nstudies, star formation timescale does not appear to depend on mass or size.

In quantum information and beyond,\nit is known that quantum states possessing symmetry are not useful for certain\ninformation-processing tasks. For example, states that commute with a\nHamiltonian realizing a time evolution are not useful for timekeeping during\nthat evolution, and bipartite states that are highly extendible are not\nstrongly entangled and thus not useful for basic tasks like teleportation.\nMotivated by this perspective, this paper details several quantum algorithms\nthat test the symmetry of quantum states and channels. For the case of testing\nBose symmetry of a state, we show that there is a simple and efficient quantum\nalgorithm, while the tests for other kinds of symmetry rely on the aid of a\nquantum prover. We prove that the acceptance probability of each algorithm is\nequal to the maximum symmetric fidelity of the state being tested, thus giving\na firm operational meaning to these latter resource quantifiers. Special cases\nof the algorithms test for incoherence or separability of quantum states. We\nevaluate the performance of these algorithms on choice examples by using the\nvariational approach to quantum algorithms, replacing the quantum prover with a\nparameterized circuit. We demonstrate this approach for numerous examples using\nthe IBM quantum noiseless and noisy simulators, and we observe that the\nalgorithms perform well in the noiseless case and exhibit noise resilience in\nthe noisy case. We also show that the maximum symmetric fidelities can be\ncalculated by semi-definite programs, which is useful for benchmarking the\nperformance of these algorithms for sufficiently small examples. Finally, we\nestablish various generalizations of the resource theory of asymmetry, with the\nupshot being that the acceptance probabilities of the algorithms are resource\nmonotones and thus well motivated from the resource-theoretic perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 18:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 15:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

In this way, when faced with a previously unseen chargepad,\nthe driver needs only manually align the vehicle a single time. As the\nchargepad is flat on the ground, it is not easy to detect it from a distance.\nThus, we propose using a Visual SLAM pipeline to learn landmarks relative to\nthe chargepad to enable alignment from a greater range.

Originally, the primary\nrole of the regularization was to stabilize the computational inversion of the\nimaging forward model against noise. However, a recent framework pioneered by\nDonoho and others, known as compressive sensing, brought the role of\nregularization beyond the stabilization of inversion. It established a\npossibility that regularization can recover full images from highly\nundersampled measurements. However, it was observed that the quality of\nreconstruction yielded by compressive sensing methods falls abruptly when the\nunder-sampling and/or measurement noise goes beyond a certain threshold.\nRecently developed learning-based methods are believed to outperform the\ncompressive sensing methods without a steep drop in the reconstruction quality\nunder such imaging conditions.

This is not necessarily equivalent to creating looks with the\nhighest probability of success. In particular, the two most efficient shots in\nthe NBA - which are shots from the paint, i.e., extremely close to the basket,\nand three-point shots from the corner, i.e., at least 22 feet apart - have\ncompletely different spatial profiles when it comes to their distance from the\nbasket. The latter also means that they are pretty much at the opposing ends of\nthe spectrum when it comes to their probability of being made. Due to their\nefficiency, these are the most sought after shots from the offense, while the\ndefense is trying to contain them. However, in order to contain them one needs\nto first understand what makes them efficient in the first place and how they\nare generated. In this study we focus on the corner three point shots and using\nplayer tracking data we show that the main factor for their efficiency -\ncontrary to the belief from the sports mass media - is not the shorter distance\nto the basket compared to three-point shots above the break, but rather the\nfact that they are assisted at a very high rate (more than 90\\%). Furthermore,\nwe analyze the movement of the shooter and his defender and find that more than\nhalf of these shots involve a shooter anchored at the corner waiting for the\nkick out pass. We finally define a simplified game between the offense and\ndefense in these situation and we find that the Nash Equilibrium supports\neither committing to the corner shooter or to the drive to the basket, and not\nlingering between the two, which is what we observed from the defenses in our\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 18:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

The approach finds\nposterior distribution estimates of the OD-coefficients, which describe the\nrelative proportions of passengers travelling between origin and destination\nlocations, via a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling procedure. We suggest two\ndifferent inference model formulations: the instantaneous-balance and\naverage-delay model. We discuss both models' sensitivity to various count\nobservation properties, and establish that the average-delay model is generally\nmore robust in determining the coefficient posteriors. The\ninstantaneous-balance model, however, requires lower resolution count\nobservations and produces comparably accurate estimates as the average-delay\nmodel, pending that count observations are only moderately interfered by trend\nfluctuations or the truncation of the observation window, and sufficient number\nof dispersed data records are available. We demonstrate that the Bayesian\nposterior distribution estimates provide quantifiable measures of the\nestimation uncertainty and prediction quality of the model, whereas the point\nestimates obtained from an alternative constrained quadratic programming\noptimisation approach only provide the residual errors between the predictions\nand observations. Moreover, the Bayesian approach proves more robust in scaling\nto high-dimensional underdetermined problems. The Bayesian\ninstantaneous-balance OD-coefficient posteriors are determined for the New York\nCity (NYC) subway network, based on several years of entry and exit count\nobservations recorded at station turnstiles across the network. The\naverage-delay model proves intractable on the real-world test scenario, given\nits computational time complexity and the incompleteness as well as coarseness\nof the turnstile records.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 19:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

Trailing and leading trails\nof asteroids and comets along the Sun's orbit in the Galactic potential are the\nby-product of the formation of the Oort cloud. These arms are composed of\nmaterial that became unbound from the Solar System when the Oort cloud formed.\nToday, the bulk of the material in the Oort cloud ($\\sim 70$\\%) originates from\nthe region in the circumstellar disk that was located between $\\sim 15$\\,au and\n$\\sim 35$\\,au, near the current location of the ice giants and the Centaur\nfamily of asteroids. According to our simulations, this population is\neradicated if the ice-giant planets are born in orbital resonance. Planet\nmigration or chaotic orbital reorganization occurring while the Solar System is\nstill a cluster member is, according to our model, inconsistent with the\npresence of the Oort cloud. About half the inner Oort cloud, between 100 and\n$10^4$\\,au, and a quarter of the material in the outer Oort cloud, $\\apgt\n10^4$\\,au, could be non-native to the Solar System but was captured from\nfree-floating debris in the cluster or from the circumstellar disk of other\nstars in the birth cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 20:07:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 08:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

Object detection is\nused in many applications such as industrial process, medical imaging analysis,\nand autonomous vehicles. The ability to detect objects in videos is crucial.\nObject detection systems are trained on large image datasets. For applications\nsuch as autonomous vehicles, it is crucial that the object detection system can\nidentify objects through multiple frames in video. There are many problems with\napplying these systems to video.

Similarly to the case of\nzero temperature, it is decomposed into the static and dynamical components,\nwhere the former is given by the contraction of the bare interaction with the\ntwo-fermion density and the latter is represented by the double contraction of\nthe four-fermion two-time correlation function, or propagator, with two\ninteraction matrix elements.

MBQC proposals have largely focused on photonic systems, where\n2-qubit gates are difficult. Semiconductor spin qubits in quantum dots, on the\nother hand, offer fast 2-qubit gates via the exchange interaction. In\nexchange-based quantum computing, as with other solid-state qubits, leakage to\nhigher states is a serious problem that must be mitigated. Here, two hybrid\nmeasurement-exchange schemes are proposed which quantify the benefits of MBQC\non quantum dot-based quantum computing. Measurement of double quantum dot\nencoded qubits in the singlet-triplet basis, along with inter- and intra-qubit\nexchange interaction, are used to perform one and two qubit operations. Both\nschemes suppress individual qubit spin-state leakage errors, offer fast gate\ntimes, and require only controllable exchange couplings, up to known phase and\nPauli corrections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 21:58:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 16:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

Current models for elastically anisotropic and\ninhomogeneous media in the literature do not impose such a constraint in their\ngoverning equations. In particular, they ignore the dependence of the total\nstrain on the order parameters while evaluating the variational derivative of\nthe elastic energy (VDEE). There is no mathematical proof to support this\ntreatment and the fundamental thermodynamic consistency of such a models could\nbe challenged. In this work, we present a rigorous and physically transparent\nformulation of PFM governing equations for elastically anisotropic and\ninhomogeneous media in which the mechanical equilibrium is explicitly used as a\nconstraint.

Although DPDP plays an important role\nin modern logistics and supply chain management, state-of-the-art DPDP\nalgorithms are still limited on their solution quality and efficiency. In\npractice, they fail to provide a scalable solution as the numbers of vehicles\nand sites become large. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach,\nSpatial-Temporal Aided Double Deep Graph Network (ST-DDGN), to solve\nindustry-scale DPDP. In our method, the delivery demands are first forecast\nusing spatial-temporal prediction method, which guides the neural network to\nperceive spatial-temporal distribution of delivery demand when dispatching\nvehicles. Besides, the relationships of individuals such as vehicles are\nmodelled by establishing a graph-based value function. ST-DDGN incorporates\nattention-based graph embedding with Double DQN (DDQN). As such, it can make\nthe inference across vehicles more efficiently compared with traditional\nmethods. Our method is entirely data driven and thus adaptive, i.e., the\nrelational representation of adjacent vehicles can be learned and corrected by\nST-DDGN from data periodically. We have conducted extensive experiments over\nreal-world data to evaluate our solution. The results show that ST-DDGN reduces\n11.27% number of the used vehicles and decreases 13.12% total transportation\ncost on average over the strong baselines, including the heuristic algorithm\ndeployed in our UAT (User Acceptance Test) environment and a variety of vanilla\nDRL methods.

The networks considered are described by either internal\nor enriched graphs. In the internal case we focus on $\\mathsf{Q}$-nets, a\ngeneralization of Petri nets based on a Lawvere theory $\\mathsf{Q}$.\n$\\mathsf{Q}$-nets include many known variants of Petri nets including pre-nets,\ninteger nets, elementary net systems, and bounded nets. In the enriched case we\nfocus on graphs enriched in a quantale $R$ regarded as matrices with entries in\n$R$. These $R$-matrices represent distance networks, Markov processes, capacity\nnetworks, non-deterministic finite automata, simple graphs, and more. The\noperational semantics of $\\mathsf{Q}$-nets is constructed as an adjunction\nbetween $\\mathsf{Q}$-nets and categories internal to the category of models of\n$\\mathsf{Q}$. Similarly, the operational semantics of $R$-matrices is\nconstructed as an adjunction between $R$-matrices and categories enriched in\n$R$. The left adjoint of this adjunction sends an $R$-matrix $M$ to the\n$R$-category $F_R(M)$ whose hom-objects are solutions of the algebraic path\nproblem: a generalization of the shortest path problem to graphs weighted in\n$R$. For both $\\mathsf{Q}$-nets and $R$-matrices we use the theory of\nstructured cospans to study the compositionality of the above operational\nsemantics. For each type of network we construct a double category whose\nmorphisms are \"open networks\", i.e. networks with certain vertices designated\nas input or output.

While some studies have proposed\nstrategies for using data with missing channels, these approaches are not\npractical when sparse montages are used and computing power is limited (e.g.,\nwearables, cell phones). To tackle this problem, we propose dynamic spatial\nfiltering (DSF), a multi-head attention module that can be plugged in before\nthe first layer of a neural network to handle missing EEG channels by learning\nto focus on good channels and to ignore bad ones.

It is considered more biologically plausible\nand more energy-efficient than artificial neural networks (ANN) in emerging\nneuromorphic hardware. However, due to the discontinuous and non-differentiable\ncharacteristics, training SNN is a relatively challenging task. Recent work has\nachieved essential progress on an excellent performance by converting ANN to\nSNN. Due to the difference in information processing, the converted deep SNN\nusually suffers serious performance loss and large time delay. In this paper,\nwe analyze the reasons for the performance loss and propose a novel bistable\nspiking neural network (BSNN) that addresses the problem of spikes of\ninactivated neurons (SIN) caused by the phase lead and phase lag. Also, when\nResNet structure-based ANNs are converted, the information of output neurons is\nincomplete due to the rapid transmission of the shortcut path. We design\nsynchronous neurons (SN) to help efficiently improve performance.

This paper is\ndevoted to another example: the effect of RSD on the apparent peculiar motions\nof tracers as inferred from their positions in redshift space (i.e. the\nobserved distance). Our theoretical study is motivated by practical\nconsiderations, mainly, the direct estimation of the velocity power spectrum,\nwhich is preferably carried out using the tracer's redshift-space position (so\nas to avoid uncertainties in distance measurements). We formulate the\nredshift-space velocity field and show that RSD enters as a higher-order\neffect. Physically, this effect may be interpreted as a dissipative correction\nto the usual perfect-fluid description of dark matter. We show that the effect\non the power spectrum is a damping on relatively large, quasilinear scales\n($k>0.01\\,h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$), as was observed, though unexplained, in $N$-body\nsimulations elsewhere. This paper presents two power spectrum models for the\npeculiar velocity field in redshift space, both of which can be considered\nvelocity analogues of existing clustering models. In particular, we show that\nthe \"Finger-of-God\" effect, while also present in the velocity field, cannot be\nentirely blamed for the observed damping in simulations. Our work provides some\nof the missing modelling ingredients required for a density--velocity\nmulti-tracer analysis, which has been proposed for upcoming redshift surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 04:01:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 23:32:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

The main idea of this approach\nis that the owner of service composition leverages the security policy model\n(SPM) to define the access control relationships that service composition must\ncomply with in the application plane, then SPM model is transformed into the\nlow-level security policy model (RSPM) containing the information of SDN data\nplane, and RSPM model is uploaded into the SDN controller. After uploading, the\nvirtual machine access control algorithm integrated in the SDN controller\nmonitors all of access requests towards service composition at runtime. Only\nthe access requests that meet the definition of RSPM model can be forwarded to\nthe target terminal. Any access requests that do not meet the definition of\nRSPM model will be automatically blocked by Openflow switches or deleted by SDN\ncontroller, Thus, this approach can effectively solve the problems of\nnetwork-layer illegal accesses, identity theft attacks and service leakages\nwhen Web service composition is running. In order to verify the feasibility of\nthis approach, this paper implements an experimental system by using POX\ncontroller and Mininet virtual network simulator, and evaluates the\neffectiveness and performance of this approach by using this system.

Existing methods either align different\ndomains with adversarial training or involve the self-learning that utilizes\npseudo labels to conduct supervised training. The former always suffers from\nthe unstable training caused by adversarial training and only focuses on the\ninter-domain gap that ignores intra-domain knowledge. The latter tends to put\noverconfident label prediction on wrong categories, which propagates errors to\nmore samples. To solve these problems, we propose a two-stage adaptive semantic\nsegmentation method based on the local Lipschitz constraint that satisfies both\ndomain alignment and domain-specific exploration under a unified principle. In\nthe first stage, we propose the local Lipschitzness regularization as the\nobjective function to align different domains by exploiting intra-domain\nknowledge, which explores a promising direction for non-adversarial adaptive\nsemantic segmentation. In the second stage, we use the local Lipschitzness\nregularization to estimate the probability of satisfying Lipschitzness for each\npixel, and then dynamically sets the threshold of pseudo labels to conduct\nself-learning. Such dynamical self-learning effectively avoids the error\npropagation caused by noisy labels. Optimization in both stages is based on the\nsame principle, i.e., the local Lipschitz constraint, so that the knowledge\nlearned in the first stage can be maintained in the second stage. Further, due\nto the model-agnostic property, our method can easily adapt to any CNN-based\nsemantic segmentation networks. Experimental results demonstrate the excellent\nperformance of our method on standard benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 04:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

In this paper we consider the\nexistence and stability of stationary and traveling slow localized patterns\nthat do not exhibit such jumps, i.e. that are completely embedded in a slow\nmanifold of the singularly perturbed spatial dynamical system. These patterns\nhave rarely been considered in the literature, for two reasons: (i) in the\nclassical Gray-Scott/Gierer-Meinhardt type models that dominate the literature,\nthe flow on the slow manifold is typically linear and thus cannot exhibit\nhomoclinic pulse or heteroclinic front solutions; (ii) the slow manifolds\noccurring in the literature are typically `vertical' -- i.e. given by $u \\equiv\nu_0$, where $u$ is the fast variable -- so that the stability problem is\ndetermined by a simple (decoupled) scalar equation. The present research\nconcerns a general system of singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion equations\nand is motivated by several explicit ecosystem models that do give rise to\nnon-vertical normally hyperbolic slow manifolds on which the flow may exhibit\nboth homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits -- that correspond to either stationary\nor traveling localized patterns.

Instead of naively pipelining these techniques, our Joint-DetNAS\noptimizes them jointly. The algorithm consists of two core processes: student\nmorphism optimizes the student's architecture and removes the redundant\nparameters, while dynamic distillation aims to find the optimal matching\nteacher. For student morphism, weight inheritance strategy is adopted, allowing\nthe student to flexibly update its architecture while fully utilize the\npredecessor's weights, which considerably accelerates the search; To facilitate\ndynamic distillation, an elastic teacher pool is trained via integrated\nprogressive shrinking strategy, from which teacher detectors can be sampled\nwithout additional cost in subsequent searches. Given a base detector as the\ninput, our algorithm directly outputs the derived student detector with high\nperformance without additional training. Experiments demonstrate that our\nJoint-DetNAS outperforms the naive pipelining approach by a great margin. Given\na classic R101-FPN as the base detector, Joint-DetNAS is able to boost its mAP\nfrom 41.4 to 43.9 on MS COCO and reduce the latency by 47%, which is on par\nwith the SOTA EfficientDet while requiring less search cost.

It is\nused extensively in practice. In congestion (or potential) games, the dynamics\nconverges to the so-called Gibbs distribution over the set of all strategy\nprofiles, when interpreted as a Markov chain. In general, logit dynamics might\nconverge slowly to the Gibbs distribution, but beyond that, not much is known\nabout their algorithmic aspects, nor that of the Gibbs distribution. In this\nwork, we are interested in the following two questions for congestion games: i)\nIs there an efficient algorithm for sampling from the Gibbs distribution? ii)\nIf yes, do there also exist natural randomized dynamics that converges quickly\nto the Gibbs distribution?\n  We first study these questions in extension parallel congestion games, a\nwell-studied special case of symmetric network congestion games. As our main\nresult, we show that there is a simple variation on the logit dynamics (in\nwhich we in addition are allowed to randomly interchange the strategies of two\nplayers) that converges quickly to the Gibbs distribution in such games. This\nanswers both questions above affirmatively. We also address the first question\nfor the class of so-called capacitated $k$-uniform congestion games.\n  To prove our results, we rely on the recent breakthrough work of Anari, Liu,\nOveis-Gharan and Vinzant (2019) concerning the approximate sampling of the base\nof a matroid according to strongly log-concave probability distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 08:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

The analysis is focused on six dimensions: (i) the style of\nacknowledging texts, (ii) the distribution of mentions, (iii) the identity of\nthe most mentioned acknowledgees, (iv) the shares of highly and lowly mentioned\nacknowledgees, (v) the hierarchy of the acknowledgment network, and (vi) the\ncorrelation at a paper level between intellectual similarity, measured by\ncommon references, and social similarity, measured by common acknowledges.\nResults show that the normative and the strategic account should be considered\nas valid but partial explanations of acknowledging behavior. Hence,\nacknowledgments should be used with extreme caution for investigating\ncollaboration practices and they should not be used to produce\nacknowledgments-based metrics of scholars for evaluative purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 08:15:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 14:37:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 15:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

It can be used to assess the features of a search engine, to position\nsearch engines relative to each other, or to select which search engine 'fits'\na certain situation. One is able to identify areas for improvement. During\ndevelopment, we were guided by the viewpoint of the user. We use the word\n`search engine' in the broadest sense possible, including library and web based\n(meta) search engines. The taxonomy distinguishes seven functionality areas: an\nindexing service, user profiling, query composition, query execution, result\npresentation, result refinement, and history keeping. Each of these relates and\nprovides services to other functionality areas. It can be extended whenever\nnecessary. To illustrate the validity of our taxonomy, it has been used for\ncomparing various document search engines existing today (ACM Digital Library,\nPiCarta, Copernic, AltaVista, Google, and GuideBeam). It appears that the\nfunctionality aspects covered by our taxonomy can be used for describing these\nsearch engines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 08:15:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

Unlike convolutions which\nare inherently parallel, the de-facto standard for NMS, namely GreedyNMS,\ncannot be easily parallelized and thus could be the performance bottleneck in\nconvolutional object detection pipelines. MaxpoolNMS is introduced as a\nparallelizable alternative to GreedyNMS, which in turn enables faster speed\nthan GreedyNMS at comparable accuracy. However, MaxpoolNMS is only capable of\nreplacing the GreedyNMS at the first stage of two-stage detectors like\nFaster-RCNN. There is a significant drop in accuracy when applying MaxpoolNMS\nat the final detection stage, due to the fact that MaxpoolNMS fails to\napproximate GreedyNMS precisely in terms of bounding box selection. In this\npaper, we propose a general, parallelizable and configurable approach\nPSRR-MaxpoolNMS, to completely replace GreedyNMS at all stages in all\ndetectors. By introducing a simple Relationship Recovery module and a Pyramid\nShifted MaxpoolNMS module, our PSRR-MaxpoolNMS is able to approximate GreedyNMS\nmore precisely than MaxpoolNMS. Comprehensive experiments show that our\napproach outperforms MaxpoolNMS by a large margin, and it is proven faster than\nGreedyNMS with comparable accuracy. For the first time, PSRR-MaxpoolNMS\nprovides a fully parallelizable solution for customized hardware design, which\ncan be reused for accelerating NMS everywhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 08:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

Although RL originally aims to maximize return indirectly through\noptimization of policy, the recent work by Levine has proposed a different\nderivation process with explicit consideration of optimality as stochastic\nvariable. This paper follows this concept and formulates the traditional\nlearning laws for both value function and policy as the optimization problems\nwith reverse KL divergence including optimality. Focusing on the asymmetry of\nKL divergence, the new optimization problems with forward KL divergence are\nderived. Remarkably, such new optimization problems can be regarded as\noptimistic RL. That optimism is intuitively specified by a hyperparameter\nconverted from an uncertainty parameter. In addition, it can be enhanced when\nit is integrated with prioritized experience replay and eligibility traces,\nboth of which accelerate learning. The effects of this expected optimism was\ninvestigated through learning tendencies on numerical simulations using\nPybullet. As a result, moderate optimism accelerated learning and yielded\nhigher rewards. In a realistic robotic simulation, the proposed method with the\nmoderate optimism outperformed one of the state-of-the-art RL method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 08:24:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 03:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

This is to be contrasted with traditional\nunivariate risk measures, like VaR or Expected shortfall, which typically\nconflate both effects.

However, in many\nreal-world tasks the labels often contain noise, and incorporating too many\nnoisy negative samples for model training may be suboptimal. In this paper, we\nstudy how many negative samples are optimal for InfoNCE in different scenarios\nvia a semi-quantitative theoretical framework.

Inspired by the high-quality results of the neural radiance fields\n(NeRF) method, we propose a joint framework to directly render novel views with\nthe desired style.

We investigate six different shapes\nincluding the bodies 101955 Bennu, 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko, 433 Eros and\n25143 Itokawa for which shape models developed during close proximity surveys\nare available. Both heterogeneous and homogeneous mass distributions are\nconsidered. The gravitational acceleration computed from the trained\ngeodesyNets models, as well as the inferred body shape, show great accuracy in\nall cases with a relative error on the predicted acceleration smaller than 1\\%\neven close to the asteroid surface. When the body shape information is\navailable, geodesyNets can seamlessly exploit it and be trained to represent a\nhigh-fidelity neural density field able to give insights into the internal\nstructure of the body. This work introduces a new unexplored approach to\ngeodesy, adding a powerful tool to consolidated ones based on spherical\nharmonics, mascon models and polyhedral gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 09:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

This type of method has\nreceived great attention in recent years because of its high performance and\ninterpretability. In fact, traditional methods such as path ranking algorithm\n(PRA) take the paths between an entity pair as atomic features. However, the\nmedical KGs are very sparse, which makes it difficult to model effective\nsemantic representation for extremely sparse path features. The sparsity in the\nmedical KGs is mainly reflected in the long-tailed distribution of entities and\npaths. Previous methods merely consider the context structure in the paths of\nthe knowledge graph and ignore the textual semantics of the symbols in the\npath. Therefore, their performance cannot be further improved due to the two\naspects of entity sparseness and path sparseness. To address the above issues,\nthis paper proposes two novel path-based reasoning methods to solve the\nsparsity issues of entity and path respectively, which adopts the textual\nsemantic information of entities and paths for MedKGC.

Although random sampling with phone-level prosody\ndistribution has been investigated to generate different prosody patterns, the\ndiversity of the generated speech is still very limited and far from what can\nbe achieved by humans. This is largely due to the use of uni-modal\ndistribution, such as single Gaussian, in the prior works of phone-level\nprosody modelling. In this work, we propose a novel approach that models\nphone-level prosodies with a GMM-based mixture density network(MDN) and then\nextend it for multi-speaker TTS using speaker adaptation transforms of Gaussian\nmeans and variances. Furthermore, we show that we can clone the prosodies from\na reference speech by sampling prosodies from the Gaussian components that\nproduce the reference prosodies. Our experiments on LJSpeech and LibriTTS\ndataset show that the proposed method with GMM-based MDN not only achieves\nsignificantly better diversity than using a single Gaussian in both\nsingle-speaker and multi-speaker TTS, but also provides better naturalness. The\nprosody cloning experiments demonstrate that the prosody similarity of the\nproposed method with GMM-based MDN is comparable to recent proposed\nfine-grained VAE while the target speaker similarity is better.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 12:16:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 14:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

As\nthe ability to achieve beam focusing is dictated by the transmit antenna, we\nstudy near-field signaling considering different antenna structures, including\nfully-digital architectures, hybrid phase shifter-based precoders, and the\nemerging dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) architecture for massive MIMO\narrays.

Simulation results show\nthe feasibility of the proposed beam focusing scheme for both single- and\nmulti-user scenarios.

By combining niching or clustering strategy, the state-of-the-art\napproaches generally divide the population into several subpopulations to find\nmultiple solutions for a problem at hand. However, these methods only guided by\nthe fitness value during iterations, which are suffering from determining the\nnumber of subpopulations, i.e., the number of niche areas or clusters. To\ncompensate for this drawback, this paper presents an Attention-oriented Brain\nStorm Optimization (ABSO) method that introduces the attention mechanism into a\nrelatively new swarm intelligence algorithm, i.e., Brain Storm Optimization\n(BSO). By converting the objective space from the fitness space into\n\"attention\" space, the individuals are clustered and updated iteratively\naccording to their salient values. Rather than converge to a single global\noptimum, the proposed method can guide the search procedure to converge to\nmultiple \"salient\" solutions. The preliminary results show that the proposed\nmethod can locate multiple global and local optimal solutions of several\nmultimodal benchmark functions.

By\nmatching the members in a robotic swarm to the individuals in the algorithm\nunder both environments and robots constraints, this paper proposes a BSO-based\ncollaborative searching framework for swarm robotics called Robotic BSO.

To overcome this\nproblem, grant free non-orthogonal multiple access schemes have been proposed\nalongside with sparse signal recovery algorithms. While most of the related\nworks have considered only homogeneous networks, we focus on a scenario where\nan enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) device and multiple MTC devices share the\nsame radio resources. We exploit the approximate message passing (AMP)\nalgorithm for joint device activity detection and channel estimation of MTC\ndevices in the presence of interference from eMBB, and evaluate the system\nperformance in terms of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and channel\nestimation errors. Moreover, we also propose two new pilot sequence generation\nstrategies which improve the detection capabilities of the MTC receiver without\naffecting the eMBB service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 13:20:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

This study performed theoretical\nanalyses about the impact of radiolytic oxygen depletion (ROD) on the cellular\nresponses after FLASH irradiation. Methods: Monte Carlo simulation was used to\nmodel the ROD process, determine the DNA damage, and calculate the amount of\noxygen depleted (LROD) during FLASH exposure. A mathematical model was applied\nto analyze oxygen tension (pO2) distribution in human tissues and the recovery\nof pO2 after FLASH irradiation. DNA damage and cell survival fractions (SFs)\nafter FLASH irradiation were calculated. The impact of initial cellular pO2,\nFLASH pulse number, pulse interval, and radiation quality of the source\nparticles on ROD and subsequent cellular responses were systematically\nevaluated. Results: The simulated electron LROD range was 0.38-0.43 {\\mu}M/Gy\nwhen pO2 ranged from 7.5-160 mmHg. The calculated DNA damage and SFs show that\nradioprotective effect is only evident in cells with a lower pO2. Different\nirradiation setups alter the cellular responses by modifying the pO2. Single\npulse delivery or multi-pulse delivery with pulse intervals shorter than 10-50\nms resulted in fewer DNA damages and higher SFs. Source particles with a low\nradiation quality have a higher capacity to deplete oxygen, and thus, lead to a\nmore conspicuous radioprotective effect. Conclusions: The FLASH radioprotective\neffect due to ROD may only be observed in cells with a low pO2. Single pulse\ndelivery or multi-pulse delivery with short pulse intervals are suggested for\nFLASH irradiation to avoid oxygen tension recovery during pulse intervals.\nSource particles with low radiation quality are preferred for their conspicuous\nradioprotective effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 13:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

However, these methods are subject to technical limitations that are\ndataset specific and involve computational trade-offs. Thus, it is challenging\nfor analysts to identify when such methods may offer benefits or select amongst\nstatistical methods. We present extensive simulation studies of several\ncutting-edge estimators, evaluating both performance and computation time.\nCritically, rather than use arbitrary simulation data, we generate synthetic\ndatasets mimicking the observed data structure (plasmode simulation) of a real\nmolecular epidemiologic cohort. We find that machine learning approaches may\nnot always be indicated in such data settings, but that performance is highly\ncontext dependent. We present a user-friendly Shiny app REFINE2 (Realistic\nEvaluations of Finite sample INference using Efficient Estimators) that enables\nanalysts to simulate synthetic data from their own datasets and directly\nevaluate the performance of several cutting-edge algorithms in those settings.\nThis tool may greatly facilitate the proper selection and implementation of\nmachine-learning-based effect estimators in bioinformatic and clinical study\ncontexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 13:50:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 07:11:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 03:50:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 04:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

However, few prior works have thoroughly discussed about\nmodels for practical applications. Instead, they often focus on improving a\ncouple of issues at a time while ignoring the others. To bridge this gap, we\naim to explore a practical model that is accurate, robust, efficient,\ngeneralizable, and end-to-end trainable at the same time. To this end, we first\npropose a baseline model equipped with one transformer decoder as detection\nhead. In order to achieve a better accuracy, we further propose two lightweight\nmodules, namely dynamic query initialization (DQInit) and query-aware memory\n(QAMem). Specifically, DQInit dynamically initializes the queries of decoder\nfrom the inputs, enabling the model to achieve as good accuracy as the ones\nwith multiple decoder layers. QAMem is designed to enhance the discriminative\nability of queries on low-resolution feature maps by assigning separate memory\nvalues to each query rather than a shared one. With the help of QAMem, our\nmodel removes the dependence on high-resolution feature maps and is still able\nto obtain superior accuracy. Extensive experiments and analysis on three\npopular benchmarks show the effectiveness and practical advantages of the\nproposed model. Notably, our model achieves new state of the art on WFLW as\nwell as competitive results on 300W and COFW, while still running at 50+ FPS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 13:51:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 10:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-03"}

In several recent studies, deep learning\nmodels have shown significant breakthroughs in medical image segmentation\ntasks. Unlike other organs such as the lungs and liver, the cardiac organ\nconsists of multiple substructures, i.e., ventricles, atriums, aortas,\narteries, veins, and myocardium. These cardiac substructures are proximate to\neach other and have indiscernible boundaries (i.e., homogeneous intensity\nvalues), making it difficult for the segmentation network focus on the\nboundaries between the substructures. In this paper, to improve the\nsegmentation accuracy between proximate organs, we introduce a novel model to\nexploit shape and boundary-aware features. We primarily propose a shape-aware\nattention module, that exploits distance regression, which can guide the model\nto focus on the edges between substructures so that it can outperform the\nconventional contour-based attention method. In the experiments, we used the\nMulti-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation dataset that has 20 CT cardiac images\nfor training and validation, and 40 CT cardiac images for testing. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed network produces more accurate\nresults than state-of-the-art networks by improving the Dice similarity\ncoefficient score by 4.97%. Our proposed shape-aware contour attention\nmechanism demonstrates that distance transformation and boundary features\nimprove the actual attention map to strengthen the responses in the boundary\narea. Moreover, our proposed method significantly reduces the false-positive\nresponses of the final output, resulting in accurate segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 13:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

Our goal is to find a novel metric to characterize interference among\nD2D pairs, which can pave the way towards efficient and fast scheduling\nalgorithms. Towards achieving this goal, we first model the connectivity\npattern of each D2D pair, including its interference links, as a\npositively-shifted Laplacian matrix, which is a symmetric positive definite\n(SPD) one. Noting that SPD matrices constitute a non-Euclidean manifold, we\nrepresent each of the D2D pairs as a point on the SPD (i.e., conic) manifold,\nwhich is analyzed via Riemannian geometry. Accordingly we employ Riemannian\nmetrics (e.g., Log-Euclidean metric \"LEM\"), which are suitable measures of\ndistances on manifolds, to characterize the interference among D2D points on\nthe SPD manifold.\n  To validate the effectiveness of the proposed LEM-based interference measure,\nwe propose a sequential link selection algorithm that schedules D2D pairs in a\ndescending order of their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while keeping their LEM\ndistances towards the already-scheduled pairs on the Riemannian manifold to be\ngreater than a certain LEM threshold. Such LEM-based condition is equivalent to\nlimiting the interference from potential D2D pairs to be below certain\nthreshold. We show that the proposed LEM-based scheduling algorithm achieves\nsum rate of more than 86% of state-of-the-art ones (e.g., FPLinQ), while only\nrequiring spatial locations of D2D pairs, as opposed to requiring full channel\nstate information (CSI).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 14:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

Our\nmain application is a negative answer to the long-standing question of whether\nor not every Einstein $4$-orbifold (which is an Einstein metric space in a\nsynthetic sense) is limit of smooth Einstein $4$-manifolds. We more precisely\nshow that spherical and hyperbolic $4$-orbifolds with the simplest\nsingularities cannot be Gromov-Hausdorff limits of smooth Einstein $4$-metrics\nwithout relying on previous integrability assumptions. For this, we analyze the\nintegrability of deformations of Ricci-flat ALE metrics through variations of\nSchoen's Pohozaev identity. Inspired by Taub's preserved quantity in General\nRelativity, we also introduce preserved integral quantities based on the\nsymmetries of Einstein metrics. These quantities are obstructions to the\nintegrability of infinitesimal Einstein deformations \"closing up\" inside a\nhypersurface - even with change of topology. We show that many previously\nidentified obstructions to the desingularization of Einstein $4$-metrics are\nequivalent to these quantities on Ricci-flat cones. In particular, all of the\nobstructions to desingularizations bubbling out Eguchi-Hanson metrics are\nrecovered. This lets us further interpret the obstructions to the\ndesingularization of Einstein metrics as a defect of integrability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 14:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

To this end, we first decompose DNNs into a new class of unit layer\nthat is the proximal operator of an implicit convex function while keeping its\noutput unchanged. Then, the equilibrium model of the unit layer can be derived,\nnamed Optimization Induced Equilibrium Networks (OptEq), which can be easily\nextended to deep layers. The equilibrium point of OptEq can be theoretically\nconnected to the solution of its corresponding convex optimization problem with\nexplicit objectives. Based on this, we can flexibly introduce prior properties\nto the equilibrium points: 1) modifying the underlying convex problems\nexplicitly so as to change the architectures of OptEq; and 2) merging the\ninformation into the fixed point iteration, which guarantees to choose the\ndesired equilibrium point when the fixed point set is non-singleton.

Two-dimensional crystals\nand van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures allow revisiting this field on the\natomic level, allowing much finer control over the parameters and offering\natomistic interpretation of experimental observations. In this work, we\nconsider the formation of instabilities consisting of radially-oriented\nwrinkles around mono- and few-layer \"bubbles\" in two-dimensional vdW\nheterostructures. Interestingly, the shape and wavelength of the wrinkles\ndepend not only on the thickness of the two-dimensional crystal forming the\nbubble, but also on the atomistic structure of the interface between the bubble\nand the substrate, which can be controlled by their relative orientation. We\nargue that the periodic nature of these patterns emanates from an energetic\nbalance between the resistance of the top membrane to bending, which favors\nlarge wavelength of wrinkles, and the membrane-substrate vdW attraction, which\nfavors small wrinkle amplitude. Employing the classical \"Winkler foundation\"\nmodel of elasticity theory, we show that the number of radial wrinkles conveys\na valuable relationship between the bending rigidity of the top membrane and\nthe strength of the vdW interaction. Armed with this relationship, we use our\ndata to demonstrate a nontrivial dependence of the bending rigidity on the\nnumber of layers in the top membrane, which shows two different regimes driven\nby slippage between the layers, and a high sensitivity of the vdW force to the\nalignment between the substrate and the membrane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 15:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

By now, a plethora of families of codes is known, but there is\nno universal approach to finding new or optimal codes for a certain task and\nsubject to specific experimental constraints. In particular, once found, a QECC\nis typically used in very diverse contexts, while its resilience against errors\nis captured in a single figure of merit, the distance of the code. This does\nnot necessarily give rise to the most efficient protection possible given a\ncertain known error or a particular application for which the code is employed.\nIn this paper, we investigate the loss channel, which plays a key role in\nquantum communication, and in particular in quantum key distribution over long\ndistances. We develop a numerical set of tools that allows to optimize an\nencoding specifically for recovering lost particles both deterministically and\nprobabilistically, where some knowledge about what was lost is available, and\ndemonstrate its capabilities. This allows us to arrive at new codes ideal for\nthe distribution of entangled states in this particular setting, and also to\ninvestigate if encoding in qudits or allowing for non-deterministic correction\nproves advantageous compared to known QECCs.

The next generation of GW detectors may reveal more\ninformation about the polarization structure of GWs. Additionally, there is\ngrowing interest in theories of gravity beyond GR. One such theory which\nremains viable within the context of recent measurements of the speed of\npropagation of GWs is the teleparallel analogue of Horndeski gravity. In this\nwork, we explore the polarization structure of this newly proposed formulation\nof Horndeski theory. In curvature-based gravity, Horndeski theory is almost\nsynonymous with extensions to GR since it spans a large portion of these\npossible extensions. We perform this calculation by taking perturbations about\na Minkowski background and consider which mode propagates. The result is that\nthe polarization structure depends on the choice of model parameters in the\nteleparallel Horndeski Lagrangian with a maximum of seven propagating degrees\nof freedom. While the curvature-based Horndeski results follows as a particular\nlimit within this setup, we find a much richer structure of both massive and\nmassless cases which produce scalar--vector--tensor propagating degrees of\nfreedom. We also find that the GW polarization that emerges from the\nteleparallel analogue of Horndeski gravity results in analogous massive and\nmassless modes which take on at most four polarizations in the massless sector\nand two scalar ones in the massive sector. In none of the cases do we find\nvector polarizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 15:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Furthermore, a careful analysis of conical\nsingularities along axes is performed, and formulas are obtained for their\npropagation across horizons, negative mass singularities, and corners. The\nmethods are robust, and may be used to construct a multitude of further\nexamples. Lastly, we show that balancing does not occur between any two signed\nmass black holes of the type studied here in 4 dimensions, while in 5\ndimensions two-body balancing is possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 15:56:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 19:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Modern\nvehicles are also connected to external networks through vehicle-to-everything\ntechnologies, enabling their communications with other vehicles,\ninfrastructures, and smart devices. However, the improving functionality and\nconnectivity of modern vehicles also increase their vulnerabilities to\ncyber-attacks targeting both intra-vehicle and external networks due to the\nlarge attack surfaces. To secure vehicular networks, many researchers have\nfocused on developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that capitalize on\nmachine learning methods to detect malicious cyber-attacks. In this paper, the\nvulnerabilities of intra-vehicle and external networks are discussed, and a\nmulti-tiered hybrid IDS that incorporates a signature-based IDS and an\nanomaly-based IDS is proposed to detect both known and unknown attacks on\nvehicular networks. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed system\ncan detect various types of known attacks with 99.99% accuracy on the\nCAN-intrusion-dataset representing the intra-vehicle network data and 99.88%\naccuracy on the CICIDS2017 dataset illustrating the external vehicular network\ndata.

The\naverage processing time of each data packet on a vehicle-level machine is less\nthan 0.6 ms, which shows the feasibility of implementing the proposed system in\nreal-time vehicle systems. This emphasizes the effectiveness and efficiency of\nthe proposed IDS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 17:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

Existing works only focus on the convolution or BN acceleration and no\nsolution can alleviate both problems with satisfactory performance. Online\ntraining has gradually become a trend in resource-limited devices like mobile\nphones while there is still no complete technical scheme with acceptable model\nperformance, processing speed, and computational cost. In this research, an\nefficient online-training quantization framework termed EOQ is proposed by\ncombining Fixup initialization and a novel quantization scheme for DNN model\ncompression and acceleration. Based on the proposed framework, we have\nsuccessfully realized full 8-bit integer network training and removed BN in\nlarge-scale DNNs. Especially, weight updates are quantized to 8-bit integers\nfor the first time. Theoretical analyses of EOQ utilizing Fixup initialization\nfor removing BN have been further given using a novel Block Dynamical Isometry\ntheory with weaker assumptions. Benefiting from rational quantization\nstrategies and the absence of BN, the full 8-bit networks based on EOQ can\nachieve state-of-the-art accuracy and immense advantages in computational cost\nand processing speed. What is more, the design of deep learning chips can be\nprofoundly simplified for the absence of unfriendly square root operations in\nBN. Beyond this, EOQ has been evidenced to be more advantageous in small-batch\nonline training with fewer batch samples.

His\nproof was criticized as being logically circular, by Grete Hermann soon after,\nand as fundamentally flawed, by John Bell in 1964. Bell's severe criticism of\nNeumann's proof and the explicit (counter) example of a hidden variable model\nfor the measurement of a quantum spin are considered by most researchers,\nthough not all, as the definitive demonstration that Neumann's proof is\ninadequate. Despite being an argument of mathematical physics, an ambiguity of\ndecision remains to this day. I show that Neumann's assumption of the linear\nadditivity of the expectation values, even for incompatible (noncommuting)\nobservables, is a necessary constraint related to the nature of observable\nphysical variables and to the conservation laws. Therefore, any theory should\nnecessarily obey it to qualify as a physically valid theory. Then, obviously,\nthe hidden variable theories with dispersion-free ensembles that violate this\nassumption are ruled out. I show that it is Bell's counter-example that is\nfundamentally flawed, being inconsistent with the factual mechanics. Further,\nit is shown that the local hidden variable theories, for which the Bell's\ninequalities were derived, are grossly incompatible with the fundamental\nconservation laws. I identify the intrinsic uncertainty in the action as the\nreason for the irreducible dispersion, which implies that there are no\ndispersion-free ensembles at any scale of mechanics. With the unconditional\nvalidity of its central assumption shown, Neumann's proof is fully resurrected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 13:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

We first show\nthat existing link prediction schemes fail to effectively predict motifs. To\nalleviate this, we establish a general motif prediction problem and we propose\nseveral heuristics that assess the chances for a specified motif to appear. To\nmake the scores realistic, our heuristics consider - among others -\ncorrelations between links, i.e., the potential impact of some arriving links\non the appearance of other links in a given motif. Finally, for highest\naccuracy, we develop a graph neural network (GNN) architecture for motif\nprediction. Our architecture offers vertex features and sampling schemes that\ncapture the rich structural properties of motifs.

In the system, the transmitted signal is generated via\nphotonic frequency up-conversion based on a single integrated dual-polarization\ndual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator (DPol-DPMZM), whereas the echo signals\nscattered from the target are de-chirped to two low-frequency signals using a\nmicrowave photonic frequency mixer. By using the two low-frequency de-chirped\nsignals, the real-time distance and radial velocity of the moving target can be\nmeasured accurately according to the round-trip time of the echo signal and its\nDoppler frequency shift. Compared with the previous reported distance and\nvelocity measurement methods, where two LFM signals with opposite chirps are\nused, these parameters can be obtained using only a single-chirped LFM signal\nand a single-tone microwave signal. Meanwhile, high-resolution inverse\nsynthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging can also be realized using ISAR imaging\nalgorithms. An experiment is performed to verify the proposed multi-functional\nmicrowave photonic radar system. An up-chirped LFM signal from 8.5 to 12.5 GHz\nand an 8.0 GHz single-tone microwave signal are used as the transmitted signal.\nThe results show that the absolute measurement errors of distance and radial\nvelocity are less than 5.9 cm and 2.8 cm/s, respectively. ISAR imaging results\nare also demonstrated, which proves the high-resolution and real-time ISAR\nimaging ability of the proposed system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 12:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

These thermistors are sensitive to temperature\nchanges near their location on-device. While they are designed to measure the\ntemperature of the device components such as the battery, they can also sense\nchanges in the temperature of the ambient environment or thermal entities in\ncontact with the device. We have developed a model to estimate core body\ntemperature from signals sensed by these thermistors during a user interaction\nin which the user places the capacitive touchscreen of a smart device against a\nthermal site on their body such as their forehead. During the interaction, the\ndevice logs the temperature sensed by the thermistors as well as the raw\ncapacitance seen by the touch screen to capture features describing the rate of\nheat transfer from the body to the device and device-to-skin contact\nrespectively. These temperature and contact features are then used to model the\nrate of heat transferred from the user's body to the device and thus core-body\ntemperature of the user for ubiquitous and accessible fever monitoring using\nonly a smart device. We validate this system in a lab environment on a\nsimulated skin-like heat source with a temperature estimate mean absolute error\nof 0.743$^{\\circ}$F (roughly 0.4$^{\\circ}$C) and limit of agreement of\n$\\pm2.374^{\\circ}$F (roughly 1.3$^{\\circ}$C) which is comparable to some\noff-the-shelf peripheral and tympanic thermometers. We found a Pearson's\ncorrelation $R^2$ of 0.837 between ground truth temperature and temperature\nestimated by our system. We also deploy this system in an ongoing clinical\nstudy on a population of 7 participants in a clinical environment to show the\nsimilarity between simulated and clinical trials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 15:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

Based on this\nproblem, we are interested in the $q$-th cohomological transfer $Tr_q^{A}$ of\nSinger [39], which is one of the useful tools for describing mod-2 cohomology\nof the algebra $A.$ This transfer is a linear map from the space of\n$GL_q(k)$-coinvariant $k\\otimes _{GL_q(k)} P((P_q)_n^{*})$ of $Q^{\\otimes q}$\nto the $k$-cohomology group of the Steenrod algebra, ${\\rm Ext}_{A}^{q, q+n}(k,\nk).$ Here $GL_q(k)$ is the general linear group of degree $q$ over the field\n$k,$ and $P((P_q)_n^{*})$ is the primitive part of $(P_q)^{*}_n$ under the\naction of $A.$ Singer conjectured that $Tr_q^{A}$ is a monomorphism, but this\nremains unanswered for all $q\\geq 4.$ The present paper is to devoted to the\ninvestigation of this conjecture for the rank 4 case.
