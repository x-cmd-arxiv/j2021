Prominent examples of\nsuch structures are magnetic buckyball nanoarchitectures, which consist of\nferromagnetic nanowires connected at vertex positions corresponding to those of\na C60 molecule. These structures can be regarded as prototypes for the study of\nthe transition from two- to three-dimensional spin-ice lattices. In spite of\ntheir significance for three-dimensional nanomagnetism, little is known about\nthe micromagnetic properties of buckyball nanostructures. By means of\nfinite-element micromagnetic simulations, we investigate the magnetization\nstructures and the hysteretic properties of several sub-micron-sized magnetic\nbuckyballs. Similar to ordinary artificial spin ice lattices, the array can be\nmagnetized in a variety of zero-field states with vertices exhibiting different\ndegrees of magnetic frustration. Remarkably, and unlike planar geometries,\nmagnetically frustrated states can be reversibly created and dissolved by\napplying an external magnetic field. This easiness to insert and remove\ndefect-like magnetic charges, made possible by the angle-selectivity of the\nfield-induced switching of individual nanowires, demonstrates a potentially\nsignificant advantage of three-dimensional nanomagnetism compared to planar\ngeometries. The control provided by the ability to switch between ice-rule\nobeying and magnetically frustrated structures could be an important feature of\nfuture applications, including magnonic devices exploiting differences in the\nfundamental frequencies of these configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 17:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

With this choice and the input metric in analytical form, we are\nable to estimate non-linearities of light propagation by comparing and\nisolating the contributions coming from Newtonian and post-Newtonian\napproximations as opposed to linear perturbation theory. We also clarify the\nrole of the dominant post-Newtonian contribution represented by the linear\ninitial seed which, strictly speaking, is absent in the Newtonian treatment. We\nfound that post-Newtonian non-linear corrections are below $1\\%$, in agreement\nwith previous results in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 17:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

First, beyond\n~20'-30' (~100-150 kpc), the GC kinematics sampled along the minor photometric\naxis of M49 become increasingly hotter, indicating a transition from GCs\nrelated to M49 to those representing the Virgo B intra-cluster medium.

We derive robust star-formation tracers\nbased on the [CII]158 $\\mu$m line; the sum of the [OI]63$\\mu$m and\n[OIII]88$\\mu$m lines; a combination of the neon and sulfur mid-IR lines; the\nbright PAH features at 6.2 and 11.3 $\\mu$m, and the H2 rotational lines at 9.7,\n12.3 and 17 $\\mu$m. We propose the [CII]158$\\mu$m line, the combination of two\nneon lines and, for solar-like metallicity galaxies that may harbor an AGN, the\nPAH11.3$\\mu$m feature as the best SFR tracers. A reliable measure of the BHAR\ncan be obtained using the [OIV]25.9 $\\mu$m and the [NeV]14.3 and 24.3 $\\mu$m\nlines. For the most commonly observed fine-structure lines in the far-IR we\ncompare our calibration with the existing ALMA observations of high redshift\ngalaxies finding overall a good agreement with local results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 18:00:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 11:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

As current surveys\nroutinely detect planets down to terrestrial size in these systems, a more\nholistic approach that reflects their diverse architectures is timely. Here, we\ninvestigate planet formation around low-mass stars and identify differences in\nthe statistical distribution of planets. We compare the synthetic planet\npopulations to observed exoplanets. We used the Generation III Bern model of\nplanet formation and evolution to calculate synthetic populations varying the\ncentral star from solar-like stars to ultra-late M dwarfs. This model includes\nplanetary migration, N-body interactions between embryos, accretion of\nplanetesimals and gas, and long-term contraction and loss of the gaseous\natmospheres. We find that temperate, Earth-sized planets are most frequent\naround early M dwarfs and more rare for solar-type stars and late M dwarfs. The\nplanetary mass distribution does not linearly scale with the disk mass. The\nreason is the emergence of giant planets for M*>0.5 Msol, which leads to the\nejection of smaller planets. For M*>0.3 Msol there is sufficient mass in the\nmajority of systems to form Earth-like planets, leading to a similar amount of\nExo-Earths going from M to G dwarfs. In contrast, the number of super-Earths\nand larger planets increases monotonically with stellar mass. We further\nidentify a regime of disk parameters that reproduces observed M-dwarf systems\nsuch as TRAPPIST-1. However, giant planets around late M dwarfs such as GJ\n3512b only form when type I migration is substantially reduced.

Our numerical experiments confirm\nthe fourth order accuracy for computing the solution $u$, the gradient $\\nabla\nu$ and the velocity $a \\nabla u$ of the proposed compact finite difference\nscheme on uniform meshes for the elliptic interface problems with discontinuous\nand high-contrast coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 18:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Several applications of the results are illustrated,\nincluding bounds on codes for weight-preserving and run-preserving channels\n(e.g., the run-preserving insertion-deletion channel), a sphere-packing bound\nfor channels with sparse error patterns, and the asymptotics of constant-weight\nsub-block constrained sequences. In addition, the asymptotics of a closely\nrelated notion -- $ q $-ary sequences with fixed Manhattan weight -- is briefly\ndiscussed, and an application in coding for molecular timing channels is\nillustrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 18:56:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2021 10:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

The interplay among the different variables\nacting over the climate is complex, often leading to correlations across long\nspatial distances (teleconnections). In some occasions, those teleconnections\noccur with quite significant temporal shifts that are fundamental for the\nunderstanding of the underlying phenomena but which are poorly captured by\nstandard methods. Applying orthogonal decomposition such as Maximum Covariance\nAnalysis (MCA) to geophysical data sets allows to extract common dominant\npatterns between two different variables, but generally suffers from (i) the\nnon-physical orthogonal constraint as well as (ii) the consideration of simple\ncorrelations, whereby temporally offset signals are not detected. Here we\npropose an extension, complex rotated MCA, to address both limitations. We\ntransform our signals using the Hilbert transform and perform the orthogonal\ndecomposition in complex space, allowing us to correctly correlate out-of-phase\nsignals. Subsequent Varimax rotation removes the orthogonal constraints,\nleading to more physically meaningful modes of geophysical variability. As an\nexample of application, we have employed this method on sea surface temperature\nand continental precipitation; our method successfully captures the temporal\nand spatial interactions between these two variables, namely for (i) the\nseasonal cycle, (ii) canonical ENSO, (iii) the global warming trend, (iv) the\nPacific Decadal Oscillation, (v) ENSO Modoki and finally (vi) the Atlantic\nMeridional Mode.

The first stage of LOFAR 2.0 will introduce a distributed\nclock signal and allow for simultaneous observation with all the low-band and\nhigh-band antennas of the array. Our aim is to provide a tool for accurate\nsimulations of LOFAR 2.0.

It remains a challenging\ndomain as visual scenes evolve according to complex underlying dynamics, such\nas the camera's egocentric motion or the distinct motility per individual\nobject viewed. These are mostly hidden from the observer and manifest as often\nhighly non-linear transformations between consecutive video frames. Therefore,\nvideo prediction is of interest not only in anticipating visual changes in the\nreal world but has, above all, emerged as an unsupervised learning rule\ntargeting the formation and dynamics of the observed environment. Many of the\ndeep learning-based state-of-the-art models for video prediction utilize some\nform of recurrent layers like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) or Gated Recurrent\nUnits (GRUs) at the core of their models. Although these models can predict the\nfuture frames, they rely entirely on these recurrent structures to\nsimultaneously perform three distinct tasks: extracting transformations,\nprojecting them into the future, and transforming the current frame. In order\nto completely interpret the formed internal representations, it is crucial to\ndisentangle these tasks.

We derive the relevant theoretical foundations and showcase\nresults on synthetic as well as real data.

Bayesian\nexploration strategies like Thompson Sampling resolve this trade-off in a\nprincipled way by modeling and updating the distribution of the parameters of\nthe action-value function, the outcome model of the environment. However, this\ntechnique becomes infeasible for complex environments due to the computational\nintractability of maintaining probability distributions over parameters of\noutcome models of corresponding complexity. Moreover, the approximation\ntechniques introduced to mitigate this issue typically result in poor\nexploration-exploitation trade-offs, as observed in the case of deep neural\nnetwork models with approximate posterior methods that have been shown to\nunderperform in the deep bandit scenario.

Flow was driven, in concert, by a constant pressure gradient and\nby the synchronous oscillation of the lateral walls. This prototypical setup\nserves to aid understanding of unsteady magnetohydrodynamic flows in liquid\nmetal coolant ducts subjected to transverse magnetic fields, motivated by the\nconditions expected in magnetic confinement fusion reactors. A wide range of\nwall oscillation frequencies and amplitudes were simulated. Focus was placed on\nthe driving pulsation optimized for the greatest reduction in the critical\nReynolds number, for a range of friction parameters $H$ (proportional to\nmagnetic field strength). An almost $70$% reduction in the critical Reynolds\nnumber, relative to that for the steady base flow, was obtained toward the\nhydrodynamic limit ($H=10^{-7}$), while just over a $90$% reduction was\nobtained by $H=10$. For all oscillation amplitudes, increasing $H$ consistently\nled to an increasing percentage reduction in the critical Reynolds number. This\nis a promising result, given fusion relevant conditions of $H \\geq 10^4$. These\nreductions were obtained by selecting a frequency that both ensures prominent\ninflection points, and a growth in perturbation energy in phase with\ndeceleration of the base flow. Nonlinear simulations at the optimized frequency\nand amplitude still satisfied the no net growth condition at the greatly\nreduced critical Reynolds numbers. However, although the linear mode undergoes\na symmetry breaking process, turbulence was not triggered. Nonlinear base flow\nmodulation also arrested the linear decay of the perturbation, with exponential\ngrowth not observed at supercritical Reynolds numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 21:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

In this paper, to solve these problems, we propose a game\ntheory-based approach with the objective to reduce service latency in the\ncontext of SFC at the network edge. The problem of allocating SFC resources can\nbe divided into two subproblems. 1) The VNF placement and routing subproblem,\nand 2) the VNF scheduling subproblem.

This is\nbecause these models properly account for dynamic processes at the molecular\nlevel and provide a clear physical picture. Recent theoretical studies made a\nsurprising discovery that in complex systems the symmetry of molecular\nforward/backward transition times with respect to local bias in the dynamics\nmay be broken and it may take longer to go downhill than uphill. The physical\norigins of these phenomena remain not fully understood. Here we explore in more\ndetail the microscopic features of the symmetry breaking in the\nforward/backward transition times by analyzing exactly solvable discrete-state\nstochastic models. In particular, we consider a specific case of two random\nwalkers on four-sites periodic lattice as the way to represent the general\nsystems with multiple pathways. It is found that the asymmetry in transition\ntimes depends on several factors that include the degree of deviation from\nequilibrium, the particle crowding and methods of measurements of dynamic\nproperties. Our theoretical analysis suggests that the asymmetry in transition\ntimes can be explored experimentally for determining the important microscopic\nfeatures of natural processes by quantitative measuring the local deviations\nfrom equilibrium and the degrees of crowding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 23:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

This improves the\neffect of domain adaptation, but domain differences exist not only between\nclasses, but also between samples. This work rethinks what is the alignment\nbetween different domains, and studies how to achieve the real alignment\nbetween different domains. Previous DA methods only considered one distribution\nfeature of aligned samples, such as full distribution or local distribution. In\naddition to aligning the global distribution, the real domain adaptation should\nalso align the meso distribution and the micro distribution.

Under 4.6 GPa pressure, the soft ferromagnet changes\ninto hard one, signalled by a rectangular hysteretic loop with remnant\nmagnetization at zero field. Interestingly, with further increasing pressure,\nthe coercive field (H_c) dramatically increases from 0.02 T at 4.6 GPa to 0.17\nT at 7.8 GPa, and the Curie temperature (T_c^h: the temperature for closing the\nhysteresis loop) also increases from ~36 K at 4.6 GPa to ~138 K at 7.8 GPa. The\ninfluences of pressure on exchange interactions are further investigated by\ndensity functional theory calculations, which reveal that the in-plane\nnearest-neighbor exchange interaction and magneto-crystalline anisotropy\nincrease simultaneously as pressure increases, leading to increased H_c and\nT_c^h in experiments.

When a user chooses to leave a social networking platform, it may\ncause a cascading dropping out among her friends. In many scenarios, it would\nbe a good idea to persuade critical users to stay active in the network and\nprevent such a cascade because critical users can have significant influence on\nuser engagement of the whole network. Many user engagement studies have been\nconducted to find a set of critical (anchored) users in the static social\nnetwork. However, social networks are highly dynamic and their structures are\ncontinuously evolving. In order to fully utilize the power of anchored users in\nevolving networks, existing studies have to mine multiple sets of anchored\nusers at different times, which incurs an expensive computational cost. To\nbetter understand user engagement in evolving network, we target a new research\nproblem called Anchored Vertex Tracking (AVT) in this paper, aiming to track\nthe anchored users at each timestamp of evolving networks.

When the solar radiation is incident on the photovoltaics (PV)\npanel, a large portion of it is absorbed by the underlying material which\nincreases its internal energy leading to the generation of heat. An overheated\nPV panel results in a decline in its performance which calls for an efficient\ncooling mechanism that can offer an optimum output of the electrical power. In\nthe present numerical work, thermal management with a porous nanochannels\ndevice capable to dissipate high heat flux is employed to regulate the\ntemperature of a commercial PV panel by integrating the device on the back face\nof the panel. The spatial and temporal variation of the PV surface temperature\nis obtained by solving the energy balance equation numerically. By evaluating\nthe steady-state PV surface temperature with and without thermal management,\nthe extent of cooling and the resulting enhancement in the electrical power\noutput is studied in detail. The nanochannels device is found to reduce the PV\nsurface temperature significantly with an average cooling of 31.5 oC.\nAdditionally, the enhancement in the electrical power output by ~33% and the\nreduction in the response time to 1/8th highlight the potential of using porous\nnanochannels as a thermal management device.

However, these methods may ignore the underlying\ndistribution of clean images, inducing distortions or artifacts in denoising\nresults. This paper proposes a new perspective to treat image denoising as a\ndistribution learning and disentangling task. Since the noisy image\ndistribution can be viewed as a joint distribution of clean images and noise,\nthe denoised images can be obtained via manipulating the latent representations\nto the clean counterpart. This paper also provides a distribution learning\nbased denoising framework. Following this framework, we present an invertible\ndenoising network, FDN, without any assumptions on either clean or noise\ndistributions, as well as a distribution disentanglement method. FDN learns the\ndistribution of noisy images, which is different from the previous CNN based\ndiscriminative mapping. Experimental results demonstrate FDN's capacity to\nremove synthetic additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) on both category-specific\nand remote sensing images. Furthermore, the performance of FDN surpasses that\nof previously published methods in real image denoising with fewer parameters\nand faster speed.

Conditioned on the varied importance of\ndifferent relations, the generated clarifying questions could perform better in\nimpelling users to provide more details on their preferences. Finially,\naccurate recommendations can be generated in fewer conversational turns.\nFurthermore, the proposed KBQG outperforms all baselines in our experiments on\ntwo real-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 03:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

However, existing\nmethods perform contrastive learning on selected samples between teacher and\nstudent networks, which is sensitive to noises in pseudo labels and neglects\nthe relationship among most samples. Moreover, these methods are not effective\nin cooperation of different teacher networks. To handle these issues, this\npaper proposes a Graph Consistency based Mean-Teaching (GCMT) method with\nconstructing the Graph Consistency Constraint (GCC) between teacher and student\nnetworks. Specifically, given unlabeled training images, we apply teacher\nnetworks to extract corresponding features and further construct a teacher\ngraph for each teacher network to describe the similarity relationships among\ntraining images. To boost the representation learning, different teacher graphs\nare fused to provide the supervise signal for optimizing student networks. GCMT\nfuses similarity relationships predicted by different teacher networks as\nsupervision and effectively optimizes student networks with more sample\nrelationships involved. Experiments on three datasets, i.e., Market-1501,\nDukeMTMCreID, and MSMT17, show that proposed GCMT outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods by clear margin. Specially, GCMT even outperforms the previous method\nthat uses a deeper backbone.

Photochromic indicators (PCIs) can accurately\nmeasure UV-C dose on nonplanar surfaces, but often saturate below doses\nrequired to decontaminate porous, multilayered textiles such as N95s. Here, we\ninvestigate the use of optical attenuators to extend PCI dynamic range while\nmaintaining a near-ideal angular response - critical for accurate measurements\nwhen UV-C is uncollimated. Through an analytical model, we show that tuning\nattenuator refractive index, attenuation coefficient, and thickness can extend\ndynamic range, but compromises ideal angular response unless the attenuator is\nan ideal diffuser. To demonstrate this tradeoff empirically, we pair PCIs with\nmodel specular (floated borosilicate) and diffuse (polytetrafluoroethylene)\nattenuators, characterize the angular response, and evaluate on-N95 UV-C dose\nmeasurement accuracy of each PCI-attenuator stack in a UV-C decontamination\nsystem.

In order to reveal AGN activities obscured\nby large amounts of dust, we select 115 mid-IR spectra of heavily obscured AGNs\nobserved by Spitzer/IRS, and systematically analyze the composition of silicate\ndust by spectral fitting using the 10~$\\mu$m amorphous and 23~$\\mu$m\ncrystalline bands. We find that the main component of the silicate dust\nobscuring AGNs is amorphous olivine, the median mass column density of which is\none order of magnitude higher than those of the minor components of amorphous\npyroxene and crystalline forsterite. The median mass fraction of the amorphous\npyroxene, $\\sim$2\\%, is significantly lower than that of the diffuse\ninterstellar medium (ISM) dust in our Galaxy, while the median mass fraction of\nthe crystalline forsterite, $\\sim$6\\%, is higher than that of the diffuse ISM\ndust. We also find that the mass fractions of the amorphous pyroxene and the\ncrystalline forsterite positively correlate with each other. The low mass\nfraction of the amorphous pyroxene suggests that the obscuring silicate dust is\nnewly formed, originating from starburst activities. The relatively high mass\nfraction of crystalline forsterite implies that the silicate dust is processed\nin the high temperature environment close to the nucleus and transported to\nouter cooler regions by molecular outflows. The positive correlation between\nthe mass fractions can be naturally explained considering that amorphous\npyroxene is transformed from crystalline forsterite by ion bombardments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 05:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

Although a few recently developed algorithms make\nthe computation efficient in presence of a small to moderately large sample\nsize (with the complexity growing in the cubic order of n), the computation\nbecomes intractable when sample size n is also large. In this article we adopt\nthe data sketching approach to compress the n original samples by a random\nlinear transformation to m<<n samples in p dimensions, and compute Bayesian\nregression with Gaussian scale mixture prior distributions with the randomly\ncompressed response vector and feature matrix. Our proposed approach yields\ncomputational complexity growing in the cubic order of m. Another important\nmotivation for this compression procedure is that it anonymizes the data by\nrevealing little information about the original data in the course of analysis.\nOur detailed empirical investigation with the Horseshoe prior from the class of\nGaussian scale mixture priors shows closely similar inference and a massive\nreduction in per iteration computation time of the proposed approach compared\nto the regression with the full sample.

However, there has been little work on integrating the unique\nstatistical distributions of SAR images which can reveal physical properties of\nterrain objects, into CNNs in a supervised feature learning framework. To\naddress this problem, a novel end-to-end supervised classification method is\nproposed for HR SAR images by considering both spatial context and statistical\nfeatures. First, to extract more effective spatial features from SAR images, a\nnew deep spatial context encoder network (DSCEN) is proposed, which is a\nlightweight structure and can be effectively trained with a small number of\nsamples. Meanwhile, to enhance the diversity of statistics, the nonstationary\njoint statistical model (NS-JSM) is adopted to form the global statistical\nfeatures. Specifically, SAR images are transformed into the Gabor wavelet\ndomain and the produced multi-subbands magnitudes and phases are modeled by the\nlog-normal and uniform distribution. The covariance matrix is further utilized\nto capture the inter-scale and intra-scale nonstationary correlation between\nthe statistical subbands and make the joint statistical features more compact\nand distinguishable. Considering complementary advantages, a feature fusion\nnetwork (Fusion-Net) base on group compression and smooth normalization is\nconstructed to embed the statistical features into the spatial features and\noptimize the fusion feature representation. As a result, our model can learn\nthe discriminative features and improve the final classification performance.\nExperiments on four HR SAR images validate the superiority of the proposed\nmethod over other related algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 06:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

For all three jet conditions simulated, LES predicts qualitatively\nsimilar near-field flow statistics to those measured at the University of\nCincinnati. Using the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings method, LES captures the\nfundamental screech tone and its harmonics fairly well at multiple observer\nlocations in the far-field. Intense jet flapping motions in the near-field\nalong the minor axis, which are influenced by jet-to-jet interactions, are\nfound to correspond to those frequencies. Moreover, the predicted overall sound\npressure levels are within 1-2 dB of the experimental measurements. However,\nthe screech tones appear to be intermittent, as the twin-jet interaction\npattern varies irregularly. To extract dominant flow structures at the screech\nfrequencies and identify the twin-jet coupling modes, spectral proper\northogonal decomposition (SPOD) analysis is used. SPOD analysis recovers\nenergetic peaks at the screech frequencies, and the corresponding leading modes\nindicate strong upstream radiation originating from the fifth/sixth\nshock-cells. For the two over-expanded conditions, the leading modes show\nanti-symmetric coupling in the minor axis at the fundamental screech\nfrequencies. In contrast, the two jets behave symmetrically with respect to\neach other in the major axis, in line with the absence of jet flapping in this\ndirection. Furthermore, the leading SPOD eigenvalues turn out to be, at least,\ntwo orders of magnitude larger than higher-order eigenvalues, suggesting\npotential of reduced-order models for the twin-jet screech.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 07:15:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2022 13:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 23:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

We propose an optimal transmit\nstrategy which maximizes a weighted sum of the average harvested powers at the\nEH nodes under a constraint on the power budget of the transmitter. First, for\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) WPT systems, we show that it is optimal to\ntransmit scalar symbols with an arbitrary phase and an amplitude, whose\nprobability density function (pdf) has at most two mass points, using maximum\nratio transmission (MRT) beamforming. Then, we prove that for single-input\nmultiple-output (SIMO) WPT systems, the optimal transmit symbol amplitudes are\ndiscrete random variables, whose pdf also has no more than two mass points. For\ngeneral multi-user MIMO WPT systems, we show that the optimal transmit strategy\ninvolves scalar unit-norm symbols with arbitrary phase and at most two\nbeamforming vectors. In order to determine these vectors, we formulate a\nnon-convex optimization problem and obtain an optimal solution based on\nmonotonic optimization. Since the computational complexity of the optimal\nsolution is high, we also propose a low-complexity iterative algorithm to\nobtain a suboptimal solution, which achieves nearly optimal performance. Our\nsimulation results reveal that the proposed transmit strategy for multi-user\nMIMO WPT systems outperforms two baseline schemes, which are based on a linear\nEH model and a single beamforming vector, respectively. For a given transmit\npower budget, we show that the harvested power saturates when increasing the\nnumber of transmit antennas. Finally, we observe that the harvested power\nregion spanned by multiple EH nodes is convex and the power harvested at one EH\nnode can be traded for a higher harvested power at the other nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 07:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Contrary to the expectations, the preliminary results\nof the ALICE Collaboration indicate that, e.g., the proton-to-pion ratio does\nnot exhibit the characteristic enhancement at intermediate $p_{\\rm T}$ in\nevents with large $R_{\\rm T}$ with respect to minimum-bias pp collisions. In\nthis work, we investigate the origin of this effect using the PYTHIA 8 and\nHERWIG 7 Monte Carlo event generators. The effect is a consequence of a\nselection bias attributed to wide-angle gluon emissions which creates jets that\npopulate the transverse region. Therefore, we propose a modified version of\n$R_{\\rm T}$ in order to suppress its sensitivity to hard gluon Bremsstrahlung,\nand enhance the sensitivity to soft Multiparton Interactions (MPI). This\napproach could be useful in order to study the particle production in the\njet-like region as a function of MPI. The implementation of these ideas in data\nwill provide more insight into the production mechanisms of hadrons in\nhigh-multiplicity pp collisions, and its connection with heavy-ion phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 07:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

Conventional adversarial attack takes place in the inference\nstage, often fooling a model by perturbing samples. In contrast, backdoor\nattack aims to implant triggers into a model during the training stage, such\nthat the victim model acts normally on the clean data unless a trigger is\npresent in a sample. This work follows a typical setting of clean-label\nbackdoor attack, where a few poisoned samples (with their content tampered yet\nlabels unchanged) are injected into the training set. The unique contributions\nof MorphNet are two-fold. First, it is key to ensure the implanted triggers\nboth visually imperceptible to humans and lead to high attack success rate on\nthe point clouds. To this end, MorphNet jointly optimizes two objectives for\nsample-adaptive poisoning: a reconstruction loss that preserves the visual\nsimilarity between benign / poisoned point clouds, and a classification loss\nthat enforces a modern recognition model of point clouds tends to mis-classify\nthe poisoned sample to a pre-specified target category. This implicitly\nconducts spectral separation over point clouds, hiding sample-adaptive triggers\nin fine-grained high-frequency details. Secondly, existing backdoor attack\nmethods are mainly designed for image data, easily defended by some point cloud\nspecific operations (such as denoising). We propose a third loss in MorphNet\nfor suppressing isolated points, leading to improved resistance to\ndenoising-based defense. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on ModelNet40\nand ShapeNetcorev2.

The comparison with stellar evolution models confirms that\nclassical models cannot reproduce the lithium abundances observed in the\nmetallicity and mass regimes covered by the data. The models that include the\neffects of both rotation-induced mixing and thermohaline instability account\nfor the Li abundance trends observed in our sample, in all metallicity and mass\nranges.

This is tested in a version of operational\nextended range forecasts based on Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2)\ndeveloped at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune. Forecast\nskills are assessed to understand the role of initial errors on the prediction\nskill for MJO. A set of lowest and highest initial day error (LIDE & HIDE)\ncases are defined and the error-growth for these categories are analysed for\nthe strong MJO events during May to September (MJJAS).

The probability distribution of bivariate\nRMSE and error growth evolution (first order difference of index error for each\nsuccessive lead days) with respect to extended range lead-time are used as\nmetrics in this analysis.

In this paper, we propose a novel Consistent\nMultiple Graph Embedding Clustering framework(CMGEC). Specifically, a multiple\ngraph auto-encoder(M-GAE) is designed to flexibly encode the complementary\ninformation of multi-view data using a multi-graph attention fusion encoder. To\nguide the learned common representation maintaining the similarity of the\nneighboring characteristics in each view, a Multi-view Mutual Information\nMaximization module(MMIM) is introduced. Furthermore, a graph fusion\nnetwork(GFN) is devised to explore the relationship among graphs from different\nviews and provide a common consensus graph needed in M-GAE. By jointly training\nthese models, the common latent representation can be obtained which encodes\nmore complementary information from multiple views and depicts data more\ncomprehensively.

Due to a naturally small mass splitting between the two neutral scalar\ncomponents, inelastic scattering processes with nucleons can occur.

Most existing methods\ndirectly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,\nwhich ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the\nperformance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for\nshallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination\nin the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning\nalgorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly\noptimize network structure without retraining.

The\nrepresentative projects are TrueBit, Arbitrum, YODA, ACE, and Optimism.\nInspired by visionaries in academia and industry, we consider the DNN\ncomputation to be promising but on the next level of complexity for the\nverification paradigm of smart contract. Unfortunately, even for the\nstate-of-the-art verification paradigm, off-chain VM execution of DNN\ncomputation has an orders-of-magnitude slowdown compared to the native\noff-chain execution.\n  To enable the native off-chain execution of verifiable DNN computation, we\npresent Agatha system, which solves the significant challenges of misalignment\nand inconsistency: (1) Native DNN computation has a graph-based computation\nparadigm misaligned with previous VM-based execution and arbitration; (2)\nNative DNN computation may be inconsistent cross platforms which invalidates\nthe verification paradigm. In response, we propose the graph-based pinpoint\nprotocol (GPP) which enables the pinpoint protocol on computational graphs, and\nbridges the native off-chain execution and the contract arbitration.

This paper proposes the first Megapixel level method for\none shot Face Swapping (or MegaFS for short). Firstly, MegaFS organizes face\nrepresentation hierarchically by the proposed Hierarchical Representation Face\nEncoder (HieRFE) in an extended latent space to maintain more facial details,\nrather than compressed representation in previous face swapping methods.\nSecondly, a carefully designed Face Transfer Module (FTM) is proposed to\ntransfer the identity from a source image to the target by a non-linear\ntrajectory without explicit feature disentanglement. Finally, the swapped faces\ncan be synthesized by StyleGAN2 with the benefits of its training stability and\npowerful generative capability. Each part of MegaFS can be trained separately\nso the requirement of our model for GPU memory can be satisfied for megapixel\nface swapping. In summary, complete face representation, stable training, and\nlimited memory usage are the three novel contributions to the success of our\nmethod. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MegaFS and the\nfirst megapixel level face swapping database is released for research on\nDeepFake detection and face image editing in the public domain.

The strongly-coupled relationships among robots and tasks, the\nredundancy of the MPDA encoding, and the variable-size decision space of the\nMO-MPDA problem posed extra challenges for addressing the problem effectively.\nTo address the above issues, we develop a hybrid decomposition-based\nmulti-objective evolutionary algorithm (HDMOEA) using $ \\varepsilon\n$-constraint method.

However, previous research has revealed API misuses\nthat violate the contract of APIs to be prevalent. Such misuses can have\nharmful consequences, especially in the context of cryptographic libraries.\nVarious API misuse detectors have been proposed to address this issue including\nCogniCrypt, one of the most versatile of such detectors and that uses a\nlanguage CrySL to specify cryptographic API usage contracts. Nonetheless,\nexisting approaches to detect API misuse had not been designed for systematic\nreuse, ignoring the fact that different versions of a library, different\nversions of a platform, and different recommendations or guidelines might\nintroduce variability in the correct usage of an API. Yet, little is known\nabout how such variability impacts the specification of the correct API usage.\nThis paper investigates this question by analyzing the impact of various\nsources of variability on widely used Java cryptographic libraries including\nJCA, Bouncy Castle, and Google Tink. The results of our investigation show that\nsources of variability like new versions of the API and security standards\nsignificantly impact the specifications. We then use the insights gained from\nour investigation to motivate an extension to the CrySL language named\nMetaCrySL, which builds on meta programming concepts.

To aid\ndecision makers in their assessments, institutions increasingly rely on\nalgorithmic risk assessment instruments (RAIs). These tools assess the\nlikelihood that an individual will be arrested for a new criminal offense\nwithin some time window following their release. However, since not all crimes\nresult in arrest, RAIs do not directly assess the risk of re-offense.\nFurthermore, disparities in the likelihood of arrest can potentially lead to\nbiases in the resulting risk scores. Several recent validations of RAIs have\ntherefore focused on arrests for violent offenses, which are viewed as being\nmore accurate reflections of offending behavior. In this paper, we investigate\nbiases in violent arrest data by analysing racial disparities in the likelihood\nof arrest for White and Black violent offenders. We focus our study on\n2007--2016 incident-level data of violent offenses from 16 US states as\nrecorded in the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Our analysis\nshows that the magnitude and direction of the racial disparities depend on\nvarious characteristics of the crimes. In addition, our investigation reveals\nlarge variations in arrest rates across geographical locations and offense\ntypes. We discuss the implications of the observed disconnect between re-arrest\nand re-offense in the context of RAIs and the challenges around the use of data\nfrom NIBRS to correct for the sampling bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 11:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

For integral field spectrographs\nyielding hyperspectral data, this means that the field of view consists of\ndiffracted starlight spectra and a spatially localized planet. Analysis usually\nrelies on cross-correlation with theoretical spectra. In a purely blind-search\ncontext, this supervised strategy can be biased with model mismatch and/or be\ncomputationally inefficient. Using an approach that is inspired by the\nremote-sensing community, we aim to propose an alternative to cross-correlation\nthat is fully data-driven, which decomposes the data into a set of individual\nspectra and their corresponding spatial distributions. This strategy is called\nspectral unmixing. We used an orthogonal subspace projection to identify the\nmost distinct spectra in the field of view. Their spatial distribution maps\nwere then obtained by inverting the data. These spectra were then used to break\nthe original hyperspectral images into their corresponding spatial distribution\nmaps via non-negative least squares. The performance of our method was\nevaluated and compared with a cross-correlation using simulated hyperspectral\ndata with medium resolution from the ELT/HARMONI integral field spectrograph.\nWe show that spectral unmixing effectively leads to a planet detection solely\nbased on spectral dissimilarities at significantly reduced computational cost.\nThe extracted spectrum holds significant signatures of the planet while being\nnot perfectly separated from residual starlight. The sensitivity of the\nsupervised cross-correlation is three to four times higher than with\nunsupervised spectral unmixing, the gap is biased toward the former because the\ninjected and correlated spectrum match perfectly. The algorithm was furthermore\nvetted on real data obtained with VLT/SINFONI of the beta Pictoris system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 12:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

However, they are mainly based on\nimage-to-image adversarial training and little consideration is given to\nsemantic variations of an object among images, failing to capture a\ncomprehensive picture of different categories. This motivates us to explore a\nholistic representative, the semantic distribution from each category in source\ndomain, to mitigate the problem above. In this paper, we present semantic\ndistribution-aware contrastive adaptation algorithm that enables pixel-wise\nrepresentation alignment under the guidance of semantic distributions.\nSpecifically, we first design a pixel-wise contrastive loss by considering the\ncorrespondences between semantic distributions and pixel-wise representations\nfrom both domains. Essentially, clusters of pixel representations from the same\ncategory should cluster together and those from different categories should\nspread out. Next, an upper bound on this formulation is derived by involving\nthe learning of an infinite number of (dis)similar pairs, making it efficient.\nFinally, we verify that SDCA can further improve segmentation accuracy when\nintegrated with the self-supervised learning.

In this thesis we explore these connections using an enhanced version of\nthe RT construction. Our invariants take the holonomy of a flat connection on\nthe link complement as input, so we call them holonomy invariants. The case of\ntrivial holonomy recovers the ordinary RT construction.\n  We consider holonomy representations into $\\operatorname{SL}_2(\\mathbb C)$,\nwhich are closely related to hyperbolic geometry. In order to define our\ninvariants we consider a particular coordinate system on the space of\nrepresentations closely related to the octahedral decomposition of the knot\ncomplement.

This approximation may lead to\nsub-optimal latent space representations. In this work, we investigate a\ndecoder-only method that uses gradient flow to encode data samples in the\nlatent space. The gradient flow is defined based on a given decoder and aims to\nfind the optimal latent space representation for any given sample through\noptimisation, eliminating the need of an approximate inversion through an\nencoder. Implementing gradient flow through ordinary differential equations\n(ODE), we leverage the adjoint method to train a given decoder.

The\noriginality in the CLaRyS approach is to use a beam-tagging hodoscope in\ncoincidence with the gamma detectors to provide both temporal and spatial\ninformation of the incoming ions. The ion range sensitivity of such PG\ndetection systems could be improved by detecting single ions with a 100 ps\n($\\sigma$) time resolution, through a quality assurance procedure at low beam\nintensity at the beginning of the treatment session. This work presents the\ninvestigations led to assess the performance of Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)\ndiamond detectors to fulfill these requirements. A $^{90}$Sr beta source, 68\nMeV protons, 95 MeV/u carbon ions and a synchrotron X-ray pulsed beam were used\nto measure the time resolution, single ion detection efficiency and proton\ncounting capability of various CVD diamond samples. An offline technique, based\non double-sided readout with fast current preamplifiers and used to improve the\nsignal-to-noise ratio, is also presented. The different tests highlighted\nTime-Of-Flight resolutions ranging from 13 ps ($\\sigma$) to 250 ps ($\\sigma$),\ndepending on the experimental conditions. The single 68 MeV proton detection\nefficiency of various large area polycrystalline (pCVD) samples was measured to\nbe $>$96% using coincidence measurements with a single-crystal reference\ndetector. Single-crystal CVD (sCVD) diamond proved to be able to count a\ndiscrete number of simultaneous protons while it was not achievable with a\npolycrystalline sample. Considering the results of the present study, two\ndiamond hodoscope demonstrators are under development: one based on sCVD, and\none of larger size based on pCVD.

We first show that state-of-the-art SCC techniques have two key\nlimitations for in-the-wild deployment: (a) the decoding accuracy drops rapidly\nunder even modest screen extraction errors from the captured images, and (b)\nthey generate perceptible flickers on common refresh rate screens even with\nminimal modulation of pixel intensity. To overcome these challenges, we\nintroduce DeepLight, a system that incorporates machine learning (ML) models in\nthe decoding pipeline to achieve humanly-imperceptible, moderately high SCC\nrates under diverse real-world conditions. Deep-Light's key innovation is the\ndesign of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based decoder that collectively decodes\nall the bits spatially encoded in a display frame, without attempting to\nprecisely isolate the pixels associated with each encoded bit. In addition,\nDeepLight supports imperceptible encoding by selectively modulating the\nintensity of only the Blue channel, and provides reasonably accurate screen\nextraction (IoU values >= 83%) by using state-of-the-art object detection DNN\npipelines. We show that a fully functional DeepLight system is able to robustly\nachieve high decoding accuracy (frame error rate < 0.2) and moderately-high\ndata goodput (>=0.95Kbps) using a human-held smartphone camera, even over\nlarger screen-camera distances (approx =2m).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 14:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

The main\ntechniques used in this paper are combination of the newly developed functional\nIt^o formula and a dynamical system approach. Compared to the study of\nstochastic Kolmogorov systems without delays, the main difficulty is that\ninfinite dimensional systems have to be treated. The extinction is\ncharacterized after investigating random occupation measures and examining\nbehavior of functional systems around boundaries. Our characterizations of\nlong-term behavior of the systems reduces to that of Kolmogorov systems without\ndelay when there is no past dependence. A number of applications are also\nexamined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 15:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Additionally, we compare our results to those\nobtained by GOTO's own in-house pipeline, {\\sc gotophoto}, and obtain similar\nresults. Based on repeatability measurements, we measure a $5\\sigma$ L-band\nsurvey depth of between 19 and 20 magnitudes, depending on observing\nconditions. We assess, using repeated observations of non-varying standard SDSS\nstars, the accuracy of our uncertainties, which we find are typically\noverestimated by roughly a factor of two for bright sources (i.e., $<15^{\\rm\nth}$~mag), but slightly underestimated (by roughly a factor of 1.25) for\nfainter sources ($>17^{\\rm th}$~mag). Finally, we present lightcurves for a\nselection of variable sources, and compare them to those obtained with the\nZwicky Transient Factory and GAIA.

Advances in ITS technologies and the advent of\nautonomousvehicles are changing mobility dramatically. They enable the\nimplementation of acoordination mechanism, called coordinated traffic\nassignment, among the sat-navdevices aiming at assigning paths to drivers to\neliminate congestion and to re-duce the total travel time in traffic networks.\nAmong possible congestion avoidance methods, coordinated traffic assignment is\na valuable choice since it does not involvehuge investments to expand the road\nnetwork. Traffic assignments are traditionally devoted to two main perspectives\non which the well-known Wardropian principlesare inspired: the user equilibrium\nand the system optimum. User equilibrium is a user-driven traffic assignment in\nwhich each user chooses the most convenientpath selfishly. It guarantees that\nfairness among users is respected since, whenthe equilibrium is reached, all\nusers sharing the same origin and destination willexperience the same travel\ntime. The main drawback in a user equilibrium is thatthe system total travel\ntime is not minimized and, hence, the so-called Price ofAnarchy is paid. On the\nother hand, the system optimum is an efficient system-wide traffic assignment\nin which drivers are routed on the network in such a waythe total travel time\nis minimized but users might experience travel times that arehigher than the\nother users travelling from the same origin to the same destina-tion affecting\nthe compliance. Thus, drawbacks in implementing one of the two assignments can\nbe overcome by hybridizing the two approaches aiming at bridging users'\nfairness to system-wide efficiency.

This is a suitable base for clustering tasks, as the\nlatent space often seems to effectively capture the inherent essence of data,\nsimplifying its manifold and reducing noise. In this article, the VAE framework\nis used to investigate how probability function gradient ascent over data\npoints can be used to process data in order to achieve better clustering.\nImprovements in classification is observed comparing with unprocessed data,\nalthough state of the art results are not obtained.

Recent works in\nneural scene representations show promising results for inferring generic\nthree-dimensional scenes from optical images. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)\nhave shown success in rendering highly specular surfaces using a large number\nof images and their pose. More recently, Generative Radiance Fields (GRAF)\nachieved full volumetric reconstruction of a scene from unposed images only,\nthanks to the use of an adversarial framework to train a NeRF. In this paper,\nwe compare and evaluate the potential of NeRF and GRAF to render novel views\nand extract the 3D shape of two different spacecraft, the Soil Moisture and\nOcean Salinity satellite of ESA's Living Planet Programme and a generic cube\nsat. Considering the best performances of both models, we observe that NeRF has\nthe ability to render more accurate images regarding the material specularity\nof the spacecraft and its pose. For its part, GRAF generates precise novel\nviews with accurate details even when parts of the satellites are shadowed\nwhile having the significant advantage of not needing any information about the\nrelative pose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 08:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

The constraints can be either\nimposed as terms in a loss function or used to formulate a neural ansatz. In\nthe present case study, we calculate the induced field inside and outside a\ndielectric cube placed in a uniform electric field, wherein the dielectric\nmismatch at edges and corners of the cube makes accurate calculations\nnumerically challenging. The electric potential is expressed as an ansatz\nincorporating neural networks with known leading order behaviors and symmetries\nand the Laplace's equation is then solved with boundary conditions at the\ndielectric interface by minimizing a loss function. The loss function ensures\nthat both Laplace's equation and boundary conditions are satisfied everywhere\ninside a large solution domain. We study how the electric potential inside and\noutside a quasi-cubic particle evolves through a sequence of shapes from a\nsphere to a cube. The neural network being differentiable, it is\nstraightforward to calculate the electric field over the whole domain, the\ninduced surface charge distribution and the polarizability. The neural network\nbeing retentive, one can efficiently follow how the field changes upon\nparticle's shape or dielectric constant by iterating from any previously\nconverged solution. The present work's objective is two-fold, first to show how\nan a priori knowledge can be incorporated into neural networks to achieve\nefficient learning and second to apply the method and study how the induced\nfield and polarizability change when a dielectric particle progressively\nchanges its shape from a sphere to a cube.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 10:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

Based upon 17 years of the\nCluster/RAPID observations, we have derived machine learning-based models to\npredict the proton intensities at energies from 28 to 1,885 keV in the 3D\nterrestrial magnetosphere at radial distances between 6 and 22 RE. We used the\nsatellite location and indices for solar, solar wind and geomagnetic activity\nas predictors. The results demonstrate that the neural network (multi-layer\nperceptron regressor) outperforms baseline models based on the k-Nearest\nNeighbors and historical binning on average by ~80% and ~33\\%, respectively.\nThe average correlation between the observed and predicted data is about 56%,\nwhich is reasonable in light of the complex dynamics of fast-moving energetic\nprotons in the magnetosphere. In addition to a quantitative analysis of the\nprediction results, we also investigate parameter importance in our model. The\nmost decisive parameters for predicting proton intensities are related to the\nlocation: ZGSE direction and the radial distance. Among the activity indices,\nthe solar wind dynamic pressure is the most important.

Therefore, it is\ncrucial to identify the strategic phenomena that determine when ODRP systems\ncan run efficiently. In this paper, we analyze the performance of an ODRP\nsystem, in which the fleet of low-capacity vehicles is endogenously adapted to\nthe demand, and operated in a zone covered by a single transit line. The\nrouting of the on-demand fleet follows some of the rules of public transport\nsystems; namely, it is not-for-profit, some users can be required to walk, and\nall requests must be served. Considering both users' and operators' costs we\nidentify two sources of scale economies: when demand grows, the average cost is\nreduced due to a) an equivalent of the Mohring Effect (also present in public\ntransport), and b) due to matching users with more similar routes when they are\nassigned to the vehicles, which we call Better-matching Effect. A\ncounter-balance force, called Flex-route Effect, is observed when the vehicle\nloads increase and users face longer detours. We find a specific demand range\nin which the latter effect dominates the others, imposing diseconomies of scale\nwhen only users' costs are considered. Such a phenomenon emerges because the\nroutes are not fixed; hence, it is not observed in traditional public transport\nsystems. However, when considering both users' and operators' costs, scale\neconomies prevail. Our simulations show that relaxing door-to-door vehicle\nrequirements to allow short walks is crucial for the performance of ODRP. In\nfact, we observe that an ODRP system with human-driven vehicles and walks\nallowed has a total cost at a similar level to that of a door-to-door ODRP\nsystem with driverless vehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 14:56:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 11:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}
