Recent works\nbuild deep neural networks for anomaly detection by discriminatively mapping\nthe normal samples and abnormal samples to different regions in the feature\nspace or fitting different distributions. However, due to the limited number of\nannotated anomaly samples, directly training networks with the discriminative\nloss may not be sufficient. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel\nstrategy to transform the input data into a more meaningful representation that\ncould be used for anomaly detection. Specifically, we leverage an autoencoder\nto encode the input data and utilize three factors, hidden representation,\nreconstruction residual vector, and reconstruction error, as the new\nrepresentation for the input data. This representation amounts to encode a test\nsample with its projection on the training data manifold, its direction to its\nprojection and its distance to its projection. In addition to this encoding, we\nalso propose a novel network architecture to seamlessly incorporate those three\nfactors. From our extensive experiments, the benefits of the proposed strategy\nare clearly demonstrated by its superior performance over the competitive\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 16:23:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 11:42:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 05:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-29"}

However, it is also one of the least\nautomated parts of machine learning systems and usually costs significant\nmanual effort and computing. Though there are pre-defined LR schedules and\noptimizers with adaptive LR, they introduce new hyperparameters that need to be\ntuned separately for different tasks/datasets. In this paper, we consider the\nquestion: Can we automatically tune the LR over the course of training without\nhuman involvement? We propose an efficient method, AutoLRS, which automatically\noptimizes the LR for each training stage by modeling training dynamics. AutoLRS\naims to find an LR applied to every $\\tau$ steps that minimizes the resulted\nvalidation loss. We solve this black-box optimization on the fly by Bayesian\noptimization (BO). However, collecting training instances for BO requires a\nsystem to evaluate each LR queried by BO's acquisition function for $\\tau$\nsteps, which is prohibitively expensive in practice. Instead, we apply each\ncandidate LR for only $\\tau'\\ll\\tau$ steps and train an exponential model to\npredict the validation loss after $\\tau$ steps. This mutual-training process\nbetween BO and the loss-prediction model allows us to limit the training steps\ninvested in the BO search. We demonstrate the advantages and the generality of\nAutoLRS through extensive experiments of training DNNs for tasks from diverse\ndomains using different optimizers. The LR schedules auto-generated by AutoLRS\nlead to a speedup of $1.22\\times$, $1.43\\times$, and $1.5\\times$ when training\nResNet-50, Transformer, and BERT, respectively, compared to the LR schedules in\ntheir original papers, and an average speedup of $1.31\\times$ over\nstate-of-the-art heavily-tuned LR schedules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 16:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

At $z>6$, a typical galaxy\nwithout an active galactic nucleus fails to form a proximity zone around itself\ndue to the overdensity of the surrounding IGM. The gravitational infall motion\nin the IGM makes the resonance absorption extend to the red side of Ly$\\alpha$,\nsuppressing the transmission up to roughly the circular velocity of the galaxy.\nIn some sight lines, an optically thin blob generated by a supernova in a\nneighboring galaxy results in a peak feature, which can be mistaken for a blue\npeak. Redward of the resonance absorption, the damping-wing opacity correlates\nwith the global IGM neutral fraction and the UV magnitude of the source galaxy.\nBrighter galaxies tend to suffer lower opacity because they tend to reside in\nlarger HII regions, and the surrounding IGM transmits redder photons, which are\nless susceptible to attenuation, owing to stronger infall velocity. The HII\nregions are highly nonspherical, causing both sight-line-to-sight-line and\ngalaxy-to-galaxy variation in opacity. Also, self-shielded systems within HII\nregions strongly attenuate the emission for certain sight lines. All these\nfactors add to the transmissivity variation, requiring a large sample size to\nconstrain the average transmission. The variation is largest for fainter\ngalaxies at higher redshift. The 68\\% range of the transmissivity is similar to\nor greater than the median for galaxies with $M_{\\rm UV}\\ge-21$ at $z\\ge7$,\nimplying that more than a hundred galaxies would be needed to measure the\ntransmission to 10\\% accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 17:07:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 06:37:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 21:51:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 23:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-29"}

In detail, our model consists of eight\nthree-level atoms where only the pairs (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) and (7,8) are\nprepared in maximally entangled states. Performing suitable interaction between\nnon-entangled three-level atoms (2,3) and (6,7) in two-mode cavities with\nphoton leakage rates in the presence of spontaneous emission leads to producing\nentanglement between atoms (1,4) and (5,8), separately. Finally, the\nentanglement between atoms (1,8) is successfully produced by performing\ninteraction between atoms (4,5) while spontaneous emission is considered in a\ndissipative cavity. In the continuation, the effects of detuning, dissipation\nand initial interaction time are considered on negativity and success\nprobability of the processes. The maxima of negativity are decreased by\nincreasing the detuning, in most cases. Also, the time evolution of negativity\nis non-periodic in the presence of dissipation. Increasing the initial\ninteraction time has a constructive effect on negativity in all considered\ncases. The oscillations of negativity are destroyed as time goes on and the\nproduced entanglement is stabled. The success probability of entangled state of\natoms (1,8) is tunable by controlling the detuning and dissipation. We show\nthat via justifying the involved parameters one can arrive at conditions in\nwhich the decoherence effects are fully disappeared; as a result an ideal\nquantum repeater can be achieved while atomic and field dissipations are taken\ninto account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 18:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

However,\nno final conclusions can be derived by just using this random noise, since it\nexcludes feature-dependent noise.

Possible applications\nto simplified linear solutions for complex nonlinear elasticity problems are\noutlined and illustrated for a superdislocation.

The\nArea Regge action, which can be defined for general 4D triangulations, is a\nnatural choice for an action based on areas. It does indeed appear in the\nsemi-classical limit of spin foam models. The Area Regge action does however\nonly lead to a discrete version of the gravitational equations of motion, if\none implements constraints, that ensure that the areas are compatible with a\nconsistent length assignment to the edges of the triangulation. The constrained\nversion is then classically equivalent to the Length Regge action, which\nprovides a discretization of the Einstein-Hilbert action.\n  Here we perform the first systematic analysis of the Area Regge dynamics on a\nhyper-cubical lattice. Surprisingly, we find that the linearized Area Regge\naction on a hyper-cubical lattice does single out the Length Regge action by\nits scaling behaviour in the lattice constant. That is, integrating out the\nvariables describing fluctuations in the area-length constraints one finds the\nlinearized Length Regge action plus terms of higher order in the lattice\nconstant. This appears without any explicit implementation of the area-length\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 20:58:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

Most chondrite groups\ncontain water-bearing minerals, attesting that both water-ice and dust were\naccreted on their parent asteroids. Nonetheless, the hydrogen isotopic\ncomposition (D/H) of water in the different chondrite groups remains poorly\nconstrained, due to the intimate mixture of hydrated minerals and organic\ncompounds, the other main H-bearing phase in chondrites. Building on our recent\nworks using in situ secondary ion mass spectrometry analyses, we determined the\nH isotopic composition of water in a large set of chondritic samples (CI, CM,\nCO, CR, and C-ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites) and report that water in each\ngroup shows a distinct and unique D/H signature. Based on a comparison with\nliterature data on bulk chondrites and their water and organics, our data do\nnot support a preponderant role of parent-body processes in controlling the D/H\nvariations among chondrites. Instead, we propose that the water and organic D/H\nsignatures were mostly shaped by interactions between the protoplanetary disk\nand the molecular cloud that episodically fed the disk over several million\nyears. Because the preservation of D-rich interstellar water and/or organics in\nchondritic materials is only possible below their respective sublimation\ntemperatures (160 and 350-450 K), the H isotopic signatures of chondritic\nmaterials depend on both the timing and location at which their parent body\nformed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 21:38:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

It is desirable to\nimplement photonic molecules using high quality factor photonic integrated ring\nresonators due to their narrow atom-like spectral resonance, tunability, and\nthe ability to scale the number of resonators on a photonic circuit. However,\nto take full advantage of molecule spectral complexity and tuning degree of\nfreedom, resonator structures should have full symmetry in terms of\ninter-resonator coupling and resonator-waveguide coupling as well as\nindependent resonance tuning, and low power dissipation operation, in a\nscalable integration platform. To date, photonic molecule symmetry has been\nlimited to dual- and triple-cavity geometries coupled to single- or\ndual-busses, and resonance tuning limited to dual resonator molecules. In this\npaper, we demonstrate a three-resonator photonic molecule, consisting of\nsymmetrically coupled 8.11 million intrinsic Q silicon nitride rings, where\neach ring is coupled to the other two rings. The resonance of each ring, and\nthat of the collective molecule, is controlled using low power dissipation,\nmonolithically integrated thin-film lead zirconate titanate (PZT) actuators\nthat are integrated with the ultra-low loss silicon nitride resonators. This\nperformance is achieved without undercut waveguides, yielding the highest Q to\ndate for a PZT controlled resonator. This advance leads to full control of\ncomplex photonic molecule resonance spectra and splitting in a wafer-scale\nintegration platform. The resulting six tunable supermodes can be fully\ncontrolled, including degeneracy, location and splitting as well as designed by\na model that can accurately predict the energy modes and transmission spectrum\nand tunable resonance splitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2021 21:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

The disorder in the space is modeled by means of a set of\nnon-overlapping spherical obstacles. We assume that obstacles are reactive in\nthe sense that they react in the presence of the particles in an attractive\nmanner: when the particle collides with an obstacle, it is attached during a\nrandom time (adsorption time), i.e., it gets adsorbed by an obstacle;\nthereafter the particle is detached from the obstacle and continues its motion\nin a random direction. We give an analytical formula for the effective\ndiffusion coefficient when the mean adsorption time is finite. When the mean\nadsorption time is infinite, we show that the system undergoes a transition\nfrom a normal to anomalous diffusion regime. We also show that another\ntransition takes place in the mean number of adsorbed particles: in the\nanomalous diffusion phase all the particles become adsorbed in the average. We\nshow that the fraction of adsorbed particles, seen as an order parameter of the\nsystem, undergoes a second-order-like phase transition, because the fraction of\nadsorbed particles is not differentiable but changes continuously as a function\nof a parameter of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 May 2021 01:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

However, the requirements imposed on the chaotic\nsystems are usually heuristic, without theoretic guarantee for the resultant\ncommunication scheme. Among all the primitives for secure communications, it is\nwell-accepted that (pseudo) random numbers are most essential. Taking the\nwell-studied two-dimensional coupled map lattice (2D CML) as an example, this\npaper performs a theoretical study towards pseudo-random number generation with\nthe 2D CML. In so doing, an analytical expression of the Lyapunov exponent (LE)\nspectrum of the 2D CML is first derived. Using the LEs, one can configure\nsystem parameters to ensure the 2D CML only exhibits complex dynamic behavior,\nand then collect pseudo-random numbers from the system orbits. Moreover, based\non the observation that least significant bit distributes more evenly in the\n(pseudo) random distribution, an extraction algorithm E is developed with the\nproperty that, when applied to the orbits of the 2D CML, it can squeeze uniform\nbits. In implementation, if fixed-point arithmetic is used in binary format\nwith a precision of $z$ bits after the radix point, E can ensure that the\ndeviation of the squeezed bits is bounded by $2^{-z}$ . Further simulation\nresults demonstrate that the new method not only guide the 2D CML model to\nexhibit complex dynamic behavior, but also generate uniformly distributed\nindependent bits. In particular, the squeezed pseudo random bits can pass both\nNIST 800-22 and TestU01 test suites in various settings.

To address this issue, this paper presents an\nend-to-end, bi-level pre-training strategy with Graph Neural Networks for\nhypergraphs. The proposed framework named HyperGene bears three distinctive\nadvantages. First, it is capable of ingesting the labeling information when\navailable, but more importantly, it is mainly designed in the self-supervised\nfashion which significantly broadens its applicability. Second, at the heart of\nthe proposed HyperGene are two carefully designed pretexts, one on the node\nlevel and the other on the hyperedge level, which enable us to encode both the\nlocal and the global context in a mutually complementary way. Third, the\nproposed framework can work in both transductive and inductive settings. When\napplying the two proposed pretexts in tandem, it can accelerate the adaptation\nof the knowledge from the pre-trained model to downstream applications in the\ntransductive setting, thanks to the bi-level nature of the proposed method.

However, it is important to consider the issues of democracy versus\nauthoritarianism, and state fragility, when examining official Covid-19 death\ncounts in research, because these factors can influence the accurate reporting\nof pandemic deaths by governments. In contrast, excess deaths are less prone to\nvariability in differences in definitions of Covid-19 deaths and testing\ncapacities across countries. Here we use excess pandemic deaths to explore\npotential relationships between political systems and public health outcomes.\n  Methods: We address these issues by comparing the official government\nCovid-19 death counts in a well-established John Hopkins database to the\ngenerally more reliable excess mortality measure of Covid-19 deaths, taken from\nthe recently released World Mortality Dataset. We put the comparison in the\ncontext of the political and fragile state dimensions.\n  Findings: We find (1) significant potential underreporting of Covid-19 deaths\nby authoritarian governments and governments with high state fragility and (2)\nsubstantial geographic variation among countries and regions with regard to\nstandard democracy indices. Additionally, we find that more authoritarian\ngovernments are (weakly) associated with more excess deaths during the pandemic\nthan democratic governments.\n  Interpretations: The inhibition and censorship of information flows, inherent\nto authoritarian states, likely results in major inaccuracies in pandemic\nstatistics that confound global public health analyses. Thus, both excess\npandemic deaths and official Covid-19 death counts should be examined in\nstudies using death as an outcome variable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 May 2021 06:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

Previous studies have focused on modeling sequential\ndynamics without much regard to which of the best-selling products (i.e., head\nitems) or niche products (i.e., tail items) should be recommended. We\nscrutinize the structural reason for why tail items are barely served in the\ncurrent sequential recommendation model, which consists of an item-embedding\nlayer, a sequence-modeling layer, and a recommendation layer. Well-designed\nsequence-modeling and recommendation layers are expected to naturally learn\nsuitable item embeddings. However, tail items are likely to fall short of this\nexpectation because the current model structure is not suitable for learning\nhigh-quality embeddings with insufficient data. Thus, tail items are rarely\nrecommended. To eliminate this issue, we propose a framework called CITIES,\nwhich aims to enhance the quality of the tail-item embeddings by training an\nembedding-inference function using multiple contextual head items so that the\nrecommendation performance improves for not only the tail items but also for\nthe head items. Moreover, our framework can infer new-item embeddings without\nan additional learning process. Extensive experiments on two real-world\ndatasets show that applying CITIES to the state-of-the-art methods improves\nrecommendation performance for both tail and head items.

Particularly, at frequency related to the double-clockwise\ncirculating spin-wave mode of the resonator, the spin wave excited in one layer\nis transferred to the second one where it propagates in the backward direction.\nInterestingly, the wave excited in the second layer propagates in the forward\ndirection only in that layer. This demonstrates add-drop filtering, as well as\ncirculator functionality. Thus, the proposed system can become an important\npart of future magnonic technology for signal routing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 May 2021 07:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

Several data quality challenges such as noise, incompleteness, outliers\nand duplicate data points may be relevant in this regard. Objective: We\ninvestigate the reporting of three potentially influential elements of data\nquality in ESE studies: data collection, data pre-processing, and the\nidentification of data quality issues. This enables us to establish how\nresearchers view the topic of data quality and the mechanisms that are being\nused to address it. Greater awareness of data quality should inform both the\nsound conduct of ESE research and the robust practice of ESE data collection\nand processing. Method: We performed a targeted literature review of empirical\nsoftware engineering studies covering the period January 2007 to September\n2012. A total of 221 relevant studies met our inclusion criteria and were\ncharacterized in terms of their consideration and treatment of data quality.\nResults: We obtained useful insights as to how the ESE community considers\nthese three elements of data quality. Only 23 of these 221 studies reported on\nall three elements of data quality considered in this paper. Conclusion: The\nreporting of data collection procedures is not documented consistently in ESE\nstudies. It will be useful if data collection challenges are reported in order\nto improve our understanding of why there are problems with software\nengineering data sets and the models developed from them. More generally, data\nquality should be given far greater attention by the community. The improvement\nof data sets through enhanced data collection, pre-processing and quality\nassessment should lead to more reliable prediction models, thus improving the\npractice of software engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 May 2021 09:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

These tools\nreflect the distributed nature of traces and the underlying causality and\nconcurrency between events, and can be said to support true concurrency. They\ngeneralize the tools that have been so efficient in understanding, classifying\nand reasoning about word languages. In particular, we introduce an asynchronous\nversion of the wreath product operation and we describe the trace languages\nrecognized by such products (the so-called asynchronous wreath product\nprinciple). We then propose a decomposition result for recognizable trace\nlanguages, analogous to the Krohn-Rhodes theorem, and we prove this\ndecomposition result in the special case of acyclic architectures. Finally, we\nintroduce and analyze two distributed automata-theoretic operations. One, the\nlocal cascade product, is a direct implementation of the asynchronous wreath\nproduct operation. The other, global cascade sequences, although conceptually\nand operationally similar to the local cascade product, translates to a more\ncomplex asynchronous implementation which uses the gossip automaton of Mukund\nand Sohoni. This leads to interesting applications to the characterization of\ntrace languages definable in first-order logic: they are accepted by a\nrestricted local cascade product of the gossip automaton and 2-state\nasynchronous reset automata, and also by a global cascade sequence of 2-state\nasynchronous reset automata. Over distributed alphabets for which the\nasynchronous Krohn-Rhodes theorem holds, a local cascade product of such\nautomata is sufficient and this, in turn, leads to the identification of a\nsimple temporal logic which is expressively complete for such alphabets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 May 2021 09:47:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 06:39:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 09:09:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:31:51 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 17:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

Here we propose a simple model that describes the\ndynamics around peaks of popularity by incorporating key features, i.e., the\nanticipatory growth and the decay of collective attention together with\ncircadian rhythms.

In the second\nstep, the estimated non-parametric FRF of the target module is smoothed using a\nparametric frequency domain estimator with the estimated variance from the\nprevious step as the non-parametric noise model. The developed approach is\npractical with weak assumptions on noise, uses the available toolbox, requires\na parametric model only for the target module of interest, and uses a\nnon-parametric noise model to reduce the variance of the estimates.

This allows corporations to provide machine\nlearning as a service (MLaaS) by encapsulating fine-tuned BERT-based models as\nAPIs. However, BERT-based APIs have exhibited a series of security and privacy\nvulnerabilities. For example, prior work has exploited the security issues of\nthe BERT-based APIs through the adversarial examples crafted by the extracted\nmodel. However, the privacy leakage problems of the BERT-based APIs through the\nextracted model have not been well studied. On the other hand, due to the high\ncapacity of BERT-based APIs, the fine-tuned model is easy to be overlearned,\nbut what kind of information can be leaked from the extracted model remains\nunknown. In this work, we bridge this gap by first presenting an effective\nmodel extraction attack, where the adversary can practically steal a BERT-based\nAPI (the target/victim model) by only querying a limited number of queries.

Besides, benefited from the object query\ndesign in DETR, our method does not need complicated post-processing methods\nsuch as Seq-NMS or Tubelet rescoring, which keeps the pipeline simple and\nclean.

In\nthis paper, we therefore investigate the role of global context for crowd\ncounting. Specifically, a pure transformer is used to extract features with\nglobal information from overlapping image patches. Inspired by classification,\nwe add a context token to the input sequence, to facilitate information\nexchange with tokens corresponding to image patches throughout transformer\nlayers. Due to the fact that transformers do not explicitly model the\ntried-and-true channel-wise interactions, we propose a token-attention module\n(TAM) to recalibrate encoded features through channel-wise attention informed\nby the context token. Beyond that, it is adopted to predict the total person\ncount of the image through regression-token module (RTM). Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various\ndatasets, including ShanghaiTech, UCF-QNRF, JHU-CROWD++ and NWPU. On the\nlarge-scale JHU-CROWD++ dataset, our method improves over the previous best\nresults by 26.9% and 29.9% in terms of MAE and MSE, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 May 2021 12:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

Atoms distributing in one excited bands of an optical\nlattice would collide and decay to other bands through different scattering\nchannels. In excited bands of one dimensional lattice, due to lack of geometry,\nthere is no significant difference between cross section of scattering\nchannels. Here, we investigate the collisional scattering channels for atoms in\nthe excited bands of a triangular optical lattice and demonstrate a dominant\nscattering channel in the experiment. A shortcut method is utilized to load\nBose-Einstein condensates of $^{87} {\\rm Rb}$ atoms into the first D band with\nzero quasi-momentum. After some time for evolution, the number of atoms\nscattering to S band due to two-body collisions is around four times more than\nthat to the second most band. We reveal that the scattering channel to $ss$\nband is dominant by theoretical calculation, which agrees with experimental\nmeasurements. The appearance of dominant scattering channels in triangular\noptical lattice is owing to geometric dimension coupling.

However, this proposition seems to break down in\nfield-effect transistors involving SrTiO$_3$ (STO) based two-dimensional\nelectron gases. Such peculiar behavior is associated with the electron trapping\nunder an external electric field. However, the microscopic nature of trapping\ncenters remains an open question. In this paper, we investigate electric\nfield-induced charge trapping/detrapping phenomena at the conducting interface\nbetween band insulators $\\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ and STO. Our transport\nmeasurements reveal that the charge trapping under +ve back gate voltage\n($V_g$) above the tetragonal to cubic structural transition temperature ($T_c$)\nof STO is contributed by the electric field-assisted thermal escape of\nelectrons from the quantum well, and the clustering of oxygen vacancies (OVs)\nas well.

Application of -ve $V_g$ results in a charge detrapping, which vanishes\nabove $T_c$ also. This feature demonstrates the crucial role of structural\ndomain walls in the electrical transport properties of STO based\nheterostructures.

The proposed original reduction algorithm achieves the required task,\nvia computation of determinants of parametric Sylvester matrices, and produces\na Rabin basis, which is shown to be minimal, when two multivariate polynomials\nare reduced at a time. The minimality of Rabin basis allows us to prove\nexponential lower bounds for the space complexity of an algebraic proof of\ncertification, for a specific computational problem in the computational\ncomplexity class PSPACE, showing that the complexity classes PSPACE and P\ncannot be the same.

By applying FET simulation methods used in\nconventional semiconductor FETs, we elucidate surface and impurity-doping\ncontributions to the overall performance of InAs NCs based FETs.
