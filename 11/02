Due to the line-of-sight confusion in the Galactic\nplane that is associated with its ubiquity, atomic hydrogen emission has been\nchallenging to study. Employing the high-angular resolution data from the THOR\nsurvey, we identify one of the largest, coherent, mostly atomic HI filaments in\nthe Milky Way at the line-of-sight velocities around -54 km/s. The giant atomic\nfilament \"Maggie\", with a total length of 1.2 kpc, is not detected in most\nother tracers, and does not show signs of active star formation. At a kinematic\ndistance of 17 kpc, Maggie is situated below (by 500 pc) but parallel to the\nGalactic HI disk and is trailing the predicted location of the Outer Arm by\n5-10 km/s in longitude-velocity space. The centroid velocity exhibits a smooth\ngradient of less than $\\pm$3 km/s /10 pc and a coherent structure to within\n$\\pm$6 km/s. The line widths of 10 km/s along the spine of the filament are\ndominated by non-thermal effects.

We also demonstrate the optimality of both the\ncoherent and the TMSV states in their respective setups (idler-free and\nsignal-idler) in the limit of low reflectivity and absorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 16:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

For\ncomputational and practical reasons, these spaces are typically discretized\nusing histograms, and the smearing is modeled through a response matrix\ncorresponding to a discretized smearing kernel of the particle detector. This\nresponse matrix depends on the unknown shape of the true spectrum, leading to a\nfundamental systematic uncertainty in the unfolding problem. To handle the\nill-posed nature of the problem, common approaches regularize the problem\neither directly via methods such as Tikhonov regularization, or implicitly by\nusing wide-bins in the true space that match the resolution of the detector.\nUnfortunately, both of these methods lead to a non-trivial bias in the unfolded\nestimator, thereby hampering frequentist coverage guarantees for confidence\nintervals constructed from these methods. We propose two new approaches to\naddressing the bias in the wide-bin setting through methods called\nOne-at-a-time Strict Bounds (OSB) and Prior-Optimized (PO) intervals. The OSB\nintervals are a bin-wise modification of an existing guaranteed-coverage\nprocedure, while the PO intervals are based on a decision-theoretic view of the\nproblem. Importantly, both approaches provide well-calibrated frequentist\nconfidence intervals even in constrained and rank-deficient settings. These\nmethods are built upon a more general answer to the wide-bin bias problem,\ninvolving unfolding with fine bins first, followed by constructing confidence\nintervals for linear functionals of the fine-bin counts. We test and compare\nthese methods to other available methodologies in a wide-bin deconvolution\nexample and a realistic particle physics simulation of unfolding a steeply\nfalling particle spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 17:01:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2022 23:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

We also estimate the dynamical mass\nwithin the central 28 pc to be 4.3 $\\times$ 10$^8$ M$_{\\odot}$, which is\nsignificantly larger than the larger scale dynamical mass, suggesting the\nvelocity gradient does not trace circular motions on that scale. The overall\ndirection of the velocity gradient and velocity range of the blueshifted\nfeatures are largely consistent with those of the 22 GHz maser emission in a\nthin disk with smaller radii of 0.1--0.4 pc and molecular outflows within\n$\\sim$1 pc from the central engine of the galaxy, implying that the 321 GHz\nmasers could trace part of the circumnuclear disk or the nuclear outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 17:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

The main challenge is that in the\nself-supervised pretraining + supervised finetuning paradigm, adversarial\nrobustness is easily forgotten due to a learning task mismatch from pretraining\nto finetuning.

We show that\n(1) the design of contrastive views matters: High-frequency components of\nimages are beneficial to improving model robustness; (2) Augmenting CL with\npseudo-supervision stimulus (e.g., resorting to feature clustering) helps\npreserve robustness without forgetting. Equipped with our new designs, we\npropose AdvCL, a novel adversarial contrastive pretraining framework. We show\nthat AdvCL is able to enhance cross-task robustness transferability without\nloss of model accuracy and finetuning efficiency. With a thorough experimental\nstudy, we demonstrate that AdvCL outperforms the state-of-the-art\nself-supervised robust learning methods across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100, and STL-10) and finetuning schemes (linear evaluation and full model\nfinetuning).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 17:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

However, their fate as they are accreted onto haloes many orders of\nmagnitude more massive remains fundamentally uncertain. A number of numerical\nexplorations have found subhaloes to be very resilient to tides, but resolution\nlimits make it difficult to explore tidal evolution at arbitrarily low masses.\nWhat are the structural properties of heavily stripped subhaloes? Do tidal\neffects destroy low-mass CDM subhaloes? Here we focus on cosmologically\nmotivated subhaloes orbiting CDM hosts, and show that subhaloes of any initial\nmass can be stripped to arbitrarily small mass fractions. We show that previous\nnumerical results can be reproduced by a simple model that describes tidal\nevolution as a progressive `peeling' in energy space and subsequent\nre-virialization. Tidal heating can effectively be neglected at all masses,\nbecause its importance i) does not increase for subhaloes of decreasing mass at\naccretion, and ii) it decreases as stripping proceeds. This allows us to\npredict analytically the structural properties of subhaloes with any initial\nmass and arbitrary degrees of mass loss. Under the hypotheses that CDM haloes\nhave centrally divergent density profiles and approximately isotropic phase\nspace distributions, our results prove that subhaloes of very low masses are a\nrobust prediction of the CDM model: as for haloes, CDM subhalo populations\nextend and are abundant down to very low masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

In this paper, we review instead the\npossibility that kination is disconnected from primordial inflation and occurs\nmuch later, inside the Standard Model radiation era. We study the implications\non all main sources of primordial gravitational waves. We show how this leads\nto very distinctive peaked spectra in the stochastic background of long-lasting\ncosmological sources of gravitational waves, namely the irreducible\ngravitational waves from inflation, and gravitational waves from cosmic\nstrings, both local and global, with promising observational prospects. We\npresent model-independent signatures and detectability predictions at SKA,\nLIGO, LISA, ET, CE, BBO, as a function of the energy scale and duration of the\nkination era. We then argue that such intermediate kination era is in fact\nsymptomatic in a large class of axion models. We analyse in details the scalar\nfield dynamics, the working conditions and constraints in the underlying\nmodels. We present the gravitational-wave predictions as a function of particle\nphysics parameters. We derive the general relation between the\ngravitational-wave signal and the axion dark matter abundance as well as the\nbaryon asymmetry. We investigate the predictions for the special case of the\nQCD axion. The key message is that gravitational-waves of primordial origin\nrepresent an alternative experimental probe of axion models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 May 2022 20:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

The nature of\nthis decline contains important clues to the mechanisms regulating the onset of\ngalaxy formation in the faintest systems. We explore here two possible models\nfor the stellar mass ($M_*$)-halo mass ($M_{200}$) relation at the faint end,\nmotivated by some of the latest LCDM cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.\nOne model includes a sharp mass threshold below which no luminous galaxies\nform, as expected if galaxy formation proceeds only in systems above the\nHydrogen-cooling limit.

Hydrodynamic simulations help us understand the dynamics of stellar\nconvection and convective boundaries. However, the codes used to compute such\nsimulations are usually tested on extremely simple problems and the reliability\nand reproducibility of their predictions for turbulent flows is unclear. We\ndefine a test problem involving turbulent convection in a plane-parallel box,\nwhich leads to mass entrainment from, and internal-wave generation in, a stably\nstratified layer. We compare the outputs from the codes FLASH, MUSIC, PPMSTAR,\nPROMPI, and SLH, which have been widely employed to study hydrodynamic problems\nin stellar interiors. The convection is dominated by the largest scales that\nfit into the simulation box. All time-averaged profiles of velocity components,\nfluctuation amplitudes, and fluxes of enthalpy and kinetic energy are within\n$\\lesssim 3\\sigma$ of the mean of all simulations on a given grid ($128^3$ and\n$256^3$ grid cells), where $\\sigma$ describes the statistical variation due to\nthe flow's time dependence. They also agree well with a $512^3$ reference run.\nThe $128^3$ and $256^3$ simulations agree within $9\\%$ and $4\\%$, respectively,\non the total mass entrained into the convective layer. The entrainment rate\nappears to be set by the amount of energy that can be converted to work in our\nsetup and details of the small-scale flows in the boundary layer seem to be\nlargely irrelevant. Our results lend credence to hydrodynamic simulations of\nflows in stellar interiors.

This is in part due to the\ntheoretical prediction of fine-tuned trivial (i.e., non-topological) zero-bias\npeaks that occur because of uncontrolled quantum dots or disorder potentials.\nWhile many aspects of the topological phase can be somewhat fine-tuned because\nthe topological phase space is often small, the quantized height of the ZBCP\nassociated with a Majorana mode is known to be robust at sufficiently low\ntemperatures even as the tunnel barrier is pinched off to vanishingly small\nnormal-state conductance. The key shortcoming of the existing experimental\nworks is an acute lack of stability of the putative Majorana mode features,\nindicating the probable absence of a topological phase, and the current paper\nsuggests specific experimentally accessible measures for a careful quantitative\nanalysis of the measured ZBCP stability. In this paper, we study how the\ncounter-intuitive robustness of the ZBCP height to the tunnel barrier strength\ncan be used to distinguish Majorana modes from non-topological ZBCPs. To this\nend, we introduce a dimensionless quality factor $F$ to quantify the robustness\nof the ZBCP height based on the range of normal-state (i.e. above-gap)\nconductance (which depends crucially on the tunnel barrier height) over which\nthe ZBCP height remains within a pre-specified range of quantization. By\ncomputing this quality factor $F$ together with the topological characteristics\nfor a wide range of models and parameters, we find that Majoranas are\nsignificantly more robust (i.e., have a higher value of $F$) compared with\nnon-topological ZBCPs in the ideal low-temperature limit. Even at a temperature\nas high as the experimentally used $20$ mK, we find that we can set a threshold\nvalue of $F\\sim 2.5$ (for $\\epsilon=0.1$) so that ZBCPs associated with a\nquality factor $F>2.5$ are likely topological and $F\\ll 2.5$ are topologically\ntrivial. More precisely, the value of $F$ is operationally related to the\ndegree of separation of the Majorana modes in the system, although $F$ uses\nonly the experimentally measured tunnel conductance properties. Finally, we\ndiscuss how the quality factor $F$ measured in a transport setup can help\nestimate the quality of topological qubits made from Majorana modes. In\nparticular, we show that if the induced gap can be enhanced somehow beyond the\ncurrently available $\\sim 30$ $\\mu$eV in InAs/Al samples, large (small) values\nof $F$ could easily distinguish between stable topological (unstable trivial)\nZBCPs with the quantum dot induced quasi-Majorana bound states occasionally\nbehaving similar to topological Majorana modes in short wires.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 18:11:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2022 17:40:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 15:40:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 17:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

We also investigate the first levels of an effective\nBorel hierarchy on the space of marked groups, and show that on many group\nproperties usually considered, this effective hierarchy corresponds sharply to\nthe Borel hierarchy. Finally, we prove that the space of marked groups is a\nPolish space that is not effectively Polish. Because of this, many of the most\nimportant results of computable analysis cannot be applied to the space of\nmarked groups. This includes the Kreisel-Lacombe-Schoenfield-Ceitin Theorem and\na theorem of Moschovakis. The space of marked groups constitutes the first\nnatural example of a Polish space that is not effectively Polish.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 18:12:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 13:05:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 08:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

We develop a novel\napproach for computing black hole virial masses using measurements of continuum\nluminosities and emission line widths from partially overlapping, narrow-band\nobservations of quasars; we refer to this technique as single-epoch photometry.\nThis novel method relies on forward-modelling quasar observations for\nestimating emission line widths, which enables unbiased measurements even for\nlines coarsely resolved by narrow-band data.

This offers a\nunique chance to improve our understanding of the galaxy evolution and the\nunresolved nature of dark matter (DM). At galaxy scales, the density\ndistribution of DM is strongly affected by the astrophysical feedback\nprocesses, which are difficult to fully account for in classical techniques to\nderive mass models. In this work, we explore the capability of supervised\nlearning algorithms to predict the DM content of galaxies from luminous\nobservational-like parameters, using the public catalog of the TNG100\nsimulation. In particular, we use Photometric, Structural and Kinematic\nparameters to predict the total DM mass, DM half-mass radius, DM mass inside\none and two stellar half-mass radii. We adopt the coefficient of determination,\n$R^2$, as a reference metric to evaluate the accuracy of these predictions. We\nfind that the Photometric features alone are able to predict the total DM mass\nwith fair accuracy, while Structural and Photometric features together are more\neffective to determine the DM inside the stellar half mass radius, and the DM\nwithin twice the stellar half mass radius. However, using all observational\nquantities together (Photometry, Structural and Kinematics) incredibly improves\nthe overall accuracy for all DM quantities. This first test shows that Machine\nLearning tools are promising approaches to derive predictions of the DM in real\ngalaxies. The next steps will be to improve observational realism of the\ntraining sets, by closely select samples which accurately reproduce the typical\nobserved luminous scaling relations.

Bayesian\noptimization (BO) is an efficient framework for solving such problems by\nintelligently selecting the inputs with high utility guided by a learned\nsurrogate model. A recent BO approach for combinatorial spaces is through a\nreduction to BO over continuous spaces by learning a latent representation of\nstructures using deep generative models (DGMs).

To run CNN inference on various target devices, hardware-aware neural\narchitecture search (NAS) is crucial. A key requirement of efficient\nhardware-aware NAS is the fast evaluation of inference latencies in order to\nrank different architectures. While building a latency predictor for each\ntarget device has been commonly used in state of the art, this is a very\ntime-consuming process, lacking scalability in the presence of extremely\ndiverse devices. In this work, we address the scalability challenge by\nexploiting latency monotonicity -- the architecture latency rankings on\ndifferent devices are often correlated. When strong latency monotonicity\nexists, we can re-use architectures searched for one proxy device on new target\ndevices, without losing optimality. In the absence of strong latency\nmonotonicity, we propose an efficient proxy adaptation technique to\nsignificantly boost the latency monotonicity. Finally, we validate our approach\nand conduct experiments with devices of different platforms on multiple\nmainstream search spaces, including MobileNet-V2, MobileNet-V3, NAS-Bench-201,\nProxylessNAS and FBNet. Our results highlight that, by using just one proxy\ndevice, we can find almost the same Pareto-optimal architectures as the\nexisting per-device NAS, while avoiding the prohibitive cost of building a\nlatency predictor for each device.

In particular in our formalism we are able to\nsynthesize high-level multi-controlled primitives from low-level circuit\ndecompositions, making it an invaluable tool for circuit optimization. Our\nformulation also accepts a circuit-like diagrammatic representation and\nproposes a novel and simple interpretation of quantum computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 19:05:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 10:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}

Current approaches try to\noptimize for the cost incurred by users when adopting a recourse, but they\nassume that all users share the same cost function. This is an unrealistic\nassumption because users might have diverse preferences about their willingness\nto change certain features. In this work, we introduce a new method for\nidentifying recourse sets for users which does not assume that users'\npreferences are known in advance. We propose an objective function, Expected\nMinimum Cost (EMC), based on two key ideas: (1) when presenting a set of\noptions to a user, there only needs to be one low-cost solution that the user\ncould adopt; (2) when we do not know the user's true cost function, we can\napproximately optimize for user satisfaction by first sampling plausible cost\nfunctions from a distribution, then finding a recourse set that achieves a good\ncost for these samples. We optimize EMC with a novel discrete optimization\nalgorithm, Cost Optimized Local Search (COLS), which is guaranteed to improve\nthe recourse set quality over iterations.

We\nutilize external electric fields to control the developmental process and study\na critical transition in morphogenesis, from the initial spheroidal shape of\nthe tissue to an elongated cylindrical shape defining the body plan of a mature\nanimal. Morphogenesis paused under external voltage is associated with a\nsignificant increase of the calcium activity compared with the activity\nsupporting normal development.

In contrast, the normal morphogenesis\nprocess is characterized by relatively moderate calcium fluctuation activity\nand restrained spatial correlations. Our methodology of controlling\nmorphogenesis by a physical electric field allows us to gain a global\nstatistical view of the dynamics.

Although\noptimization is employed to learn the neural network, the weights of this\nnetwork are frozen at runtime. As a result, these learning solutions are\ndomain-specific and do not generalize well to other statistically different\nscenarios. This paper revisits the scene flow problem that relies predominantly\non runtime optimization and strong regularization. A central innovation here is\nthe inclusion of a neural scene flow prior, which uses the architecture of\nneural networks as a new type of implicit regularizer. Unlike learning-based\nscene flow methods, optimization occurs at runtime, and our approach needs no\noffline datasets -- making it ideal for deployment in new environments such as\nautonomous driving. We show that an architecture based exclusively on\nmultilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can be used as a scene flow prior.

The framework of reverse engineering a\ntrained RNN by linearizing around its fixed points has provided insight, but\nthe approach has significant challenges. These include difficulty choosing\nwhich fixed point to expand around when studying RNN dynamics and error\naccumulation when reconstructing the nonlinear dynamics with the linearized\ndynamics. We present a new model that overcomes these limitations by\nco-training an RNN with a novel switching linear dynamical system (SLDS)\nformulation. A first-order Taylor series expansion of the co-trained RNN and an\nauxiliary function trained to pick out the RNN's fixed points govern the SLDS\ndynamics. The results are a trained SLDS variant that closely approximates the\nRNN, an auxiliary function that can produce a fixed point for each point in\nstate-space, and a trained nonlinear RNN whose dynamics have been regularized\nsuch that its first-order terms perform the computation, if possible. This\nmodel removes the post-training fixed point optimization and allows us to\nunambiguously study the learned dynamics of the SLDS at any point in\nstate-space. It also generalizes SLDS models to continuous manifolds of\nswitching points while sharing parameters across switches. We validate the\nutility of the model on two synthetic tasks relevant to previous work reverse\nengineering RNNs.

This study proposes metrics to quantify the shareability of\nperson-trips in a city, as a function of two inputs--the road network structure\nand origin-destination (OD) travel demand. The study first conceptualizes a\nfundamental shareability unit, 'flow overlap'. Flow overlap denotes, for a\nperson-trip traversing a given path, the weighted (by link distance) average\nnumber of other trips sharing the links along the original person's path. The\nstudy extends this concept to the network level and formulates the Maximum\nNetwork Flow Overlap Problem (MNFLOP) to assign all OD trips to paths that\nmaximize network-wide flow overlap. The study utilizes the MNFLOP output to\ncalculate metrics of shareability at various levels of aggregation: person-trip\nlevel, OD level, origin or destination level, network level, and link level.\nThe study applies the MNFLOP and associated shareability metrics to different\nOD demand scenarios in the Sioux Falls network. The computational results\nverify that (i) MNFLOP assigns person-trips to paths such that flow overlaps\nsignificantly increase relative to shortest path assignment, (ii) MNFLOP and\nits associated shareability metrics can meaningfully differentiate between\ndifferent OD trip matrices in terms of shareability, and (iii) an MNFLOP-based\nmetric can quantify demand dispersion--a metric of the directionality of\ndemand--in addition to the magnitude of demand, for trips originating or\nterminating from a single node in the network. The paper also includes an\nextensive discussion of potential future uses of the MNFLOP and its associated\nshareability metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 21:25:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 17:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

When items take continuous values (e.g., orientation,\ncontrast, length, loudness) they must be stored in a continuous structure of\nappropriate dimensions. We investigate how this structure is represented in\nneural circuits by training recurrent networks to report two previously shown\nstimulus orientations. We find the activity manifold for the two orientations\nresembles a Clifford torus. Although a Clifford and standard torus (the surface\nof a donut) are topologically equivalent, they have important functional\ndifferences. A Clifford torus treats the two orientations equally and keeps\nthem in orthogonal subspaces, as demanded by the task, whereas a standard torus\ndoes not. We find and characterize the connectivity patterns that support the\nClifford torus. Moreover, in addition to attractors that store information via\npersistent activity, our networks also use a dynamic code where units change\ntheir tuning to prevent new sensory input from overwriting the previously\nstored one. We argue that such dynamic codes are generally required whenever\nmultiple inputs enter a memory system via shared connections. Finally, we apply\nour framework to a human psychophysics experiment in which subjects reported\ntwo remembered orientations. By varying the training conditions of the RNNs, we\ntest and support the hypothesis that human behavior is a product of both neural\nnoise and reliance on the more stable and behaviorally relevant memory of the\nordinal relationship between the two orientations.

The SCS is non-extensive as the number of clusters varies sub-linearly\nwith the system size. In the parameter space, the SCS separates equilibrium and\njamming (extensive) states. The conventional methods such as the van Kampen\nexpansion fail to describe the SCS. To characterize the SCS, we propose a\nscaling approach with a set of critical exponents.

Novel statistical methods increasingly rely on simulation\nstudies to assess their validity. Such assessments typically appear in\nstatistical or computational journals, and the methodology is later introduced\nto the medical community through tutorials. This can be problematic if applied\nresearchers use the methodologies in settings that have not been evaluated. In\nthis paper, we explore a case study of one such method that has become popular\nin the analysis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) data. The integrated\nnested Laplace approximations (INLA), as implemented in the R-INLA package,\napproximates the marginal posterior distributions of target parameters that\nwould have been obtained from a fully Bayesian analysis. We seek to answer an\nimportant question: Does existing research on the accuracy of INLA's\napproximations support how researchers are currently using it to analyze\nCOVID-19 data? We identify three limitations to work assessing INLA's accuracy:\n1) inconsistent definitions of accuracy, 2) a lack of studies validating how\nresearchers are actually using INLA, and 3) a lack of research into the\nreproducibility of INLA's output. We explore the practical impact of each\nlimitation with simulation studies based on models and data used in COVID-19\nresearch. Our results suggest existing methods of assessing the accuracy of the\nINLA technique may not support how COVID-19 researchers are using it. Guided in\npart by our results, we offer a proposed set of minimum guidelines for\nresearchers using statistical methodologies primarily validated through\nsimulation studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 22:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

When these shocks are\nradiative they may be inefficient in accelerating fresh particles, however they\ncan reaccelerate and compress Galactic cosmic rays from the background. In this\nwork we investigate the interactions of Galactic cosmic rays within a shocked\nhigh velocity cloud, when the shock is induced by the collision with the disk.\nThis study is focused in the case of radiative shocks.

In agreement with the slightly glib summary\nof Hebbian learning as \"cells that fire together wire together\", this article\nmakes the case that the analogy should be different. Since the \"neurons\" in\ndeep neural networks are managing the changing weights, they are more akin to\nthe synapses in the brain; instead, it is the wires in deep neural networks\nthat are more like nerve cells, in that they are what cause the information to\nflow. An intuition that nerve cells seem like more than mere wires is exactly\nright, and is justified by a precise category-theoretic analogy which we will\nexplore in this article. Throughout, we will continue to highlight the error in\nequating artificial neurons with nerve cells by leaving \"neuron\" in quotes or\nby calling them artificial neurons.\n  We will first explain how to view deep neural networks as nested dynamical\nsystems with a very restricted sort of interaction pattern, and then explain a\nmore general sort of interaction for dynamical systems that is useful\nthroughout engineering, but which fails to adapt to changing circumstances.

We call the resulting encompassing generalization\ndeeply interacting learning systems: they have complex interaction as in\ncontrol theory, but adaptation to circumstances as in deep neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 23:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

However, a recent user study shows\nthat word matching features are quite obvious to users and thus of slight\nvalue. GenEx explains a search result by providing a terse description for the\nquery aspect covered by that result. We cast the task as a sequence\ntransduction problem and propose a novel model based on the Transformer\narchitecture. To represent documents with respect to the given queries and yet\nnot generate the queries themselves as explanations, two query-attention layers\nand masked-query decoding are added to the Transformer architecture. The model\nis trained without using any human-generated explanations. Training data are\ninstead automatically constructed to ensure a tolerable noise level and a\ngeneralizable learned model. Experimental evaluation shows that our explanation\nmodels significantly outperform the baseline models. Evaluation through user\nstudies also demonstrates that our explanation model generates short yet useful\nexplanations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 00:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Like previous shock capturing schemes\nand artificial viscosity techniques, the combined FC-SDNN strategy effectively\ncontrols spurious oscillations in the proximity of discontinuities. Thanks to\nits use of a localized but smooth artificial viscosity term, whose support is\nrestricted to a vicinity of flow-discontinuity points, the algorithm enjoys\nspectral accuracy and low dissipation away from flow discontinuities, and, in\nsuch regions, it produces smooth numerical solutions -- as evidenced by an\nessential absence of spurious oscillations in level set lines.

Closure phases\nalong baseline triangles are robust interferometric observables that are\nsensitive to the expected structural changes of the images but are free of\nstation-based atmospheric and instrumental errors. We explored the day-to-day\nvariability in closure phase measurements on all six linearly independent\nnon-trivial baseline triangles that can be formed from the 2017 observations.\nWe showed that three triangles exhibit very low day-to-day variability, with a\ndispersion of $\\sim3-5^\\circ$.

Unfortunately, the exchange of the weights quickly consumes the\nnetwork bandwidth if highly expressive network architecture is employed.\nSo-called split learning partially solves this problem by dividing a neural\nnetwork into a client and a server part, so that the client part of the network\ntakes up less extensive computation resources and bandwidth. However, it is not\nclear how to find the optimal split without sacrificing the overall network\nperformance.

The learned policies may then be\ndeployed in real-world settings where interactions are costly or dangerous.\nCurrent algorithms over-fit to the training dataset and as a consequence\nperform poorly when deployed to out-of-distribution generalizations of the\nenvironment. We aim to address these limitations by learning a Koopman latent\nrepresentation which allows us to infer symmetries of the system's underlying\ndynamic. The latter is then utilized to extend the otherwise static offline\ndataset during training; this constitutes a novel data augmentation framework\nwhich reflects the system's dynamic and is thus to be interpreted as an\nexploration of the environments phase space. To obtain the symmetries we employ\nKoopman theory in which nonlinear dynamics are represented in terms of a linear\noperator acting on the space of measurement functions of the system and thus\nsymmetries of the dynamics may be inferred directly. We provide novel\ntheoretical results on the existence and nature of symmetries relevant for\ncontrol systems such as reinforcement learning settings.

In this paper, we propose an improved loss function, which is\nsuitable for a variety of machine learning models. By increasing the weight of\nextreme temperature samples and reducing the possibility of misjudging extreme\ntemperature as normal, the proposed loss function can enhance the prediction\nresults in extreme situations. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod, we implement the improved loss function in LightGBM, long short-term\nmemory, and artificial neural network and conduct experiments on a real-world\ngreenhouse dataset. The results show that the performance of models with the\nimproved loss function is enhanced compared to the original models in extreme\ncases.

In this paper, we propose FedGraph for federated graph learning among\nmultiple computing clients, each of which holds a subgraph. FedGraph provides\nstrong graph learning capability across clients by addressing two unique\nchallenges. First, traditional GCN training needs feature data sharing among\nclients, leading to risk of privacy leakage. FedGraph solves this issue using a\nnovel cross-client convolution operation. The second challenge is high GCN\ntraining overhead incurred by large graph size. We propose an intelligent graph\nsampling algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, which can\nautomatically converge to the optimal sampling policies that balance training\nspeed and accuracy.

However, the realization of such a solution requires\nthe development of custom ASIC designs, which is still challenging in practice\nand tends to produce one-off implementations unusable beyond the initial\nintended scope. Therefore, as a feasibility study, we have been investigating a\ndesign workflow that allows us to explore algorithmically complex hardware\ndesigns and develop reusable hardware libraries for the needs of scientific\ninstruments at the edge.

The function, often referred to as the generator, is\noptimized to minimize a chosen distance measure between the generated and\ntarget distributions. One commonly used measure for this purpose is the\nWasserstein distance. However, Wasserstein distance is hard to compute and\noptimize, and in practice entropic regularization techniques are used to\nimprove numerical convergence. The influence of regularization on the learned\nsolution, however, remains not well-understood. In this paper, we study how\nseveral popular entropic regularizations of Wasserstein distance impact the\nsolution in a simple benchmark setting where the generator is linear and the\ntarget distribution is high-dimensional Gaussian. We show that entropy\nregularization promotes the solution sparsification, while replacing the\nWasserstein distance with the Sinkhorn divergence recovers the unregularized\nsolution. Both regularization techniques remove the curse of dimensionality\nsuffered by Wasserstein distance. We show that the optimal generator can be\nlearned to accuracy $\\epsilon$ with $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ samples from the target\ndistribution. We thus conclude that these regularization techniques can improve\nthe quality of the generator learned from empirical data for a large class of\ndistributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 06:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Starting from\nsimple rule-based systems, research has progressed towards increasingly complex\narchitectures trained on a massive corpus of datasets, like deep learning\nsystems. Motivated with the intuition of resembling human dialogues, progress\nhas been made towards incorporating emotions into the natural language\ngenerator, using reinforcement learning. While we see a trend of highly\nmarginal improvement on some metrics, we find that limited justification exists\nfor the metrics, and evaluation practices are not uniform. To conclude, we flag\nthese concerns and highlight possible research directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 08:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

In this paper, we propose a new solution Callee combining\ntransfer learning and contrastive learning. The key insight is that, deep\nneural networks (DNNs) can automatically identify patterns concerning indirect\ncalls, which can be more efficient than designing approximation algorithms or\nheuristic rules to handle various cases. Inspired by the advances in\nquestion-answering applications, we utilize contrastive learning to answer the\ncallsite-callee question. However, one of the toughest challenges is that DNNs\nneed large datasets to achieve high performance, while collecting large-scale\nindirect-call ground-truths can be computational-expensive. Since direct calls\nand indirect calls share similar calling conventions, it is possible to\ntransfer knowledge learned from direct calls to indirect ones. Therefore, we\nleverage transfer learning to pre-train DNNs with easy-to-collect direct calls\nand further fine-tune the indirect-call DNNs. We evaluate Callee on several\ngroups of targets, and results show that our solution could match callsites to\ncallees with an F1-Measure of 94.6%, much better than state-of-the-art\nsolutions. Further, we apply Callee to binary code similarity detection and\nhybrid fuzzing, and found it could greatly improve their performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 08:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 02:57:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 07:45:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 08:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

Dipolar or\nquadrupolar axisymmetric (levitating) base states are identified depending on\n$d$ and $\\mbox{Pe}$.

In addition, quadrupolar states are more\nunstable than their dipolar counterparts due to the redistribution of the\nchemical perturbation by the base flow, favouring the emergence of stronger\nslip forcing on the drop surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 08:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

In this context, the present work\ndiscusses the first realistic results of a novel multi-reference perturbation\ntheory (PGCM-PT) that can do so within a symmetry-conserving scheme for both\nground and low-lying excited states.

The analyses given in this paper focus on statistics of the\nfluid-particle acceleration conditioned on both the local dissipation rate and\nthe kinetic energy. It is shown that this quantity presents an exponential\ndependence on the kinetic energy with a growth rate independent of the Reynolds\nnumber, in addition to the expected power law behavior with the dissipation\nrate. The exponential growth, which clearly departs from the previous\npropositions, reflects additional kinematic effects of the flow structures on\nthe acceleration. Regarding intermittency, to account for the persistence of\nthe effect of the large-scales on the dissipation rate, it is further proposed\nscaling laws for the Reynolds number dependence of the conditional and\nunconditional acceleration variance using Barenblatt's incomplete similarity\nframework. It is then shown that both these intermittency and kinematic effects\ncan be combined in a multiplicative cascade process for the acceleration\ndepending on the kinetic energy and the dissipation rate. On the basis of these\nobservations, we introduce a vectorial stochastic model for the dynamics of a\ntracer in turbulent flows. This model incorporates a fractional log-normal\nprocess for the dissipation rate recently proposed, as well as an additional\nhypothesis regarding non-diagonal terms in the diffusion tensor which naturally\nleads to the decomposition between tangential and centripetal acceleration.\nThis model is shown to be in good agreement with direct numerical simulations\nand presents the essential characteristics of the Lagrangian turbulence\nhighlighted in recent years, namely (i) non-Gaussian acceleration, (ii) scale\nseparation between the norm of the acceleration and its components, (iii)\nanomalous scaling law for the Lagrangian velocity spectra, and (iv) negative\nskewness of the increments of the mechanical power, reflecting the temporal\nirreversibility of the dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 10:10:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 09:31:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 12:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

There, dust coagulation is more efficient and\nre-condensation of vapor on pebbles may enhance their growth outside the ice\nline. Previous theoretical studies showed that disruption of icy pebbles due to\nsublimation increases the growth rate of pebbles inside and outside the ice\nline, by freeing small silicate particles back in the dust reservoir of the\ndisc. However, since planet accretion is dependent on the Stokes number of the\naccreting pebbles, the growth of planetesimals could be enhanced downstream of\nthe ice line if pebbles are not disrupting upon sublimation. We developed two\nexperimental models of icy pebbles using different silicate dusts, and we\nexposed them to low-temperature and low-pressure conditions in a vacuum\nchamber. Increasing the temperature inside the chamber, we studied the\nconditions for which pebbles are preserved through sublimation without\ndisrupting. We find that small silicate particles ($<50$um) and a small\nquantity of ice (around $15$% pebble mass) are optimal conditions for\npreserving pebbles through sublimation. Furthermore, pebbles with coarse dust\ndistribution ($100-300$um) do not disrupt if a small percentage ($10-20$% mass)\nof dust grains are smaller than $50$um. Our findings highlight how sublimation\nis not necessarily causing disruption, and that pebbles seem to survive fast\nsublimation processes effectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 10:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

ArchABM is flexible regarding the aerosol model and the\nbuilding layout due to its modular architecture, which allows implementing\nfurther models, any number and size of rooms, agents, and actions reflecting\nhuman-building interaction patterns. We present a use case based on a real\nfloor plan and working schedules adopted in our research center. This study\ndemonstrates how advanced simulation tools can contribute to improving IAQ\nacross a building, thereby ensuring a healthy indoor environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 10:38:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 11:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-17"}

Serendipitous X-ray surveys have proven to be an efficient way to\nfind rare objects, for example tidal disruption events, changing-look active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN), binary quasars, ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), and\nintermediate mass black holes. With the advent of very large X-ray surveys, an\nautomated classification of X-ray sources becomes increasingly valuable.Aims.\nThis work proposes a revisited naive Bayes classification of the X-ray sources\nin the Swift-XRT and XMM-Newton catalogs into four classes -- AGN, stars, X-ray\nbinaries (XRBs) and cataclysmic variables (CVs) -- based on their spatial,\nspectral and timing properties and their multiwavelength counterparts. An\noutlier measure is used to identify objects of other natures. The classifier is\noptimized to maximize the classification performance of a chosen class (here\nXRBs) and it is adapted to data mining purposes.Methods. We augmented the X-ray\ncatalogs with multiwavelength data, source class, and variability properties.\nWe then built a reference sample of about 25000 X-ray sources of known nature.\nFrom this sample the distribution of each property was carefully estimated and\ntaken as reference to assign probabilities of belonging to each class. The\nclassification was then performed on the whole catalog, combining the\ninformation from each property.Results. Using the algorithm on the Swift\nreference sample we retrieved 99%, 98%, 92% and 34% of AGN, stars, XRBs, and\nCVs, respectively, and the false positive rates are 3%, 1%, 9% and 15%. Similar\nresults are obtained on XMM sources. When applied to a carefully selected test\nsample, representing 55% of the X-ray catalog, the classification gives\nconsistent results in terms of distributions of source properties. A\nsubstantial fraction of sources not belonging to any class is efficiently\nretrieved using the outlier measure, as well as AGN and stars with properties\ndeviating from the bulk of their class. Our algorithm is then compared to a\nrandom forest method; the two showed similar performances but the algorithm\npresented in this paper improved insight into the grounds of each\nclassification.Conclusions. This robust classification method can be tailored\nto include additional or different source classes and can be applied to other\nX-ray catalogs. The transparency of the classification compared to other\nmethods makes it a useful tool in the search for homogeneous populations or\nrare source types, including multi-messenger events. Such a tool will be\nincreasingly valuable with the development of surveys of unprecedented size,\nsuch as LSST, SKA and Athena, and the search for counterparts of\nmulti-messenger events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 10:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

As applications produce more and more data, I/O becomes the\nlimiting factor for increasing application performance. I/O congestion caused\nby concurrent access to storage devices is one of the main obstacles that cause\nI/O performance degradation and, consequently, total performance degradation.\n  Although task-based programming models made it possible to achieve higher\nlevels of parallelism by enabling the execution of tasks in large-scale\ndistributed platforms, this parallelism only benefited the compute workload of\nthe application. Previous efforts addressing I/O performance bottlenecks either\nfocused on optimizing fine-grained I/O access patterns using I/O libraries or\navoiding system-wide I/O congestion by minimizing interference between multiple\napplications.\n  In this paper, we propose enabling I/O Awareness in task-based programming\nmodels for improving the total performance of applications. An I/O aware\nprogramming model is able to create more parallelism and mitigate the causes of\nI/O performance degradation. On the one hand, more parallelism can be created\nby supporting special tasks for executing I/O workloads, called I/O tasks, that\ncan overlap with the execution of compute tasks. On the other hand, I/O\ncongestion can be mitigated by constraining I/O tasks scheduling. We propose\ntwo approaches for specifying such constraints: explicitly set by the users or\nautomatically inferred and tuned during application's execution to optimize the\nexecution of variable I/O workloads on a certain storage infrastructure.\n  Our experiments on the MareNostrum 4 Supercomputer demonstrate that using I/O\naware programming model can achieve up to 43% total performance improvement as\ncompared to the I/O non-aware implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 11:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Characterizing temporal networks is crucial to compare\nsuch systems and to study the dynamical processes unfolding on them. A\nsystematic method to characterize simultaneously the temporal and topological\nrelations of active links (also called contacts or events), in order to compare\ndifferent real-world networks and to detect their common patterns or\ndifferences is still missing. In this paper, we propose a method to\ncharacterize to what extent contacts that happen close in time occur also close\nin topology. Specifically, we study the interrelation between temporal and\ntopological properties of contacts from three perspectives: (1) the\nautocorrelation of the time series recording the total number of contacts\nhappened at each time step in a network; (2) the interplay between the\ntopological distance and interevent time of two contacts; (3) the temporal\ncorrelation of contacts within local neighborhoods beyond a node pair. By\napplying our method on 13 real-world temporal networks, we found that\ntemporal-topological correlation of contacts is more evident in virtual contact\nnetworks than in physical contact ones. This could be due to the lower cost and\neasier access of online communications than physical interactions, allowing and\npossibly facilitating social contagion, i.e., interactions of one individual\nmay influence the activity of its neighbors. We also identify different\npatterns between virtual and physical networks and among physical contact\nnetworks at, e.g., school and workplace, in the formation of correlation in\nlocal neighborhoods. Detected patterns and differences may further inspire the\ndevelopment of more realistic temporal network models, that could reproduce\njointly temporal and topological properties of contacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 11:19:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 10:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

Detailed analyses of past\nmajor and minor events can help to understand the eruptive behavior of the\nvolcano and the underlying physical and chemical processes. Catalogs of\nvolcanic eruptions may be established using continuous seismic recordings at\nstations in the proximity of volcanoes. However, in many cases, the analysis of\nthe recordings relies heavily on the manual picking of events by human experts.\nRecently developed Machine Learning-based approaches require large training\ndata sets which may not be available a priori. Here, we propose an alternative\nautomated approach: the Adaptive-Window Volcanic Event Selection Analysis\nModule (AWESAM). This process of creating event catalogs consists of three main\nsteps: (i) identification of potential volcanic events based on squared\nground-velocity amplitudes, an adaptive MaxFilter, and a prominence threshold.\n(ii) catalog consolidation by comparing and verification of the initial\ndetections based on recordings from two different seismic stations. (iii)\nidentification and exclusion of signals from regional tectonic earthquakes. The\nsoftware package is applied to publicly accessible continuous seismic\nrecordings from two almost equidistant stations at Stromboli volcano in Italy.\nWe tested AWESAM by comparison with a hand-picked catalog and found that around\n95 percent of the eruptions with a signal-to-noise ratio above three are\ndetected. In a first application, we derive a new amplitude-frequency\nrelationship from over 290.000 volcanic events at Stromboli during 2019-2020.\nThe module allows for a straightforward generalization and application to other\nvolcanoes worldwide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 11:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

For warps made of off-plane new stellar\nmaterial (either born in-situ or accreted), the warped region of the disc is\nnot well described by a double $\\mathrm{sech^2}$ density profile. Yet, once the\nwarp is gone, the thin and thick disc structure is recovered, with their\nscale-heights following the same trends as in the region that was never warped.\nFinally, we find that the overall thickness and vertical velocity dispersion do\nnot increase during a warp, regardless of the warp's origin. This holds even\nfor warps triggered by interactions with satellites, which cause disc heating\nbut before the warp forms.

However, the\nimperceptibility of attacks, which is also essential for practical attackers,\nis often left out by previous studies. In consequence, the crafted AEs tend to\nhave obvious structural and semantic differences from the original\nhuman-written texts, making them easily perceptible. In this work, we advocate\nleveraging multi-objectivization to address such issue. Specifically, we\nformulate the problem of crafting AEs as a multi-objective optimization\nproblem, where the imperceptibility of attacks is considered as auxiliary\nobjectives. Then, we propose a simple yet effective evolutionary algorithm,\ndubbed HydraText, to solve this problem. To the best of our knowledge,\nHydraText is currently the only approach that can be effectively applied to\nboth score-based and decision-based attack settings. Exhaustive experiments\ninvolving 44237 instances demonstrate that HydraText consistently achieves\ncompetitive attack success rates and better attack imperceptibility than the\nrecently proposed attack approaches. A human evaluation study also shows that\nthe AEs crafted by HydraText are more indistinguishable from human-written\ntexts. Finally, these AEs exhibit good transferability and can bring notable\nrobustness improvement to the target model by adversarial training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 12:10:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 06:43:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 03:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

Both doublets have a dominant photospheric component\nin inactive stars and can be used as tracers of effective temperature and\ngravity. For variability studies using the optical doublet, we concentrate on\nthe red line component because this is less prone to artefacts from telluric\ncorrection in individual spectra. The optical doublet lines are sensitive to\nactivity, especially for M dwarfs later than M5.0 V where the lines develop an\nemission core. For earlier type M dwarfs, the red component of the optical\ndoublet lines is also correlated with H$\\alpha$ activity. We usually find\npositive correlation for stars with H$\\alpha$ in emission, while early-type M\nstars with H$\\alpha$ in absorption show anti-correlation. During flares, the\noptical doublet lines can exhibit strong fill-in or emission cores for our\nlatest spectral types. On the other hand, the near-infrared doublet lines very\nrarely show correlation or anti-correlation to H$\\alpha$ and do not change line\nshape significantly even during the strongest observed flares. Nevertheless,\nthe near-infrared doublet lines show notable resolved Zeeman splitting for\nabout 20 active stars which allows to estimate the magnetic fields B.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 12:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Here, we explicitly measure the\ngeneralization ability of model-based agents in comparison to their model-free\ncounterparts. We focus our analysis on MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2020), a\npowerful model-based agent, and evaluate its performance on both procedural and\ntask generalization.

First, we review the\nclassical analysis to obtain the deflection angle and the differential\nscattering cross-section. Then, using the partial wave method, we determine the\ntotal absorption cross-section numerically in terms of the decoupling parameter\ncalled $M\\omega$, finding that the amplitude of the dilatonic black hole is\nlower than the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om one for mild frequencies. In the\nhigh-frequency limit, the absorption cross-section exhibits two different\ncomplex behaviors; the fine structure and the hyperfine structure. For the\ndifferential scattering cross-section, smaller values of $M\\omega$ lead to more\nsignificant amplitudes; the opposite scenario is obtained by increasing the\ncharge-to-mass ratio. To fully grasp the main properties of the charged\ndilatonic black hole, we consider a different framework where the compact\nobject is impinged by a charged massive scalar field. The superradiant effect\nis lessened for intermediate frequency concerning the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\ncase. However, this effect does not necessarily imply the existence of any\ndynamical instability. In order to trigger the superradiant instability,\nunstable modes must remain trapped outside the event horizon with a mechanism\nbased on the reflecting-mirror boundary conditions. In this way, a charged\nscalar field plus a charged black hole configure a charged black hole bomb. We\nprovide an analytic formula (lower bound) for the values of the charge field,\nwhich can trigger this superradiant instability. We extend this minimal setup\nby considering the dilaton perturbations while freezing the other degree of\nfreedom. The new perturbation scheme enhances the superradiance scattering and\nreduces the lower bound of the charge-to-mass ratio to develop a superradiant\ninstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 13:52:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 14:41:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2022 13:35:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-28"}

The recently approved ten-year\nextension of data acquisition for BESIII prompted an upgrade program for both\nthe BEPCII collider that houses the experiment and some of the sub-detectors\nthat make up the spectrometer. The current inner drift chamber is suffering\nfrom aging and it has been proposed to replace it with a detector based on the\nCylindrical Gas Electron Multiplier (CGEM) technology.\n  The CGEM Inner Tracker (CGEM-IT) consists of three coaxial layers of triple\nGEM. The lightweight tracker is designed to recover efficiency and improve\nz-determination and secondary vertex position reconstruction, resulting in a\nbetter performance and longer lifetime. A novel system has been deeloped for\nthe readout of the CGEM detector, including a new ASIC, called TIGER (Torino\nIntegrated GEM Electronics for Readout), designed to amplify and digitize the\nCGEM signals. The data output from TIGER are collected and processed by a first\nFPGA-based module, GEM Read Out Card, which is responsible for configuring and\ncontrolling the front-end ASICs. A second FPGA-based module, GEM Data\nConcentrator (GEM DC), builds the event packets and transmits them to the\nBESIII data acquisition system.\n  In this thesis I will describe the entire custom electronics chain designed\nfor the CGEM-IT to achieve the desired performance.\n  The structure of my work is presented along with the results of the\nmeasurements performed on the detector and the analysis of the data obtained\nwith the detection of cosmic rays and under test beam.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 13:52:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 12:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Our scenario-based assessments show that Korea's current policy\nfalls short of what the nation's carbon-neutrality ambition would require.\nAcross all technology scenarios examined in this study, extensive and rapid\nenergy system transition is imperative, requiring the large-scale deployment of\nrenewables and carbon capture & storage (CCS) early on and negative emission\ntechnologies (NETs) by the mid-century. Importantly, rapid decarbonization of\nthe power sector that goes with rapid electrification of end-uses seems to be a\nrobust national decarbonization strategy. Furthermore, we contextualize our\nnet-zero scenario results using policy costs, requirements for natural\nresources, and the expansion rate of zero-carbon technologies. We find that the\navailability of nuclear power lowers the required expansion rate of renewables\nand CCS, alleviating any stress on terrestrial and geological systems. By\ncontrast, the limited availability of CCS without nuclear power necessarily\ndemands a very high penetration of renewables and significantly high policy\ncompliance costs, which would decrease the feasibility of achieving the carbon\nneutrality target.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 13:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

In our campaign, we detected 18\ntotal bursts from FRB 20201124A at two separate epochs. By combining the\nvisibilities from both observing epochs, we were able to localise FRB 20201124A\nwith a 1-$\\sigma$ error of 4.5 milliarcseconds (mas).

Optimizing cross-domain resources with\nonline DRL is, however, challenging, as the random exploration of DRL violates\nthe service level agreement (SLA) of slices and resource constraints of\ninfrastructures. In this paper, we propose OnSlicing, an online end-to-end\nnetwork slicing system, to achieve minimal resource usage while satisfying\nslices' SLA. OnSlicing allows individualized learning for each slice and\nmaintains its SLA by using a novel constraint-aware policy update method and\nproactive baseline switching mechanism. OnSlicing complies with resource\nconstraints of infrastructures by using a unique design of action modification\nin slices and parameter coordination in infrastructures. OnSlicing further\nmitigates the poor performance of online learning during the early learning\nstage by offline imitating a rule-based solution. Besides, we design four new\ndomain managers to enable dynamic resource configuration in radio access,\ntransport, core, and edge networks, respectively, at a timescale of subseconds.\nWe implement OnSlicing on an end-to-end slicing testbed designed based on\nOpenAirInterface with both 4G LTE and 5G NR, OpenDayLight SDN platform, and\nOpenAir-CN core network. The experimental results show that OnSlicing achieves\n61.3% usage reduction as compared to the rule-based solution and maintains\nnearly zero violation (0.06%) throughout the online learning phase. As online\nlearning is converged, OnSlicing reduces 12.5% usage without any violations as\ncompared to the state-of-the-art online DRL solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 14:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

To understand these discrepancies, detailed cross-comparisons of\nadditional galaxies are needed. We present the first part of our\ncross-comparison between stellar- and gas-based MBH estimates in the nearby\nfast-rotating early-type galaxy NGC 6958. The measurements presented here are\nbased on ground-layer adaptive optics-assisted Multi-Unit Spectroscopic\nExplorer (MUSE) science verification data at around 0.6 arcsec spatial\nresolution. The spatial resolution is a key ingredient for the measurement and\nwe provide a Gaussian parametrisation of the adaptive optics-assisted point\nspread function (PSF) for various wavelengths. From the MUSE data, we extracted\nthe stellar kinematics and constructed dynamical models.

Here, we present based on Fe-doping of Ni-Mn-In a microstructure\ndesign strategy which simultaneously improves cyclic stability and maintains\nthe excellent magnetocaloric and elastocaloric properties. Our results reveal\nthat precipitation of a strongly Fe-enriched and In-depleted coherent secondary\ngamma-phase at grain boundaries can ensure excellent mechanical stability by\nhindering intergranular fracture during cyclic loading. In this way, a large\nelastocaloric effect of -4.5 K was achieved for more than 16000 cycles without\nstructural or functional degradation, which corresponds to an increase of the\ncyclic stability by more than three orders of magnitude as compared to\nsingle-phase Ni-Mn-In-(Fe). In addition, we demonstrate that the large\nmagnetocaloric effect of single-phase Ni-Mn-In-(Fe) can be preserved in the\ndual-phase material when the secondary gamma-phase is exclusively formed at\ngrain boundaries as the martensitic transformation within the Heusler matrix is\nbarely affected.

Misclassification may lead to biased estimates of model\nparameters, even when the misclassification is entirely random. We aimed to\ndevelop statistical methods that facilitate unbiased estimation of adjusted and\nunadjusted exposure-outcome associations and between-study heterogeneity in\nIPD-MA, where the extent and nature of exposure misclassification may vary\nacross studies.\n  We present Bayesian methods that allow misclassification of binary exposure\nvariables to depend on study- and participant-level characteristics. In an\nexample of the differential diagnosis of dengue using two variables, where the\ngold standard measurement for the exposure variable was unavailable for some\nstudies which only measured a surrogate prone to misclassification, our methods\nyielded more accurate estimates than analyses naive with regard to\nmisclassification or based on gold standard measurements alone. In a simulation\nstudy, the evaluated misclassification model yielded valid estimates of the\nexposure-outcome association, and was more accurate than analyses restricted to\ngold standard measurements.\n  Our proposed framework can appropriately account for the presence of binary\nexposure misclassification in IPD-MA. It requires that some studies supply IPD\nfor the surrogate and gold standard exposure and misclassification is\nexchangeable across studies conditional on observed covariates (and outcome).\nThe proposed methods are most beneficial when few large studies that measured\nthe gold standard are available, and when misclassification is frequent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 15:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Rigid polymer solutions that generate DR seemingly lack prevalent\nviscoelastic characteristics. They do, however, demonstrate larger viscosities\nand a noticeable shear-thinning trend, well approximated by generalized\nNewtonian models. The following experimental investigation scrutinized the flow\nstatistics of an aqueous xanthan gum solution in a turbulent channel flow, with\nfriction Reynolds numbers ($Re_{\\tau}$) between 160 and 680. The amount of DR\nvaried insignificantly between 28% and 33%. The velocity field was measured\nusing planar particle image velocimetry and the steady shear rheology was\nmeasured using a torsional rheometer. The results were used to characterize the\nflow statistics of the polymer drag-reduced flows at different $Re_{\\tau}$ and\nwith negligible changes in DR; a parametric study only previously considered by\nnumerical simulations. Changes to the mean velocity and Reynolds stress\nprofiles with increasing $Re_{\\tau}$ were similar to the modifications observed\nin Newtonian turbulence. Specifically, the inner-normalized mean velocity\nprofiles overlapped for different $Re_{\\tau}$ and the Reynolds stresses\nmonotonically grew in magnitude with increasing $Re_{\\tau}$. Profiles of mean\nviscosity with respect to the wall-normal position demonstrated a thin layer\nthat consists of a low-viscosity fluid in the immediate vicinity of the wall.\nFluid outside of this thin layer had a significantly larger viscosity. We\nsurmise that the demarcation in the shear viscosity between the inner\n\"lubricating\" layer and the outer layer cultivates fluid slippage in the buffer\nlayer and an upward shift in the logarithmic layer; a hypothesis akin to DR\nusing wall lubrication and superhydrophobic surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 15:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

However, glSNe detections are rare, owing to the\nintrinsic rarity of SN explosions, the necessity of alignment with a foreground\nlens, and the relatively short window of detectability. We present the Las\nCumbres Observatory Lensed Supernova Search, LCOLSS, a targeted survey designed\nfor detecting glSNe in known strong-lensing systems. Using cadenced\n$r^\\prime$-band imaging, LCOLSS targeted 112 galaxy-galaxy lensing systems with\nhigh expected SN rates, based on estimated star formation rates. No plausible\nglSN was detected by LCOLSS over two years of observing. The analysis performed\nhere measures a detection efficiency for these observations and runs a Monte\nCarlo simulation using the predicted supernova rates to determine the expected\nnumber of glSN detections. The results of the simulation suggest an expected\nnumber of detections and $68\\%$ Poisson confidence intervals, $N_{SN} = 0.20,\n[0,2.1] $, $N_{Ia} = 0.08, [0,2.0]$, $N_{CC} = 0.12, [0,2.0]$, for all SN, Type\nIa, and core-collapse (CC) SNe respectively.

Through SSSA, the thesis systematically\nidentifies the control parameter settings for which delays in PSSs improve the\ndamping of a power system.

Finally, SSSA is utilized in the thesis to systematically propose a\ndelay-based method to reduce the coupling of the equations of power system\nmodels for transient stability analysis. The method consists in identifying the\nvariables that, when subjected to a delay equal to the time step of the\nnumerical integration, leave practically unchanged the system trajectories.\nSuch an one-step-delay approximation increases the sparsity of the system\nJacobian matrices and can be used in conjunction with state-of-the-art\ntechniques for the integration of DAEs.

Specifically, scalable RRAMs based on Pr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$MnO$_3$\n(PCMO) exhibit analog switching have been demonstrated as an integrating\nneuron, an analog synapse, and a voltage-controlled oscillator. More recently,\nthe inherent stochasticity of memristors has been proposed for efficient\nhardware implementations of Boltzmann Machines. However, as the problem size\nscales, the number of neurons increase and controlling the stochastic\ndistribution tightly over many iterations is necessary. This requires\nparametric control over stochasticity. Here, we characterize the stochastic Set\nin PCMO RRAMs. We identify that the Set time distribution depends on the\ninternal state of the device (i.e., resistance) in addition to external input\n(i.e., voltage pulse). This requires the confluence of contradictory properties\nlike stochastic switching as well as deterministic state control in the same\ndevice. Unlike, \"stochastic-everywhere\" filamentary memristors, in PCMO RRAMs,\nwe leverage the (i) stochastic Set in negative polarity and (ii) deterministic\nanalog Reset in positive polarity to demonstrate 100x reduced Set time\ndistribution drift. The impact on Boltzmann Machines' performance is analyzed\nand as opposed to the \"fixed external input stochasticity\", the\n\"state-monitored stochasticity\" can solve problems 20x larger in size. State\nmonitoring also tunes out the device-to-device variability effect on\ndistributions providing 10x better performance. In addition to the physical\ninsights, this study establishes the use of experimental stochasticity in PCMO\nRRAMs in stochastic recurrent neural networks reliably over many iterations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 13:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}

Various techniques have been explored\nwithin the field of machine learning to gauge the utility in fulfilling the\ncore ambition. Steady advection diffusion problem has been used as the test\ncase to understand the level of complexity up to which a method can provide\nsolution. Ultimately, the focus stays over physics informed machine learning\ntechniques where solving differential equations is possible without any\ntraining with computed data. The prevalent methods by I.E. Lagaris et.al. and\nM. Raissi et.al are explored thoroughly. The prevalent methods cannot solve\nadvection dominant problems. A physics informed method, called as Distributed\nPhysics Informed Neural Network (DPINN), is proposed to solve advection\ndominant problems. It increases the lexibility and capability of older methods\nby splitting the domain and introducing other physics-based constraints as mean\nsquared loss terms. Various experiments are done to explore the end to end\npossibilities with the method. Parametric study is also done to understand the\nbehavior of the method to different tunable parameters. The method is tested\nover steady advection-diffusion problems and unsteady square pulse problems.\nVery accurate results are recorded. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a very\nfast neural network algorithm at the cost of tunable parameters. The ELM based\nvariant of the proposed model is tested over the advection-diffusion problem.\nELM makes the complex optimization simpler and Since the method is\nnon-iterative, the solution is recorded in a single shot. The ELM based variant\nseems to work better than the simple DPINN method.

We incorporate human factors\n(e.g., levels of expertise, stress, and efficiency) and empirical psychological\nresults (e.g., the Yerkes-Dodson law and the sunk cost fallacy) to model the\noperators' attention dynamics and their decision-making processes along with\nthe real-time alert monitoring and inspection.
