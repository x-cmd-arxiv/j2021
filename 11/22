The formation processes of massive stars are still unclear but a\npicture is emerging involving accretion disks and molecular outflows in what\nappears to be a scaled-up version of low-mass star formation. A census of\noutflow activity towards massive star-forming clumps in various evolutionary\nstages has the potential to shed light on massive star formation (MSF).\n  Aims. We conducted an outflow survey towards ATLASGAL clumps using SEDIGISM\ndata and aimed to obtain a large sample of clumps exhibiting outflows in\ndifferent evolutionary stages.\n  Methods. We identify the high-velocity wings of the 13CO lines toward\nATLASGAL clumps by (1) extracting the simultaneously observed 13CO and C18O\nspectra from SEDIGISM, and (2) subtracting Gaussian fits to the scaled C18O\nfrom the 13CO, line after considering opacity broadening.\n  Results. We have detected high-velocity gas towards 1192 clumps out of a\ntotal sample of 2052, giving an overall detection rate of 58%. Outflow activity\nhas been detected in the earliest quiescent clumps (i.e., 70$\\mu$m weak), to\nthe most evolved HII region stages i.e., 8$\\mu$m bright with MSF tracers. The\ndetection rate increases as a function of evolution (quiescent=51%,\nprotostellar=47%, YSO=57%, UCHII regions=76%).\n  Conclusion. Our sample is the largest outflow sample identified so far. The\nhigh-detection rate from this large sample is consistent with previous results\nand supports that outflows are a ubiquitous feature of MSF. The lower detection\nrate in early evolutionary stages may be due to that outflows in the early\nstages are weak and difficult to detect. We obtain a statistically significant\nsample of outflow clumps for every evolutionary stage, especially for outflow\nclumps in the 70$\\mu$m dark stage. This suggests that the absence of 70$\\mu$m\nemission is not a robust indicator of starless/pre-stellar cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 16:13:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 11:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

The\nresultant point set embedding is robust to the permutations of the input\npoints. Our novel CpT block builds over local neighbourhoods of points obtained\nvia a dynamic graph computation at each layer of the networks' structure. It is\nfully differentiable and can be stacked just like convolutional layers to learn\nglobal properties of the points. We evaluate our model on standard benchmark\ndatasets such as ModelNet40, ShapeNet Part Segmentation, and the S3DIS 3D\nindoor scene semantic segmentation dataset to show that our model can serve as\nan effective backbone for various point cloud processing tasks when compared to\nthe existing state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 17:45:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

With the provided memory safety guarantees, DPTI can even securely\nsupport deep argument filtering, such as string comparisons.

We study such fairness concerns in\nthe context of a two-sided market, where there are two sets of agents, and each\nagent has preferences over the other set. The goal is producing a matching\nbetween the sets. This setting has been the focus of a rich body of work. The\nseminal work of Gale and Shapley formulated a stability desideratum, and showed\nthat a stable matching always exists and can be found efficiently. We study\nthis question through the lens of metric-based fairness notions (Dwork et al.,\nKim et al.). We formulate appropriate definitions of fairness and stability in\nthe presence of a similarity metric, and ask: does a fair and stable matching\nalways exist? Can such a matching be found in polynomial time? Our\ncontributions are as follows: (1) Composition failures for classical\nalgorithms: We show that composing the Gale-Shapley algorithm with fair\nhospital preferences can produce blatantly unfair outcomes. (2) New algorithms\nfor finding fair and stable matchings: Our main technical contributions are\nefficient new algorithms for finding fair and stable matchings when: (i) the\nhospitals' preferences are fair, and (ii) the fairness metric satisfies a\nstrong \"proto-metric\" condition: the distance between every two doctors is\neither zero or one. In particular, these algorithms also show that, in this\nsetting, fairness and stability are compatible. (3) Barriers for finding fair\nand stable matchings in the general case: We show that if the hospital\npreferences can be unfair, or if the metric fails to satisfy the proto-metric\ncondition, then no algorithm in a natural class can find a fair and stable\nmatching. The natural class includes the classical Gale-Shapley algorithms and\nour new algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 19:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

Here, we investigate the\nphysical impact of the finite thickness of a galactic disc on the disc\nstability against the non-axisymmetric perturbations and on the longevity of\nthe spiral density waves, with and without the presence of gas. The longevity\nis quantified via group velocity of density wavepackets. The galactic disc is\nfirst modelled as a collisionless stellar disc with finite height and then more\nrealistically as a gravitationally-coupled stars plus gas system (with\ndifferent thickness for stars and gas). For each case, we derive the\nappropriate dispersion relation in the WKB approximation, and study the\ndynamical effect of the disc thickness on the life-time of spiral density waves\nvia a parametric approach. We find the generic trend that the effective\nreduction in disc self-gravity due to disc thickness makes it more stable\nagainst the non-axisymmetric perturbations, and shortens the life-span of the\nspiral density waves. Further, the interstellar gas and the disc thickness are\nshown to have a mutually opposite dynamical effect on the disc stability as\nwell as the longevity of the spiral density waves. While the gas supports the\nnon-axisymmetric features for a longer time, the disc thickness has an\nopposite, quenching effect.

We resolve this conjecture in the positive by\nproving that in general, even if both concentrability and realizability are\nsatisfied, any algorithm requires sample complexity polynomial in the size of\nthe state space to learn a non-trivial policy.\n  Our results show that sample-efficient offline reinforcement learning\nrequires either restrictive coverage conditions or representation conditions\nthat go beyond supervised learning, and highlight a phenomenon called\nover-coverage which serves as a fundamental barrier for offline value function\napproximation methods. A consequence of our results for reinforcement learning\nwith linear function approximation is that the separation between online and\noffline RL can be arbitrarily large, even in constant dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 23:22:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 17:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

In this work, we begin by first developing an\nexpression of disjoining pressure in a water film as a function of distance\nfrom the surface from prior experimental findings.

The simulation results are in excellent\nagreement with experimental data, thus demonstrating and validating that\nnear-surface molecular interactions can be integrated in continuum numerical\nsimulations through the disjoining pressure term. Following the implementation,\nwe simulate the transpiration process of passive water transport over a height\nof 100 m by using a domain comprising of nanopore connected to a tube with a\nground-based water tank, thus mimicking the stomata-xylem-soil pathway in\ntrees. By varying the evaporation rate from liquid-vapor interface in the\nnanopore, effects on naturally-created pressure difference and liquid flow\nvelocity are estimated. Further, kinetic theory analysis is performed to study\nthe combined effect of absolute negative liquid-film pressure and accommodation\ncoefficient on the maximum mass flux feasible during transpiration.

Recently this\nbound was improved to include corrections for finite-sized thermal reservoirs.\nIn conventional information-erasure schemes, conservation of energy plays a key\nrole with the cost of erasure. However, it has been shown that erasure can be\nachieved through the manipulation of spin angular momentum rather than energy,\nusing a reservoir composed of energy-degenerate spin particles under the\nconstraint of the conservation of spin angular momentum, in the limit of an\ninfinite number of particles. In this case the erasure cost is in terms of\ndissipation of spin angular momentum. Here we analyze the erasure of memory\nusing a finite-sized spin reservoir. We compute the erasure cost to compare it\nwith its infinite counterpart and determine what size of finite reservoir gives\nsimilar erasure cost statistics using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the\nmeasure of difference. Our findings show that erasure with finite-sized\nreservoirs results in the erasure of less information compared to the infinite\nreservoir counterpart when compared on this basis.

When TL is applied to DL, pretrained (teacher) models\nare fine-tuned to build domain specific (student) models. This fine-tuning\nrelies on the fact that DL model can be decomposed to classifiers and feature\nextractors, and a line of studies showed that the same feature extractors can\nbe used to train classifiers on multiple tasks. Furthermore, recent studies\nproposed multiple algorithms that can fine-tune teacher models' feature\nextractors to train student models more efficiently. We note that regardless of\nthe fine-tuning of feature extractors, the classifiers of student models are\ntrained with final outputs of feature extractors (i.e., the outputs of\npenultimate layers). However, a recent study suggested that feature maps in\nResNets across layers could be functionally equivalent, raising the possibility\nthat feature maps inside the feature extractors can also be used to train\nstudent models' classifiers. Inspired by this study, we tested if feature maps\nin the hidden layers of the teacher models can be used to improve the student\nmodels' accuracy (i.e., TL's efficiency). Specifically, we developed 'adaptive\ntransfer learning (ATL)', which can choose an optimal set of feature maps for\nTL, and tested it in the few-shot learning setting. Our empirical evaluations\nsuggest that ATL can help DL models learn more efficiently, especially when\navailable examples are limited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 01:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

In the CI chondritic\ncomposition experiments, irregularly shaped amorphous silicate particles of\nless than a few hundred nanometers embedded with multiple Fe-Ni nanoparticles\nof ~<20 nm were successfully synthesized. These characteristics are very\nsimilar to those of GEMS, except for the presence of FeSi instead of sulfide\ngrains.

Dialogue sequence labeling is a supervised learning task\nthat estimates labels for each utterance in the target dialogue document, and\nis useful for many applications such as dialogue act estimation. Accurate\nlabeling is often realized by a hierarchically-structured large model\nconsisting of utterance-level and dialogue-level networks that capture the\ncontexts within an utterance and between utterances, respectively. However, due\nto its large model size, such a model cannot be deployed on\nresource-constrained devices. To overcome this difficulty, we focus on\nknowledge distillation which trains a small model by distilling the knowledge\nof a large and high performance teacher model. Our key idea is to distill the\nknowledge while keeping the complex contexts captured by the teacher model. To\nthis end, the proposed method, hierarchical knowledge distillation, trains the\nsmall model by distilling not only the probability distribution of the label\nclassification, but also the knowledge of utterance-level and dialogue-level\ncontexts trained in the teacher model by training the model to mimic the\nteacher model's output in each level.

Significant progress has been made in continuously locating\nindividual pigs using tracking-by-detection methods. However, these methods\nfail for oblong pens because a single fixed camera does not cover the entire\nfloor at adequate resolution. We address this problem by using multiple\ncameras, placed such that the visual fields of adjacent cameras overlap, and\ntogether they span the entire floor. Avoiding breaks in tracking requires\ninter-camera handover when a pig crosses from one camera's view into that of an\nadjacent camera. We identify the adjacent camera and the shared pig location on\nthe floor at the handover time using inter-view homography. Our experiments\ninvolve two grow-finish pens, housing 16-17 pigs each, and three RGB cameras.\nOur algorithm first detects pigs using a deep learning-based object detection\nmodel (YOLO) and creates their local tracking IDs using a multi-object tracking\nalgorithm (DeepSORT). We then use inter-camera shared locations to match\nmultiple views and generate a global ID for each pig that holds throughout\ntracking. To evaluate our approach, we provide five two-minutes long video\nsequences with fully annotated global identities. We track pigs in a single\ncamera view with a Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and Precision of 65.0% and\n54.3% respectively and achieve a Camera Handover Accuracy of 74.0%.

By producing features that are\nguaranteed to transform covariantly to the group actions on the inputs,\ngroup-equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) achieve significantly\nimproved generalization performance in learning tasks with intrinsic symmetry.\nGeneral theory and practical implementation of G-CNNs have been studied for\nplanar images under either rotation or scaling transformation, but only\nindividually. We present, in this paper, a roto-scale-translation equivariant\nCNN (RST-CNN), that is guaranteed to achieve equivariance jointly over these\nthree groups via coupled group convolutions. Moreover, as symmetry\ntransformations in reality are rarely perfect and typically subject to input\ndeformation, we provide a stability analysis of the equivariance of\nrepresentation to input distortion, which motivates the truncated expansion of\nthe convolutional filters under (pre-fixed) low-frequency spatial modes. The\nresulting model provably achieves deformation-robust RST equivariance, i.e.,\nthe RST symmetry is still \"approximately\" preserved when the transformation is\n\"contaminated\" by a nuisance data deformation, a property that is especially\nimportant for out-of-distribution generalization.

Then using the assumption that the classical effective action of the\nstring theory at the critical dimension is background independent, we fix the\ncoefficients of the independent gauge invariant couplings by imposing $O(1,1)$\nsymmetry when the background has a circle and by imposing $O(d,d)$ symmetry\nwhen the background has $T^d$. These constraints fix the bulk action up to an\noverall factor, and the boundary action up to two parameters. By requiring the\ngravity couplings in the boundary action to be consistent with those in the\nChern-Simons gravity, the two boundary parameters are also fixed.

KD is a model compression method that improves\nthe performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) without using additional\nparameters for testing.

Our key insight is to explore the\nfeature representation learning with labeled and unlabeled (i.e., pseudo\nlabeled) images to enhance the segmentation performance. In the first stage, we\npresent an aleatoric uncertainty-aware method, namely AUA, to improve the\nsegmentation performance for generating high-quality pseudo labels. Considering\nthe inherent ambiguity of medical images, AUA adaptively regularizes the\nconsistency on images with low ambiguity. To enhance the representation\nlearning, we propose a stage-adaptive contrastive learning method, including a\nboundary-aware contrastive loss to regularize the labeled images in the first\nstage and a prototype-aware contrastive loss to optimize both labeled and\npseudo labeled images in the second stage. The boundary-aware contrastive loss\nonly optimizes pixels around the segmentation boundaries to reduce the\ncomputational cost. The prototype-aware contrastive loss fully leverages both\nlabeled images and pseudo labeled images by building a centroid for each class\nto reduce computational cost for pair-wise comparison.

Moreover, their adversarial examples are generated under\nthe white-box setting, which frequently suffers from low success rates when\ntransferred to attack remote black-box models. In this paper, we study 3D point\ncloud attacks from two new and challenging perspectives by proposing a novel\nImperceptible Transfer Attack (ITA): 1) Imperceptibility: we constrain the\nperturbation direction of each point along its normal vector of the\nneighborhood surface, leading to generated examples with similar geometric\nproperties and thus enhancing the imperceptibility. 2) Transferability: we\ndevelop an adversarial transformation model to generate the most harmful\ndistortions and enforce the adversarial examples to resist it, improving their\ntransferability to unknown black-box models. Further, we propose to train more\nrobust black-box 3D models to defend against such ITA attacks by learning more\ndiscriminative point cloud representations.

In this paper, we propose a new backdoor attack\nFTROJAN through trojaning the frequency domain. The key intuition is that\ntriggering perturbations in the frequency domain correspond to small pixel-wise\nperturbations dispersed across the entire image, breaking the underlying\nassumptions of existing defenses and making the poisoning images visually\nindistinguishable from clean ones. We evaluate FTROJAN in several datasets and\ntasks showing that it achieves a high attack success rate without significantly\ndegrading the prediction accuracy on benign inputs.

Despite certain success, a content-free positional embedding\nhardly associates stably with meaningful local image regions. In this paper, we\npropose a novel module called Multi-Domain Character Distance Perception\n(MDCDP) to establish a visual and semantic related positional encoding.

The two kinds of constrained features are then fused\nto produce a reinforced feature, generating a content-aware embedding that well\nperceives spacing variations and semantic affinities among characters, i.e.,\nmulti-domain character distance.

Introducing the concept of the generalized Lelong numbers and studying\nthese new numerical values, we extend both theories to a more general class of\npositive plurisubharmonic currents and in a more general context of ambient\nmanifolds.\n  More specifically, in the first part of our article, we consider a positive\nplurisubharmonic current $T$ of bidegree $(p,p)$ on a complex manifold $X$ of\ndimension $k,$ and let $V\\subset X$ be a K\\\"ahler submanifold of dimension $l$\nand $B$ a relatively compact piecewise $\\mathcal{C}^2$-smooth open subset of\n$V.$ We define the notion of the $j$-th Lelong number of $T$ along $B$ for\nevery $j$ with $\\max(0,l-p)\\leq j\\leq \\min(l,k-p)$ and prove their existence as\nwell as their basic properties.\n  Our method relies on some Lelong-Jensen formulas for the normal bundle to $V$\nin $X,$ which are of independent interest.\n  The second part of our article is devoted to geometric characterizations of\nthe generalized Lelong numbers. As a consequence of this study, we show that\nthe top degree Lelong number of $T$ along $B$ is totally intrinsic. This is a\ngeneralization of the fundamental result of Siu (for positive closed currents)\nand of Alessandrini--Bassanelli (for positive plurisubharmonic currents) on the\nindependence of Lelong numbers at a single point on the choice of coordinates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 07:23:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 22:35:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

By qualitatively minimizing the relative\nscore $s_n - s_p$, the pairwise approaches capture the ranking of samples\nnaturally but suffer from training efficiency. Additionally, both approaches\nare hard to explicitly provide a personalized decision boundary to determine if\nusers are interested in items unseen. To address those issues, we innovatively\nintroduce an auxiliary score $b_u$ for each user to represent the User Interest\nBoundary(UIB) and individually penalize samples that cross the boundary with\npairwise paradigms, i.e., the positive samples whose score is lower than $b_u$\nand the negative samples whose score is higher than $b_u$.

It will be laborious to cope with the\nheterogeneous requirements in next-generation wireless communications, such as\nvarious transmission data, complicated communication scenarios, and massive\nuser access. Therefore, this paper studies a generalized MU-MIMO (GMU-MIMO)\nsystem with more practical constraints, i.e., non-Gaussian signaling, non-IID\nchannel, and massive users and antennas. These generalized assumptions bring\nnew challenges in theory and practice. For example, there is no accurate\ncapacity analysis for GMU-MIMO. In addition, it is unclear how to achieve the\ncapacity optimal performance with practical complexity.\n  To address these challenges, a unified framework is proposed to derive the\nGMU-MIMO capacity and design a capacity optimal transceiver, which jointly\nconsiders encoding, modulation, detection, and decoding. Group asymmetry is\ndeveloped to make a tradeoff between user rate allocation and implementation\ncomplexity. Specifically, the capacity region of group asymmetric GMU-MIMO is\ncharacterized by using the celebrated mutual information and minimum\nmean-square error (MMSE) lemma and the MMSE optimality of orthogonal\napproximate message passing (OAMP)/vector AMP (VAMP). Furthermore, a\ntheoretically optimal multi-user OAMP/VAMP receiver and practical multi-user\nlow-density parity-check (MU-LDPC) codes are proposed to achieve the capacity\nregion of group asymmetric GMU-MIMO.

The\nmost challenging environment for planet formation may be the harsh UV radiation\nfield of nearby massive stars which quickly erodes disks by external\nphoto-evaporation. We have observed the AT Pyx system, located in the head of a\ncometary globule in the Gum Nebula, to search for signs of ongoing planet\nformation. We used the extreme adaptive optics imager VLT/SPHERE to observe AT\nPyx in polarized light as well as total intensity in the J, H and K-band.\nAdditionally we employed VLT/NACO to observe the system in the L-band. We\nresolve the disk around AT Pyx in scattered light across multiple wavelengths.\nWe find an extended (>126 au) disk, with an intermediate inclination between 35\ndeg and 42 deg. The disk shows complex sub-structure and we identify 2 and\npossibly 3 spiral-like features. Depending on the precise geometry of the disk\n(which we can not unambiguously infer from our data) the disk may be eccentric\nwith an eccentricity of ~0.16 or partially self-shadowed. The spiral features\nand possible eccentricity are both consistent with signatures of an embedded\ngas giant planet equal in mass to Jupiter. Our own observations can rule out\nbrown dwarf companions embedded in the resolved disk, but are not sensitive\nenough to detect gas giants. AT Pyx is the first disk in a cometray globule in\nthe Gum Nebula which is spatially resolved. By comparison with disks in the\nOrion Nebula Cluster we note that the extension of the disk may be exceptional\nfor this environment if the external UV radiation field is comparable to other\ncometary globules in the region.

Previous studies have\ndemonstrated that the wind torque can be predicted via formulations dependent\non stellar properties, such as magnetic field strength and geometry, stellar\nradius and mass, wind mass-loss rate, and stellar rotation rate. Although these\nstars are observed to experience surface differential rotation, torque\nformulations so far have assumed solid-body rotation. Surface differential\nrotation is expected to affect the rotation of the wind and thus the angular\nmomentum loss. To investigate how differential rotation affects the torque, we\nuse the PLUTO code to perform 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic, axisymmetric\nsimulations of stellar winds, using a colatitude-dependent surface differential\nrotation profile that is solar-like (i.e., rotation is slower at the poles than\nthe equator). We demonstrate that the torque is determined by the average\nrotation rate in the wind, so that the net torque is less than that predicted\nby assuming solid-body rotation at the equatorial rate. The magnitude of the\neffect is essentially proportional to the magnitude of the surface differential\nrotation, for example, resulting in a torque for the Sun that is $\\sim 20 \\%$\nsmaller than predicted by the solid-body assumption.

The representation\nfeatures mappings from a gradient waveform to two scalars that separately\ncontrol the sensitivity to restriction and exchange.

While Transformers have delivered significant performance\nimprovements, training such networks is extremely memory intensive owing to\nstoring all intermediate activations that are needed for gradient computation\nduring backpropagation, especially for long sequences. To this end, we present\nMesa, a memory-saving training framework for Transformers. Specifically, Mesa\nuses exact activations during forward pass while storing a low-precision\nversion of activations to reduce memory consumption during training. The\nlow-precision activations are then dequantized during back-propagation to\ncompute gradients. Besides, to address the heterogeneous activation\ndistributions in the multi-head self-attention layers, we propose a head-wise\nactivation quantization strategy, which quantizes activations based on the\nstatistics of each head to minimize the approximation error. To further boost\ntraining efficiency, we learn quantization parameters by running estimates.\nMore importantly, by re-investing the saved memory in employing a larger batch\nsize or scaling up model size, we may further improve the performance under\nconstrained computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet,\nCIFAR-100 and ADE20K demonstrate that Mesa can achieve flexible memory-savings\n(up to 50%) during training while achieving comparable or even better\nperformance.

In particular, in the most simple case of a haploid population in a\ntwo-patch environment, while it is known from population genetics that\npolymorphism at a single major-effect locus is stable in the symmetric case,\nthere exists no analytical predictions on how this polymorphism holds when a\npolygenic background also contributes to the trait. Here we propose to answer\nthis question by introducing a new eco-evo methodology that allows us to take\ninto account the combined contributions of a major-effect locus and of a\nquantitative background resulting from small-effect loci, where inheritance is\nencoded according to an extension to the infinitesimal model. In a regime of\nsmall variance contributed by the quantitative loci, we justify that traits are\nconcentrated around the major alleles, according to a normal distribution,\nusing new convex analysis arguments. This allows a reduction in the complexity\nof the system using a separation of time scales approach. We predict an\nundocumented phenomenon of loss of polymorphism at the major-effect locus\ndespite strong selection for local adaptation, because the quantitative\nbackground slowly disrupts the rapidly established polymorphism at the\nmajor-effect locus, which is confirmed by individual-based simulations. Our\nstudy highlights how segregation of a quantitative background can greatly\nimpact the dynamics of major-effect loci by provoking migrational meltdowns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 12:06:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 14:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

The experimental settings and the quality of\nthe recording can also affect the observed amplitudes of the spikes. Whole-cell\npatch-clamp recordings from the somata of projection neurons of the antennal\nlobe in Drosophila or mosquitoes can show spikes with amplitudes as small as 2\nmV. Moreover, the observed spikes often ride on relatively large\ndepolarizations, which makes it difficult for the standard thresholding-based\napproaches to distinguish them from noise or sharp EPSPs present in the signal.\nFor spike detection in such neuronal recordings, we propose a clustering-based\nalgorithm that separates peaks corresponding to action potentials from those\ncorresponding to noise. Candidate peaks, including many noise peaks, are first\nselected according to their sharpness, and then a feature vector is extracted\nfor each peak. The 3-dimensional feature vector contains the absolute value of\nthe peak voltage, height of the spike, and the magnitude of the second\nderivative minima attained during the spike. In most recordings, this 3D space\nreveals two natural clusters, separating the noise peaks from the true action\npotentials. Some parameters of the algorithm can be optionally altered by the\nuser to improve detection, which comes handy in the few recordings where the\ndefault parameters do not work well. In summary, the algorithm facilitates\naccurate spike detection to enable the interpretation and analysis of\npatch-clamp data from neuronal recordings in invertebrates.

The resulting first-order differential\nequations are approximated by the finite difference scheme and the boundary\nvalue problem is converted to an initial value problem using the shooting\nmethod. The paper develops the theoretical framework based on the\nNavier-Bernoulli hypothesis, with a possible extension to shear-flexible beams.\nNumerical procedures for the evaluation of equivalent nodal forces and of the\nelement tangent stiffness are presented in detail. Unlike standard finite\nelement formulations, the present approach can increase accuracy by refining\nthe integration scheme on the element level while the number of global degrees\nof freedom is kept constant. The efficiency and accuracy of the developed\nscheme are documented by seven examples that cover circular and parabolic\narches, a spiral-shaped beam, and a spring-like beam with a zig-zag centerline.\nThe proposed formulation does not exhibit any locking. No excessive stiffness\nis observed for coarse computational grids and the distribution of internal\nforces is not polluted by any oscillations.

State-of-the-art defenses are either\nlimited to specific backdoor attacks (source-agnostic attacks) or\nnon-user-friendly in that machine learning (ML) expertise or expensive\ncomputing resources are required. This work observes that all existing backdoor\nattacks have an inevitable intrinsic weakness, non-transferability, that is, a\ntrigger input hijacks a backdoored model but cannot be effective to another\nmodel that has not been implanted with the same backdoor. With this key\nobservation, we propose non-transferability enabled backdoor detection (NTD) to\nidentify trigger inputs for a model-under-test (MUT) during\nrun-time.Specifically, NTD allows a potentially backdoored MUT to predict a\nclass for an input. In the meantime, NTD leverages a feature extractor (FE) to\nextract feature vectors for the input and a group of samples randomly picked\nfrom its predicted class, and then compares similarity between the input and\nthe samples in the FE's latent space. If the similarity is low, the input is an\nadversarial trigger input; otherwise, benign. The FE is a free pre-trained\nmodel privately reserved from open platforms. As the FE and MUT are from\ndifferent sources, the attacker is very unlikely to insert the same backdoor\ninto both of them. Because of non-transferability, a trigger effect that does\nwork on the MUT cannot be transferred to the FE, making NTD effective against\ndifferent types of backdoor attacks. We evaluate NTD on three popular\ncustomized tasks such as face recognition, traffic sign recognition and general\nanimal classification, results of which affirm that NDT has high effectiveness\n(low false acceptance rate) and usability (low false rejection rate) with low\ndetection latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 12:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

However, active matter is\ninherently out-of-equilibrium and even simple models such as active Brownian\nparticles (ABPs) and active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs) behave\nmarkedly differently from their passive counterparts. Controversially, this\ndifference has been shown to manifest itself via either a speedup, slowdown, or\nnon-monotonic change of the glassy relaxation dynamics. Here we rationalize\nthese seemingly contrasting views on the departure from equilibrium by\nidentifying the ratio of the short-time length scale to the cage length, i.e.\nthe length scale of local particle caging, as a vital and unifying control\nparameter for active glassy matter. In particular, we explore the glassy\ndynamics of both thermal and athermal ABPs and AOUPs upon increasing the\npersistence time. We find that for all studied systems there is an optimum of\nthe dynamics; this optimum occurs when the cage length coincides with the\ncorresponding short-time length scale of the system, which is either the\npersistence length for athermal systems or a combination of the persistence\nlength and a diffusive length scale for thermal systems. This new insight, for\nwhich we also provide a simple physical argument, allows us to reconcile and\nexplain the manifestly disparate departures from equilibrium reported in many\nprevious studies of dense active materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 13:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

However, purely data-driven approaches, which\nonly make use of an artificial neural network and data, often fail to\naccurately simulate the evolution of the reactive flow over a sufficiently long\ntime and in a physically consistent manner.

We tested a new set of PMS models including radius\ninflation due to starspots or magnetic inhibition of convection, using five\nclusters observed by the Gaia-ESO Survey, spanning the age range ~10-100 Myr\nwhere such effects could be important. Gaia-ESO radial velocities were combined\nwith Gaia EDR3 astrometry to obtain clean lists of high-probability members for\nthe five clusters. A Bayesian maximum likelihood method was adopted to derive\nthe best model parameters and the cluster reddening and age. Models were\ncalculated for different values of the mixing length parameter\n($\\alpha_{ML}=2.0$, 1.5 and 1.0), without spots or with effective spot coverage\n$\\beta_{spot}=0.2$ and 0.4. To reproduce the CMD and the Li depletion pattern\nin Gamma Vel A and B and in 25 Ori we need both a reduced convection efficiency\n$\\alpha_{ML}=1.0$ and an effective spot coverage of ~20%. We obtained ages of\n18 Myr and 21 Myr for Gamma Vel A and B, respectively, and 19 Myr for 25 Ori.\nHowever, a single isochrone is not sufficient to account for the Li dispersion,\nand an increasing level of spot coverage as mass decreases seems to be\nrequired. The older clusters (NGC2451B at 30 Myr, NGC2547 at 35 Myr, and\nNGC2516 at 138 Myr) are consistent with standard models ($\\alpha_{ML}=2.0$ and\nno spots) except at low masses: a 20% spot coverage seems to reproduce the\nsequence of M-type stars better and might explain the observed abundance\nspread. The quality of Gaia-ESO data combined with Gaia allows us to gain\nimportant insights on PMS evolution.

Using\n't Hooft anomaly matching, most attractive channel, and soft SUSY breaking\napproaches, we outline a number of possible consistent low energy vacua\nincluding one with a remnant $SO(3)\\times U(1)$ symmetry that is analogous to\nthe one-generation model.

We adopt a representation consisting of a\ndensity voxel grid for scene geometry and a feature voxel grid with a shallow\nnetwork for complex view-dependent appearance.

First, we introduce the post-activation interpolation on\nvoxel density, which is capable of producing sharp surfaces in lower grid\nresolution. Second, direct voxel density optimization is prone to suboptimal\ngeometry solutions, so we robustify the optimization process by imposing\nseveral priors.

In 2017, the invention of a quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR)\nbased on photon-assisted tunneling of quasiparticles through a\nnormal-metal--insulator--superconductor junction inspired a series of\nexperimental studies demonstrating the following main properties: (i) the\ndirect-current (dc) bias voltage of the junction can change the QCR-induced\ndamping rate of a superconducting microwave resonator by orders of magnitude\nand give rise to non-trivial Lamb shifts, (ii) the damping rate can be\ncontrolled in nanosecond time scales, and (iii) the dc bias can be replaced by\na microwave excitation, the amplitude of which controls the induced damping\nrate. Theoretically, it is predicted that state-of-the-art superconducting\nresonators and qubits can be reset with an infidelity lower than $10^{-4}$ in\ntens of nanoseconds using experimentally feasible parameters. A QCR-equipped\nresonator has also been demonstrated as an incoherent photon source with an\noutput temperature above one kelvin yet operating at millikelvin. This source\nhas been used to calibrate cryogenic amplification chains. In the future, the\nQCR may be experimentally used to quickly reset superconducting qubits, and\nhence assist in the great challenge of building a practical quantum computer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 14:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

Traditional methods of transient stability\nassessment, such as time domain simulation approach and direct methods, are\nappropriate for offline studies and thus, cannot be applied for online\ntransient stability prediction, which is a major requirement in modern power\nsystems. This motivated the requirement to apply an artificial\nintelligence-based approach. In this regard, supervised machine learning is\nbeneficial for predicting transient stability status, in the presence of\nuncertainties. Therefore, this paper examines the application of a binary\nsupport vector machine-based supervised machine learning, for predicting the\ntransient stability status of a power system, considering uncertainties of\nvarious factors, such as load, faulted line, fault type, fault location and\nfault clearing time. The support vector machine is trained using a Gaussian\nRadial Basis function kernel and its hyperparameters are optimized using\nBayesian optimization. Results obtained for the IEEE 14-bus test system\ndemonstrated that the proposed method offers a fast technique for probabilistic\ntransient stability status prediction, with an excellent accuracy.

Most studies attribute the colour of the red\nspirals to different environmental effects. We analyze a volume limited sample\nfrom the SDSS to study the roles of small-scale and large-scale environments on\nthe colour of spiral galaxies. We compare the star formation rate, stellar age\nand stellar mass distributions of the red and blue spirals and find\nstatistically significant differences between them at $99.9\\%$ confidence\nlevel. The red spirals inhabit significantly denser regions than the blue\nspirals, explaining some of the observed differences in their physical\nproperties. However, the differences persist in all types of environments,\nindicating that the local density alone is not sufficient to explain the origin\nof the red spirals. Using an information theoretic framework, we find a small\nbut non-zero mutual information between the colour of spiral galaxies and their\nlarge-scale environment that are statistically significant ($99.9\\%$ confidence\nlevel) throughout the entire length scale probed. Such correlations between the\ncolour and the large-scale environment of spiral galaxies may result from the\nassembly bias. Thus both the local environment and the assembly bias may play\nessential roles in forming the red spirals. The spiral galaxies may have\ndifferent assembly history across all types of environments. We propose a\npicture where the differences in the assembly history may produce spiral\ngalaxies with different cold gas content. Such a difference would make some\nspirals more susceptible to quenching. In all environments, the spirals with\nhigh cold gas content could delay the quenching and maintain a blue colour,\nwhereas the spirals with low cold gas fractions would be easily quenched and\nbecome red.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 14:55:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 16:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

However, recent implementations suffer from an\nexponential complexity class when computing the prior over all the possible\npolicies up to the time horizon. Fountas et al (2020) used Monte Carlo tree\nsearch to address this problem, leading to very good results in two different\ntasks. Additionally, Champion et al (2021a) proposed a tree search approach\nbased on (temporal) structure learning. This was enabled by the development of\na variational message passing approach to active inference, which enables\ncompositional construction of Bayesian networks for active inference. However,\nthis message passing tree search approach, which we call branching-time active\ninference (BTAI), has never been tested empirically. In this paper, we present\nan experimental study of BTAI in the context of a maze solving agent. In this\ncontext, we show that both improved prior preferences and deeper search help\nmitigate the vulnerability to local minima. Then, we compare BTAI to standard\nactive inference (AcI) on a graph navigation task. We show that for small\ngraphs, both BTAI and AcI successfully solve the task. For larger graphs, AcI\nexhibits an exponential (space) complexity class, making the approach\nintractable. However, BTAI explores the space of policies more efficiently,\nsuccessfully scaling to larger graphs. Then, BTAI was compared to the POMCP\nalgorithm on the frozen lake environment. The experiments suggest that BTAI and\nthe POMCP algorithm accumulate a similar amount of reward. Also, we describe\nwhen BTAI receives more rewards than the POMCP agent, and when the opposite is\ntrue. Finally, we compared BTAI to the approach of Fountas et al (2020) on the\ndSprites dataset, and we discussed the pros and cons of each approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 15:30:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 14:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

The equatorial gravity wave sources driving the LASO\nare localised in the deep convection region at the substellar point and in a\njet exit region near the western terminator, unlike the QBO, for which these\nsources are distributed uniformly around the planet. Longitudinally, the\nwestern terminator experiences the highest wind speeds and undergoes reversals\nearlier than other longitudes. The antistellar point only experiences a weak\noscillation with a very brief, low-speed westward phase.

As a relatively complex\nproblem, in order to achieve good results, current approaches often integrate\ncomponents from several fields, such as supervised learning, semi-supervised\nlearning, transfer learning and resulting in complicated methods. Furthermore,\nthey often make multiple assumptions about the type of noise of the data. This\naffects the model robustness and limits its performance under different noise\nconditions.

We develop low-order linear models based on data from\ndirect numerical simulations of flow past a flexible wing at low Reynolds\nnumber. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these models to track aggressive\nmaneuvers with model predictive control while constraining maximum wing\ndeformation. This system identification approach provides an interpretable,\naccurate, and low-dimensional representation of an aeroelastic system that can\naid in system and controller design for applications where transients play an\nimportant role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 15:53:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 22:19:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 23:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

First measurements aimed at validating the ability to\naccount for the Cerenkov electron energy spectrum dependency by simultaneously\nmeasuring the deposited dose, thus isolating signal variations resulting from\nthe angular dependency. The Cerenkov probe is composed of a 10-mm long\nsensitive volume of clear PMMA optical fiber separated by an absorptive filter\nfrom a 1-mm diameter transport fiber. Filtered and raw Cerenkov signals from\nthe sensitive volume and transport fiber, respectively, were collected using\nthe Hyperscint RP-200 scintillation dosimetry platform. The total signal was\nunmixed using a hyperspectral approach. Dose calibration of the detector signal\nwas accomplished with photon and electron beams. Using a solid-water phantom,\nmeasurements at fixed incident angles covering a wide range of doses and output\nfactors were realized. For fixed incident angle, signal characterization of the\nCerenkov detector displays a linear dose-light relationship. As expected, the\nsensitive volume signal was found to be energy dependent. Output factors were\naccurately measured within 0.8 % for field size up to 25 cm x 25 cm with both\nphotons and electrons. First validation of the Cerenkov angular dependency\nshows a linear dose-light relationship for the whole range of angles tested. As\nexpected, the Cerenkov signal intensity per dose unit varies based on the\nirradiation angle due to the angular dependency.

We\ndemonstrate the regularizing power of deep architectures and present new\nelements to understand the role of the architecture in deep learning methods\nfor registration. Hence, to study the impact of the network parameters, we ran\nour method with different architectural configurations on a private dataset of\n110 metastatic breast cancer full-body PET images with manual segmentations of\nthe brain, bladder and metastatic lesions. We compared it against conventional\niterative registration approaches and supervised deep learning-based models.\nGlobal and local registration accuracies were evaluated using the detection\nrate and the Dice score respectively, while registration realism was evaluated\nusing the Jacobian's determinant. Moreover, we computed the ability of the\ndifferent methods to shrink vanishing lesions with the disappearing rate.\nMIRRBA significantly improves the organ and lesion Dice scores of supervised\nmodels. Regarding the disappearing rate, MIRRBA more than doubles the best\nperforming conventional approach SyNCC score. Our work therefore proposes an\nalternative way to bridge the performance gap between conventional and deep\nlearning-based methods and demonstrates the regularizing power of deep\narchitectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 10:58:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 22:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

NES optimizes the parameters of a probability\ndistribution based on the estimated natural gradient, and one of the key\nparameters affecting the performance is the learning rate. We argue that from\nthe viewpoint of the natural gradient method, the learning rate should be\ndetermined according to the estimation accuracy of the natural gradient. To do\nso, we propose a new learning rate adaptation mechanism for NES. The proposed\nmechanism makes it possible to set a high learning rate for problems that are\nrelatively easy to optimize, which results in speeding up the search. On the\nother hand, in problems that are difficult to optimize (e.g., multimodal\nfunctions), the proposed mechanism makes it possible to set a conservative\nlearning rate when the estimation accuracy of the natural gradient seems to be\nlow, which results in the robust and stable search. The experimental\nevaluations on unimodal and multimodal functions demonstrate that the proposed\nmechanism works properly depending on a search situation and is effective over\nthe existing method, i.e., using the fixed learning rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 13:20:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2022 01:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

As humans overutilize natural resources for their\ndevelopment, elephants' living area continues to decrease; this leads elephants\nto invade the human living area and raid crops more frequently, costing\nmillions of dollars annually. To mitigate EHC, in this paper, we propose an\noriginal solution that comprises of three parts: a compact custom low-power GPS\ntag that is installed on the elephants, a receiver stationed in the human\nliving area that detects the elephants' presence near a farm, and an autonomous\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system that tracks and herds the elephants away\nfrom the farms. By utilizing proportional-integral-derivative controller and\nmachine learning algorithms, we obtain accurate tracking trajectories at a\nreal-time processing speed of 32 FPS. Our proposed autonomous system can save\nover 68 % cost compared with human-controlled UAVs in mitigating EHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 02:44:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}
