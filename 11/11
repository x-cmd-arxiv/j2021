Recent\nTransformer-based VLN methods have made great progress benefiting from the\ndirect connections between visual observations and the language instruction via\nthe multimodal cross-attention mechanism. However, these methods usually\nrepresent temporal context as a fixed-length vector by using an LSTM decoder or\nusing manually designed hidden states to build a recurrent Transformer.\nConsidering a single fixed-length vector is often insufficient to capture\nlong-term temporal context, in this paper, we introduce Multimodal Transformer\nwith Variable-length Memory (MTVM) for visually-grounded natural language\nnavigation by modelling the temporal context explicitly.

In this work, we search for these\nDIBs in the ESO VLT/X-shooter archival data and identify the 9632, 9577, 9428\nand 9365 Angstrom DIBs in a sample of 25 stars.

We\nfind their equivalent widths, after normalized by reddening to eliminate their\ncommon correlation with the density of interstellar clouds, exhibit a tight,\npositive correlation.

Lam [38] introducing systems\nof relations on vectors on such graphs, depending on some signatures defined on\nedges.

The proposed approach\nincorporates three sub-models, namely, the spatial model, the mobility model,\nand the propagation model, in order to develop a realistic environment for the\nstudy of the properties exhibited by the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The spatial\nmodel converts images of real cities taken from Google Maps into undirected\nweighted graphs that capture the spatial arrangement of the streets utilized\nnext for the mobility of individuals. The mobility model implements a\nstochastic agent-based approach, developed in order to assign specific routes\nto individuals moving in the city, through the use of stochastic processes,\nutilizing the weights of the underlying graph to deploy shortest path\nalgorithms. The propagation model implements both the epidemiological model and\nthe physical substance of the transmission of an airborne virus considering the\ntransmission parameters of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we integrate these sub-models\nin order to derive an integrated framework for the study of the epidemic\ndynamics exhibited through the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 16:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

Although TL had been widely adopted in wireless applications\n(e.g., spectrum management and caching), its reliability and security in\n6G-enabled IoV were still not well investigated. For instance, malicious\nvehicles in source domains may transfer and share untrustworthy models (i.e.,\nknowledge) about connection availability to target domains, thus adversely\naffecting the performance of learning processes. Therefore, it is important to\nselect and also incentivize trustworthy vehicles to participate in TL. In this\narticle, we first introduce the integration of TL and 6G-enbaled IoV and\nprovide TL applications for 6G-enabled IoV. We then design a secure and\nreliable transfer learning framework by using reputation to evaluate the\nreliability of pre-trained models and utilizing the consortium blockchain to\nachieve secure and efficient decentralized reputation management. Moreover, a\ndeep learning-based auction scheme for the TL model market is designed to\nmotivate high-reputation vehicles to participate in model sharing.

To study\nits potential, we develop multi-task neural processes, a new variant of neural\nprocesses for multi-task learning. In particular, we propose to explore\ntransferable knowledge from related tasks in the function space to provide\ninductive bias for improving each individual task. To do so, we derive the\nfunction priors in a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework, which enables\neach task to incorporate the shared knowledge provided by related tasks into\nits context of the prediction function.

Traditionally,\nsynthetic images of a scene are generated using rendering algorithms such as\nrasterization or ray tracing, which take specifically defined representations\nof geometry and material properties as input. Collectively, these inputs define\nthe actual scene and what is rendered, and are referred to as the scene\nrepresentation (where a scene consists of one or more objects). Example scene\nrepresentations are triangle meshes with accompanied textures (e.g., created by\nan artist), point clouds (e.g., from a depth sensor), volumetric grids (e.g.,\nfrom a CT scan), or implicit surface functions (e.g., truncated signed distance\nfields). The reconstruction of such a scene representation from observations\nusing differentiable rendering losses is known as inverse graphics or inverse\nrendering. Neural rendering is closely related, and combines ideas from\nclassical computer graphics and machine learning to create algorithms for\nsynthesizing images from real-world observations. Neural rendering is a leap\nforward towards the goal of synthesizing photo-realistic image and video\ncontent.

As a case study, we consider the simplest extension of the SM\nscalar sector involving a light CP-even scalar singlet $S$ mixing with the SM\nHiggs boson. These $S$ particles can be produced abundantly in neutron star\nmergers via the nucleon bremsstrahlung process. We show that the $S$ particles\nmay either be trapped in or stream freely out of the merger remnant, depending\non the $S$ mass, its mixing with the SM Higgs boson, and the temperature and\nbaryon density in the merger. In the free-streaming region, the scalar $S$ will\nprovide an extra channel to cool down the merger remnant, with cooling\ntimescales as small as ${\\cal O}$(ms). On the other hand, in the trapped\nregion, the Bose gas of $S$ particles could contribute a larger thermal\nconductivity than the trapped neutrinos in some parts of the parameter space,\nthus leading to faster thermal equilibration than expected. Therefore, future\nobservations of the early postmerger phase of a neutron star merger could\neffectively probe a unique range of the $S$ parameter space, largely\ncomplementary to the existing and future laboratory and supernova limits.

However, the computational demands of 3D radiative\ntransfer techniques have precluded their usage within atmospheric retrievals.\nHere we introduce TRIDENT, a new 3D radiative transfer model which rapidly\ncomputes transmission spectra of exoplanet atmospheres with day-night,\nmorning-evening, and vertical variations in temperature, chemical abundances,\nand cloud properties. We also derive a general equation for transmission\nspectra, accounting for 3D atmospheres, refraction, multiple scattering,\ningress/egress, grazing transits, stellar heterogeneities, and nightside\nthermal emission. After introducing TRIDENT's linear algebra-based approach to\n3D radiative transfer, we propose new parametric prescriptions for 3D\ntemperature and abundance profiles and 3D clouds.

Tides gradually peel off stars and dark matter\nfrom a subhalo, trimming it down according to their initial binding energy.\nThis process strips preferentially particles with long orbital times, and comes\nto an end when the remaining bound particles have crossing times shorter than a\nfraction of the orbital time at pericentre. The properties of the final stellar\nremnant thus depend on the energy distribution of stars in the progenitor\nsubhalo, which in turn depends on the initial density profile and radial\nsegregation of the initial stellar component. The stellar component may\nactually be completely dispersed if its energy distribution does not extend all\nthe way to the subhalo potential minimum, although a bound dark remnant may\nremain. These results imply that 'tidally-limited' galaxies, defined as systems\nwhose stellar components have undergone substantial tidal mass loss, neither\nconverge to a unique structure nor follow a single tidal track, as claimed in\nearlier work.

Furthermore, recent years have witnessed an exponential\ngrowth of the model scale--from Google's 2016 model with 1 billion parameters\nto the latest Facebook's model with 12 trillion parameters. Significant quality\nboost has come with each jump of the model capacity, which makes us believe the\nera of 100 trillion parameters is around the corner. However, the training of\nsuch models is challenging even within industrial scale data centers. This\ndifficulty is inherited from the staggering heterogeneity of the training\ncomputation--the model's embedding layer could include more than 99.99% of the\ntotal model size, which is extremely memory-intensive; while the rest neural\nnetwork is increasingly computation-intensive. To support the training of such\nhuge models, an efficient distributed training system is in urgent need. In\nthis paper, we resolve this challenge by careful co-design of both the\noptimization algorithm and the distributed system architecture. Specifically,\nin order to ensure both the training efficiency and the training accuracy, we\ndesign a novel hybrid training algorithm, where the embedding layer and the\ndense neural network are handled by different synchronization mechanisms; then\nwe build a system called Persia (short for parallel recommendation training\nsystem with hybrid acceleration) to support this hybrid training algorithm.\nBoth theoretical demonstration and empirical study up to 100 trillion\nparameters have conducted to justified the system design and implementation of\nPersia.

This generalisation unveils\nmany new phenomena, including an ADE classification when the Jacobi ring has\ndimension zero and, by suitably taking limits, a further ADE classification in\ndimension one. These are natural generalisations of the simple singularities\nand those with infinite multiplicity in Arnold's classification. We obtain\nnormal forms away from some exceptional Type E cases. Remarkably these normal\nforms have no moduli, and the key new feature is that the noncommutative world\naffords larger families, and there are many more examples of each type.\n  The first application of noncommutative singularity theory is to the\nbirational geometry of 3-folds. We prove that all local normal forms of Type A\nand D are geometric, in the sense that each one gives rise to the contraction\nalgebra of some smooth 3-fold flop or divisor-to-curve contraction.

In the process,\nwe describe the first and conjecturally only infinite family of length two\ncrepant divisor-to-curve contractions.

On the other hand, if $G$\nis weakly $d$-degenerate, then $\\chi(G) \\leq d + 1$ (and, moreover, the same\nbound holds for the list-chromatic and even the DP-chromatic number of $G$). It\nturns out that several upper bounds in graph coloring theory can be phrased in\nterms of weak degeneracy. For example, we show that planar graphs are weakly\n$4$-degenerate, which implies Thomassen's famous theorem that planar graphs are\n$5$-list-colorable. We also prove a version of Brooks's theorem for weak\ndegeneracy: a connected graph $G$ of maximum degree $d \\geq 3$ is weakly\n$(d-1)$-degenerate unless $G \\cong K_{d + 1}$. (By contrast, all $d$-regular\ngraphs have degeneracy $d$.) We actually prove an even stronger result, namely\nthat for every $d \\geq 3$, there is $\\epsilon > 0$ such that if $G$ is a graph\nof weak degeneracy at least $d$, then either $G$ contains a $(d+1)$-clique or\nthe maximum average degree of $G$ is at least $d + \\epsilon$. Finally, we show\nthat graphs of maximum degree $d$ and either of girth at least $5$ or of\nbounded chromatic number are weakly $(d - \\Omega(\\sqrt{d}))$-degenerate, which\nis best possible up to the value of the implied constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 20:04:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 00:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

We study in detail, a system that\nconsists of a one-dimensional charge conserving spin-singlet superconductor\ncoupled to a boundary magnetic impurity. Our main finding is that quantum\nfluctuations lead to the destruction of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) intra-gap\nbound-states in all but a narrow region of the phase diagram. We carry out our\nanalysis in three stages, increasing the role of the quantum fluctuations at\neach stage. First we consider the limit of a classical impurity and study the\nbulk semiclassically, finding YSR states throughout the phase diagram, a\nsituation similar to conventional BCS superconductors. In the second stage, we\nreintroduce quantum fluctuations in the bulk and find that the YSR state is\nsuppressed over half of the phase diagram, existing only around the quantum\ncritical point separating the unscreened and the partially screened phases. In\nthe final stage we solve exactly the full interacting model with arbitrary\ncoupling constants using Bethe Ansatz. We find that including both the quantum\nfluctuating bulk and quantum impurity destabilizes the YSR state over most of\nthe phase diagram allowing it to exist only in a small region, the YSR regime,\nbetween a Kondo-screened and an unscreened regime. Within the YSR regime a\nfirst order phase transition occurs between a spin singlet and doublet ground\nstate. We also find that for large enough impurity spin exchange interaction a\nrenormalized Kondo-screened regime is established. In this regime, not found\nfor BCS superconductors, there is no YSR state and a renormalized Kondo\ntemperature scale is generated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 20:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

Interleaved Dyck reachability (denoted\n$D_k\\odot D_k$) uses two Dyck languages for increased precision (e.g., context\nand field sensitivity) but is well-known to be undecidable. As many static\nanalyses yield a certain type of bidirected graphs, they give rise to\ninterleaved bidirected Dyck reachability problems. Although these problems have\nseen numerous applications, their decidability and complexity has largely\nremained open. In a recent work, Li et al. made the first steps in this\ndirection, showing that (i) $D_1\\odot D_1$ reachability (i.e., when both Dyck\nlanguages are over a single parenthesis and act as counters) is computable in\n$O(n^7)$ time, while (ii) $D_k\\odot D_k$ reachability is NP-hard.\n  In this work we address the decidability and complexity of all variants of\ninterleaved bidirected Dyck reachability. First, we show that $D_1\\odot D_1$\nreachability can be computed in $O(n^3\\cdot \\alpha(n))$ time, significantly\nimproving over the existing $O(n^7)$ bound. Second, we show that $D_k\\odot D_1$\nreachability (i.e., when one language acts as a counter) is decidable, in\ncontrast to the non-bidirected case where decidability is open. We further\nconsider $D_k\\odot D_1$ reachability where the counter remains linearly\nbounded.

High efficiency filtering is achieved through spectroscopic\ncommon-mode rejection within and across receivers, resulting in nearly\nuncorrelated white noise within single-frequency channels.

Especially during\nlogic synthesis, predicting cell congestion due to improper logic combination\ncan reduce the burden of subsequent physical implementations. There have been\nattempts using Graph Neural Network (GNN) techniques to tackle congestion\nprediction during the logic synthesis stage. However, they require informative\ncell features to achieve reasonable performance since the core idea of GNNs is\nbuilt on the message passing framework, which would be impractical at the early\nlogic synthesis stage.

However, the brittleness\nof DL models to noisy and out-of-distribution inputs is ailing their deployment\nin the clinic. Most models produce point estimates without further information\nabout model uncertainty or confidence. This paper introduces a new Bayesian DL\nframework for uncertainty quantification in segmentation neural networks:\nSUPER-Net: trustworthy medical image Segmentation with Uncertainty Propagation\nin Encoder-decodeR Networks. SUPER-Net analytically propagates, using Taylor\nseries approximations, the first two moments (mean and covariance) of the\nposterior distribution of the model parameters across the nonlinear layers. In\nparticular, SUPER-Net simultaneously learns the mean and covariance without\nexpensive post-hoc Monte Carlo sampling or model ensembling. The output\nconsists of two simultaneous maps: the segmented image and its pixelwise\nuncertainty map, which corresponds to the covariance matrix of the predictive\ndistribution. We conduct an extensive evaluation of SUPER-Net on medical image\nsegmentation of Magnetic Resonances Imaging and Computed Tomography scans under\nvarious noisy and adversarial conditions. Our experiments on multiple benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that SUPER-Net is more robust to noise and adversarial\nattacks than state-of-the-art segmentation models. Moreover, the uncertainty\nmap of the proposed SUPER-Net associates low confidence (or equivalently high\nuncertainty) to patches in the test input images that are corrupted with noise,\nartifacts, or adversarial attacks. Perhaps more importantly, the model exhibits\nthe ability of self-assessment of its segmentation decisions, notably when\nmaking erroneous predictions due to noise or adversarial examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 22:46:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 15:49:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2023 17:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

The aim is to build a machine learning model for\npredicting the normalized average traffic speed and flow of the subregions of\nmultiple large-scale cities using historical data points. The model is supposed\nto be generic, in a way that it can be applied to new cities. By considering\nspatiotemporal feature learning and modeling efficiency, we explore 3DResNet\nand Sparse-UNet approaches for the tasks in this competition. The 3DResNet\nbased models use 3D convolution to learn the spatiotemporal features and apply\nsequential convolutional layers to enhance the temporal relationship of the\noutputs. The Sparse-UNet model uses sparse convolutions as the backbone for\nspatiotemporal feature learning. Since the latter algorithm mainly focuses on\nnon-zero data points of the inputs, it dramatically reduces the computation\ntime, while maintaining a competitive accuracy.

One of our sample, PUDG\\_R24, appears to be undergoing\nquenching and is expected to fade into the UDG regime within the next $\\sim0.5$\nGyr. We target this sample with Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) spectroscopy to\ninvestigate differences in their dark matter halos, as expected from their\ndiffering GC content. Our spectroscopy measures both recessional velocities,\nconfirming Perseus cluster membership, and stellar velocity dispersions, to\nmeasure dynamical masses within their half-light radius. We supplement our data\nwith that from the literature to examine trends in galaxy parameters with GC\nsystem richness. We do not find the correlation between GC numbers and UDG\nphase space positioning expected if GC-rich UDGs environmentally quench at high\nredshift. We do find GC-rich UDGs to have higher velocity dispersions than\nGC-poor UDGs on average, resulting in greater dynamical mass within the\nhalf-light radius. This agrees with the first order expectation that GC-rich\nUDGs have higher halo masses than GC-poor UDGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 01:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

For such systems the sparsity of the\neffective delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel is adversely affected in the\npresence of channel path delay and Doppler shifts which are non-integer\nmultiples of the delay and Doppler domain resolution. The sparsity is also\nadversely affected when practical transmit and receive pulses are used. In this\npaper we propose a Modified Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimation (M-MLE)\nmethod for OTFS based systems which exploits the fine delay and Doppler domain\nresolution of the OTFS modulated signal to decouple the joint estimation of the\nchannel parameters (i.e., channel gain, delay and Doppler shift) of all channel\npaths into separate estimation of the channel parameters for each path. We\nfurther observe that with fine delay and Doppler domain resolution, the\nreceived DD domain signal along a particular channel path can be written as a\nproduct of a delay domain term and a Doppler domain term where the delay domain\nterm is primarily dependent on the delay of this path and the Doppler domain\nterm is primarily dependent on the Doppler shift of this path. This allows us\nto propose another method termed as the two-step method (TSE), where the joint\ntwo-dimensional estimation of the delay and Doppler shift of a particular path\nin the M-MLE method is further decoupled into two separate one-dimensional\nestimation for the delay and for the Doppler shift of that path.

A major issue inherent to sequential learning,\nhowever, is catastrophic forgetting, i.e., a substantial drop in accuracy on\nprior tasks when a model is updated for a new task. Elastic Weight\nConsolidation is a recently proposed method to address this issue, but scaling\nthis approach to the modern large models used in practice requires making\nstrong independence assumptions about model parameters, limiting its\neffectiveness.

To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet powerful probabilistic\ncontrastive learning (PCL) in this paper, which not only produces compact\nfeatures but also enforces them to be distributed around the class weights.\nSpecifically, we break the traditional contrastive learning paradigm\n(feature+$\\ell_{2}$ normalization) by replacing the features with probabilities\nand removing $\\ell_{2}$ normalization.

There have been extensive\nstudies on the statistical and computational approaches to identify (i) whether\na peptide is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) or a non-AMP and (ii) which targets\nare these sequences effective to (Gram-positive, Gram-negative, etc.). Despite\nthe existing deep learning methods on this problem, most of them are unable to\nhandle the small AMP classes (anti-insect, anti-parasite, etc.). And more\nimportantly, some AMPs can have multiple targets, which the previous methods\nfail to consider. In this study, we build a diverse and comprehensive\nmulti-label protein sequence database by collecting and cleaning amino acids\nfrom various AMP databases. To generate efficient representations and features\nfor the small classes dataset, we take advantage of a protein language model\ntrained on 250 million protein sequences. Based on that, we develop an\nend-to-end hierarchical multi-label deep forest framework, HMD-AMP, to annotate\nAMP comprehensively. After identifying an AMP, it further predicts what targets\nthe AMP can effectively kill from eleven available classes. Extensive\nexperiments suggest that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art models in\nboth the binary classification task and the multi-label classification task,\nespecially on the minor classes.The model is robust against reduced features\nand small perturbations and produces promising results. We believe HMD-AMP\ncontributes to both the future wet-lab investigations of the innate structural\nproperties of different antimicrobial peptides and build promising empirical\nunderpinnings for precise medicine with antibiotics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 02:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-12"}

No statistically significant periodic signal is\nfound with either method on any of the four epochs.

Here we present a first statistical study of flaring\n(highlighted by flare-ribbons) vector magnetic fields in the photosphere. Our\nsystematic approach allows us to describe key physical properties of solar\nflare magnetism, including distributions of magnetic flux, magnetic shear,\nvertical current and net current over flaring versus non-flaring parts of the\nactive region, and compare these with flare/CME properties. Our analysis\nsuggests that while flares are guided by the physical properties that scale\nwith AR size, like the total amount of magnetic flux that participates in the\nreconnection process and the total current (extensive properties), CMEs are\nguided by mean properties, like the fraction of the AR magnetic flux that\nparticipates (intensive property), with little dependence on the amount of\nshear at polarity inversion line (PIL) or the net current. We find that the\nnon-neutralized current is proportional to the amount of shear at PIL,\nproviding direct evidence that net vertical currents are formed as a result of\nany mechanism that could generate magnetic shear along PIL. We also find that\neruptive events tend to have smaller PIL fluxes and larger magnetic shears than\nconfined events.

One of the reasons\nattributed to this strengthening behaviour is the force exerted by the TBs on\ndislocations. Since the TBs exert repulsive force on dislocations and the\nplasticity in nanopillars is surface controlled, it is interesting to know\nwhether the TB position from the nanowire surface has any effect on the\nstrength of twinned nanopillars.

In this paper, we\ndevelop a holistic framework of indicators, called Socially-Aware Evaluation\nFramework for Transportation (SAEF), that will assist in understanding how\ntraffic routing and the resultant traffic dynamics impact city metrics, with\nthe intent of avoiding unintended consequences and adhering to city objectives.\nSAEF is a holistic decision framework formed as an assembled set of city\nperformance indicators grounded in the literature. The selected indicators can\nbe evaluated for cities of various sizes and at the urban scale. The SAEF\nframework is presented for four Bay Area cities, for which we compare three\ndifferent routing strategies. Our intent with this work is to provide an\nevaluation framework that enables reflection on the consequence of policies,\ntraffic management strategies and network changes. With an ability to model out\nproposed traffic management strategies, the policymaker can consider the\ntrade-offs and potential unintended consequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 05:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

However, the characterization of\nlow-jitter dual-comb systems is challenging because it requires measurement\ntechniques with high sensitivity. Motivated by this challenge, we developed a\ntechnique based on an optical heterodyne detection approach for measuring the\nrelative timing jitter of two pulse trains. The method is suitable for\ndual-comb systems with essentially any repetition rate difference. Furthermore,\nthe proposed approach allows for continuous and precise tracking of the\nsampling rate. To demonstrate the technique, we perform a detailed\ncharacterization of a single-mode-diode pumped $\\mathrm{Yb:CaF_2}$ dual-comb\nlaser from a free-running polarization-multiplexed cavity. This new laser\nproduces 115 fs pulses at 160 MHz repetition rate, with 130 mW of average power\nin each comb.

This\nperformance indicates that the demonstrated laser is highly compatible with\npractical dual-comb spectroscopy, ranging, and sampling applications.\nFurthermore, our results show that the relative timing noise measurement\ntechnique can characterize dual-comb systems operating in free-running mode or\nwith finite repetition rate differences while providing a sub-attosecond\nresolution, which was not feasible with any other approach before.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 07:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 12:41:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 17:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

However, due\nto ISM absorption, we typically only observe the transit signature in the\nblue-wing, making them challenging to interpret. This challenge has been\nrecently highlighted by non-detections from planets thought to be undergoing\nvigorous escape. Pioneering 3D simulations have shown that escaping hydrogen is\nshaped into a cometary tail receding from the planet. Motivated by this work,\nwe develop a simple model to interpret Lyman-$\\alpha$ transits. Using this\nframework, we show that the Lyman-$\\alpha$ transit depth is primarily\ncontrolled by the properties of the stellar tidal field rather than details of\nthe escape process. Instead, the transit duration provides a direct measurement\nof the velocity of the planetary outflow. This result arises because the\nunderlying physics is the distance a neutral hydrogen atom can travel before it\nis photoionized in the outflow. Thus, higher irradiation levels, expected to\ndrive more powerful outflows, produce weaker, shorter Lyman-$\\alpha$ transits\nbecause the outflowing gas is ionized more quickly. Our framework suggests that\nthe generation of energetic neutral atoms may dominate the transit signature\nearly, but the acceleration of planetary material produces long tails. Thus,\nLyman-$\\alpha$ transits do not primarily probe the mass-loss rates. Instead,\nthey inform us about the velocity at which the escape mechanism is ejecting\nmaterial from the planet, providing a clean test of predictions from\natmospheric escape models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 08:09:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 10:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Despite the large sizes, existing KGs are far from\ncomplete and comprehensive. In order to continuously enrich KGs, automatic\nknowledge construction and update mechanisms are usually utilized, which\ninevitably bring in plenty of noise. However, most existing knowledge graph\nembedding (KGE) methods assume that all the triple facts in KGs are correct,\nand project both entities and relations into a low-dimensional space without\nconsidering noise and knowledge conflicts. This will lead to low-quality and\nunreliable representations of KGs. To this end, in this paper, we propose a\ngeneral multi-task reinforcement learning framework, which can greatly\nalleviate the noisy data problem. In our framework, we exploit reinforcement\nlearning for choosing high-quality knowledge triples while filtering out the\nnoisy ones. Also, in order to take full advantage of the correlations among\nsemantically similar relations, the triple selection processes of similar\nrelations are trained in a collective way with multi-task learning.

IRSA is a\ncompletely distributed multiple access protocol: in any given frame, a small\nsubset of the users, i.e., the active users, transmit replicas of their packet\nin randomly selected resource elements (REs). The first step in the decoding\nprocess at the BS is to detect which users are active in each frame. To this\nend, a novel Bayesian user activity detection (UAD) algorithm is developed,\nwhich exploits both the sparsity in user activity as well as the underlying\nstructure of IRSA-based transmissions. Next, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) on the\nmean squared error in channel estimation is derived. It is empirically shown\nthat the channel estimates obtained as a by-product of the proposed UAD\nalgorithm achieves the CRB. Then, the signal to interference plus noise ratio\nachieved by the users is analyzed, accounting for UAD, channel estimation\nerrors, and pilot contamination. The impact of these non-idealities on the\nthroughput of IRSA is illustrated via Monte Carlo simulations. For example, in\na system with 1500 users and 10% of the users being active per frame, a pilot\nlength of as low as 20 symbols is sufficient for accurate user activity\ndetection. In contrast, using classical compressed sensing approaches for UAD\nwould require a pilot length of about 346 symbols.

The deterministic transform is relatively easy to reconcile with\nthe local information (gradient etc.) of the target distribution. However, as\nthe ergodic theory suggests, these deterministic proposal methods seem to be\nincompatible with robustness and lead to poor convergence, especially in the\ncase of target distributions with heavy tails. On the other hand, the Markov\nkernel using the Haar measure is relatively robust since it learns global\ninformation about the target distribution introducing global parameters.\nHowever, it requires a density preserving condition, and many deterministic\nproposals break this condition. In this paper, we carefully select\ndeterministic transforms that preserve the structure and create a Markov\nkernel, the Weave-Metropolis kernel, using the deterministic transforms. By\ncombining with the Haar measure, we also introduce the Haar-Weave-Metropolis\nkernel. In this way, the Markov kernel can employ the local information of the\ntarget distribution using the deterministic proposal, and thanks to the Haar\nmeasure, it can employ the global information of the target distribution.\nFinally, we show through numerical experiments that the performance of the\nproposed method is superior to other methods in terms of effective sample size\nand mean square jump distance per second.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 11:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-12"}

In fact, for low levels of disorder,\na RSB solution with staggered magnetization (mixed phase) emerges from the\nmaximum frustration region.

A natural way\nfor dealing with these problems is to extend the nonlinear optimization problem\nas the one optimizing the objective function over the set of points with the\nleast constraint violation. This leads to the study of the shifted problem.\nThis paper focuses on the constrained convex optimization problem. The\nsufficient condition for the closedness of the set of feasible shifts is\npresented and the continuity properties of the optimal value function and the\nsolution mapping for the shifted problem are studied. Properties of the\nconjugate dual of the shifted problem are discussed through the relations\nbetween the dual function and the optimal value function. The solvability of\nthe dual of the optimization problem with the least constraint violation is\ninvestigated. It is shown that, if the least violated shift is in the domain of\nthe subdifferential of the optimal value function, then this dual problem has\nan unbounded solution set. Under this condition, the optimality conditions for\nthe problem with the least constraint violation are established in term of the\naugmented Lagrangian. It is shown that the augmented Lagrangian method has the\nproperties that the sequence of shifts converges to the least violated shift\nand the sequence of multipliers is unbounded. Moreover, it is proved that the\naugmented Lagrangian method is able to find an approximate solution to the\nproblem with the least constraint violation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 13:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-12"}

The novelty of the model is that the\ninfectivity of an infected individual is infection age dependent.

Building on the 2013\ndiscovery investigation, we combine an extensive spectropolarimetric (Stokes\n$V$) dataset with archival photometry and spectropolarimetry to establish the\nessential characteristics of the magnetic field and magnetosphere of the\nrapidly rotating, broad-line component of the system. We apply Least-Squares\nDeconvolution (LSD) to infer the longitudinal magnetic field from each Stokes\n$V$ spectrum. Using the timeseries of longitudinal field measurements, in\ncombination with CoRoT photometry and equivalent width measurements of\nmagnetospheric spectral lines, we infer the rotation period of the magnetic\nstar to be equal to $1.21551^{+0.00028}_{-0.00034}$ d.

We find a magnetic field that is predominantly\ndipolar, but with an important quadrupolar component, and weak higher order\ncomponents. The dipolar component has an obliquity near 90 deg and a polar\nstrength of about 850 G, while the average field strength over the entire\nsurface is 520 G. We update the calculations of the theoretical magnetospheric\nparameters, and in agreement with their predictions we identify clear\nvariability signatures of the H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$, and He II $\\lambda 4686$\nlines confirming the presence of a dense centrifugal magnetosphere surrounding\nthe star.

In other words, the AI system\nsurpasses the level of a strong human expert player in such games. In this\ncontext, it is difficult for a human player to enjoy playing the games with the\nAI. To keep human players entertained and immersed in a game, the AI is\nrequired to dynamically balance its skill with that of the human player. To\naddress this issue, we propose AlphaDDA, an AlphaZero-based AI with dynamic\ndifficulty adjustment (DDA).

Consequently, AlphaDDA adjusts its skills according to a game\nstate. AlphaDDA can adjust its skill using only the state of a game without any\nprior knowledge regarding an opponent. In this study, AlphaDDA plays Connect4,\nOthello, and 6x6 Othello with other AI agents. Other AI agents are AlphaZero,\nMonte Carlo tree search, the minimax algorithm, and a random player.

These games\nare modelled by finite directed graphs (digraphs) $G$ which may have directed\ncycles and, hence, infinite plays. Yet, it is assumed that all these plays are\nequivalent and form a single outcome $c$, while the terminal vertices $V_T =\n\\{a_1, \\ldots, a_p\\}$ form $p$ remaining outcomes. We study the existence of\nNash equilibria (NE) in pure stationary strategies. It is known that NE exist\nwhen $n=2$ and may fail to exist when $n > 2$. Yet, the question becomes open\nfor $n > 2$ under the following extra condition: (C) For each of $n$ players,\n$c$ is worse than each of $p$ terminal outcomes. In other words, all players\nare interested in terminating the play, which is a natural assumption.\nMoreover, Nash-solvability remains open even if we replace (C) by a weaker\ncondition: (C22) There exist no two players for whom $c$ is better than (at\nleast) two terminal outcomes. We conjecture that such two players exist in each\nNE-free DG game, or in other words, that (C22) implies Nash-solvability, for\nall $n$.

EEG-based computer-aided diagnosis of epilepsy can\ngreatly improve the ac-curacy of epilepsy detection while reducing the workload\nof physicians. However, there are many challenges in practical applications for\npersonalized epileptic EEG detection (i.e., training of detection model for a\nspecific person), including the difficulty in extracting effective features\nfrom one single view, the undesirable but common scenario of lacking sufficient\ntraining data in practice, and the no guarantee of identically distributed\ntraining and test data. To solve these problems, we propose a TSK fuzzy\nsystem-based epilepsy detection algorithm that integrates multi-view\ncollaborative transfer learning. To address the challenge due to the limitation\nof single-view features, multi-view learning ensures the diversity of features\nby extracting them from different views. The lack of training data for building\na personalized detection model is tackled by leveraging the knowledge from the\nsource domain (reference scene) to enhance the performance of the target domain\n(current scene of interest), where mismatch of data distributions between the\ntwo domains is resolved with adaption technique based on maximum mean\ndiscrepancy. Notably, the transfer learning and multi-view feature extraction\nare performed at the same time. Furthermore, the fuzzy rules of the TSK fuzzy\nsystem equip the model with strong fuzzy logic inference capability. Hence, the\nproposed method has the potential to detect epileptic EEG signals effectively,\nwhich is demonstrated with the positive results from a large number of\nexperiments on the CHB-MIT dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 12:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Specifically, the degree of platelet activation is influenced by the\nlevel and type of mechanical stresses in the blood flow. Here we analyze the\nblood flow in the left ventricle of the heart through a computational model\nconstructed from patient-specific data. The blood flow in the ventricle is\nmodeled by the Navier-Stokes equations, and the flow through the mitral valve\nby a parameterized model which represents the projected opening of the valve. A\nfinite element method is used to solve the equations, from which a simulation\nof the velocity and pressure of the blood flow is constructed. A triple\ndecomposition of the velocity gradient tensor is then used to distinguish\nbetween rigid body rotational flow, irrotational straining flow, and shear\nflow. The triple decomposition enables the separation of three fundamentally\ndifferent flow structures, each generating a distinct type of mechanical\nstimulus on the blood cells in the flow. We compare the results to simulations\nwhere a mitral valve clip intervention is modelled, which leads to a\nsignificant modification of the ventricular flow. It was found that the shear\nin the simulation cases treated with clips increased more compared to the\nuntreated case than the rotation and strain did. A decrease in valve opening\narea of 64 % in one of the cases led to a 90 % increase in rotation and strain,\nbut a 150 % increase in shear. The computational analysis suggests a process\nfor patient-specific simulation of clinical interventions in the heart with a\ndetailed analysis of the resulting blood flow, which could support clinical\nrisk assessment with respect to platelet activation and thrombosis events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 14:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}
