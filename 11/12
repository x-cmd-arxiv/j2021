Specifically, alloys of 2D TMDs have\nbroad potential applications owing to their composition-controlled properties.\nSeveral important challenges remain regarding controllable and scalable\nfabrication of these alloys, such as achieving control over their atomic\nordering (i.e. clustering or random mixing of the transition metal atoms within\nthe 2D layers). In this work, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is used to\nsynthesize the TMD alloy Mo$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$S$_{2}$ with excellent composition\ncontrol along the complete composition range 0 $\\leq$ x $\\leq$ 1. Importantly,\nthis composition control allows us to control the atomic ordering of the alloy\nfrom well-mixed to clustered while keeping the alloy composition fixed, as is\nconfirmed directly through atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM imaging. The control\nover atomic ordering leads to tuning of the bandgap, as is demonstrated using\noptical transmission spectroscopy. The relation between this tuning of the\nelectronic structure and the atomic ordering of the alloy was further confirmed\nthrough ab-initio calculations. Furthermore, as the atomic ordering modulates\nfrom clustered to well-mixed, the typical MoS$_{2}$ and WS$_{2}$ A$_{1g}$\nvibrational modes converge. Our results demonstrate that atomic ordering is an\nimportant parameter that can be tuned experimentally to finely tune the\nfundamental properties of 2D TMD alloys for specific applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 16:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-12"}

This problem has been extensively studied in the static/offline\nsetting. In this paper we initiate its study in the fully-dynamic setting with\nrecourse: the algorithm sees a stream of T insertions and deletions of vectors,\nand at each time must maintain a low-discrepancy signing, while also minimizing\nthe amortized recourse (the number of times any vector changes its sign) per\nupdate.\n  For general vectors, we show algorithms which almost match Spencer's\n$O(\\sqrt{n})$ offline discrepancy bound, with ${O}(n\\cdot poly\\!\\log T)$\namortized recourse per update. The crucial idea is to compute a basic feasible\nsolution to the linear relaxation in a distributed and recursive manner, which\nhelps find a low-discrepancy signing. To bound recourse we argue that only a\nsmall part of the instance needs to be re-computed at each update.\n  Since vector balancing has also been greatly studied for sparse vectors, we\nthen give algorithms for low-discrepancy edge orientation, where we dynamically\nmaintain signings for 2-sparse vectors. Alternatively, this can be seen as\norienting a dynamic set of edges of an n-vertex graph to minimize the absolute\ndifference between in- and out-degrees at any vertex. We present a\ndeterministic algorithm with $O(poly\\!\\log n)$ discrepancy and $O(poly\\!\\log\nn)$ amortized recourse. The core ideas are to dynamically maintain an\nexpander-decomposition with low recourse and then to show that, as the\nexpanders change over time, a natural local-search algorithm converges quickly\n(i.e., with low recourse) to a low-discrepancy solution. We also give strong\nlower bounds for local-search discrepancy minimization algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 16:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-12"}

A set of\nergonomic indexes is defined to account for multiple potential contributors to\nWMSDs, also giving importance to the subject-specific requirements of the\nworkers. To evaluate the proposed framework, a thorough experimental analysis\nwas conducted on twelve human subjects considering tasks that represent typical\nworking activities in the manufacturing sector. For each task, the ergonomic\nindexes that better explain the underlying physical load were identified,\nfollowing a statistical analysis, and supported by the outcome of a surface\nelectromyography (sEMG) analysis. A comparison was also made with a\nwell-recognised and standard tool to evaluate human ergonomics in the\nworkplace, to highlight the benefits introduced by the proposed framework.\nResults demonstrate the high potential of the proposed framework in identifying\nthe physical risk factors, and therefore to adopt preventive measures.

Their\nconstant stepsize variants are preferred in practice due to fast convergence\nbehavior. However, constant step stochastic iterative algorithms do not\nconverge asymptotically to the optimal solution, but instead have a stationary\ndistribution, which in general cannot be analytically characterized. In this\nwork, we study the asymptotic behavior of the appropriately scaled stationary\ndistribution, in the limit when the constant stepsize goes to zero.\nSpecifically, we consider the following three settings: (1) SGD algorithms with\nsmooth and strongly convex objective, (2) linear SA algorithms involving a\nHurwitz matrix, and (3) nonlinear SA algorithms involving a contractive\noperator. When the iterate is scaled by $1/\\sqrt{\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha$ is\nthe constant stepsize, we show that the limiting scaled stationary distribution\nis a solution of an integral equation. Under a uniqueness assumption (which can\nbe removed in certain settings) on this equation, we further characterize the\nlimiting distribution as a Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix is the\nunique solution of a suitable Lyapunov equation. For SA algorithms beyond these\ncases, our numerical experiments suggest that unlike central limit theorem type\nresults: (1) the scaling factor need not be $1/\\sqrt{\\alpha}$, and (2) the\nlimiting distribution need not be Gaussian. Based on the numerical study, we\ncome up with a formula to determine the right scaling factor, and make\ninsightful connection to the Euler-Maruyama discretization scheme for\napproximating stochastic differential equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 17:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-12"}

Second, the graph representation model\n(GRM) is adopted to unify and construct the features of dynamic vehicles,\ninter-vehicle interactions and static traffic markings in real driving scenes\ninto graphs. The driver-specific risk label provides ground truth to capture\nthe risk evaluation criteria of different drivers. In addition, the graph model\nrepresents multiple features of the driving scenes. Therefore, the proposed\nframework can learn the risk-evaluating pattern of driving scenes of different\ndrivers and establish driver-specific risk identifiers. Last, the performance\nof the proposed framework is evaluated via experiments conducted using\nreal-world urban driving datasets collected by multiple drivers. The results\nshow that the risks and their levels in real driving environments can be\naccurately recognized by the proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 17:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-12"}

Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random\npatches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on\ntwo core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture,\nwith an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without\nmask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original\nimage from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that\nmasking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial\nand meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to\ntrain large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3x\nor more) and improve accuracy.

By training the model to minimize view synthesis\nerrors based on segment flow, our appearance and motion pathways learn region\nsegmentation and flow estimation automatically without building them up from\nlow-level edges or optical flows respectively. Our model demonstrates the\nsurprising emergence of objectness in the appearance pathway, surpassing prior\nworks on zero-shot object segmentation from an image, moving object\nsegmentation from a video with unsupervised test-time adaptation, and semantic\nimage segmentation by supervised fine-tuning. Our work is the first truly\nend-to-end zero-shot object segmentation from videos. It not only develops\ngeneric objectness for segmentation and tracking, but also outperforms\nprevalent image-based contrastive learning methods without augmentation\nengineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 18:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-12"}

This abundance and variety of vaccines created a\nhistorical moment to understand vaccine hesitancy better. Never before were\nmore types of vaccines available for an illness and the intensity of\nvaccine-related public discourse is unprecedented. Yet, the heterogeneity of\nhesitancy by vaccine types has been neglected so far, even though factual or\nbelieved vaccine characteristics and patient attributes are known to influence\nacceptance. We address this problem by analysing acceptance and assessment of\nfive vaccine types using information collected with a nationally representative\nsurvey at the end of the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary, where\na unique portfolio of vaccines were available to the public in large\nquantities. Our special case enables us to quantify revealed preferences across\nvaccine types since one could evaluate a vaccine unacceptable and even could\nreject an assigned vaccine to wait for another type. We find that the source of\ninformation that respondents trust characterizes their attitudes towards\nvaccine types differently and leads to divergent vaccine hesitancy. Believers\nof conspiracy theories were significantly more likely to evaluate the mRNA\nvaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) unacceptable while those who follow the advice of\npoliticians evaluate vector-based (AstraZeneca and Sputnik) or whole-virus\nvaccines (Sinopharm) acceptable with higher likelihood. We illustrate that the\nrejection of non-desired and re-selection of preferred vaccines fragments the\npopulation by the mRNA versus other type of vaccines while it generally\nimproves the assessment of the received vaccine. These results highlight that\ngreater variance of available vaccine types and individual free choice are\ndesirable conditions that can widen the acceptance of vaccines in societies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 21:05:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 10:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Alone, these software approaches help to\nmaximize the use of available hardware but cannot overcome the inherent\nlimitations posed by the underlying technology. An alternative approach is to\nexplore the use of new, though potentially less developed, technology as a path\ntowards scalability.

NA systems offer several promising\nadvantages such as long range interactions and native multiqubit gates which\nreduce communication overhead, overall gate count, and depth for compiled\nprograms. Long range interactions, however, impede parallelism with restriction\nzones surrounding interacting qubit pairs. We extend current compiler methods\nto maximize the benefit of these advantages and minimize the cost. Furthermore,\natoms in an NA device have the possibility to randomly be lost over the course\nof program execution which is extremely detrimental to total program execution\ntime as atom arrays are slow to load.

Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and\nMUSE integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy, we find the SN environment\ncontains three episodes of star formation; the low ejecta mass suggests the SN\nprogenitor is most likely from the oldest population, corresponding to an\ninitial mass of 10.4$^{+1.5}_{-1.3}$ $M_\\odot$. The pre-explosion SED can be\nreproduced by two components, one for the hot and compact SN progenitor and one\nfor a cool and inflated yellow hypergiant (YHG) companion that dominates the\nbrightness. Thus, SN 2019yvr could possibly be the first Type Ib/c SN for which\nthe progenitor's binary companion is directly detected on pre-explosion images.\nBoth the low progenitor mass and the YHG companion suggest significant binary\ninteraction during their evolution.

In this first paper, we present bolometric light curves of 74\nSNe~II. We outline our methodology to calculate the bolometric luminosity,\nwhich consists of the integration of the observed fluxes in numerous\nphotometric bands ($uBgVriYJH$) and black-body (BB) extrapolations to account\nfor the unobserved flux at shorter and longer wavelengths. BB fits were\nperformed using all available broadband data except when line blanketing\neffects appeared. Photometric bands bluer than $r$ that are affected by line\nblanketing were removed from the fit, which makes near-infrared (NIR)\nobservations highly important to estimate reliable BB extrapolations to the\ninfrared. BB fits without NIR data produce notably different bolometric light\ncurves, and therefore different estimates of SN~II progenitor and explosion\nproperties when data are modelled. We present two methods to address the\nabsence of NIR observations: (a) colour-colour relationships from which NIR\nmagnitudes can be estimated using optical colours, and (b) new prescriptions\nfor bolometric corrections as a function of observed SN~II colours. Using our\n74 SN~II bolometric light curves, we provide a full characterisation of their\nproperties based on several observed parameters.

We perform repeated experiments at adverse viscosity ratios from 1\n- 20 and Peclet numbers from 10$^4$ - 10$^6$ capturing the transition from 2D\nto 3D radial fingering and experimental uncertainty. The open-access dataset\nprovides time-lapse images of the fingering patterns, transient effluent\nprofiles, and meta-information for use in model validation. We find the\ncomplexity of the fingering pattern increases with viscosity ratio and Peclet\nnumber, and the onset of fingering is delayed compared to linear displacements,\nlikely due to Taylor dispersion stabilisation. The transition from 2D to 3D\nfingering occurs at a critical Peclet number that is consistent with recent\nexperiments in the literature. 2D numerical simulations with hydrodynamic\ndispersion and different mesh orientations provide good predictions of\nbreakthrough times and sweep efficiency obtained at intermediate Peclet numbers\nacross the range of viscosity ratios tested, generally within the experimental\nuncertainty. Specific finger wavelengths, tip shapes, and growth are hard to\nreplicate; model predictions using velocity dependent longitudinal dispersion\nor simple molecular diffusion bound the fingering evolution seen in the\nexperiments, but neither fully capture both fine-scale and macroscopic\nmeasures. In both cases simulations predict sharper fingers than the\nexperiment. A weaker dispersion stabilisation seems necessary to capture the\nexperimental fingering at high viscosity ratio, which may also require\nanisotropic components. 3D models with varying dispersion formulations should\nbe explored in future developments to capture the full range of effects at high\nviscosity ratio and Peclet number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 03:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-15"}

To improve the spectral properties of the scheme, the authors\nhave previously proposed a scale sensor to automatically adjust the numerical\ndissipation. In consequence, a fourth-order finite difference scheme with\nminimized dispersion and adaptive dissipation (MDAD) has been proposed [1]. In\nthis study, we further investigate this method for the high-fidelity numerical\nsimulation of the acoustic problems and a new dispersion control method is\nproposed which is different from the traditional dispersion relation preserving\n(DRP) approach. Firstly, the scale sensor, which quantifies the local length\nscale of the solution as the effective scaled wavenumber, is modified for\nbetter performance on composite waves. Then the scale sensor is applied to\ncontrol both the dispersion and dissipation of the scheme. The relationships\nbetween the dispersion/dissipation parameter and the effective scaled\nwavenumber are analytically and artificially constructed respectively. Thus, a\nfourth-order finite difference scheme with accurate dispersion and adaptive\ndissipation (ADAD) is constructed. The approximate dispersion relation (ADR)\nshows that the ADAD scheme achieves accurate dispersion property at k < 2.5.\nThe dissipation is negligible at low wave number and gradually increases after\nk = 1 to suppress non-physical oscillations. Several benchmark cases of\ncomputational acoustics are presented to verify the high resolution of the\nproposed scheme compared with the conventional spectral optimized schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 03:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-15"}

The\nbunching mechanism has been mostly discussed within the context of curvature\nradiation or cyclotron/synchrotron radiation. Here we propose a family of model\ninvoking coherent inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of bunched particles that\nmay operate within or just outside of the magnetosphere of a flaring magnetar.\nCrustal oscillations during the flaring event may excite low-frequency\nelectromagnetic waves near the magnetar surface.

Resilience guides the design of the algorithm, the sensitivity\nanalysis, and the success probability analysis of the test step in\nPropose-Test-Release. The key insight is that if we design an exponential\nmechanism that accesses the data only via one-dimensional robust statistics,\nthen the resulting local sensitivity can be dramatically reduced. Using\nresilience, we can provide tight local sensitivity bounds. These tight bounds\nreadily translate into near-optimal utility guarantees in several cases.

The core problems mainly come from two aspects: (1) the\ngraph is unavailable in the most clustering scenes so that how to construct\nhigh-quality graphs on the non-graph data is usually the most important part;\n(2) given n samples, the graph-based clustering methods usually consume at\nleast $\\mathcal O(n^2)$ time to build graphs and the graph convolution requires\nnearly $\\mathcal O(n^2)$ for a dense graph and $\\mathcal O(|\\mathcal{E}|)$ for\na sparse one with $|\\mathcal{E}|$ edges. Accordingly, both graph-based\nclustering and GNNs suffer from the severe inefficiency problem. To tackle\nthese problems, we propose a novel clustering method, AnchorGAE, with the\nself-supervised estimation of graph and efficient graph convolution. We first\nshow how to convert a non-graph dataset into a graph dataset, by introducing\nthe generative graph model and anchors.

Furthermore, the estimated bipartite graph\nis updated dynamically according to the features extracted by GNN, to promote\nthe quality of the graph.

Besides\nthe reference for the direct-path self-interference (SI) signal, the RLS\nalgorithm is used to construct another reference for the residual SI signal\nfrom the direct path and the SI signals from the reflection paths. The proposed\nmethod can solve the performance limitation in the previously reported SIC\nmethods of constructing the multipath SI signal using a single reference caused\nby the limited dynamic range of the digital-to-analog converter when the\ndirect-path SI signal is much stronger than the sub-weak reflection-path SI\nsignals. An experiment is performed. When the carrier frequency of the\nmultipath SI signal is 10 GHz and the direct-path SI signal is much stronger\nthan the sub-weak multipath SI signal, the cancellation depths of about 26.7\nand 26.1 dB are realized with SI baud rates of 0.5 and 1 Gbaud.

To make the CNN applicable in the task of\nthe impact parameter determination at the present energy range, specific\nimprovements are made in the input selection, the CNN construction and the CNN\ntraining. It is demonstrated from the comparisons of the deep CNN method and\nthe conventional methods with the impact parameter-sensitive observables, that\nthe deep CNN method shows better performance for determining the impact\nparameters, especially leading to the capability of providing better\nrecognition of the central collision events. With a proper consideration of the\nexperimental filter effect in both training and testing processes to keep\nconsistency with the actual experiments, the good performance of the deep CNN\nmethod holds, and shows significantly better in terms of predicting the impact\nparameters and recognizing the central collision events, compared to that of\nthe conventional methods, demonstrating the superiority of the present deep CNN\nmethod.

Here, we attempt to formalize information evolution and\nexplain the coexistence of randomness and regularity in complex networks.\nApplying network dynamics and information theory, we discover that a certain\namount of information, determined by the selectivity of networks to the input\ninformation, frequently survives from random distortion. Other information will\ninevitably experience distortion or dissipation, whose speeds are shaped by the\ndiversity of information selectivity in networks.

We formalize the encoding process in the\ncontext of the nonequilibrium second law of thermodynamics, revealing an\nintrinsic difference in information thermodynamics characteristics between\ninformation thermodynamics encoders with and without internal correlations.\nDuring the information encoding process of an external source $\\mathsf{Y}$,\nspecific sub-systems in an encoder $\\mathsf{X}$ with internal correlations can\nexceed the information thermodynamics bound on\n$\\left(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y}\\right)$ and encode more information than system\n$\\mathsf{X}$ works as a whole. We computationally verify this theoretical\nfinding in an Ising model with a random external field and a neural data set of\nthe human brain during visual perception and recognition. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that the stronger internal correlation inside these systems\nimplies a higher possibility for specific sub-systems to encode more\ninformation than the global one. These findings may suggest a new perspective\nin studying information thermodynamics in diverse physical and biological\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 09:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

A\nbelly occurs in the graphic of wave evolution whenever the wave is maximally\ndisplaced in the quadrature space, whereas a node takes place every time the\nwave passes the equilibrium point during its oscillation.

These features are either ionised gas filaments similar to\nthose observed in cooling flows (2 gal), or thin discs with sizes 0.7<R(Ha)<2.0\nkpc (6 gal), thus significantly smaller than those of the stellar disc. These\ndiscs have morphological properties similar to those of the dust seen in\nabsorption in high-resolution HST images.

By comparing the\ndust masses measured from absorption maps in optical images, from the Balmer\ndecrement, or estimated by fitting the UV-to-far-IR spectral energy\ndistribution of the target galaxies, we confirm that those derived from optical\nattenuation maps are heavily underestimated because of geometrical effects due\nto the relative distribution of the absorbing dust and the emitting stars.

The resulting directed acyclic graph has 2 root nodes (Q02 from\navoidant and Q05 from anxious attachment) and 5 end nodes (Q16, Q34, and Q36\nfrom anxious attachment). The network can be divided into 5 clusters, 2\navoidance and 3 anxiety clusters. Furthermore, our list of items in the\nclusters are consistent with the findings of previous factor analysis studies\nand our estimated coefficients are significantly correlated with those of one\npartial correlation network study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 10:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-15"}

In each synchronous slot, each node can\nsend or remain idle. If in a slot one node sends alone, it succeeds; otherwise,\nif multiple nodes send simultaneously, messages collide and none succeeds.\nNodes can differentiate collision and silence only if collision detection is\navailable. Ideally, a contention resolution algorithm should satisfy three\ncriteria: low time complexity (or high throughput); low energy complexity,\nmeaning each node does not make too many broadcast attempts; strong robustness,\nmeaning the algorithm can maintain good performance even if slots can be\njammed. Previous work has shown, with collision detection, there are \"perfect\"\ncontention resolution algorithms satisfying all three criteria. On the other\nhand, without collision detection, it was not until 2020 that an algorithm was\ndiscovered which can achieve optimal time complexity and low energy cost,\nassuming there is no jamming. More recently, the trade-off between throughput\nand robustness was studied. However, an intriguing and important question\nremains unknown: without collision detection, are there robust algorithms\nachieving both low total time complexity and low per-node energy cost? In this\npaper, we answer the above question affirmatively. Specifically, we develop a\nnew randomized algorithm for robust contention resolution without collision\ndetection. Lower bounds show that it has both optimal time and energy\ncomplexity. If all nodes start execution simultaneously, we design another\nalgorithm that is even faster, with similar energy complexity as the first\nalgorithm. The separation on time complexity suggests for robust contention\nresolution without collision detection, ``batch'' instances (nodes start\nsimultaneously) are inherently easier than ``scattered'' ones (nodes arrive\nover time).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 10:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-15"}

On the level of linear response the method allows to include\nthe reaction of the market to individual actions of the agents as well as the\nreaction of the agents to individual information items of the market. This way\nwe derive a self-consistent solution to the minority game. In particular we\nanalyze the impact of general nonlinear price functions on the amount of\narbitrage if noise from external fluctuations is present. We identify the\nconditions under which arbitrage gets reduced due to the presence of noise.\nWhen the cavity method is extended to time dependent response of the market\nprice to previous actions of the agents, the individual contributions of noise\ncan be pursued over different time scales in the transient dynamics until a\nstationary state is reached and when the stationary state is reached. The\ncontributions are from external fluctuations in price and information and from\nnoise due to the choice of strategies. The dynamics explains the time evolution\nof scores of the agents' strategies: it changes from initially a random walk to\nnon-Markovian dynamics and bounded excursions on an intermediate time scale to\neffectively random switching in the choice between strategies on long time\nscales. In contrast to the Curie-Weiss level of a mean-field approach, the\nmarket response included by the cavity method captures the realistic feature\nthat the agents can have a preference for a certain choice of strategies\nwithout getting stuck to a single choice. The breakdown of the method in the\nphase transition region indicates possible market mechanisms leading to\ncritical volatility and a possible regime shift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 11:09:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 10:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

Moreover, to implement and\nvalidate a phase space file generation routine. Methods: The MC-GPU code (v.\n1.5 DBT) was modified in order to generate phase space files and to be\ncompatible with PENELOPE v. 2018 derived cross section database. Simulations\nwere performed with homogeneous and anthropomorphic breast phantoms for\ndifferent breast imaging techniques. The glandular dose was computed for each\ncase and compared with results from the PENELOPE (v. 2014) + penEasy (v. 2015)\nand egs brachy (EGSnrc) Monte Carlo codes. Afterwards, several phase space\nfiles were generated with MC-GPU and the scored photon spectra were compared\nbetween the codes. Results: MC-GPU showed good agreement with the other codes\nwhen calculating the glandular dose distribution for mammography, mean\nglandular dose for digital breast tomosynthesis, and normalized glandular dose\nfor breast-CT. The latter case showed average/maximum relative differences of\n2.3%/27%, respectively, compared to other literature works, with the larger\ndifferences observed at low energies (around 10 keV).

Here we aim to overcome these issues with a novel\nalgorithm that derives the 3D extinction density of dust in the Milky Way using\na latent variable Gaussian Process and variational inference. Our model\nmaintains non-negative density and hence monotonically non-decreasing\nextinction along all lines-of-sight, and performs inference within a reasonable\ncomputational time. Using extinctions for hundreds of thousands of stars\ncomputed from optical and near-IR photometry, together with distances based on\nGaia parallaxes, we use our algorithm to infer the structure of the Orion,\nTaurus, Perseus, and Cygnus X star-forming regions. A number of features\nsuperimposed in 2D extinction maps are clearly deblended in 3D dust extinction\ndensity maps. We find a large filament on the edge of Orion, identify filament\nthat in the Taurus and Perseus regions, and show that Cygnus X is located at\n1300-1500pc. We compute dust masses of the regions and find these to be\nslightly higher than previous estimates, likely a consequence of our input data\nrecovering the highest column densities more effectively. Comparing our\npredicted extinctions to Planck data, we find that known relationships between\ndensity and dust processing, where high extinction lines of sight have the most\nprocessed grains, hold up in resolved observations when density is included,\nand that they exist at smaller scales than previously suggested. This can be\nused to study the changes in size or composition of dust as they are processed\nin molecular clouds.

However, the\nlengths of most existing ZCZ sequences are limited, and their parameters are\nnot flexible, which are leading to practical limitations in their use in\nQS-CDMA and other communication systems. The current study proposes a direct\nconstruction of ZCZ sequences of prime-power length with flexible parameters by\nusing multivariable functions. In the proposed construction, we first present a\nmultivariable function to generate a vector with specific properties; this is\nfurther used to generate another class of multivariable functions to generate\nthe desired $(p^t,(p-1)p^n,p^{n+t+1})$-ZCZ sequence set, where $p$ is a prime\nnumber, $t,n$ are positive integers, and $t\\leq n$.

Nowadays, more applications require ML on tiny devices with extremely\nlimited resources, like implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), which is\nknown as TinyML. Unlike ML on the edge, TinyML with a limited energy supply has\nhigher demands on low-power execution. Stochastic computing (SC) using\nbitstreams for data representation is promising for TinyML since it can perform\nthe fundamental ML operations using simple logical gates, instead of the\ncomplicated binary adder and multiplier. However, SC commonly suffers from low\naccuracy for ML tasks due to low data precision and inaccuracy of arithmetic\nunits. Increasing the length of the bitstream in the existing works can\nmitigate the precision issue but incur higher latency.

BSC\ndivides inputs into blocks, such that the latency can be reduced by exploiting\nhigh data parallelism. Moreover, optimized arithmetic units and output revision\n(OUR) scheme are proposed to improve accuracy. On top of it, a global\noptimization approach is devised to determine the number of blocks, which can\nmake a better latency-power trade-off.

The seasonal variability, linked to the stratospheric\nintrusions of air masses with higher tritium content into the troposphere, is\ncorrectly reproduced for Antarctica with a maximum in winter.

We test here the hypothesis that\nthese biases are partly consequences of a too diffusive advection. Exploiting\nthe LMDZ-iso model, we show that a less diffusive representation of the\nadvection, especially on the horizontal, is very important to reduce the bias\nin the isotopic contents of precipitation above this area. The choice of an\nappropriate representation of the advection is thus essential when using GCMs\nfor paleoclimate applications based on polar water isotopes. Too much diffusive\nmixing along the poleward transport leads to overestimated isotopic contents in\nwater vapor because dehydration by mixing follows a more enriched path than\ndehydration by Rayleigh distillation. The near-air surface temperature is also\ninfluenced, to a lesser extent, by the diffusive properties of the advection\nscheme directly via the advection of the air and indirectly via the radiative\neffects of changes in high cloud fraction and water vapor. A too diffusive\nhorizontal advection increases the temperature and so also contributes to\nenrich the isotopic contents of water vapor over Antarctica through a reduction\nof the distillation. The temporal relationship, from Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)\nto present-day conditions, between the mean annual near-air surface temperature\nand the water isotopic contents of precipitation for a specific location can\nalso be impacted, with significant consequences on the paleo-temperature\nreconstruction from observed changes in water isotopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 13:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-15"}

In recent years, there have been tremendous improvements in\narchitecture design, resulting in better performance on various prediction\ntasks. In general, these neural architectures combine node feature aggregation\nand feature transformation using learnable weight matrix in the same layer.\nThis makes it challenging to analyze the importance of node features aggregated\nfrom various hops and the expressiveness of the neural network layers. As\ndifferent graph datasets show varying levels of homophily and heterophily in\nfeatures and class label distribution, it becomes essential to understand which\nfeatures are important for the prediction tasks without any prior information.\nIn this work, we decouple the node feature aggregation step and depth of graph\nneural network, and empirically analyze how different aggregated features play\na role in prediction performance. We show that not all features generated via\naggregation steps are useful, and often using these less informative features\ncan be detrimental to the performance of the GNN model.

The main idea of the time-freezing\nreformulation is to introduce a clock state and an auxiliary dynamical system\nwhose trajectory endpoints satisfy the state jump law. When the auxiliary\nsystem is active, the clock state is not evolving, hence by taking only the\nparts of the trajectory when the clock state was active, we can recover the\noriginal solution.

This study\nproposes an approach for enabling high-precision radial velocity measurements\nfrom space. The concept presents a combination of a high-dispersion densified\npupil spectrograph and a novel telescope line-of-sight monitor. The precision\nof the radial velocity measurements is determined by combining the\nspectrophotometric accuracy and the quality of the absorption lines in the\nrecorded spectrum. Therefore, a highly dispersive densified pupil spectrograph\nproposed to perform stable spectroscopy can be utilized for high-precision\nradial velocity measures. A concept involving the telescope line-of-sight\nmonitor is developed to minimize the change of the telescope line-of-sight over\na decade. This monitor allows the precise measurement of a long-term telescope\ndrift without any significant impact on the Airy disk when the densified pupil\nspectra are recorded.

However, the observational test of this model is\nproblematic. Spectral lines of Wolf-Rayet stars originate in expanding stellar\nwind, therefore a reliable spectroscopical determination of their rotational\nvelocities is difficult. Intrinsic polarization of Wolf-Rayet stars due to the\nrotational modulation of the stellar wind may provide an indirect way to\ndetermine the rotational velocities of these stars. However, detailed wind\nmodels are required for this purpose. We determine the intrinsic polarization\nof Wolf-Rayet stars from hydrodynamical wind models as a function of rotational\nvelocity. We used 2.5D hydrodynamical simulations to calculate the structure of\nrotating winds of Wolf-Rayet stars. The simulations account for the deformation\nof the stellar surface due to rotation, gravity darkening, and nonradial\nforces. From the derived models, we calculated the intrinsic stellar\npolarization. The mass loss rate was scaled to take realistic wind densities of\nWolf-Rayet stars into account. The hydrodynamical wind models predict a prolate\nwind structure, which leads to a relatively low level of polarization. Even\nrelatively large rotational velocities are allowed by observational constrains.\nThe obtained wind structure is similiar to that obtained previously for\nrotating optically thin winds.

We achieve 120\nGb/s and 240 Gb/s aggregate data transmission for 30 Gb/s non-return-to-zero\n(NRZ) and 60 Gb/s pulse modulation amplitude 4 (PAM4) modulation formats\nrespectively over 2 km of optical fiber, exceeding the reach, single lane data\nrate, and aggregate data rates specified in Parallel Single Mode 4 (PSM4) and\nCourse Wavelength Division Multiplex 4 (CWDM4) multi-source agreements.\nRemarkably, we achieve an extremely low power penalty of 0.1 dB compared to\nback-to-back characterization. The results firmly cement CMOS-compatible\nmicro-resonator frequency combs based high-speed data transmission as a viable\ntechnology for the cost and power sensitive data center transceiver industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 08:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

The primordial black hole is a type of black hole\nformed in the early universe, especially during the thermal radiation period of\nthe early universe. Driven by gravity, thermal radiation will collapse to form\na black hole. Because of the complexity of the actual situation, we use the\nsimplest model for simulation under the premise of only considering the\nthermodynamic properties of the system: in the classic case, an isolated box\nfull of thermal radiation, by adjusting the initial temperature within a\nreasonable range, the results show that the collapse of part of the thermal\nradiation to form a black hole and finally achieve thermal equilibrium is an\ninevitable result of the second law of thermodynamics. We then introduced the\nquantization of black holes and the number of microscopic states of thermal\nradiation into the thermal equilibrium system and came to a surprising\nconclusion: if both the quantization of black holes and the number of\nmicroscopic states of thermal radiation are considered at the same time, the\nfluctuation of thermodynamics is inevitable. When only one of them is\nconsidered, the law of conservation of energy and the second law of\nthermodynamics can be satisfied at the same time, and the fluctuation of\nthermodynamics can be avoided.

Such exposed PII can cause\nsevere losses to the users, and informing users of their PII exposure is\ncrucial to raise their privacy awareness and encourage them to take protective\nmeasures. To this end, advanced automatic techniques are needed. While\nInformation Extraction (IE) techniques can be used to extract the PII\nautomatically, Deep Learning (DL)-based IE models alleviate the need for\nfeature engineering and further improve the efficiency. However, DL-based IE\nmodels often require large-scale labeled data for training, but PII-labeled\nsocial media posts are difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns. Also, these\nmodels rely heavily on pre-trained word embeddings, while PII in social media\noften varies in forms and thus has no fixed representations in pre-trained word\nembeddings. In this study, we propose the Deep Transfer Learning for PII\nExtraction (DTL-PIIE) framework to address these two limitations. DTL-PIIE\ntransfers knowledge learned from publicly available PII data to social media to\naddress the problem of rare PII-labeled data. Moreover, our framework leverages\nGraph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to incorporate syntactic patterns to guide\nPIIE without relying on pre-trained word embeddings. Evaluation against\nbenchmark IE models indicates that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art\nDL-based IE models.

The ability of the final DT model to\npredict the failure modes was validated with a classification rate of around\n90%.
