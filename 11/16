We design a novel pairwise-independent\nSE(3)-equivariant graph matching network to predict the rotation and\ntranslation to place one of the proteins at the right docked position relative\nto the second protein. We mathematically guarantee a basic principle: the\npredicted complex is always identical regardless of the initial locations and\norientations of the two structures. Our model, named EquiDock, approximates the\nbinding pockets and predicts the docking poses using keypoint matching and\nalignment, achieved through optimal transport and a differentiable Kabsch\nalgorithm.

A novelty of these models is that they contain non-trivially\ncorrelated spacetime branes or, equivalently, nonlocal interactions in their\naction. Such nonlocal correlations are motivated in the low-energy gravity\ntheory by integrating out UV degrees of freedom. Demanding factorization fixes\nalmost all brane correlators, and the exact geometric expansion of the\npartition function collapses to only two terms: the black hole saddle and a\nsubleading ``half-wormhole'' geometry, whose sum yields the desired discrete\nspectrum. By mapping the insertion of correlated branes to a certain\ndouble-trace deformation in the dual matrix integral, we show that\nfactorization and discreteness also persist non-perturbatively. While in our\nmodel all wormholes completely cancel, they are still computationally relevant:\nself-averaging quantities, like the Page curve, computed in the original theory\nwith wormholes, accurately approximate observables in our theory, which\naccounts for UV corrections. Our models emphasize the importance of\ncorrelations between different disconnected components of spacetime, providing\na possible resolution to the factorization puzzle in any number of dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 16:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Many papers attempted to quantify\nbias in word or sentence embeddings to evaluate debiasing methods or compare\ndifferent embedding models, usually with cosine-based metrics. However, lately\nsome works have raised doubts about these metrics showing that even though such\nmetrics report low biases, other tests still show biases. In fact, there is a\ngreat variety of bias metrics or tests proposed in the literature without any\nconsensus on the optimal solutions. Yet we lack works that evaluate bias\nmetrics on a theoretical level or elaborate the advantages and disadvantages of\ndifferent bias metrics. In this work, we will explore different cosine based\nbias metrics. We formalize a bias definition based on the ideas from previous\nworks and derive conditions for bias metrics. Furthermore, we thoroughly\ninvestigate the existing cosine-based metrics and their limitations to show why\nthese metrics can fail to report biases in some cases.

In\nparticular, we explain how DRO can be used as a nonparametric alternative to\nconventional extreme value theory that extrapolates tails based on theoretical\nlimiting distributions, which could face challenges in bias-variance control\nand other technical complications. We also explain how OU resolves the\nchallenges in interpretability and robustness faced by existing distributional\nshape notions used in the DRO literature. Methodologically, we characterize the\nextreme points of the OU distribution class in terms of what we call OU sets\nand build a corresponding Choquet representation, which subsequently allows us\nto reduce OU-DRO into moment problems over infinite-dimensional random\nvariables. We then develop, in the bivariate setting, a geometric approach to\nreduce such moment problems into finite dimension via a specially constructed\nvariational problem designed to eliminate suboptimal solutions.

The progression of corrosion\ndepends on nanoscale morphology, stress, and defects present. Experimentally\nmonitoring this complex interplay is challenging. Here we implement in situ\nBragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI) to probe the dissolution of a\nCo-Fe alloy microcrystal exposed to hydrochloric acid (HCl). By measuring five\nBragg reflections from a single isolated microcrystal at ambient conditions, we\ncompare the full three-dimensional (3D) strain state before corrosion and the\nstrain along the [111] direction throughout the corrosion process. We find that\nthe strained surface layer of the crystal dissolves to leave a progressively\nless strained surface.

Prior art on FL often requires devices to train deep\nneural networks (DNNs) using a 32-bit precision level for data representation\nto improve accuracy. However, such algorithms are impractical for\nresource-constrained devices since DNNs could require execution of millions of\noperations. Thus, training DNNs with a high precision level incurs a high\nenergy cost for FL. In this paper, a quantized FL framework, that represents\ndata with a finite level of precision in both local training and uplink\ntransmission, is proposed. Here, the finite level of precision is captured\nthrough the use of quantized neural networks (QNNs) that quantize weights and\nactivations in fixed-precision format. In the considered FL model, each device\ntrains its QNN and transmits a quantized training result to the base station.\nEnergy models for the local training and the transmission with the quantization\nare rigorously derived. An energy minimization problem is formulated with\nrespect to the level of precision while ensuring convergence. To solve the\nproblem, we first analytically derive the FL convergence rate and use a line\nsearch method. Simulation results show that our FL framework can reduce energy\nconsumption by up to 53% compared to a standard FL model. The results also shed\nlight on the tradeoff between precision, energy, and accuracy in FL over\nwireless networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 17:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 16:25:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 18:26:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 15:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

This is especially true for the rapidly-rotating Be\nand Bn stars, owing to their high temperatures, geometric asymmetries, binary\nproperties, and evolutionary history. UV spectropolarimetric observations are\nextremely sensitive to the photospheric consequences of rapid rotation (i.e.\noblateness, temperature, and surface gravity gradients). Our polarized\nradiative-transfer modelling predicts that with low-resolution UV\nspectropolarimetry covering 120 -- 300 nm the inclination angle of a rapid\nrotator can be determined to within 5 degrees, and the rotation rate to within\n1%. The origin of rapid rotation in Be/n stars can be explained by either\nsingle-star or binary evolution, but their relative importance is largely\nunknown. Some Be stars have hot sub-luminous (sdO) companions, which at an\nearlier phase transferred their envelope (and with it mass and angular\nmomentum) to the present-day rapid rotator. Through spectral modelling of a\nwide range of simulated Be/n+sdO configurations, we demonstrate that\nhigh-resolution high-SNR UV spectroscopy can detect an sdO star even when\n$\\sim$1,000 times fainter in the UV than its Be/n star companion. This degree\nof sensitivity is needed to more fully explore the parameter space of Be/n+sdO\nbinaries, which so far has been limited to about a dozen systems with\nrelatively luminous sdO stars. We suggest that a UV spectropolarimetric survey\nof Be/n stars is the next step forward in understanding this population. Such a\ndataset would, when combined with population synthesis models, allow for the\ndetermination of the relative importance of the possible evolutionary pathways\ntraversed by these stars, which is also crucial for understanding their future\nevolution and fate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 17:30:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 17:34:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 20:40:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

From an approximation perspective,\nthis paper shows that the number of parameters that need to be learned can be\nsignificantly smaller than people typically expect. First, we theoretically\ndesign ReLU networks with a few learnable parameters to achieve an attractive\napproximation.

The IEQ-macrostates are unique in the enlarged state space and\nhave no memory just as EQ macrostates are in the EQ state space. The approach\nprovides a clear strategy to identify the internal variables for any model\nthrough several examples. The MNEQT deals directly with system-intrinsic\nquantities, which are very useful as they fully describe irreversibility.\nBecause of this, MNEQT solves a long-standing problem in NEQT of identifying a\nunique global temperature T of a system, thus fulfilling Planck's dream of a\nglobal temperature for any system, even if it is not uniform such as when it is\ndriven between two heat baths; T has the conventional interpretation of\nsatisfying the Clausius statement that the exchange macroheat flows from hot to\ncold, and other sensible criteria expected of a temperature. The concept of the\ngeneralized macroheat dQ converts the Clausius inequality into the Clausius\nequality dS=dQ/T, which also covers macrostates with memory, and follows from\nthe extensivity property. The equality also holds for a NEQ isolated system.\nThe novel approach is extremely useful as it also works when no internal state\nvariables are used to study nonunique macrostates in the EQ state space at the\nexpense of explicit time dependence in the entropy that gives rise to memory\neffects. To show the usefulness of the novel approach, we give several examples\nsuch as irreversible Carnot cycle, friction and Brownian motion, the free\nexpansion, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 18:38:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 02:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

The proposed LiT is widely\napplicable; it works reliably with multiple pre-training methods (supervised\nand unsupervised) and across diverse architectures (ResNet, Vision Transformers\nand MLP-Mixer) using three different image-text datasets. With the\ntransformer-based pre-trained ViT-g/14 model, the LiT model achieves 85.2%\nzero-shot transfer accuracy on the ImageNet test set, and 82.5% on the\nchallenging out-of-distribution ObjectNet test set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 18:53:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 16:24:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 14:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

We aim to complete the measurements of the\ndirection of the magnetic fields at mas resolution around a sample of massive\nstar-forming regions (MSFRs) to determine whether the magnetic field and\noutflows are aligned. In 2012, we started a large VLBI campaign with the EVN to\nmeasure the magnetic field orientation and strength toward a sample of 31 MSFRs\n(the flux-limited sample) by analyzing the polarized emission of 6.7GHz CH3OH\nmasers. In the previous papers of the series, we have presented 80% of the\nsample. Here, we report the linearly and circularly polarized emission of\n6.7GHz CH3OH masers toward the last five MSFRs of the flux-limited sample. The\nsources are G30.70-0.07, G30.76-0.05, G31.28+0.06, G32.03+0.06, and\nG69.52-0.97.

In addition, we determined that\ntypical values of the linear and circular polarization fractions for 6.7 GHz\nCH3OH masers are Pl=1.0%-2.5% and Pv=0.5%-0.75%, respectively.

A well-studied and simple solution to this charged\ncurrent anomaly is to introduce a scalar leptoquark $S_1$ that couples to the\nsecond and third generation of fermions. We investigate how $S_1$ can also\nserve as a mediator between the Standard Model and a dark sector. We study this\nscenario in detail and estimate the constraints arising from collider searches\nfor leptoquarks, collider searches for missing energy signals, direct detection\nexperiments and the dark matter relic abundance. We stress that the production\nof a pair of leptoquarks that decays into different final states (i.e. the\ncommonly called \"mixed\" channels) provides critical information for identifying\nthe underlying dynamics, and we exemplify this by studying the $t \\tau b \\nu$\nand the resonant $S_1$ plus missing energy channels. We find that direct\ndetection data provides non-negligible constraints on the leptoquark coupling\nto the dark sector, which in turn affects the relic abundance. We also show\nthat the correct relic abundance can not only arise via standard freeze-out,\nbut also through conversion-driven freeze-out.

(ii) Abductive inference -- a term coined by C. S. Peirce, which he\ndefined as \"the process of forming explanatory hypotheses. It is the only\nlogical operation which introduces any new idea.\"\n  Abductive inference and quantitative economics: Abductive inference plays a\nfundamental role in empirical scientific research as a tool for discovery and\ndata analysis. Heckman and Singer (2017) strongly advocated \"Economists should\nabduct.\" Arnold Zellner (2007) stressed that \"much greater emphasis on\nreductive [abductive] inference in teaching econometrics, statistics, and\neconomics would be desirable.\" But currently, there are no established theory\nor practical tools that can allow an empirical analyst to abduct. This paper\nattempts to fill this gap by introducing new principles and concrete procedures\nto the Economics and Statistics community. I termed the proposed approach as\nAbductive Inference Machine (AIM).\n  The historical Peirce's experiment: In 1872, Peirce conducted a series of\nexperiments to determine the distribution of response times to an auditory\nstimulus, which is widely regarded as one of the most significant statistical\ninvestigations in the history of nineteenth-century American mathematical\nresearch (Stigler, 1978). On the 150th anniversary of this historical\nexperiment, we look back at the Peircean-style abductive inference through a\nmodern statistical lens. Using Peirce's data, it is shown how empirical\nanalysts can abduct in a systematic and automated manner using AIM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 19:17:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 18:49:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 06:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

Nonetheless, the\nmechanism of chain collapsing and phase separation in this limit differs from\nthe case with a poor solvent rendered by unfavorable polymer-solvent\ninteractions. In the latter, the solvent is excluded from the domain of the\ncollapsed chains while in the former, the solvent is still present in the\npervaded volume of a collapsed chain or in the polymer-rich domain that phase\nseparates from the pure solvent.

In addition to the antiferromagnetic exchange\ninteraction $J_{\\perp}$ between the localized (impurity) and conduction\n(itinerant) electrons, our model includes the local repulsion $U$ of the\nconduction electrons and the Heisenberg interaction $J_H$ between the\nimpurities.

The transition from the spiral\nmagnetic order to the Kondo singlet phase is a second-order phase transition.\nIn the $(J_{\\perp}, J_{H})$ plane, we observe that the effect of $J_H$ is to\nreduce the Kondo singlet phase, giving more room to the spiral magnetic order\nphase.

We derive the probability\ndistributions of the projected areas and masses for nine clouds within 400 pc\nfrom the Sun using 3D dust distribution data from the literature. We find that\nthe viewing angle can have a dramatic effect on the observed areas and masses\nof individual clouds. The joint probability distributions of the areas and\nmasses are strongly correlated, relatively flat, and can show multiple peaks.\nThe typical ranges and 50% quartiles of the distributions are roughly 100-200%\nand 20-80% of the median value, respectively, making viewing angle effects\nimportant for all individual clouds. The threshold value used to define the\ncloud areas is also important; our analysis suggests that the clouds become\nmore anisotropic for smaller thresholds (larger scales). On average, the areas\nand masses of the plane-of-the-sky and face-on projections agree, albeit with a\nlarge scatter. This suggests that sample averages of areas and masses are\nrelatively free of viewing angle effects, which is important to facilitate\ncomparisons of extragalactic and galactic data. Ultimately, our results\ndemonstrate that a cloud's location in the KS-relation is affected by viewing\nangle in a non-trivial manner. However, the KS-relation of our sample as a\nwhole is not strongly affected by these effects, because the co-variance of the\nareas and masses causes the observed mean column density to remain relatively\nconstant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 20:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

This problem is even more\npronounced in MU-MIMO scheduling where the scheduler can assign multiple users\nto the same time-frequency physical resources. Traditional approaches thus\nresort to designing heuristics that trade optimality in favor of feasibility of\nexecution.

To cater to the nature of the problem at hand, like the\nlack of an intrinsic ordering of the users as well as the importance of\ndependencies between combinations of users, we make fundamental modifications\nto the neural network architecture by introducing the self-attention mechanism.\nWe then demonstrate that the resulting approach is not only feasible but vastly\noutperforms state-of-the-art heuristic-based scheduling approaches in the\npresence of measurement uncertainties and finite buffers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 20:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

In\nMoebius, open code can depend on type and term variables (level 0) whose values\nare supplied at a later stage, as well as code variables (level 1) that stand\nfor code templates supplied at a later stage. This leads to a multi-level modal\nlambda-calculus that supports System-F style polymorphism and forms the basis\nfor polymorphic code generation. 2) we extend the multi-level modal\nlambda-calculus to support pattern matching on code.

A locally irregular edge coloring of a graph G is any\nedge coloring of G such that each of the colors induces a locally irregular\nsubgraph of G. A graph G is colorable if it admits a locally irregular edge\ncoloring. The locally irregular chromatic index of a colorable graph G, denoted\nby CHI'irr(G), is the smallest number of colors used by a locally irregular\nedge coloring of G. The Local Irregularity Conjecture claims that all graphs,\nexcept odd length path, odd length cycle and a certain class of cacti, are\ncolorable by 3 colors. As the conjecture is valid for graphs with large minimum\ndegree and all non-colorable graphs are vertex disjoint cacti, we take\ndirection to study rather sparse graphs. In this paper, we give a cactus graph\nB which contradicts this conjecture, i.e. CHI'irr(B) = 4.

This is because the low-dimensional pose\nand shape parameters of the SMAL model makes it easier for deep networks to\nlearn the high-dimensional animal meshes. However, the SMAL model is learned\nfrom scans of toy animals with limited pose and shape variations, and thus may\nnot be able to represent highly varying real animals well. This may result in\npoor fittings of the estimated meshes to the 2D evidences, e.g. 2D keypoints or\nsilhouettes. To mitigate this problem, we propose a coarse-to-fine approach to\nreconstruct 3D animal mesh from a single image. The coarse estimation stage\nfirst estimates the pose, shape and translation parameters of the SMAL model.\nThe estimated meshes are then used as a starting point by a graph convolutional\nnetwork (GCN) to predict a per-vertex deformation in the refinement stage. This\ncombination of SMAL-based and vertex-based representations benefits from both\nparametric and non-parametric representations. We design our mesh refinement\nGCN (MRGCN) as an encoder-decoder structure with hierarchical feature\nrepresentations to overcome the limited receptive field of traditional GCNs.\nMoreover, we observe that the global image feature used by existing animal mesh\nreconstruction works is unable to capture detailed shape information for mesh\nrefinement. We thus introduce a local feature extractor to retrieve a\nvertex-level feature and use it together with the global feature as the input\nof the MRGCN. We test our approach on the StanfordExtra dataset and achieve\nstate-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we test the generalization capacity of\nour approach on the Animal Pose and BADJA datasets.

In\nthis work, we study the impact of applying each approach to create more\nchallenging evaluation datasets.

We\nfind that AFLite indeed selects more challenging examples, lowering the\nperformance of evaluated models more as stronger adversary models are used.\nHowever, the resulting ranking of models can also be unstable and highly\nsensitive to the choice of adversary model used. Moreover, AFLite oversamples\nexamples with low annotator agreement, meaning that model comparisons hinge on\nthe most contentiously labeled examples.

In such stochastic models, several quantities are of\nclinical interest as insertional mutagenesis carries the potential threat of\nleukemogenesis following gene therapy with autologous stem cell\ntransplantation. In this paper, we develop a three-type branching process model\ndescribing accumulations of mutations in a population of stem cells\ndistinguished by their ability for long-term self-renewal. Our outcome of\ninterest is the appearance of a double-mutant cell, which carries a high\npotential for leukemic transformation. In our model, a single-hit mutation\ncarries a slight proliferative advantage over a wild-type stem cells. We\ncompute marginalized transition probabilities that allow us to capture\nimportant quantitative aspects of our model, including the probability of\nobserving a double-hit mutant and relevant moments of a single-hit mutation\npopulation over time. We thoroughly explore the model behavior numerically,\nvarying birth rates across the initial sizes and populations of wild type stem\ncells and single-hit mutants, and compare the probability of observing a\ndouble-hit mutant under these conditions. We find that increasing the number of\nsingle-mutants over wild-type particles initially present has a large effect on\nthe occurrence of a double-mutant, and that it is relatively safe for\nsingle-mutants to be quite proliferative, provided the lentiviral gene addition\navoids creating single mutants in the original insertion process.

For robust and high-quality delivery\nof video content over wireless and mobile networks, the main challenge is\nsending image and video signals to single and multiple users over unstable and\ndiverse channel environments. To this end, many studies have designed\ndigital-based video delivery schemes, which mainly consist of a sequence of\ndigital-based coding and transmission schemes. Although digital-based schemes\nperform well when the channel characteristics are known in advance, significant\nquality degradation, known as cliff and leveling effects, often occurs owing to\nthe fluctuating channel characteristics. To prevent cliff and leveling effects\nirrespective of the channel characteristics of each user, a new paradigm for\nwireless and mobile video streaming has been proposed. Soft delivery schemes\nskip the digital operations of quantization and entropy and channel coding\nwhile directly mapping the power-assigned frequency--domain coefficients onto\nthe transmission symbols. This modification is based on the fact that the pixel\ndistortion due to communication noise is proportional to the magnitude of the\nnoise, resulting in graceful quality improvement, wherein quality is improved\ngradually, according to the wireless channel quality without any cliff and\nleveling effects.

Nonetheless, existing contact-free\ndesigns mostly require human subjects to remain static, largely confining their\nadoptions in everyday environments where body movements are inevitable.\nFortunately, radio-frequency (RF) enabled contact-free sensing, though\nsuffering motion interference inseparable by conventional filtering, may offer\na potential to distill respiratory waveform with the help of deep learning. To\nrealize this potential, we introduce MoRe-Fi to conduct fine-grained\nrespiration monitoring under body movements. MoRe-Fi leverages an IR-UWB radar\nto achieve contact-free sensing, and it fully exploits the complex radar signal\nfor data augmentation. The core of MoRe-Fi is a novel variational\nencoder-decoder network; it aims to single out the respiratory waveforms that\nare modulated by body movements in a non-linear manner. Our experiments with 12\nsubjects and 66-hour data demonstrate that MoRe-Fi accurately recovers\nrespiratory waveform despite the interference caused by body movements. We also\ndiscuss potential applications of MoRe-Fi for pulmonary disease diagnoses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 02:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

The limited resource capacities of the\nexisting servers, the dependency between nodes in a graph, and the privacy\nconcern due to the centralized storage and model learning have spurred the need\nto design an effective distributed algorithm for GNN training. However,\nexisting distributed GNN training methods impose either excessive communication\ncosts or large memory overheads that hinders their scalability. To overcome\nthese issues, we propose a communication-efficient distributed GNN training\ntechnique named $\\text{{Learn Locally, Correct Globally}}$ (LLCG). To reduce\nthe communication and memory overhead, each local machine in LLCG first trains\na GNN on its local data by ignoring the dependency between nodes among\ndifferent machines, then sends the locally trained model to the server for\nperiodic model averaging. However, ignoring node dependency could result in\nsignificant performance degradation. To solve the performance degradation, we\npropose to apply $\\text{{Global Server Corrections}}$ on the server to refine\nthe locally learned models. We rigorously analyze the convergence of\ndistributed methods with periodic model averaging for training GNNs and show\nthat naively applying periodic model averaging but ignoring the dependency\nbetween nodes will suffer from an irreducible residual error.

Such a scale, combined with ever-growing system complexity, is\ncausing a key challenge to failure and resource management for dependable cloud\ncomputing. Autonomic failure detection is a crucial technique for understanding\nemergent, cloud-wide phenomena and self-managing cloud resources for\nsystem-level dependability assurance. To detect failures, we need to monitor\nthe cloud execution and collect runtime performance data. These data are\nusually unlabeled, and thus a prior failure history is not always available in\nproduction clouds. In this paper, we present a \\emph{self-evolving anomaly\ndetection} (SEAD) framework for cloud dependability assurance. Our framework\nself-evolves by recursively exploring newly verified anomaly records and\ncontinuously updating the anomaly detector online. As a distinct advantage of\nour framework, cloud system administrators only need to check a small number of\ndetected anomalies, and their decisions are leveraged to update the detector.\nThus, the detector evolves following the upgrade of system hardware, update of\nthe software stack, and change of user workloads. Moreover, we design two types\nof detectors, one for general anomaly detection and the other for type-specific\nanomaly detection. With the help of self-evolving techniques, our detectors can\nachieve 88.94\\% in sensitivity and 94.60\\% in specificity on average, which\nmakes them suitable for real-world deployment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 05:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

In this paper, we propose\na novel solution that relies only on in-band mmWave wireless measurements to\nproactively predict future dynamic line-of-sight (LOS) link blockages. The\nproposed solution utilizes deep neural networks and special patterns of\nreceived signal power, that we call pre-blockage wireless signatures to infer\nfuture blockages.

To evaluate our proposed approach, we build a\nlarge-scale real-world dataset comprising nearly $0.5$ million data points\n(mmWave measurements) for both indoor and outdoor blockage scenarios. The\nresults, using this dataset, show that the proposed approach can successfully\npredict the occurrence of future dynamic blockages with more than 85\\%\naccuracy.

Predictive\nanalytics is human involved, thus the machine learning model is preferred to be\ninterpretable. In literature, Generalized Additive Model (GAM) is a standard\nfor interpretability. However, due to the one-to-many and many-to-one phenomena\nwhich appear commonly in real-world scenarios, existing GAMs have limitations\nto serve predictive analytics in terms of both accuracy and training\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose FXAM (Fast and eXplainable Additive\nModel), a unified and fast interpretable model for predictive analytics. FXAM\nextends GAM's modeling capability with a unified additive model for numerical,\ncategorical, and temporal features. FXAM conducts a novel training procedure\ncalled Three-Stage Iteration (TSI). TSI corresponds to learning over numerical,\ncategorical, and temporal features respectively. Each stage learns a local\noptimum by fixing the parameters of other stages. We design joint learning over\ncategorical features and partial learning over temporal features to achieve\nhigh accuracy and training efficiency.

Deep learning methods have\neffectively been applied to human pose estimation. However, the major\nbottleneck to the application of these methods to animal pose estimation is the\nunavailability of sufficient quantities of labeled data. Though there are ample\nquantities of unlabelled data publicly available, it is economically\nimpractical to label large quantities of data for each animal. In addition, due\nto the wide variety of body shapes in the animal kingdom, the transfer of\nknowledge across domains is ineffective. Given the fact that the human brain is\nable to recognize animal pose without requiring large amounts of labeled data,\nit is only reasonable that we exploit unsupervised learning to tackle the\nproblem of animal pose recognition from the available, unlabelled data. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel architecture that is able to recognize the pose of\nmultiple animals fromunlabelled data. We do this by (1) removing background\ninformation from each image and employing an edge detection algorithm on the\nbody of the animal, (2) Tracking motion of the edge pixels and performing\nagglomerative clustering to segment body parts, (3) employing contrastive\nlearning to discourage grouping of distant body parts together. Hence we are\nable to distinguish between body parts of the animal, based on their visual\nbehavior, instead of the underlying anatomy. Thus, we are able to achieve a\nmore effective classification of the data than their human-labeled\ncounterparts.

Boarded patients may\ncompete with new patients for medical resources in the ED, compromising the\nquality of emergency care. A common expedient for mitigating boarding is\npatient overflowing, i.e., sending patients to beds in other specialties or\naccommodation classes, which may compromise the quality of inpatient care and\nbring on operational challenges. We study inpatient bed assignment to shorten\nboarding times without excessive patient overflowing.\n  Methodology: We use a queue with multiple customer classes and multiple\nserver pools to model hospital wards. Exploiting patient flow data from a\nhospital, we propose a computationally tractable approach to formulating the\nbed assignment problem, where the joint probability of all waiting patients\nmeeting their respective delay targets is maximized.\n  Results: By dynamically adjusting the overflow rate, the proposed approach is\ncapable not only of reducing patients' waiting times, but also of mitigating\nthe time-of-day effect on boarding times. In numerical experiments, our\napproach greatly outperforms both early discharge policies and threshold-based\noverflowing policies, which are commonly used in practice.\n  Managerial implications: We provide a practicable approach to solving the bed\nassignment problem. This data-driven approach captures critical features of\npatient flow management, while the resulting optimization problem is\npractically solvable. The proposed approach is a useful tool for the control of\nqueueing systems with time-sensitive service requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 07:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

The change of the \"shape\" of the\nheavy fragments causes an increase of a distance between the charge centers of\nthe nascent fragments just after scission as excitation energy increases.\nAccordingly, the Coulomb repulsion between the two fragments decreases with an\nincrease of the excitation energy, which causes the decrease of the average\nTKE. In this manner, we found that the change of the shape of the heavy\nfragment as a function of the excitation energy is the key issue for the TKE of\nfission fragments to decrease as the excitation energy of the fissioning nuclei\nincreases. In other words, washing out of the shell effects which affect the\nshape of the heavy fragments is the key reason for the decreasing energy\ndependence of the average TKE of the fission fragments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 07:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

The\nenergy-based approach serves as a supplemental index to response quantities and\nincludes the effect of repeated loads in seismic performance. The design\nphilosophy suggests that the seismic demands are met by the energy dissipation\ncapacity of the structural members. Therefore, the energy dissipation behavior\nof the structural members should be well understood to achieve an effective\nenergy-based design approach. This study focuses on the energy dissipation\ncapacity of reinforced concrete (RC) shear walls that are widely used in high\nseismic regions as they provide significant stiffness and strength to resist\nlateral forces. A machine learning (Gaussian Process Regression (GPR))-based\npredictive model for energy dissipation capacity of shear walls is developed as\na function of wall design parameters. Eighteen design parameters are shown to\ninfluence energy dissipation, whereas the most important ones are determined by\napplying sequential backward elimination and by using feature selection methods\nto reduce the complexity of the predictive model. The ability of the proposed\nmodel to make robust and accurate predictions is validated based on novel data\nwith a prediction accuracy (the ratio of predicted/actual values) of around\n1.00 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.93. The outcomes of this\nstudy are believed to contribute to the energy-based approach by (i) defining\nthe most influential wall properties on the seismic energy dissipation capacity\nof shear walls and (ii) providing predictive models that can enable comparisons\nof different wall design configurations to achieve higher energy dissipation\ncapacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 08:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

When a data item is not\ndominated by any other data item, this data is said to be a member of the\nskyline. However, as the number of criteria increases, the possibility that a\ndata dominates another data decreases, resulting in too many members of the\nskyline set. To solve this kind of problem, the concept of the k-dominant\nskyline was proposed, which reduces the number of skyline members by relaxing\nthe limit. The uncertainty of the data makes each data have a probability of\nappearing, so each data has the probability of becoming a member of the\nk-dominant skyline. When a new data item is added, the probability of other\ndata becoming members of the k-dominant skyline may change. How to quickly\nupdate the k-dominant skyline for real-time applications is a serious problem.\nThis paper proposes an effective method, Middle Indexing (MI), which filters\nout a large amount of irrelevant data in the uncertain data stream by sorting\ndata specifically, so as to improve the efficiency of updating the k-dominant\nskyline.

We carefully investigate\ninto the phenomenon, and construct a two-level ensemble scheme, NENet, to\nintegrate multiple predictions from diverse base predictors. The NENet forms a\nmore reliable depth estimator, which substantially boosts the performance over\nbase predictors. Notably, this is the first attempt to introduce ensemble\nlearning and evaluate its utility for monocular depth estimation to the best of\nour knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed NENet\nachieves better results than previous state-of-the-art approaches on the\nNYU-Depth-v2 and KITTI datasets.

To\nachieve good performance and to influence the region of attraction associated\nwith the prediction horizon, the terminal cost of the predictive controller's\noptimization objective is a key design factor. Approximate dynamic programming\nrefers to one particular approximation paradigm that pursues iterative cost\nadaptation over a state domain. Troubled by approximation errors, the\nassociated approximate optimal controller is, in general, not necessarily\nstabilizing nor is its performance quantifiable on the entire approximation\ndomain. Using a parametric terminal cost trained via approximate dynamic\nprogramming, a stabilizing predictive controller is proposed whose performance\ncan directly be related to cost approximation errors. The controller further\nensures closed-loop asymptotic stability beyond the training domain of the\napproximate optimal controller associated to the terminal cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 09:22:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 22:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

Motivated by the application to public transit networks, where edges\ncannot be scheduled independently one of another, we consider the setting where\nthe edges are grouped into certain walks (called trips) in the digraph and\nwhere assigning the appearing time to the first edge of a trip forces the\nappearing times of the subsequent edges. In this setting, we show that, quite\nsurprisingly, it is NP-complete to decide whether there exists an assignment of\ntimes connecting a given pair of nodes. This result allows us to prove that the\nproblem of maximising the temporal reachability cannot be approximated within a\nfactor better than some polynomial term in the size of the graph. We thus focus\non the case where, for each pair of nodes, there exists an assignment of times\nsuch that one node is reachable from the other. We call this property strong\ntemporalisability.

Thus far, research has mainly focused on architectures.\nNonetheless, model training is an equally important issue. A first problem is\nthe absence of ground truths, unavoidable in pansharpening. This is often\naddressed by training networks in a reduced resolution domain and using the\noriginal data as ground truth, relying on an implicit scale invariance\nassumption. However, on full resolution images results are often disappointing,\nsuggesting such invariance not to hold. A further problem is the scarcity of\ntraining data, which causes a limited generalization ability and a poor\nperformance on off-training test images. In this paper, we propose a\nfull-resolution training framework for deep learning-based pansharpening. The\nframework is fully general and can be used for any deep learning-based\npansharpening model. Training takes place in the high-resolution domain,\nrelying only on the original data, thus avoiding any loss of information. To\nensure spectral and spatial fidelity, a suitable two-component loss is defined.\nThe spectral component enforces consistency between the pansharpened output and\nthe low-resolution multispectral input. The spatial component, computed at\nhigh-resolution, maximizes the local correlation between each pansharpened band\nand the panchromatic input. At testing time, the target-adaptive operating\nmodality is adopted, achieving good generalization with a limited computational\noverhead. Experiments carried out on WorldView-3, WorldView-2, and GeoEye-1\nimages show that methods trained with the proposed framework guarantee a pretty\ngood performance in terms of both full-resolution numerical indexes and visual\nquality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 10:03:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 09:31:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 13:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

In the sequential tunneling regime we analyze the\nbehaviour of heat currents and rectification as functions of the position of\nthe energy levels and of the temperature bias.

We propose a\nmethod to study the multi-timescale material transport, leakage, and\nentrainment by eddies with their surroundings by constructing sequences of\nfinite-time coherent sets, computed as superlevel sets of dominant\neigenfunctions of dynamic Laplace operators. The dominant eigenvalues of\ndynamic Laplace operators defined on time intervals of varying length allows us\nto identify a maximal coherence timescale that minimizes the rate of mass loss\nover a domain, per unit flow time.

The model is described by a\nnumber of physical parameters that are related to various oscillation modes,\nquasi-linear combination tones or non-linear features that appear in the\npost-merger phase. The time evolution of the main post-merger frequency peak is\ntaken into account and it is described by a two-segment linear expression. The\neffectiveness of the model, in terms of the fitting factor or, equivalently,\nthe reduction in the detection rate, is evaluated along a sequence of\nequal-mass simulations of varying mass. We find that all parameters of the\nanalytic model correlate with the total binary mass of the system. For high\nmasses, we identify new spectral features originating from the non-linear\ncoupling between the quasi-radial oscillation and the antipodal tidal\ndeformation, the inclusion of which significantly improves the fitting factors\nachieved by the model. We can thus model the post-merger gravitational-wave\nemission with an analytic model that achieves high fitting factors for a wide\nrange of total binary masses. Our model can be used for the detection and\nparameter estimation of the post-merger phase in upcoming searches with\nupgraded second-generation detectors, such as aLIGO+ and aVirgo+, with future,\nthird-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer) or with\ndedicated, high-frequency detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 10:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 12:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

Most of the\nrecent speech enhancement approaches mainly focus on wide-band signal with a\nsampling rate of 16K Hz. However, research on super wide band (e.g., 32K Hz) or\neven full-band (48K) denoising is still lacked due to the difficulty of\nmodeling more frequency bands and particularly high frequency components. In\nthis paper, we extend our previous deep complex convolution recurrent neural\nnetwork (DCCRN) substantially to a super wide band version -- S-DCCRN, to\nperform speech denoising on speech of 32K Hz sampling rate. We first employ a\ncascaded sub-band and full-band processing module, which consists of two\nsmall-footprint DCCRNs -- one operates on sub-band signal and one operates on\nfull-band signal, aiming at benefiting from both local and global frequency\ninformation. Moreover, instead of simply adopting the STFT feature as input, we\nuse a complex feature encoder trained in an end-to-end manner to refine the\ninformation of different frequency bands. We also use a complex feature decoder\nto revert the feature to time-frequency domain. Finally, a learnable spectrum\ncompression method is adopted to adjust the energy of different frequency\nbands, which is beneficial for neural network learning. The proposed model,\nS-DCCRN, has surpassed PercepNet as well as several competitive models and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of speech quality and\nintelligibility.

Conventional MIMO communication\ntechniques require transmitting a considerable amount of training symbols as\npilots in each data block to obtain the channel state information (CSI) such\nthat the transmitted signals can be successfully recovered. However, the pilot\noverhead and contamination become a bottleneck for the practical application of\nMIMO systems with the increase of the number of antennas. To overcome this\nobstacle, we propose a blind channel estimation framework, where we introduce\nan auxiliary posterior distribution of CSI and the transmitted signals given\nthe received signals to derive a lower bound to the intractable likelihood\nfunction of the received signal. Meanwhile, we generate this auxiliary\ndistribution by a neural network based variational inference framework, which\nis trained by maximizing the lower bound. The optimal auxiliary distribution\nwhich approaches real prior distribution is then leveraged to obtain the\nmaximum a posterior (MAP) estimation of channel matrix and transmitted data.\nThe simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed blind\nchannel estimation method closely approaches that of the conventional\npilot-aided methods in terms of the channel estimation error and symbol error\nrate (SER) of the detected signals even without the help of pilots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 11:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Our results indicate that a classification-based multi-task learning\nscenario yields the best results, but that its performance is relatively\nsensitive to the dimensionality of the similarity space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 12:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

In a\nbackdoor attack, the attacker corrupts the training data so to induce an\nerroneous behaviour at test time. Test time errors, however, are activated only\nin the presence of a triggering event corresponding to a properly crafted input\nsample. In this way, the corrupted network continues to work as expected for\nregular inputs, and the malicious behaviour occurs only when the attacker\ndecides to activate the backdoor hidden within the network.

Linearised equations,\ndescribing the steady flow response to arbitrary surface modulations, are\nderived by assuming that surface modulations are shallow.

It requires new solutions that allow continuous unobstructed monitoring\nand reliable detection and prediction of seizures. A high variability in the\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) patterns exists among people, brain states, and time\ninstances during seizures, but also during non-seizure periods. This makes\nepileptic seizure detection very challenging, especially if data is grouped\nunder only seizure and non-seizure labels.\n  Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, a novel machine learning approach, comes in\nas a promising tool. However, it has certain limitations when the data shows a\nhigh intra-class variability. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel\nsemi-supervised learning approach based on a multi-centroid HD computing. The\nmulti-centroid approach allows to have several prototype vectors representing\nseizure and non-seizure states, which leads to significantly improved\nperformance when compared to a simple 2-class HD model.\n  Further, real-life data imbalance poses an additional challenge and the\nperformance reported on balanced subsets of data is likely to be overestimated.\nThus, we test our multi-centroid approach with three different dataset\nbalancing scenarios, showing that performance improvement is higher for the\nless balanced dataset. More specifically, up to 14% improvement is achieved on\nan unbalanced test set with 10 times more non-seizure than seizure data. At the\nsame time, the total number of sub-classes is not significantly increased\ncompared to the balanced dataset. Thus, the proposed multi-centroid approach\ncan be an important element in achieving a high performance of epilepsy\ndetection with real-life data balance or during online learning, where seizures\nare infrequent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 13:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

To capture the joint behaviour of precipitation aggregates\nevaluated at different spatial scales, parsimonious and effective models must\nbe built with knowledge of the underlying spatial process. Precipitation is\ndriven by a mixture of processes acting at different scales and intensities,\ne.g., convective and frontal, with extremes of aggregates for typical catchment\nsizes arising from extremes of only one of these processes, rather than a\ncombination of them. High-intensity convective events cause extreme spatial\naggregates at small scales but the contribution of lower-intensity large-scale\nfronts is likely to increase as the area aggregated increases. Thus, to capture\nsmall to large scale spatial aggregates within a single approach requires a\nmodel that can accurately capture the extremal properties of both convective\nand frontal events. Previous extreme value methods have ignored this mixture\nstructure; we propose a spatial extreme value model which is a mixture of two\ncomponents with different marginal and dependence models that are able to\ncapture the extremal behaviour of convective and frontal rainfall and more\nfaithfully reproduces spatial aggregates for a wide range of scales. Modelling\nextremes of the frontal component raises new challenges due to it exhibiting\nstrong long-range extremal spatial dependence. Our modelling approach is\napplied to fine-scale, high-dimensional, gridded precipitation data. We show\nthat accounting for the mixture structure improves the joint inference on\nextremes of spatial aggregates over regions of different sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 13:47:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 10:30:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 14:03:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 13:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

Reverse elastic channels (RECs) are an interesting class of\nsuch unreliable channels, where only a dishonest committer, say, Alice can\nmaliciously alter the channel. RECs have attracted recent interest in the study\nof several cryptographic primitives.\n  Our principal contribution is the REC commitment capacity characterization;\nthis proves a recent related conjecture. A key result is our tight converse\nwhich analyses a specific cheating strategy by Alice. RECs are closely related\nto the classic unfair noisy channels (UNCs); elastic channels (ECs), where only\na dishonest receiver Bob can alter the channel, are similarly related. In stark\ncontrast to UNCs, both RECs and ECs always exhibit positive commitment\nthroughput for all non-trivial parameters.

Does shape sensing\nemerge from wave-pinning? We show that wave pinning senses the cell's long\naxis. Simulating wave-pinning on a curved surface, we find that high-activity\ndomains migrate to peaks and troughs of the surface. For smooth surfaces, a\nsimple rule of minimizing the domain perimeter while keeping its area fixed\npredicts the final position of the domain and its shape. However, when we\nintroduce roughness to our surfaces, shape sensing can be disrupted, and\nhigh-activity domains can become localized to locations other than the global\npeaks and valleys of the surface. On rough surfaces, the domains of the\nwave-pinning model are more robust in finding the peaks and troughs than the\nminimization rule, though both can become trapped in steady states away from\nthe peaks and valleys. We can control the robustness of shape sensing by\naltering the Rho GTPase diffusivity and the domain size. We also find that the\nshape sensing properties of cell polarity models can explain how domains\nlocalize to curved regions of deformed cells. Our results help to understand\nthe factors that allow cells to sense their shape - and the limits that\nmembrane roughness can place on this process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 14:17:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 16:57:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 22:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

In higher dimensions, adaptation is possible if and\nonly if the underlying regularities belong to some interval of width at least\n$d/(d-4)$.

A naive conditioning on intercurrent events does\nnot have a straight-forward causal interpretation, and the practical relevance\nof other commonly used approaches is debated. In this work, we discuss how to\nformulate and choose an estimand, beyond the marginal intention to treat\neffect, from the point of view of a decision maker and drug developer. In\nparticular, we argue that careful articulation of a practically useful research\nquestion should either reflect decision making at this point in time or future\ndrug development. Indeed, a substantially interesting estimand is a\nformalization of the (plain English) description of a research question. A\ncommon feature of estimands that are practically useful is that they correspond\nto possibly hypothetical but well-defined interventions in identifiable\n(sub)populations. To illustrate our points, we consider five examples that were\nrecently used to motivate consideration of principal stratum estimands in\nclinical trials. In all of these examples, we propose alternative causal\nestimands, such as conditional effects, sequential regime effects and separable\neffects, that correspond to explicit research questions of substantial\ninterest. Certain questions require stronger assumptions for identification.\nHowever, we highlight that our proposed estimands require less stringent\nassumptions than estimands commonly targeted in these settings, including\nprincipal stratum effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 14:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

In this setting, we\nstudy the sensitivity of the expected occupancy at the facility to\nmischaracterizations of user profiles and uncharacterized heterogeneity. For\nuser profile mischaracterizations, we first provide a fundamental upper bound\nfor the difference between the expected occupancy under any two different\ndistributions on a user's impatience (i.e., value of time) that only depends on\nthe minimum and maximum charging rate offered by the charging facility. Next,\nwe consider the case when a user's impatience is a discrete random variable and\nstudy the sensitivity of the expected occupancy to the probability masses and\nattained values of the random variable. We show that the expected occupancy\nvaries linearly with respect to the probability masses and is piecewise\nconstant with respect to the attained values. Furthermore, we study the effects\non the expected occupancy from the occurrence of heterogeneous user\npopulations.

Based on the\n\"self-contradictory\" template, we create a novel dataset for the\nself-contradiction detection task. Conventional contradiction detection focuses\non comparing pairs of sentences or claims, but self-contradiction detection\nneeds to further reason the semantics of an article and simultaneously learn\nthe contradiction-aware comparison from all pairs of sentences. Therefore, we\npresent the first model, Pairwise Contradiction Neural Network (PCNN), to not\nonly effectively identify self-contradiction articles, but also highlight the\nmost contradiction pairs of contradiction sentences. The main idea of PCNN is\ntwo-fold. First, to mitigate the effect of data scarcity on self-contradiction\narticles, we pre-train the module of pairwise contradiction learning using SNLI\nand MNLI benchmarks. Second, we select top-K sentence pairs with the highest\ncontradiction probability values and model their correlation to determine\nwhether the corresponding article belongs to self-contradiction.

Previous work showed that this so-called memory\ndeduplication can be exploited in local attacks to break ASLR, spy on other\nprograms,and determine the presence of data, i.e., website images. All these\nattacks exploit memory deduplication across security domains, which in turn was\ndisabled. However, within a security domain or on an isolated system with no\nuntrusted local access, memory deduplication is still not considered a security\nrisk and was recently re-enabled on Windows by default.\n  In this paper, we present the first fully remote memorydeduplication attacks.\nUnlike previous attacks, our attacks require no local code execution.\nConsequently, we can disclose memory contents from a remote server merely by\nsending and timing HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 network requests. We demonstrate our\nattacks on deduplication both on Windows and Linux and attack widely used\nserver software such as Memcached and InnoDB. Our side channel leaks up to\n34.41 B/h over the internet, making it faster than comparable remote\nmemory-disclosure channels.

A\nstake-pool operates a node that engages in the PoS protocol and potentially\nrepresents a large number of smaller stakeholders. While such pooled PoS\noperation is attractive from various angles, it also exhibits a significant\nshortcoming that, so far and to the best of our knowledge, has not been\nsufficiently understood or investigated.

A recently proposed method is the regret minimization\nset (RMS) query. RMS returns a size $r$ subset $S$ of dataset $D$ that\nminimizes the regret-ratio (the difference between the score of top-1 in $S$\nand the score of top-1 in $D$, for any possible utility function). RMS is not\nshift invariant, causing inconsistency in results. Further, existing work\nshowed that the regret-ratio is often a made-up number and users may mistake\nits absolute value. Instead, users do understand the notion of rank. Thus it\nconsidered the problem of finding the minimal set $S$ with a rank-regret (the\nrank of top-1 tuple of $S$ in the sorted list of $D$) at most $k$, called the\nrank-regret representative (RRR) problem.\n  Corresponding to RMS, we focus on the min-error version of RRR, called the\nrank-regret minimization (RRM) problem, which finds a size $r$ set to minimize\nthe maximum rank-regret for all utility functions. Further, we generalize RRM\nand propose the restricted RRM (i.e., RRRM) problem to optimize the rank-regret\nfor functions restricted in a given space. Previous studies on both RMS and RRR\ndid not consider the restricted function space. The solution for RRRM usually\nhas a lower regret level and can better serve the specific preferences of some\nusers. Note that RRM and RRRM are shift invariant. In 2D space, we design a\ndynamic programming algorithm 2DRRM to return the optimal solution for RRM. In\nHD space, we propose an algorithm HDRRM that introduces a double approximation\nguarantee on rank-regret. Both 2DRRM and HDRRM are applicable for RRRM.\nExtensive experiments on the synthetic and real datasets verify the efficiency\nand effectiveness of our algorithms.

Microbial\ncommunities are a natural system to decipher this mechanistic basis because\ntheir interactions in the form of substrate consumption, metabolite production,\nand cross-feeding can be described explicitly in thermodynamic terms. Previous\nwork has considered how thermodynamic constraints impact competition between\npairs of species, but restrained from analysing how this manifests in complex\ndynamical systems. To address this gap, we develop a thermodynamic microbial\ncommunity model with fully reversible reaction kinetics, which allows direct\nconsideration of free-energy dissipation. This also allows species to interact\nvia products rather than just substrates, increasing the dynamical complexity,\nand allowing a more nuanced classification of interaction types to emerge.\nUsing this model, we find that community diversity increases with substrate\nlability, because greater free-energy availability allows for faster generation\nof niches. Thus, more niches are generated in the time frame of community\nestablishment, leading to higher final species diversity. We also find that\nallowing species to make use of near-to-equilibrium reactions increases\ndiversity in a low free-energy regime. In such a regime, two new thermodynamic\ninteraction types that we identify here reach comparable strengths to the\nconventional (competition and facilitation) types, emphasising the key role\nthat thermodynamics plays in community dynamics.

This requires careful image preprocessing, and\nit may not perform well in the situation of complicated bolt assemblies, or in\nthe presence of surrounding objects and background noise, thus hindering their\nreal-world applications. In this study, an integrated real-time detect-track\nmethod, namely RTDT-Bolt, is proposed to monitor the bolt rotation angle.\nFirst, a real-time convolutional-neural-networks-based object detector, named\nYOLOv3-tiny, is established and trained to localize structural bolts. Then, the\ntarget-free object tracking algorithm based on optical flow is implemented, to\ncontinuously monitor and quantify the rotation of structural bolts. In order to\nenhance the tracking performance against background noise and potential\nillumination changes during tracking, the YOLOv3-tiny is integrated with the\noptical flow tracking algorithm to re-detect the bolts when the tracking gets\nlost. Extensive parameter studies were conducted to identify optimal tracking\nperformance and examine the potential limitations. The results indicate the\nRTDT-Bolt method can greatly enhance the tracking performance of bolt rotation,\nwhich can achieve over 90% accuracy using the recommended range for the\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

Nanocrystalline phases have been\nrecently obtained by mechanosynthesis across the system, and the perovskite\nstructural evolution has been described. Two continuous solid solutions with\northorhombic Pnma and rhombohedral R3c symmetries were found, which coexist\nwithin a broad compositional interval of 0.5 < x < 0.9. This might be a\npolar-nonpolar morphotropic phase boundary region, at which strong phase-change\nmagnetoelectric responses can be expected. A major issue is phase decomposition\nat moderate temperatures that highly complicates ceramic processing. This is\nrequired for carrying out a sound electrical characterization and also for\ntheir use in devices. We present here the application of Spark Plasma Sintering\nto the ceramic processing of YMnO$_3$-BiFeO$_3$ phases. This advanced\ntechnique, when combined with nanocrystalline powders, allowed densifying\nphases at reduced processing temperatures and times, so that perovskite\ndecomposition was avoided. Electrical measurements were accomplished, and the\nresponse was shown to be mostly dominated by conduction. Nonetheless, the\nintrinsic dielectric permittivity was obtained, and a distinctive enhancement\nin the phase coexistence region was revealed.
