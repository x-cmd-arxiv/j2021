It presents parts of\nproteins (peptides) from inside a cell on its membrane surface enabling\nvisiting immune cells that detect non-self peptides to terminate the cell. The\nability to predict whether a peptide will get presented on MHC Class I\nmolecules helps in designing vaccines so they can activate the immune system to\ndestroy the invading disease protein. We designed a prediction model using a\nBERT-based architecture (ImmunoBERT) that takes as input a peptide and its\nsurrounding regions (N and C-terminals) along with a set of MHC class I (MHC-I)\nmolecules. We present a novel application of well known interpretability\ntechniques, SHAP and LIME, to this domain and we use these results along with\n3D structure visualizations and amino acid frequencies to understand and\nidentify the most influential parts of the input amino acid sequences\ncontributing to the output. In particular, we find that amino acids close to\nthe peptides' N- and C-terminals are highly relevant. Additionally, some\npositions within the MHC proteins (in particular in the A, B and F pockets) are\noften assigned a high importance ranking - which confirms biological studies\nand the distances in the structure visualizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 16:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

Manual determination of the\narchitecture for self-attention networks relies on the experience of experts\nand cannot automatically adapt to various scenarios. Meanwhile, neural\narchitecture search (NAS) has significantly advanced the automatic design of\nneural architectures. Thus, it is appropriate to consider using NAS methods to\ndiscover a better self-attention architecture automatically. However, it is\nchallenging to directly use existing NAS methods to search attention networks\nbecause of the uniform cell-based search space and the lack of long-term\ncontent dependencies. To address this issue, we propose a full-attention based\nNAS method. More specifically, a stage-wise search space is constructed that\nallows various attention operations to be adopted for different layers of a\nnetwork. To extract global features, a self-supervised search algorithm is\nproposed that uses context auto-regression to discover the full-attention\narchitecture. To verify the efficacy of the proposed methods, we conducted\nextensive experiments on various learning tasks, including image\nclassification, fine-grained image recognition, and zero-shot image retrieval.\nThe empirical results show strong evidence that our method is capable of\ndiscovering high-performance, full-attention architectures while guaranteeing\nthe required search efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 16:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

Then the\nsubtle motion information of the potential blob targets can be accurately\ncharacterized. This idea has been conduced in optical image sequences by\nsolving an motion optical flow field (MOFF) function. Nonetheless, due to the\nsparkle of the sonar echograph sequences, and strong interferences caused by\nwake and cavitation noise of fast-moving ship in harbor environments, the\nconstraints underlying the traditional motion optical flow function that is\ncouples the brightness constancy constant along time dimension of each echo\nintensity points and the motion field spatial smoothness does not hold in our\ncase.

In radiation therapy\napplications, the phase space of this density is composed of energy, spatial\nposition and direction of flight. The resulting six-dimensional phase space\nprohibits fine numerical discretizations, which are essential for the\nconstruction of accurate and reliable treatment plans. In this work, we tackle\nthe high dimensional phase space through a dynamical low-rank approximation of\nthe particle density. Dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) evolves the\nsolution on a low-rank manifold in time. Interpreting the energy variable as a\npseudo-time lets us employ the DLRA framework to represent the solution of the\nradiation transport equation on a low-rank manifold for every energy. Stiff\nscattering terms are treated through an efficient implicit energy\ndiscretization and a rank adaptive integrator is chosen to dynamically adapt\nthe rank in energy. To facilitate the use of boundary conditions and reduce the\noverall rank, the radiation transport equation is split into collided and\nuncollided particles through a collision source method. Uncollided particles\nare described by a directed quadrature set guaranteeing low computational\ncosts, whereas collided particles are represented by a low-rank solution. It\ncan be shown that the presented method is L$^2$-stable under a time step\nrestriction which does not depend on stiff scattering terms. Moreover, the\nimplicit treatment of scattering does not require numerical inversions of\nmatrices. Numerical results for radiation therapy configurations as well as the\nline source benchmark underline the efficiency of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 17:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

Design and\nperformance of control components are therefore tightly coupled with\ncommunication component performance. The information flow between vehicles can\nsignificantly affect the dynamics of a platoon. Therefore, both the performance\nand the stability of a platoon depend not only on the vehicle's controller but\nalso on the information flow Topology (IFT). The IFT can cause limitations for\ncertain platoon properties, i.e., stability and scalability. Cellular\nVehicle-To-Everything (C-V2X) has emerged as one of the main communication\ntechnologies to support connected and automated vehicle applications. As a\nresult of packet loss, wireless channels create random link interruption and\nchanges in network topologies. In this paper, we model the communication links\nbetween vehicles with a first-order Markov model to capture the prevalent time\ncorrelations for each link. These models enable performance evaluation through\nbetter approximation of communication links during system design stages.

Total population estimation, also called\ncapture-recapture, is an important problem in many biological and social\nsciences. A typical dataset consists of incomplete lists of individuals from\nthe population of interest along with some covariate information. The goal is\nto estimate the number of unobserved individuals and equivalently, the total\npopulation size. drpop flexibly models heterogeneity using the covariate\ninformation, under the assumption that two lists are conditionally independent\ngiven covariates. This can be a much weaker assumption than full marginal\nindependence often required by classical methods. Moreover, it can incorporate\ncomplex and high dimensional covariates, and does not require parametric models\nlike other popular methods. In particular, our estimator is doubly robust and\nhas fast convergence rates even under flexible non-parametric set-ups. drpop\nprovides the user with the flexibility to choose the model for estimation of\nintermediate parameters and returns the estimated population size, confidence\ninterval and some other related quantities. In this paper, we illustrate the\napplications of drpop in different scenarios and we also present some\nperformance summaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 20:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

The proposed model is adaptable to a large variety of garments and\nchanging topologies, without need of being retrained. Such simulations are\ntypically carried out by physics engines that require manual human expertise\nand are subjectto computationally intensive computations. PhysXNet, by\ncontrast, is a fully differentiable deep network that at inference is able to\nestimate the geometry of dense cloth meshes in a matter of milliseconds, and\nthus, can be readily deployed as a layer of a larger deep learning\narchitecture. This efficiency is achieved thanks to the specific\nparameterization of the clothes we consider, based on 3D UV maps encoding\nspatial garment displacements. The problem is then formulated as a mapping\nbetween the human kinematics space (represented also by 3D UV maps of the\nundressed body mesh) into the clothes displacement UV maps, which we learn\nusing a conditional GAN with a discriminator that enforces feasible\ndeformations. We train simultaneously our model for three garment templates,\ntops, bottoms and dresses for which we simulate deformations under 50 different\nhuman actions. Nevertheless, the UV map representation we consider allows\nencapsulating many different cloth topologies, and at test we can simulate\ngarments even if we did not specifically train for them. A thorough evaluation\ndemonstrates that PhysXNet delivers cloth deformations very close to those\ncomputed with the physical engine, opening the door to be effectively\nintegrated within deeplearning pipelines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 21:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

The objective is to\ninvestigate the attenuation mechanisms of vertically polarized seismic waves\ntraveling at the surface of unconsolidated substrates that are characterized by\npower-law rigidity profiles. Both geometric spreading and material damping due\nto skeletal dissipation are considered. An electromagnetic shaker is employed\nto excite the granular medium between 300 and 550 Hz, generating linear modes\nthat are localized near the surface. A densely sampled section is recorded at\nthe surface using a laser vibrometer. The explicit solution of the geometric\nattenuation law of Rayleigh-like waves in layered media is employed to\ncalculate the geometric spreading function of the vertically polarized surface\nmodes within the granular material. In accordance with recent studies, the\ndynamics of these small-amplitude multi-modal linear waves can be analysed by\nconsidering the granular medium as perfectly continuous and elastic. By\nperforming a non-linear regression analysis on particle displacements,\nextracted from experimental velocity data, we determine the frequency-dependent\nattenuation coefficients, which account for the material damping.\n  The findings of this work show that laboratory-scale physical models can be\nused to study the geometric spreading of vertically polarized seismic waves\ninduced by the soil inhomogeneity and characterize the material damping of the\nmedium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 21:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

Often, these equations are developed under the\nLagrange constraint, which makes the evolving orbital elements parameterise\ninstantaneous conics tangent to the orbit. Arbitrary mathematically, this\nchoice of a constraint is convenient under perturbations dependent only on\npositions. Under perturbations dependent also on velocities (like relativistic\ncorrections) the Lagrange constraint unnecessarily complicates solutions that\ncan be simplified by introducing a freedom in the orbit parameterisation, which\nis analogous to the gauge freedom in electrodynamics and gauge theories.\nGeometrically, this freedom is the freedom of nonosculation, i.e. of the degree\nto which the instantaneous conics are permitted to be non-tangent to the actual\norbit.

We develop a self-supervised\ndeep learning-based method entitled \"SDnDTI\" for denoising DTI data, which does\nnot require additional high-SNR data for training. Specifically, SDnDTI divides\nmulti-directional DTI data into many subsets, each consisting of six DWI\nvolumes along optimally chosen diffusion-encoding directions that are robust to\nnoise for the tensor fitting, and then synthesizes DWI volumes along all\nacquired directions from the diffusion tensors fitted using each subset of the\ndata as the input data of CNNs.

SDnDTI\nremoves noise from each subset of synthesized DWI volumes using a deep\n3-dimensional CNN to match the quality of the cleaner target DWI volumes and\nachieves even higher SNR by averaging all subsets of denoised data.

However, function scheduling, a critical component\nof serverless systems, has been overlooked. In this paper, we take a\nfirst-principles approach toward designing a scheduler that caters to the\nunique characteristics of serverless functions as seen in real-world\ndeployments. We first create a taxonomy of scheduling policies along three\ndimensions. Next, we use simulation to explore the scheduling policy space for\nthe function characteristics in a 14-day trace of Azure functions and conclude\nthat frequently used features such as late binding and random load balancing\nare sub-optimal for common execution time distributions and load ranges. We use\nthese insights to design Hermes, a scheduler for serverless functions with\nthree key characteristics. First, to avoid head-of-line blocking due to high\nfunction execution time variability, Hermes uses a combination of early binding\nand processor sharing for scheduling at individual worker machines. Second,\nHermes uses a hybrid load balancing approach that improves consolidation at low\nload while employing least-loaded balancing at high load to retain high\nperformance. Third, Hermes is both load and locality-aware, reducing the number\nof cold starts compared to pure load-based policies. We implement Hermes for\nApache OpenWhisk and demonstrate that, for the case of the function patterns\nobserved both in the Azure and in other real-world traces, it achieves up to\n85% lower function slowdown and 60% higher throughput compared to existing\npolicies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 02:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

Based on Dewitt's approach, we calculate the gravitational Casimir\nenergy cost of the binary plane, which consists of statically gravitational\neffects and deformation-induced effects. It is found that the static effects\ninclude a term coming from the self-gravity of the orbital plane and the\ncontribution of Newtonian gravitational potential of the binary system. While\nthe deformation-induced effect also results from two parts, i.e. the\ninstability of orbital binding energy, scaling as $\\frac{1}{(R-r)^2}$, and the\ndynamically Casimir energy cost of the orbital binding energy, decaying as\n$\\frac{1}{(R-r)^4}$. The dynamically gravitational Casimir phenomena and the\ncorresponding energy cost modify the spiral-in orbital motion of the binary and\nthus the frequency of released gravitational waves (GWs). We consider the\nmechanical response of two NS components and qualitatively study the\ncorrections to the orbital motion of the system and the GW frequencies. It is\nfound that the dynamical Casimir effects exert a dissipative force on the\nbinary plane, depending on the frequency of GWs. The resultant dissipation may\nenhance with the decaying separation and increasing GW frequencies, which\nsubsequently accelerates the orbital decay of the binary. However, the\ndissipation rate just has an order of $10^{-70}$ eV/s. So the corrections to\nthe dynamics of NS binaries are very marginal, by considering the wide\nseparation, the cosmological coalescence time, and low-frequency GWs of the\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 03:18:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2022 05:48:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

However, many existing ESNs have limitations for properly\nmodeling high-dimensional data. The most important limitation of these networks\nis the high memory consumption due to their reservoir structure, which has\nprevented the increase of reservoir units and the maximum use of special\ncapabilities of this type of network. One way to solve this problem is to use\nquaternion algebra. Because quaternions have four different dimensions,\nhigh-dimensional data are easily represented and, using Hamilton\nmultiplication, with fewer parameters than real numbers, make external\nrelations between the multidimensional features easier. In addition to the\nmemory problem in the ESN network, the linear output of the ESN network poses\nan indescribable limit to its processing capacity, as it cannot effectively\nutilize higher-order statistics of features provided by the nonlinear dynamics\nof reservoir neurons. In this research, a new structure based on ESN is\npresented, in which quaternion algebra is used to compress the network data\nwith the simple split function, and the output linear combiner is replaced by a\nmultidimensional bilinear filter. This filter will be used for nonlinear\ncalculations of the output layer of the ESN. In addition, the two-dimensional\nprincipal component analysis technique is used to reduce the number of data\ntransferred to the bilinear filter. In this study, the coefficients and the\nweights of the quaternion nonlinear ESN (QNESN) are optimized using the genetic\nalgorithm. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model compared\nto the previous methods, experiments for speech emotion recognition have been\nperformed on EMODB, SAVEE, and IEMOCAP speech emotional datasets.

Here\nwe develop a new method to recover the three-dimensional (3D) turbulent\nvelocity dispersion (${\\sigma}_{v,3D}$) from position-position-velocity (PPV)\ndata. We simulate a rotating, turbulent, collapsing molecular cloud and compare\nits intrinsic ${\\sigma}_{v,3D}$ with three different measures of the velocity\ndispersion accessible in PPV space: 1) the spatial mean of the 2nd-moment map,\n${\\sigma}_i$, 2) the standard deviation of the gradient/rotation-corrected\n1st-moment map, ${\\sigma}_{(c-grad)}$, and 3) a combination of 1) and 2),\ncalled the 'gradient-corrected parent velocity dispersion',\n${\\sigma}_{(p-grad)}=({\\sigma}^2_i+{\\sigma}^2_{(c-grad)})^{1/2}$. We show that\nthe gradient correction is crucial in order to recover purely turbulent motions\nof the cloud, independent of the orientation of the cloud with respect to the\nline of sight (LOS). We find that with a suitable correction factor and\nappropriate filters applied to the moment maps, all three statistics can be\nused to recover ${\\sigma}_{v,3D}$, with method 3 being the most robust and\nreliable. We determine the correction factor as a function of the telescope\nbeam size for different levels of cloud rotation, and find that for a beam FWHM\n$f$ and cloud radius $R$, the 3D turbulent velocity dispersion can best be\nrecovered from the gradient-corrected parent velocity dispersion via\n${\\sigma}_{v,3D}=[(-0.29\\pm0.26)f/R+1.93\\pm0.15]{\\sigma}_{(p-grad)}$ for\n$f/R<1$, independent of the level of cloud rotation or LOS orientation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 04:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

In this paper, we propose a novel 3D point cloud\nlearning network, referred to as Dynamic Point Feature Aggregation Network\n(DPFA-Net), by selectively performing the neighborhood feature aggregation with\ndynamic pooling and an attention mechanism. DPFA-Net has two variants for\nsemantic segmentation and classification of 3D point clouds. As the core module\nof the DPFA-Net, we propose a Feature Aggregation layer, in which features of\nthe dynamic neighborhood of each point are aggregated via a self-attention\nmechanism. In contrast to other segmentation models, which aggregate features\nfrom fixed neighborhoods, our approach can aggregate features from different\nneighbors in different layers providing a more selective and broader view to\nthe query points, and focusing more on the relevant features in a local\nneighborhood. In addition, to further improve the performance of the proposed\nsemantic segmentation model, we present two novel approaches, namely Two-Stage\nBF-Net and BF-Regularization to exploit the background-foreground information.\nExperimental results show that the proposed DPFA-Net achieves the\nstate-of-the-art overall accuracy score for semantic segmentation on the S3DIS\ndataset, and provides a consistently satisfactory performance across different\ntasks of semantic segmentation, part segmentation, and 3D object\nclassification.

Under certain\ndecay assumptions on the plane wave, we conclude that the perturbed system\nadmits a globally smooth solution if the perturbation is non-small along the\ntravelling direction of the plane wave, while the perturbation along the\ntransversal direction is sufficiently small. By choosing a gauge adapted to the\nplane wave solution, we deduce an equivalent Euler-Lagrangian equation for the\nperturbation whose quasilinear structure is reflected precisely in the induced\ngeometry of the relativistic string. It then helps to proceed a geometrically\nadapted and weighted energy argument for which robust estimates suffice.\nMoreover, due to the non-trivial background solutions, the induced metric of\nthe relativistic string involves linear perturbations with undetermined signs,\nand hence a key observation is needed to guarantee that the energies associated\nto the multipliers are positive up to lower order terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 07:05:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

Recent inpainting methods have introduced\nperceptual and style losses as auxiliary losses to guide the learning of\ninpainting generators. Perceptual and style losses help improve the perceptual\nquality of inpainted results by supervising deep features of generated regions.\nHowever, two challenges have emerged with the usage of auxiliary losses: (i)\nthe time-consuming grid search is required to decide weights for perceptual and\nstyle losses to properly perform, and (ii) loss terms with different auxiliary\nabilities are equally weighted by perceptual and style losses. To meet these\ntwo challenges, we propose a novel framework that independently weights\nauxiliary loss terms and adaptively adjusts their weights within a single\ntraining process, without a time-consuming grid search. Specifically, to\nrelease the auxiliary potential of perceptual and style losses, we propose two\nauxiliary losses, Tunable Perceptual Loss (TPL) and Tunable Style Loss (TSL) by\nusing different tunable weights to consider the contributions of different loss\nterms. TPL and TSL are supersets of perceptual and style losses and release the\nauxiliary potential of standard perceptual and style losses. We further propose\nthe Auxiliary Weights Adaptation (AWA) algorithm, which efficiently reweights\nTPL and TSL in a single training process. AWA is based on the principle that\nthe best auxiliary weights would lead to the most improvement in inpainting\nperformance. We conduct experiments on publically available datasets and find\nthat our framework helps current SOTA methods achieve better results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 08:45:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 00:45:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 02:38:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 12:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

At early stages of the Big-Bang, the inflaton\ntrapped in the minimum at $\\phi = 0$ gets uplifted due to interaction with\nneutrinos and starts to roll down to one of the degenerate minima of the\neffective potential and after a while gets anchored at this minimum, which in\nturn evolves in time very slowly.

One of such regimes occurs in bosonic\nsystems, where nowadays one can induce driving and dissipation through pairs of\nexcitations, rather than the conventional single-excitation processes.\nMoreover, modern platforms can be driven in a way in which the modes of the\nbosonic array decay collectively rather than locally, such that the pairs of\nexcitations recorded by the environment come from a coherent superposition of\nall sites. In this work we analyze the superfluid phases accessible to bosonic\narrays subject to these novel mechanisms more characteristic of quantum optics,\nwhich we prove to lead to remarkable spatiotemporal properties beyond the\ntraditional scope of pattern formation in condensed-matter systems or nonlinear\noptics alone. We show that, even in the presence of residual local loss, the\nsystem is stabilized into an exotic state with bosons condensed along the modes\nof a closed manifold in Fourier space, with a distribution of the population\namong these Fourier modes that can be controlled via a weak bias (linear)\ndrive. This gives access to a plethora of different patterns, ranging from\nperiodic and quasi-periodic ones with tunable spatial wavelength, to\nhomogeneously-populated closed-Fourier-manifold condensates that are thought to\nplay an important role in some open problems of condensed-matter physics.\nMoreover, we show that when any residual local linear dissipation is balanced\nwith pumping, new constants of motion emerge that can force the superfluid to\noscillate in time, similarly to the mechanism behind the recently discovered\nsuperfluid time crystals. We propose specific experimental implementations with\nwhich this rich and unusual spatiotemporal superfluid behavior can be explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 12:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

Each single model is based on a mathematical\nformulation that we call a rule-based system. They have several advantages, for\nexample that they can be both interpreted both stochastically and\ndeterministically without changing the model structure. Rule-based systems\nshould be easier to communicate to non-specialists, when compared to\ndifferential equations. Due to their combinatorial nature, the rule-based model\nframework we propose is ideal for systematic mathematical modelling, systematic\nlinks to statistics, data analysis in general and machine learning. Most\nimportantly, the framework can be used inside a Bayesian model selection\nalgorithm, which can extend unsupervised machine learning technology to gain\nmechanistic insight through mathematical models. We first introduce the\nBayesian model selection algorithm and give an introduction to rule-based\nsystems. We propose precursor models, all consistent with our rule-based\nframework and relevant for the COVID-19 pandemic. We complement the models with\nnumerical results and, for some of them, we include analytical results such as\nthe calculation of the number of new infections generated by an infected person\nduring their infectious period.

Hence, when the topology is\nnon-informative for label prediction, ordinary GNNs may work significantly\nworse than simply applying multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) on each node. To\ntackle the above problem, we propose a new $p$-Laplacian based GNN model,\ntermed as $^p$GNN, whose message passing mechanism is derived from a discrete\nregularization framework and could be theoretically explained as an\napproximation of a polynomial graph filter defined on the spectral domain of\n$p$-Laplacians.

In this paper, interference\nmanagement is studied in a Laser-based optical wireless network where\nvertical-cavity surface-emitting (VCSEL) lasers are used for data transmission.\nIn particular, rate splitting (RS) and hierarchical rate splitting (HRS) are\nproposed to align multi-user interference, while maximizing the multiplexing\ngain of the network. Basically, RS serves multiple users simultaneously by\nsplitting a message of a user into common and private messages, each message\nwith a certain level of power, while on the other side users decode their\nmessages following a specific methodology. The performance of the conventional\nRS scheme is limited in high density wireless networks. Therefore, the HRS\nscheme is developed aiming to achieve high rates where users are divided into\nmultiple groups, and a new message called outer common message is used for\nmanaging inter-group interference. We formulate an optimization problem that\naddresses power allocation among the messages of the HRS scheme to further\nenhance the performance of the network.

However, privacy has become an issue of great concern, as the\nidentities of people used to train affective models can be exposed in the\nprocess. For instance, malicious individuals could exploit images from users\nand assume their identities. In addition, affect recognition using images can\nlead to discriminatory and algorithmic bias, as certain information such as\nrace, gender, and age could be assumed based on facial features. Possible\nsolutions to protect the privacy of users and avoid misuse of their identities\nare to: (1) extract anonymised facial features, namely action units (AU) from a\ndatabase of images, discard the images and use AUs for processing and training,\nand (2) federated learning (FL) i.e. process raw images in users' local\nmachines (local processing) and send the locally trained models to the main\nprocessing machine for aggregation (central processing). In this paper, we\npropose a two-level deep learning architecture for affect recognition that uses\nAUs in level 1 and FL in level 2 to protect users' identities. The architecture\nconsists of recurrent neural networks to capture the temporal relationships\namongst the features and predict valence and arousal affective states.

We\npredict the effects of the curvature-induced drift of skyrmions under the\naction of the curvature gradients without any external stimuli. The strength of\nthe curvature-induced driving force essentially depends on the skyrmion type,\nNeel or Bloch, while the trajectory of motion is determined by the type of\nmagnetic ordering: ferro- or antiferromagnetic. When moving on the surface,\nskyrmions undergo deformations that depend on the type of skyrmion. In the\nsmall-curvature limit, using the collective-variable approach we show, that the\ndriving force acting on a Neel skyrmion is linear in the gradient of the mean\ncurvature. The driving acting on a Bloch skyrmion is much smaller: it is\nproportional to the product of the mean curvature and its gradient. In contrast\nto the fast Neel skyrmions, the dynamics of the slow Bloch skyrmions is\nessentially affected by the skyrmion profile deformation. For the sake of\nsimplicity, we restrict ourselves to the case of zero Gaussian curvature and\nconsider cylindrical surfaces of general type.

For a massive particle, the spacetime splits of\nthe velocity, acceleration, momentum, and force four-vectors with the\nnormalized four-velocity of the fiducial observer, at rest in the coordinate\nsystem of the spacetime metric, are given, where the proper time of the\nfiducial observer is identified, and the contribution of the bivector\nconnection is considered, and with these results, a three-dimensional analogue\nof Newton's second law for this particle in curved spacetime is achieved.\nFinally, as a comprehensive application of the techniques constructed in this\npaper, a geometric algebra approach to gyroscopic precession is provided, where\nfor a gyroscope moving in the Lense-Thirring spacetime, the precessional\nangular velocity of its spin is derived in a signature invariant manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 14:14:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 12:35:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 06:50:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 01:07:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

Traditionally, this has been\ndone by identifying the object regions in the images by utilizing pre-trained\nmodels to perform object detection, object segmentation and/or object pose\nestimation. Although using pre-trained models is a viable approach, it has\nseveral limitations in the need for an exhaustive annotation of object\ncategories, a possible domain gap between datasets, and a bias that is\ntypically present in pre-trained models. In this work, we propose to utilize\nthe common rationale that a sequence of video frames capture a set of common\nobjects and interactions between them, thus a notion of co-segmentation between\nthe video frame features may equip the model with the ability to automatically\nfocus on task-specific salient regions and improve the underlying task's\nperformance in an end-to-end manner. In this regard, we propose a generic\nmodule called ``Co-Segmentation inspired Attention Module'' (COSAM) that can be\nplugged in to any CNN model to promote the notion of co-segmentation based\nattention among a sequence of video frame features. We show the application of\nCOSAM in three video-based tasks namely: 1) Video-based person re-ID, 2) Video\ncaptioning, & 3) Video action classification and demonstrate that COSAM is able\nto capture the task-specific salient regions in video frames, thus leading to\nnotable performance improvements along with interpretable attention maps for a\nvariety of video-based vision tasks, with possible application to other\nvideo-based vision tasks as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 15:35:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 19:34:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 22:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

A major obstacle to practical applications of Gibbs distributions is\nthe need to estimate their partition functions. The state of the art in\naddressing this problem is multi-stage algorithms, which consist of a cooling\nschedule, and a mean estimator in each step of the schedule. While the cooling\nschedule in these algorithms is adaptive, the mean estimation computations use\nMCMC as a black-box to draw approximate samples.

However, these methods also implicitly assume that the users are\nindependent of each other without considering the influence between users. In\nfact, this influence plays an important role in sequence recommendation since\nthe behavior of a user is easily affected by others. Therefore, it is desirable\nto aggregate both user behaviors and the influence between users, which are\nevolved temporally and involved in the heterogeneous graph of users and items.\nIn this paper, we incorporate dynamic user-item heterogeneous graphs to propose\na novel sequential recommendation framework.

In this\narticle, we studied the electric quadrupolar frequency shift of 131Xe atoms\nwith the silicon wall of the micro-machined vapor cell. A cylinder\nmicro-machined vapor cell is utilized in the experiment and a large part of the\ninner cell surface is composed of silicon material. We studied the temperature\ndependence of the 129Xe spin relaxation and 131Xe frequency shifts to evaluate\nthe interaction of the nuclear spin with container wall and the alkali metal\natoms. The results show that the average twisted angle of the 131Xe nuclear\nspins as they collide with the silicon wall is measured to be 29 *10^-6 rad.\nThe desorption energy for the 131Xe nuclear spin to escape from the silicon\nsurface is Esi = 0.009eV . This study could help to improve the bias stability\nof the CASG which is a key parameter for the gyroscope as well as may developes\na method to study the surface property of various material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 13:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Besides supply and demand, crude oil prices are largely influenced by\nvarious factors, such as economic development, financial markets, conflicts,\nwars, and political events. Most previous research treats crude oil price\nforecasting as a time series or econometric variable prediction problem.\nAlthough recently there have been researches considering the effects of\nreal-time news events, most of these works mainly use raw news headlines or\ntopic models to extract text features without profoundly exploring the event\ninformation. In this study, a novel crude oil price forecasting framework,\nAGESL, is proposed to deal with this problem. In our approach, an open domain\nevent extraction algorithm is utilized to extract underlying related events,\nand a text sentiment analysis algorithm is used to extract sentiment from\nmassive news. Then a deep neural network integrating the news event features,\nsentimental features, and historical price features is built to predict future\ncrude oil prices. Empirical experiments are performed on West Texas\nIntermediate (WTI) crude oil price data, and the results show that our approach\nobtains superior performance compared with several benchmark methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 08:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

The\nsuccess of this type of detector technology relies on its capability to detect\nboth primary scintillation and ionization signals from particle interactions in\nliquid xenon (LXe). The ionization electrons are converted into\nelectroluminescence in the gas xenon (GXe), where a single electron can be\namplified by more than 100 times in number of photons in a strong electric\nfield. Maintaining a strong and uniform electric field in the small gas gap in\nlarge diameter TPCs is challenging. One alternative solution is to produce the\nelectroluminescence in the LXe directly to overcome the gas gap uniformity\nproblem. Here we report on the design and performance of a single-phase Radial\nTPC (RTPC) which can create and detect the electroluminescence directly in LXe.\nIt simplifies the design and operation of the LXe TPC by using a single wire in\nthe axial center to create the strong electric field.

Comparing to the recent development of\nbackpropagation-based (BP-based) methods that are able to train spiking neural\nnetworks (SNNs) with high accuracy, biologically plausible methods are still in\ntheir infancy. In this work, we wish to answer the question of whether it is\npossible to attain comparable accuracy of SNNs trained by BP-based rules with\nbio-plausible mechanisms. We propose a new bio-plausible learning framework,\nconsisting of two components: a new architecture, and its supporting learning\nrules. With two types of cells and four types of synaptic connections, the\nproposed local microcircuit architecture can compute and propagate error\nsignals through local feedback connections and support training of multi-layers\nSNNs with a globally defined spiking error function. Under our microcircuit\narchitecture, we employ the Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) rule\noperating in local compartments to update synaptic weights and achieve\nsupervised learning in a biologically plausible manner. Finally, We interpret\nthe proposed framework from an optimization point of view and show the\nequivalence between it and the BP-based rules under a special circumstance. Our\nexperiments show that the proposed framework demonstrates learning accuracy\ncomparable to BP-based rules and may provide new insights on how learning is\norchestrated in biological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 10:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}
