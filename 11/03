To tune these properties however, a good control over features size\nand shape is essential. Here, a versatile fabrication process is presented to\nachieve tailored silicon nanostructures (thin/thick pillars,\nsharp/truncated/re-entrant cones), of pitch down to ~50 nm, and high-aspect\nratio (>10). The approach relies on pre-assembled block copolymer (BCP)\nmicelles and their direct transfer into a glass hard mask of an arbitrary\nthickness, now enabled by our recently reported regenerative secondary mask\nlithography. During this pattern transfer, not only the mask diameter can be\ndecreased but also uniquely increased; constituting the first method to achieve\nsuch tunability without necessitating a different molecular weight BCP.\nConsequently, the hard mask modulation (height, diameter) advances the\nflexibility in attainable inter-pillar spacing, aspect ratios, and re-entrant\nprofiles (= glass on silicon). Combined with adjusted silicon etch conditions,\nthe morphology of nanopatterns can be highly customized. The process control\nand scalability enable uniform patterning of a 6-inch wafer which is verified\nthrough cross-wafer excellent antireflectivity (<5%) and water-repellency\n(advancing contact angle 158{\\deg}; hysteresis 1{\\deg}). It is envisioned the\nimplementation of this approach to silicon nanostructuring to be far-reaching,\nfacilitating fundamental studies and targeting applications spanning solar\npanels, antifogging/antibacterial surfaces, sensing, amongst many others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 16:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

But, beyond its role\nin MOND, the question: 'Why should a critical gravitational acceleration scale\nexist at all?' remains unanswered. There is no deep understanding about what is\ngoing on.\n  Over roughly the same period that MOND has been a topic of controversy,\nBaryshev, Sylos Labini, Pietronero and others have been arguing, with equal\ncontroversy in earlier years, that, on medium scales at least, material in the\nuniverse is distributed in a quasi-fractal $D\\approx 2$ fashion. There is a\nlink: if the idea of a quasi-fractal $D \\approx 2$ universe on medium scales is\ntaken seriously then there is an associated characteristic mass surface density\nscale, $\\Sigma_F$ say, and an associated characteristic gravitational\nacceleration scale, $a_F = 4 \\pi G \\Sigma_F$. If, furthermore, the\nquasi-fractal structure is taken to include the inter-galactic medium, then it\nis an obvious step to consider the possibility that $a_0$ and $a_F$ are the\nsame thing.\n  Subsequently, via a modern geometric realization of the Leibniz-Mach\nworldview, we obtain a detailed theoretical understanding of how galaxy disks\nshould interact with a $D\\approx 2$ quasi-fractal IGM. This understanding takes\nthe form of a superficially unremarkable scaling relationship which, used with\nstandard photometric mass-modelling applied to SPARC data, shows that $a_F\n\\approx 1.2\\times 10^{-10}\\, mtrs/sec^2$ is explicitly embedded in that data.\nSince the scaling relationship also gives rise to the Baryonic Tully-Fisher\nRelationship, but with $a_0$ replaced by $a_F$, we are led unambiguously to the\nconclusion that $a_0$ and $a_F$ are, in reality, one and the same thing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 16:05:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 12:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

Protoplanetary disks around young stars often contain substructures\nlike rings, gaps, and spirals that could be caused by interactions between the\ndisk and forming planets. Aims. We aim to study the young (1-3 Myr) star DR Tau\nin the near-infrared and characterize its disk, which was previously resolved\nthrough sub-millimeter interferometry with ALMA, and to search for possible\nsub-stellar companions embedded into it. Methods. We observed DR Tau with\nVLT/SPHERE both in polarized light (H broad band) and total intensity (in Y, J,\nH, and K spectral bands). We also performed L' band observations with\nLBTI/LMIRCam on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). Results. We found two\npreviously undetected spirals extending north-east and south of the star,\nrespectively. We further detected an arc-like structure north of the star.\nFinally a bright, compact and elongated structure was detected at separation of\n303 +/- 10 mas and position angle 21.2 +/- 3.7 degrees, just at the root of the\nnorth-east spiral arm. Since this feature is visible both in polarized light\nand in total intensity and has a flat spectrum it is likely caused by stellar\nlight scattered by dust. Conclusions. The two spiral arms are at different\nseparation from the star, have very different pitch angles, and are separated\nby an apparent discontinuity, suggesting they might have a different origin.\nThe very open southern spiral arm might be caused by infalling material from\nlate encounters with cloudlets into the formation environment of the star\nitself. The compact feature could be caused by interaction with a planet in\nformation still embedded in its dust envelope and it could be responsible for\nlaunching the north-east spiral.

The 2020 statements therefore provide\na unique opportunity to learn from the broader impact experiment: to\ninvestigate the benefits and challenges of this and similar governance\nmechanisms, as well as providing an insight into how ML researchers think about\nthe societal impacts of their own work. Such learning is needed as NeurIPS and\nother venues continue to question and adapt their policies. To enable this, we\nhave created a dataset containing the impact statements from all NeurIPS 2020\npapers, along with additional information such as affiliation type, location\nand subject area, and a simple visualisation tool for exploration. We also\nprovide an initial quantitative analysis of the dataset, covering\nrepresentation, engagement, common themes, and willingness to discuss potential\nharms alongside benefits.

Drawing on these findings, we discuss the\npotential benefits and negative outcomes of ethics statement requirements, and\ntheir possible causes and associated challenges. These lead us to several\nlessons to be learnt from the 2020 requirement: (i) the importance of creating\nthe right incentives, (ii) the need for clear expectations and guidance, and\n(iii) the importance of transparency and constructive deliberation.

This paper explores methodology to\nidentify check-worthy claim sentences from fake news articles, irrespective of\ndomain, without explicit sentence-level annotations.

However,\ndistance estimation is very challenging using 2D monocular cameras. This paper\npresents a deep learning framework that consists of two deep networks for depth\nestimation and object detection using a single image. Firstly, objects in the\nscene are detected and localized using the You Only Look Once (YOLOv5) network.\nIn parallel, the estimated depth image is computed using a deep autoencoder\nnetwork to detect the relative distances. The proposed object detection based\nYOLO was trained using a supervised learning technique, in turn, the network of\ndepth estimation was self-supervised training. The presented distance\nestimation framework was evaluated on real images of outdoor scenes.

Existing approaches usually rely on proposals or clustering to\nsegment foreground instances. As a result, they struggle to achieve real-time\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time end-to-end panoptic\nsegmentation network for LiDAR point clouds, called CPSeg. In particular, CPSeg\ncomprises a shared encoder, a dual-decoder, and a cluster-free instance\nsegmentation head, which is able to dynamically pillarize foreground points\naccording to the learned embedding. Then, it acquires instance labels by\nfinding connected pillars with a pairwise embedding comparison. Thus, the\nconventional proposal-based or clustering-based instance segmentation is\ntransformed into a binary segmentation problem on the pairwise embedding\ncomparison matrix. To help the network regress instance embedding, a fast and\ndeterministic depth completion algorithm is proposed to calculate the surface\nnormal of each point cloud in real-time. The proposed method is benchmarked on\ntwo large-scale autonomous driving datasets: SemanticKITTI and nuScenes.\nNotably, extensive experimental results show that CPSeg achieves\nstate-of-the-art results among real-time approaches on both datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 16:44:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 00:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

In this study, we present the\ndiscovery of TOI-2257 b (TIC 198485881), a long-period (35 d) sub-Neptune\norbiting an M3 star at 57.8pc.

Accordingly, a central problem in neuromorphic computing is training\nspiking neural networks (SNNs) to reproduce spatio-temporal spiking patterns in\nresponse to given spiking stimuli. Most existing approaches model the\ninput-output behavior of an SNN in a deterministic fashion by assigning each\ninput to a specific desired output spiking sequence. In contrast, in order to\nfully leverage the time-encoding capacity of spikes, this work proposes to\ntrain SNNs so as to match distributions of spiking signals rather than\nindividual spiking signals. To this end, the paper introduces a novel hybrid\narchitecture comprising a conditional generator, implemented via an SNN, and a\ndiscriminator, implemented by a conventional artificial neural network (ANN).\nThe role of the ANN is to provide feedback during training to the SNN within an\nadversarial iterative learning strategy that follows the principle of\ngenerative adversarial network (GANs). In order to better capture multi-modal\nspatio-temporal distribution, the proposed approach -- termed SpikeGAN -- is\nfurther extended to support Bayesian learning of the generator's weight.\nFinally, settings with time-varying statistics are addressed by proposing an\nonline meta-learning variant of SpikeGAN.

If, however, such\npairs are obtained via record linkage of two files, this assumption can be\nviolated as a result of mismatch error rooting, for example, in the lack of\nreliable identifiers in the two files. Recently, there has been a surge of\ninterest in this setting under the term \"Shuffled data\" in which the underlying\ncorrect pairing of (X, Y)-pairs is represented via an unknown index\npermutation. Explicit modeling of the permutation tends to be associated with\nsubstantial overfitting, prompting the need for suitable methods of\nregularization. In this paper, we propose a flexible exponential family prior\non the permutation group for this purpose that can be used to integrate various\nstructures such as sparse and locally constrained shuffling. This prior turns\nout to be conjugate for canonical shuffled data problems in which the\nlikelihood conditional on a fixed permutation can be expressed as product over\nthe corresponding (X,Y)-pairs. Inference is based on the EM algorithm in which\nthe intractable E-step is approximated by the Fisher-Yates algorithm. The\nM-step is shown to admit a significant reduction from $n^2$ to $n$ terms if the\nlikelihood of (X,Y)-pairs has exponential family form as in the case of\ngeneralized linear models. Comparisons on synthetic and real data show that the\nproposed approach compares favorably to competing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 17:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

In a narrow region\nof phase space, they are emitted with velocities smaller than the escape\nvelocity of the solar system, thereby populating a gravitationally bound\ndensity that can accumulate over the solar lifetime, referred to as a \"solar\nbasin.\" Detection strategies that can succeed in spite of (or even be enhanced\nby) the low particle velocities are therefore poised to explore new regions of\nparameter space when taking this solar population into account. Here we\nidentify \"direct deflection\" as a powerful method to detect such a population\nof millicharged particles. This approach involves distorting the local flow of\ngravitationally bound millicharges with an oscillating electromagnetic field\nand measuring these distortions with a resonant LC circuit. Since it is easier\nto distort the flow of slowly moving particles, the signal is parametrically\nenhanced by the small solar escape velocity near Earth.

Whilst modern simulations reliably\nproduce populations of quiescent massive galaxies at z<2, it is also crucial to\nassess the similarities and differences of the responsible AGN populations.\nHere, we compare the AGN population of the Illustris, TNG100, TNG300,\nHorizon-AGN, EAGLE, and SIMBA simulations. The AGN luminosity function (LF)\nvaries significantly between simulations. Although in agreement with current\nobservational constraints at z=0, at higher redshift the agreement of the LFs\ndeteriorates with most simulations producing too many AGN of L_{x, 2-10\nkeV}~10^43-10^44 erg/s. AGN feedback in some simulations prevents the existence\nof any bright AGN with L_{x, 2-10 keV}>=10^45 erg/s (although this is sensitive\nto AGN variability), and leads to smaller fractions of AGN in massive galaxies\nthan in the observations at z<=2. We find that all the simulations fail at\nproducing a number density of AGN in good agreement with observational\nconstraints for both luminous (L_{x, 2-10 keV}~10^43-10^45 erg/s) and fainter\n(L_{x, 2-10 keV}~10^42-10^43 erg/s) AGN, and at both low and high redshift.\nThese differences can aid us in improving future BH and galaxy subgrid modeling\nin simulations. Upcoming X-ray missions (e.g., Athena, AXIS, and LynX) will\nbring faint AGN to light and new powerful constraints. After accounting for AGN\nobscuration, we find that the predicted number density of detectable AGN in\nfuture surveys spans at least one order of magnitude across the simulations, at\nany redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Existing work in informative planning mainly focuses\non proposing new planners and applying them to various robotic applications\nsuch as environmental monitoring, autonomous exploration, and system\nidentification. The informative planners optimize an objective given by a\nprobabilistic model, e.g., Gaussian process regression (GPR). In practice, the\nubiquitous sensing outliers can easily affect the model, resulting in a\nmisleading objective. A straightforward solution is to filter out the outliers\nin the sensing data stream using an off-the-shelf outlier detector. However,\ninformative samples are also scarce by definition so they might be falsely\nfiltered out. In this paper, we propose a method to enable the robot to\nre-visit the locations where outliers were sampled besides optimizing the\ninformative planning objective. The robot can collect more samples in the\nvicinity of outliers and update the outlier detector to reduce the number of\nfalse alarms. We achieve this by designing a new objective for the Pareto Monte\nCarlo tree search (MCTS).

As compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, with the\nproposed method, edge devices (EDs) transmit the signs of local stochastic\ngradients by activating one of two orthogonal resources, i.e., orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers, and the MVs at the edge\nserver (ES) are obtained with non-coherent detectors by exploiting the energy\naccumulations on the subcarriers.

Each bidder $i$ also has a valuation\nfunction $v_i(s_1,\\ldots,s_n)$ mapping the (private) signals of all buyers to a\npositive real number representing their value for the item. This setting\ncaptures scenarios where the item's information is asymmetric or dispersed\namong agents, such as in competitions for oil drilling rights, or in auctions\nfor art pieces. Due to the increased complexity of this model compared to\nstandard private values, it is generally assumed that each bidder's valuation\nfunction $v_i$ is public knowledge. But in many situations, the seller may not\nknow how a bidder aggregates signals into a valuation. In this paper, we design\nmechanisms that guarantee approximately-optimal social welfare while satisfying\nex-post incentive compatibility and individual rationality for the case where\nthe valuation functions are private to the bidders.\n  When the valuations are public, it is possible for optimal social welfare to\nbe attained by a deterministic mechanism under a single-crossing condition.

While PCFGs allow for nested hierarchical dependencies (tree\nstructures), their latent variables (non-terminal symbols) have to be discrete.\nIn contrast, DBNs allow for continuous latent variables, but the dependencies\nare strictly sequential (chain structure). Therefore, neither can be applied if\nthe latent variables are assumed to be continuous and also to have a nested\nhierarchical dependency structure. In this paper, we present Recursive Bayesian\nNetworks (RBNs), which generalise and unify PCFGs and DBNs, combining their\nstrengths and containing both as special cases. RBNs define a joint\ndistribution over tree-structured Bayesian networks with discrete or continuous\nlatent variables. The main challenge lies in performing joint inference over\nthe exponential number of possible structures and the continuous variables. We\nprovide two solutions: 1) For arbitrary RBNs, we generalise inside and outside\nprobabilities from PCFGs to the mixed discrete-continuous case, which allows\nfor maximum posterior estimates of the continuous latent variables via gradient\ndescent, while marginalising over network structures. 2) For Gaussian RBNs, we\nadditionally derive an analytic approximation, allowing for robust parameter\noptimisation and Bayesian inference. The capacity and diverse applications of\nRBNs are illustrated on two examples: In a quantitative evaluation on synthetic\ndata, we demonstrate and discuss the advantage of RBNs for segmentation and\ntree induction from noisy sequences, compared to change point detection and\nhierarchical clustering.

Solar surface flux transport models (SFTMs) are used to describe the\nevolution of the radial magnetic field at the solar surface. There is however\nuncertainty about using these models in the early stage of AR evolution. We aim\nto test the applicability of SFTMs in the first days after the emergence of ARs\nby comparing them with observations. The models we employ range from passive\nevolution to models where the inflows around ARs are included. We simulate the\nevolution of the surface magnetic field of 17 emerging active regions using a\nlocal surface flux transport simulation. We selected regions that do not form\nfully-fledged sunspots that exhibit moat flows. The simulation includes\ndiffusion and advection. We use observed flows from local correlation tracking\nof solar granulation, as well as parametrizations of the inflows around ARs. To\nevaluate our simulations, we measure the cross correlation between the observed\nand the simulated magnetic field, as well as the total unsigned flux of the\nARs, over time. We also test the validity of our simulations by varying the\nstarting time relative to the emergence of flux. We find that the simulations\nusing observed surface flows can reproduce the evolution of the observed\nmagnetic flux. The effect of buffeting of the field by supergranulation can be\ndescribed as a diffusion process. The SFTM is applicable after 90% of the peak\ntotal unsigned flux of the AR has emerged. Diffusivities in the range between\n$D=250$ to $720$ km$^2$/s are consistent with the evolution of the AR flux in\nthe first five days after this time. We find that the converging flows around\nemerging ARs are not important for the evolution of the total flux of the AR in\nthese first five days; their effect of increasing flux cancellation is balanced\nby the decrease of flux transport away from the AR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 21:06:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

One reason is that second-order optimality requires\ncalculating Hessian matrices that can grow with $O(N^2)$ with the number of\nwaypoints. Decreasing the waypoints can quadratically decrease computation\ntime. Unfortunately, fewer waypoints result in lower quality trajectories that\nmay not avoid the collision. To have both, dense waypoints and reduced\ncomputation time, we took inspiration from recent studies on consensus\noptimization and propose a distributed formulation of collocated trajectory\noptimization. It breaks a long trajectory into several segments, where each\nsegment becomes a subproblem of a few waypoints. These subproblems are solved\nclassically, but in parallel, and the solutions are fused into a single\ntrajectory with a consensus constraint that enforces continuity of the segments\nthrough a consensus update. With this scheme, the quadratic complexity is\ndistributed to each segment and enables solving for higher-quality trajectories\nwith denser waypoints. Furthermore, the proposed formulation is amenable to\nusing any existing trajectory optimizer for solving the subproblems.

In\nthese situations, a good strategy is to focus on exploration, hopefully leading\nto the discovery of a reward signal to improve on. A learning algorithm capable\nof dealing with this kind of settings has to be able to (1) explore possible\nagent behaviors and (2) exploit any possible discovered reward. Efficient\nexploration algorithms have been proposed that require to define a behavior\nspace, that associates to an agent its resulting behavior in a space that is\nknown to be worth exploring. The need to define this space is a limitation of\nthese algorithms. In this work, we introduce STAX, an algorithm designed to\nlearn a behavior space on-the-fly and to explore it while efficiently\noptimizing any reward discovered. It does so by separating the exploration and\nlearning of the behavior space from the exploitation of the reward through an\nalternating two-steps process. In the first step, STAX builds a repertoire of\ndiverse policies while learning a low-dimensional representation of the\nhigh-dimensional observations generated during the policies evaluation. In the\nexploitation step, emitters are used to optimize the performance of the\ndiscovered rewarding solutions.

This paper\npresents a formal approach for verifying switched system stability that blends\nclassical ideas from the controls and verification literature using\ndifferential dynamic logic (dL), a logic for deductive verification of hybrid\nsystems. From controls, we use standard stability notions for various classes\nof switching mechanisms and their corresponding Lyapunov function-based\nanalysis techniques. From verification, we use dL's ability to verify\nquantified properties of hybrid systems and dL models of switched systems as\nlooping hybrid programs whose stability can be formally specified and proven by\nfinding appropriate loop invariants, i.e., properties that are preserved across\neach loop iteration. This blend of ideas enables a trustworthy implementation\nof switched system stability verification in the KeYmaera X prover based on dL.\nFor standard classes of switching mechanisms, the implementation provides fully\nautomated stability proofs, including searching for suitable Lyapunov\nfunctions. Moreover, the generality of the deductive approach also enables\nverification of switching control laws that require non-standard stability\narguments through the design of loop invariants that suitably express specific\nintuitions behind those control laws.

Recent literature in fault-injection attacks shows\nthe severe DNN accuracy degradation caused by bit flips. In this scenario, the\nattacker changes a few weight bits during DNN execution by tampering with the\nprogram's DRAM memory. To detect runtime bit flips, HASHTAG extracts a unique\nsignature from the benign DNN prior to deployment. The signature is later used\nto validate the integrity of the DNN and verify the inference output on the\nfly. We propose a novel sensitivity analysis scheme that accurately identifies\nthe most vulnerable DNN layers to the fault-injection attack. The DNN signature\nis then constructed by encoding the underlying weights in the vulnerable layers\nusing a low-collision hash function. When the DNN is deployed, new hashes are\nextracted from the target layers during inference and compared against the\nground-truth signatures. HASHTAG incorporates a lightweight methodology that\nensures a low-overhead and real-time fault detection on embedded platforms.\nExtensive evaluations with the state-of-the-art bit-flip attack on various DNNs\ndemonstrate the competitive advantage of HASHTAG in terms of both attack\ndetection and execution overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 22:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

As such, methodologies for\nmapping neural interactions into structural models, i.e., inference of\nfunctional connectome from neural recordings, are key for the study of brain\nnetworks. While multiple approaches have been proposed for functional\nconnectomics based on statistical associations between neural activity,\nassociation does not necessarily incorporate causation. Additional approaches\nhave been proposed to incorporate aspects of causality to turn functional\nconnectomes into causal functional connectomes, however, these methodologies\ntypically focus on specific aspects of causality. This warrants a systematic\nstatistical framework for causal functional connectomics that defines the\nfoundations of common aspects of causality. Such a framework can assist in\ncontrasting existing approaches and to guide development of further causal\nmethodologies. In this work, we develop such a statistical guide.

We particularly focus on the\nintroduction of directed Markov graphical models as a framework through which\nwe define the Directed Markov Property -- an essential criterion for examining\nthe causality of proposed functional connectomes. We demonstrate how based on\nthese notions, a comparative study of several existing approaches for finding\ncausal functional connectivity from neural activity can be conducted. We\nproceed by providing an outlook ahead regarding the additional properties that\nfuture approaches could include to thoroughly address causality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 00:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

Natural selection can generate favorable mutations with\nimproved fitness advantages; however, the identified coronaviruses may be the\ntip of the iceberg, and potentially more fatal variants of concern (VOCs) may\nemerge over time. Understanding the patterns of emerging VOCs and forecasting\nmutations that may lead to gain of function or immune escape is urgently\nrequired. Here we developed PhyloTransformer, a Transformer-based\ndiscriminative model that engages a multi-head self-attention mechanism to\nmodel genetic mutations that may lead to viral reproductive advantage. In order\nto identify complex dependencies between the elements of each input sequence,\nPhyloTransformer utilizes advanced modeling techniques, including a novel Fast\nAttention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+) from\nPerformer, and the Masked Language Model (MLM) from Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT). PhyloTransformer was trained with\n1,765,297 genetic sequences retrieved from the Global Initiative for Sharing\nAll Influenza Data (GISAID) database.

One way to alleviate\nthis burden and better inform future trials is to build reliable models for\ndrug administration. Previous chemotherapy optimization models have mainly\nrelied on optimal control, which does not lend itself to capturing complex and\nvital operational constraints in chemotherapy planning involving discrete\ndecisions, such as doses via pills and rest periods. In addition, most of the\nexisting models for chemotherapy optimization lack an explicit toxicity measure\nand impose toxicity constraints primarily through (fixed) limits on drug\nconcentration. The existing stochastic optimization models also focus on\nmaximizing the probability of cure when tumor heterogeneity is uncertain. In\nthis paper, we develop a mixed-integer program for combination chemotherapy\n(utilization of multiple drugs) optimization that incorporates various\nimportant operational constraints and, besides dose and concentration limits,\ncontrols treatment toxicity based on its effect on the count of white blood\ncells. To address the uncertainty of tumor heterogeneity, we propose chance\nconstraints that guarantee reaching an operable tumor size with a high\nprobability in a neoadjuvant setting. We present analytical results pertinent\nto the accuracy of the model in representing biological processes of\nchemotherapy and establish its merit for clinical applications through a\nnumerical study of breast cancer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 03:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

This marks the first improvement for this problem\nsince a running time bound of $\\tilde O(mn)$ was established by several papers\nin the early 1990s.\n  Our global minimum cut algorithm is obtained as a corollary of a minimum\nSteiner cut algorithm, where a minimum Steiner cut is a minimum (weight) set of\nedges whose removal disconnects at least one pair of vertices among a\ndesignated set of terminal vertices. The running time of our deterministic\nminimum Steiner cut algorithm matches that of the global minimum cut algorithm\nstated above. Using randomization, the running time improves to $m^{1+o(1)}$\nbecause of a faster maximum flow subroutine; this improves the best known\nrandomized algorithm for the minimum Steiner cut problem as well.\n  Our main technical contribution is a new tool that we call *isolating cuts*.\nGiven a set of vertices $R$, this entails finding cuts of minimum weight that\nseparate (or isolate) each individual vertex $v\\in R$ from the rest of the\nvertices $R\\setminus \\{v\\}$.

As suggested by Breiman, the strength of unstable\nlearners and the diversity among them are the ensemble models' core strength.\nIn this paper, we propose two approaches known as oblique and rotation double\nrandom forests. In the first approach, we propose rotation based double random\nforest. In rotation based double random forests, transformation or rotation of\nthe feature space is generated at each node. At each node different random\nfeature subspace is chosen for evaluation, hence the transformation at each\nnode is different. Different transformations result in better diversity among\nthe base learners and hence, better generalization performance. With the double\nrandom forest as base learner, the data at each node is transformed via two\ndifferent transformations namely, principal component analysis and linear\ndiscriminant analysis. In the second approach, we propose oblique double random\nforest. Decision trees in random forest and double random forest are\nunivariate, and this results in the generation of axis parallel split which\nfails to capture the geometric structure of the data. Also, the standard random\nforest may not grow sufficiently large decision trees resulting in suboptimal\nperformance. To capture the geometric properties and to grow the decision trees\nof sufficient depth, we propose oblique double random forest. The oblique\ndouble random forest models are multivariate decision trees. At each non-leaf\nnode, multisurface proximal support vector machine generates the optimal plane\nfor better generalization performance.

Inspired by this observation, we propose an\nend-to-end trainable Multi-Glimpse Network (MGNet) which aims to tackle the\nchallenges of high computation and the lack of robustness based on recurrent\ndownsampled attention mechanism. Specifically, MGNet sequentially selects\ntask-relevant regions of an image to focus on and then adaptively combines all\ncollected information for the final prediction.

Also, MGNet is inherently more interpretable as it explicitly\ninforms us where it focuses during each iteration.

A robust test\nof these models/approaches is challenging because of the lack of directly\nmeasured physical parameters. Fortunately, the viewing angle inferred from the\nafterglow modeling is widely anticipated to be the same as the inclination\nangle of the binary neutron star (BNS) mergers that can be evaluated with the\ngravitational wave (GW) data. Therefore in the future, it is possible to\ncalibrate the afterglow modeling with the GW inclination angle measurements. We\ntake three methods, including both analytical estimations and direct\nsimulations, to project the uncertainties of the inclination angle\nmeasurements. For some BNS mergers accompanied with electromagnetic\ncounterparts detected in the O4/O5 runs of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA/LIGO-India\ndetectors, we show that the inclination angle can be determined within an\nuncertainty of $\\leq 0.1$ rad, supposing that the Hubble constant is known with\nan accuracy of $\\leq 3\\%$ and the uncertainty of Hubble flow velocity is within\n$\\sim 1 \\%$.

In the interaction graph, edges between user and item\nnodes function as the main element of GCNs to perform information propagation\nand generate informative representations. Nevertheless, an underlying challenge\nlies in the quality of interaction graph, since observed interactions with\nless-interested items occur in implicit feedback (say, a user views\nmicro-videos accidentally). This means that the neighborhoods involved with\nsuch false-positive edges will be influenced negatively and the signal on user\npreference can be severely contaminated.

In particular, a graph refining layer\nis designed to identify the noisy edges with the high confidence of being\nfalse-positive interactions, and consequently prune them in a soft manner. We\nthen apply a graph convolutional layer on the refined graph to distill\ninformative signals on user preference. Through extensive experiments on three\ndatasets for micro-video recommendation, we validate the rationality and\neffectiveness of our GRCN. Further in-depth analysis presents how the refined\ngraph benefits the GCN-based recommender model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 06:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

Researchers have shown that\ndifferent categories of images can access the consciousness of human mind\ndifferently, and produce different ranges of ABM values. So in this paper, we\ncompare two different types of images, categorized as animal and object, by\npredicting ABM values directly from image features extracted from convolutional\nneural network (CNN), and indirectly from functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI) data. First, for two sets of images, we separately extract their average\nfeatures from layers of Alexnet, a classic model of CNN, then input the\nfeatures into a trained linear regression model to predict ABM values, and we\nfind higher-level instead of lower-level image features determine the\ncategorical difference in AB effect, and mid-level image features predict ABM\nvalues more correctly than low-level and high-level image features. Then we\nemploy fMRI data from different brain regions collected when the subjects\nviewed 50 test images to predict ABM values, and conclude that brain regions\ncovering relatively broader areas, like LVC, HVC and VC, perform better than\nother smaller brain regions, which means AB effect is more related to synthetic\nimpact of several visual brain regions than only one particular visual regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 07:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

Based on the observed transient\npressure and mud-loss trends, the model can estimate the effective fracture\nconductivity, the time-dependent cumulative mud-loss volume, and the leakage\nperiod. The behavior of lost-circulation into fractured formation can be\nquickly evaluated, at the drilling site, to perform useful diagnostics, such as\nthe rate of fluid leakage, and the associated effective fracture hydraulic\nproperties. Further, novel derivative-based mud-type-curves (DMTC) are\ndeveloped to quantify the leakage of drilling fluid flow into fractures. The\ndeveloped model is applied for non-Newtonian fluids exhibiting yield-power-law,\nincluding shear thickening and thinning, and Bingham plastic fluids. Proposing\nnew dimensionless groups generates the dual type-curves, MTC and DMTC, which\noffer superior predictivity compared to traditional methods.

One then defines a graph $G(r)$ whose edges are\nall the pairs $(o,o')$ for which $\\Pi(o,o';r)$ is true, and seeks the smallest\nvalue of $r$ for which some monotone property holds for $G(r)$.\n  Problems that fit into this context include (i) the reverse shortest path\nproblem in unit-disk graphs, recently studied by Wang and Zhao, (ii) the same\nproblem for weighted unit-disk graphs, with a decision procedure recently\nprovided by Wang and Xue, (iii) extensions of these problems to three and\nhigher dimensions, (iv) the discrete Fr\\'echet distance with one-sided\nshortcuts in higher dimensions, extending the study by Ben Avraham et al., (v)\nperfect matchings in intersection graphs: given, e.g., a set of fat ellipses of\nroughly the same size, find the smallest value $r$ such that if we expand each\nof the ellipses by $r$, the resulting intersection graph contains a perfect\nmatching, (vi) generalized distance selection problems: given, e.g., a set of\ndisjoint segments, find the $k$'th smallest distance among the pairwise\ndistances determined by the segments, for a given (sufficiently small but\nsuperlinear) parameter $k$, and (vii) the maximum-height independent towers\nproblem, in which we want to erect vertical towers of maximum height over a\n1.5-dimensional terrain so that no pair of tower tips are mutually visible.\n  We obtain significantly improved solutions for problems (i), (ii) and (vi),\nand new efficient solutions to the other problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 07:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 09:35:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 11:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

In contrast, offline imitation learning (IL) has no such\nissues since it learns the policy directly without estimating the value\nfunction by bootstrapping. However, IL is usually limited in the capability of\nthe behavioral policy and tends to learn a mediocre behavior from the dataset\ncollected by the mixture of policies.

We devised experiments comprising many tasks to\ntest these biases for the ResNet and DenseNet models. From the results, we\nconclude that (1) the combined effect of certain features is typically far more\ninfluential than any single feature; (2) in different tasks, neural models can\nperform different biases, that is, we can design a specific task to make a\nneural model biased toward a specific anticipated feature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 08:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

This ranges from methods as early as Structure from Motion (SFM) based\napproaches to recent solution frameworks involving deep neural networks. We\nshow that the long-term motion patterns alone play a pivotal role in the task\nof recognizing an event. Consequently each video is significantly represented\nby a fixed number of key-frames using a graph-based approach. Only the temporal\nfeatures are exploited using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) +\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture. The results we obtain are\nencouraging as they outperform standard temporal CNNs and are at par with those\nusing spatial information along with motion cues. Further exploring multistream\nmodels, we conceive a multi-tier fusion strategy for the spatial and temporal\nwings of a network. A consolidated representation of the respective individual\nprediction vectors on video and frame levels is obtained using a biased\nconflation technique. The fusion strategy endows us with greater rise in\nprecision on each stage as compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and thus a\npowerful consensus is achieved in classification.

The properties of intermediate\nrotator phases are crucially important for various industrial and living nature\nprocesses, but the data for their rheological properties are almost missing,\ndue to the specific difficulties in the respective experiments. In the current\nstudy we describe a methodology for measuring and comparing the shear\nrheological properties of rotator (R) and crystalline (C) phases formed in bulk\nhydrocarbons at temperatures below the melting temperature. We apply this\napproach to characterize the rheological properties of R and C phases formed\nupon cooling of alkanes with chain length varied between 17 and 30 carbon\natoms. For comparison, we study also several alkane mixtures and one alkene\nwith double bond at the end of its chain. The obtained results show that the\nstorage and loss moduli of the rotator phases are ca. 10-times lower than those\nof the respective crystalline phases. We found also that the rheological\nproperties of the crystal phases depend mainly on the subcooling temperature\nbelow the crystallization temperature, while the R phases become softer with\nthe increase of the molecular length. We explain these results by assuming that\nthe rheological properties of the crystal phases are determined mainly by the\nsliding of the ordered crystal domains with respect to each other, while in the\nrotator phases we have multiple defects in the molecular packing which increase\nwith the alkane length. The proposed methodology and the obtained results serve\nas a solid basis for further rheological studies of this important class of\ntechnological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 09:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

The answer to this question clearly depends on the average\nrate at which jobs arrive at the queue and on the average rate of service.\nSomewhat less obvious is the fact that stochastic fluctuations in service and\narrival times are also important, and that these are a major source of backlogs\nand delays. Strategies that could mitigate fluctuations induced delays are in\nhigh demand as queue structures appear in various natural and man-made systems.\nHere we demonstrate that a simple service resetting mechanism can reverse the\ndeleterious effects of large fluctuations in service times, thus turning a\nmarked drawback into a favourable advantage. This happens when stochastic\nfluctuations are intrinsic to the server, and we show that the added feature of\nservice resetting can then dramatically cut down average queue lengths and\nwaiting times. While the analysis presented herein is based on the M/G/1\nqueueing model where service is general but arrivals are assumed to be\nMarkovian, Kingman's formula asserts that the benefits of service resetting\nwill carry over to queues with general arrivals.

(2020) for skin friction in\nzero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs). In this work, a\nnew derivation is presented which shows that these relations (i) fundamentally\nrepresent a dynamically-consistent scaling of skin friction for nominally\ntwo-dimensional ZPG TBLs and fully-developed pipes and channels, and (ii) apply\nindividually to each of these flows. The new theoretical arguments are based on\ntransfer of kinetic energy from mean flow to large eddies of turbulence and\ndepend neither on flow geometry nor outer boundary condition, both of which\ndistinguish one type of flow from the other. Using skin friction data from the\nliterature, it is demonstrated that the finite-$Re$ model describes, as\npredicted by the theory, data from individual flows remarkably well; these data\ncover the complete range of laboratory/simulation Reynolds numbers to date. It\nis, however, observed that performance of the model degrades while attempting\nto describe data from all flows in a universal fashion. Differences in outer\nboundary condition and large-scale structures amongst different types of flows\nappear to be responsible for this degradation. An empirical correction based on\nClauser's shape factor, is proposed to absorb the outer boundary condition\neffects into the scaling of skin friction. This correction leads to a new\nuniversal scaling and a robust, semi-empirical, universal finite-$Re$ model for\nskin friction in ZPG TBLs, pipes and channels. Remarkable collapse of data from\nall flows in the new scaling underscores the importance of a\ndynamically-consistent approach towards revealing universality of skin friction\nin wall turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 10:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

Various techniques have\nbeen developed based on the analysis of the subtle traces left in the images\nduring the acquisition. The Photo Response Non Uniformity (PRNU) noise pattern\ncaused by sensor imperfections has been proven to be an effective way to\nidentify the source camera. The existing literature suggests that the PRNU is\nthe only fingerprint that is device-specific and capable of identifying the\nexact source device. However, the PRNU is susceptible to camera settings, image\ncontent, image processing operations, and counter-forensic attacks. A forensic\ninvestigator unaware of counter-forensic attacks or incidental image\nmanipulations is at the risk of getting misled. The spatial synchronization\nrequirement during the matching of two PRNUs also represents a major limitation\nof the PRNU. In recent years, deep learning based approaches have been\nsuccessful in identifying source camera models. However, the identification of\nindividual cameras of the same model through these data-driven approaches\nremains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we bring to light the existence of a new\nrobust data-driven device-specific fingerprint in digital images which is\ncapable of identifying the individual cameras of the same model. It is\ndiscovered that the new device fingerprint is location-independent, stochastic,\nand globally available, which resolve the spatial synchronization issue. Unlike\nthe PRNU, which resides in the high-frequency band, the new device fingerprint\nis extracted from the low and mid-frequency bands, which resolves the fragility\nissue that the PRNU is unable to contend with. Our experiments on various\ndatasets demonstrate that the new fingerprint is highly resilient to image\nmanipulations such as rotation, gamma correction, and aggressive JPEG\ncompression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 11:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

A\npromising mechanism for explaining magnetar formation is magnetic field\namplification by the MRI in fast-rotating protoneutron stars (PNS). This\nscenario is supported by recent global models, which showed that small-scale\nturbulence can generate a dipole with magnetar-like intensity. However, the\nimpact of buoyancy and density stratification on the efficiency of the MRI in\ngenerating a dipole is still unknown. We assess the impact of the density and\nentropy profiles on the MRI dynamo in a global model of a fast-rotating PNS,\nwhich focuses on its outer stratified region that is stable to convection.\nUsing the pseudo-spectral code MagIC, we performed 3D Boussinesq and anelastic\nMHD simulations in spherical geometry with explicit diffusivities. We performed\na parameter study in which we investigate the effect of different\napproximations and of thermal diffusion. We obtain a self-sustained turbulent\nMRI-driven dynamo.

The MRI also generates a nondominant equatorial\ndipole, which represents about 4.3% of the averaged magnetic field strength.\nInterestingly, in the presence of a density gradient, an axisymmetric magnetic\nfield at large scales oscillates with time, which can be described as a\nmean-field $\\alpha\\Omega$ dynamo.

As biological systems are\ngenerally not well understood, most mathematical models of these systems are\nbased on experimental data, resulting in a seemingly heterogeneous collection\nof models that ostensibly represent the same system. To understand the system\nwe therefore need to know how the different models are related, with a view to\nobtaining a unified mathematical description. This goal is complicated by the\nfact that distinct mathematical formalisms may be used to represent the same\nsystem, making direct comparison of the models very difficult. In previous work\nwe developed an appropriate framework for model comparison where we represent\nmodels as labelled simplicial complexes and compare them with two general\nmethodologies: comparison by distance or equivalence. In this article we\ncontinue the development of our model comparison methodology in two directions.\nFirst, we present a rigorous and automatable methodology for the core process\nof comparison by equivalence, namely determining the vertices in a simplicial\nrepresentation, corresponding to model components, that are conceptually\nrelated and the identification of these vertices via simplicial operations. Our\nmethodology is based on considerations of vertex symmetry in the simplicial\nrepresentation, for which we develop the required mathematical theory of group\nactions on simplicial complexes. This methodology greatly simplifies and\nexpedites the process of determining model equivalence.

Most of the existing methods focus on\nproposing different cross-modal fusion strategies. However, these strategies\nintroduce redundancy in the features of different modalities without fully\nconsidering the complementary properties between modal information, and these\napproaches do not guarantee the non-loss of original semantic information\nduring intra- and inter-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel\ncross-modal fusion network based on self-attention and residual structure\n(CFN-SR) for multimodal emotion recognition. Firstly, we perform representation\nlearning for audio and video modalities to obtain the semantic features of the\ntwo modalities by efficient ResNeXt and 1D CNN, respectively. Secondly, we feed\nthe features of the two modalities into the cross-modal blocks separately to\nensure efficient complementarity and completeness of information through the\nself-attention mechanism and residual structure. Finally, we obtain the output\nof emotions by splicing the obtained fused representation with the original\nrepresentation. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct\nexperiments on the RAVDESS dataset. The experimental results show that the\nproposed CFN-SR achieves the state-of-the-art and obtains 75.76% accuracy with\n26.30M parameters.

CoSi is synthesized using arc melting\ntechnique and the Rietveld refinement gives the lattice parameters of a = b = c\n= 4.445 {\\AA}. The measured values of Seebeck coefficient (S) shows the\nnon-monotonic behaviour in the studied temperature range with the value of\n$\\sim-$81 $\\mu$V/K at room temperature. The $|S|$ first increases till 560 K\n($\\sim-$93 $\\mu$V/K) and then decreases up to 800 K ($\\sim-$84 $\\mu$V/K)\nindicating the dominating n-type behaviour in the full temperature range. The\nelectrical conductivity, $\\sigma$ (thermal conductivity, $\\kappa$) shows the\nmonotonic decreasing (increasing) behaviour with the values of $\\sim$5.2$\\times\n10^{5}$ (12.1 W/m-K) and $\\sim$3.6$\\times 10^{5}$ (14.2 W/m-K)\n$\\Omega^{-1}m^{-1}$ at 300 K and 800 K, respectively. The $\\kappa$ exhibits the\ntemperature dependency as, $\\kappa \\propto T^{0.16}$. The DFT based Boltzmann\ntransport theory is used to understand these behaviour. The multi-band electron\nand hole pockets appear to be mainly responsible for deciding the temperature\ndependent transport behaviour. Specifically, the decrease in the $|S|$ above\n560 K and change in the slope of $\\sigma$ around 450 K are due to the\ncontribution of thermally generated charge carriers from the hole pockets. The\ntemperature dependent relaxation time is computed which shows temperature\ndependency of $1/T^{0.35}$. Present study suggests that electronic\nband-structure obtained from DFT provides reasonably good estimate of the\ntransport coefficients of CoSi in the high temperature region of $300-800$ K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 13:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 14:51:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

As a result, plans must also\ninclude actions to learn about the environment. This is known as active\nperception.

This work\ncombines symbolic control with active perception to achieve complex tasks in a\npartially observed and noisy control system with hybrid dynamics. Our basic\nidea is to employ a counterexample-guided-inductive-synthesis approach for\ncontrol from probabilistic signal temporal logic (PrSTL) specifications. Our\nproposed algorithm combines bounded model checking (BMC) with sampling-based\ntrajectory synthesis for uncertain hybrid systems.

The use of\nlarge antenna arrays at high carrier frequencies (in the mmWave range) pushes\ntowards a propagation regime in which the wavefront is no longer plane but\nspherical. This allows to infer the position and orientation of a transmitting\nsource from the received signal without the need of using multiple anchor\nnodes, located in known positions. To understand the fundamental limits of\nlarge antenna arrays for localization, this paper combines wave propagation\ntheory with estimation theory, and computes the Cram\\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) for\nthe estimation of the source position on the basis of the three Cartesian\ncomponents of the electric field, observed over a rectangular surface area.

The former allows one to classify problems more\nfinely than the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy (PH), whereas the latter\ncharacterizes physically motivated problems such as Approximate Simulation\n(APX-SIM) [Ambainis, CCC 2014]. In this area, a central role has been played by\nthe classes $P^{NP[\\log]}$ and $P^{QMA[\\log]}$, defined identically to $P^{NP}$\nand $P^{QMA}$, except that only logarithmically many oracle queries are\nallowed. Here, [Gottlob, FOCS 1993] showed that if the adaptive queries made by\na $P^{NP}$ machine have a \"query graph\" which is a tree, then this computation\ncan be simulated in $P^{NP[\\log]}$.\n  In this work, we first show that for any verification class\n$C\\in\\{NP,MA,QCMA,QMA,QMA(2),NEXP,QMA_{\\exp}\\}$, any $P^C$ machine with a query\ngraph of \"separator number\" $s$ can be simulated using deterministic time\n$\\exp(s\\log n)$ and $s\\log n$ queries to a $C$-oracle.

There exist an abundance of validation methods that, implicitly or\nexplicitly, assume a certain clustering notion. Moreover, they are often\nrestricted to operate on partitions obtained from a specific method. In this\npaper, we focus on groups that can be well separated by quadratic or linear\nboundaries. The reference cluster concept is defined through the quadratic\ndiscriminant score function and parameters describing clusters' size, center\nand scatter. We develop two cluster-quality criteria called quadratic scores.\nWe show that these criteria are consistent with groups generated from a general\nclass of elliptically-symmetric distributions. The quest for this type of\ngroups is common in applications. The connection with likelihood theory for\nmixture models and model-based clustering is investigated.

Often such missing data arise in\nexperimental observations from limitations of sensors or post-processing\ntransformation errors. Other times they arise from numerical and algorithmic\nconstraints in computer simulations. One such instance and the application\nemphasis of this paper are numerical simulations of storm surge. The simulation\ndata corresponds to time-series surge predictions over a number of save points\nwithin the geographic domain of interest, creating a spatio-temporal imputation\nproblem where the surge points are heavily correlated spatially and temporally,\nand the missing values regions are structurally distributed at random. Very\nrecently, machine learning techniques such as neural network methods have been\ndeveloped and employed for missing data imputation tasks. Generative\nAdversarial Nets (GANs) and GAN-based techniques have particularly attracted\nattention as unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, the\nGenerative Adversarial Imputation Nets (GAIN) performance is improved by\napplying convolutional neural networks instead of fully connected layers to\nbetter capture the correlation of data and promote learning from the adjacent\nsurge points. Another adjustment to the method needed specifically for the\nstudied data is to consider the coordinates of the points as additional\nfeatures to provide the model more information through the convolutional\nlayers. We name our proposed method as Convolutional Generative Adversarial\nImputation Nets (Conv-GAIN).

We test\nthis hypothesis by simulating the propagation of a virus on networks of\ndifferent topologies. Our main finding is that Gompertz growth observed for\nearly outbreaks occurs only for a scale-free network, in which nodes with many\nmore neighbors than average are common. These nodes that have very many\nneighbors are infected early in the outbreak and then spread the infection very\nrapidly. When these nodes are no longer infectious, the remaining nodes that\nhave most neighbors take over and continue to spread the infection.

Recent studies have shown the potential of\nconvolution-free Transformer approach to extract the dynamic dependencies among\ncomplex influencing factors. However, two issues prevent the approach from\nbeing effectively applied in traffic flow forecasting. First, it ignores the\nspatiotemporal structure of the traffic flow videos. Second, for a long\nsequence, it is hard to focus on crucial attention due to the quadratic times\ndot-product computation. To address the two issues, we first factorize the\ndependencies and then design a progressive space-time self-attention mechanism\nnamed ProSTformer. It has two distinctive characteristics: (1) corresponding to\nthe factorization, the self-attention mechanism progressively focuses on\nspatial dependence from local to global regions, on temporal dependence from\ninside to outside fragment (i.e., closeness, period, and trend), and finally on\nexternal dependence such as weather, temperature, and day-of-week; (2) by\nincorporating the spatiotemporal structure into the self-attention mechanism,\neach block in ProSTformer highlights the unique dependence by aggregating the\nregions with spatiotemporal positions to significantly decrease the\ncomputation.

In this regard, the global picture of the\ninterdependence patterns of extreme rainfall events (EREs) still needs to be\nfurther explored. To this end, we propose a top-down complex-network-based\nclustering workflow, with the combination of consensus clustering and mutual\ncorrespondences. Consensus clustering provides a reliable community structure\nunder each dataset, while mutual correspondences build a matching relationship\nbetween different community structures obtained from different datasets. This\napproach ensures the robustness of the identified structures when multiple\ndatasets are available. By applying it simultaneously to two satellite-derived\nprecipitation datasets, we identify consistent synchronized structures of EREs\naround the globe, during boreal summer. Two of them show independent\nspatiotemporal characteristics, uncovering the primary compositions of\ndifferent monsoon systems. They explicitly manifest the primary intraseasonal\nvariability in the context of the global monsoon, in particular the `monsoon\njump' over both East Asia and West Africa and the mid-summer drought over\nCentral America and southern Mexico. Through a case study related to the Asian\nsummer monsoon (ASM), we verify that the intraseasonal changes of upper-level\natmospheric conditions are preserved by significant connections within the\nglobal synchronization structure. Our work advances network-based clustering\nmethodology for (i) decoding the spatiotemporal configuration of\ninterdependence patterns of natural variability and for (ii) the\nintercomparison of these patterns, especially regarding their spatial\ndistributions over different datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 22:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

While solving for the\nglobal optimal is intractable in many cases, the greedy algorithm is a\nwell-studied and efficient way to provide good approximate solutions - notably\nfor submodular optimization problems. Executing the greedy algorithm requires\nthe agents to be ordered and execute a local optimization based on the\nsolutions of the previous agents. However, in limited information settings,\npassing the solution from the previous agents may be nontrivial, as some agents\nmay not be able to directly communicate with each other. Thus the communication\ntime required to execute the greedy algorithm is closely tied to the order that\nthe agents are given. In this work, we characterize interplay between the\ncommunication complexity and agent orderings by showing that the complexity\nusing the best ordering is O(n) and increases considerably to O(n^2) when using\nthe worst ordering. Motivated by this, we also propose an algorithm that can\nfind an ordering and execute the greedy algorithm quickly, in a distributed\nfashion.
