However, recent reports of demonstrative deployments of\nautomated vehicles (AVs) indicate that AVs are still difficult to meet the\nexpectation of other interacting drivers, which leads to several AV accidents\ninvolving human-driven vehicles (HVs). This is most likely due to the lack of\nunderstanding about the dynamic interaction process, especially about the human\ndrivers. By investigating the causes of 4,300 video clips of traffic accidents,\nwe find that the limited dynamic visual field of drivers is one leading factor\nin inter-vehicle interaction accidents, especially in those involving trucks. A\ngame-theoretic decision algorithm considering social compatibility is proposed\nto handle the interaction with a human-driven truck at an unsignalized\nintersection. Starting from a probabilistic model for the visual field\ncharacteristics of truck drivers, social fitness and reciprocal altruism in the\ndecision are incorporated in the game payoff design. Human-in-the-loop\nexperiments are carried out, in which 24 subjects are invited to drive and\ninteract with AVs deployed with the proposed algorithm and two comparison\nalgorithms.

These findings can help\ninform the design of automated driving decision algorithms, to ensure that AVs\ncan be safely and efficiently integrated into the human-dominated traffic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 16:21:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 16:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

Besides, position and color\ninformation contained in each pixel of point cloud video, and viewport distance\neffect caused by 6DoFs viewing procedure make the traditional objective quality\nevaluation metric cannot be directly used in point cloud video streaming\nsystem. In this paper we first analyze the subjective and objective factors\nrelated to QoE model. Then an experimental system to simulate point cloud video\nstreaming is setup and detailed subjective quality evaluation experiments are\ncarried out. Based on collected mean opinion score (MOS) data, we propose a QoE\nmodel for point cloud video streaming. We also verify the model by actual\nsubjective scoring, and the results show that the proposed QoE model can\naccurately reflect users' visual perception. We also make the experimental\ndatabase public to promote the QoE research of point cloud video streaming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 16:29:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 10:55:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 04:21:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 07:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

As far as we know, no\npolynomial-time algorithm was previously known for this problem. In fact,\nfinding any even cycle in a directed graph in polynomial time was open for more\nthan two decades until Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas (Ann. of Math. (2) 1999)\nand, independently, McCuaig (Electron. J. Combin. 2004; announced jointly at\nSTOC 1997) gave an efficiently testable structural characterisation of\neven-cycle-free directed graphs.\n  Methodologically, our algorithm relies on algebraic fingerprinting and\nrandomized polynomial identity testing over a finite field, and uses a\ngenerating polynomial implicit in Vazirani and Yannakakis ( Discrete Appl.\nMath. 1989) that enumerates weighted cycle covers as a difference of a\npermanent and a determinant polynomial. The need to work with the permanent is\nwhere our main technical contribution occurs. We design a family of finite\ncommutative rings of characteristic 4 that simultaneously (i) give a\nnondegenerate representation for the generating polynomial identity via the\npermanent and the determinant, (ii) support efficient permanent computations,\nand (iii) enable emulation of finite-field arithmetic in characteristic 2.

Once deployed, a ML model needs to be watched and\nconstantly supervised and debugged to guarantee its validity and robustness in\nunexpected situations. Debugging in ML aims to identify (and address) the model\nweaknesses in not trivial contexts. Several techniques have been proposed to\nidentify different types of model weaknesses, such as bias in classification,\nmodel decay, adversarial attacks, etc., yet there is not a generic framework\nthat allows them to work in a collaborative, modular, portable, iterative way\nand, more importantly, flexible enough to allow both human- and machine-driven\ntechniques. In this paper, we propose a novel containerized directed graph\nframework to support and accelerate end-to-end ML workflow management,\nsupervision, and debugging. The framework allows defining and deploying ML\nworkflows in containers, tracking their metadata, checking their behavior in\nproduction, and improving the models by using both learned and human-provided\nknowledge. We demonstrate these capabilities by integrating in the framework\ntwo hybrid systems to detect data drift distribution which identify the samples\nthat are far from the latent space of the original distribution, ask for human\nintervention, and whether retrain the model or wrap it with a filter to remove\nthe noise of corrupted data at inference time.

Here, the Edge Switching Markov Chain (ES-MC) is a common choice.\nGiven an arbitrary simple graph with the required degree sequence, ES-MC\ncarries out a large number of small changes, called edge switches, to\neventually obtain a uniform sample. In practice, reasonably short runs\nefficiently yield approximate uniform samples.\n  In this work, we study the problem of executing edge switches in parallel. We\ndiscuss parallelizations of ES-MC, but find that this approach suffers from\ncomplex dependencies between edge switches. For this reason, we propose the\nGlobal Edge Switching Markov Chain (G-ES-MC), an ES-MC variant with simpler\ndependencies. We show that G-ES-MC converges to the uniform distribution and\ndesign shared-memory parallel algorithms for ES-MC and G-ES-MC. In an empirical\nevaluation, we provide evidence that G-ES-MC requires not more switches than\nES-MC (and often fewer), and demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our\nparallel G-ES-MC implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 17:04:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 10:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

We find\nsignificant positive and negative correlations between radio and $\\gamma$-ray\nfluxes in different time ranges. The time delays between radio and $\\gamma$-ray\nemission suggest that the observed $\\gamma$-ray flares originated from multiple\nregions upstream of the radio core, within a few parsecs from the central\nengine. Using time-resolved 43 GHz VLBA maps we identified 14 jet components\nmoving downstream along the jet. Their apparent speeds range from 6 to 26 $c$,\nshowing notable variations in their position angles upstream the stationary\ncomponent ($\\sim$0.53 mas from the core). The brightness temperature declines\nas function of distance from the core according to a power-law which becomes\nshallower at the location of the stationary component. We also find that the\nperiods at which significant correlations between radio and $\\gamma$-ray\nemission occur overlap with the times when the jet was oriented to the north.\nOur results indicate that the passage of a propagating disturbance (or shock)\nthrough the radio core and the orientation of the jet might be responsible for\nthe observed correlation between the radio and $\\gamma$-ray variability.

Preference-based RL provides an alternative: learning policies\nusing a teacher's preferences without pre-defined rewards, thus overcoming\nconcerns associated with reward engineering. However, it is difficult to\nquantify the progress in preference-based RL due to the lack of a commonly\nadopted benchmark. In this paper, we introduce B-Pref: a benchmark specially\ndesigned for preference-based RL. A key challenge with such a benchmark is\nproviding the ability to evaluate candidate algorithms quickly, which makes\nrelying on real human input for evaluation prohibitive. At the same time,\nsimulating human input as giving perfect preferences for the ground truth\nreward function is unrealistic. B-Pref alleviates this by simulating teachers\nwith a wide array of irrationalities, and proposes metrics not solely for\nperformance but also for robustness to these potential irrationalities. We\nshowcase the utility of B-Pref by using it to analyze algorithmic design\nchoices, such as selecting informative queries, for state-of-the-art\npreference-based RL algorithms.

Recent work has shown\nthat these models are unable to capture key structures in real-world graphs,\nparticularly heterophilous structures, wherein links occur between dissimilar\nnodes. In contrast, a factorization with two vectors per node, based on\nlogistic principal components analysis (LPCA), has been proven not only to\nrepresent such structures, but also to provide exact low-rank factorization of\nany graph with bounded max degree. However, this bound has limited\napplicability to real-world networks, which often have power law degree\ndistributions with high max degree. Further, the LPCA model lacks\ninterpretability since its asymmetric factorization does not reflect the\nundirectedness of the graph. We address these issues in two ways. First, we\nprove a new bound for the LPCA model in terms of arboricity rather than max\ndegree; this greatly increases the bound's applicability to many sparse\nreal-world networks. Second, we propose an alternative graph model whose\nfactorization is symmetric and nonnegative, which allows for link predictions\nto be interpreted in terms of node clusters. We show that the bounds for exact\nrepresentation in the LPCA model extend to our new model. On the empirical\nside, our model is optimized effectively on real-world graphs with gradient\ndescent on a cross-entropy loss.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected most\nsectors of the global economy, and there is by now plenty of evidence to\nsupport this. The impact on stock markets is, however, still unclear. The fact\nthat most markets seem to have partly recovered while the pandemic is still\nongoing suggests that the relationship between stock returns and COVID-19 has\nbeen subject to structural change.

Thus, it is important for the access points to\nidentify the active devices promptly with minimal resource consumption to\nenable massive machine-type communication without disrupting the conventional\ntraffic. In this paper, a frequency-multiplexed strategy based on group testing\nis proposed for activity detection which can take into account the constraints\non network latency while minimizing the overall resource utilization. The core\nidea is that during each time-slot of active device discovery, multiple\nsubcarriers in frequency domain can be used to launch group tests in parallel\nto reduce delay.

Remarkably, the Gibbs free energy of AB stacked\nNbS2 is shown to cover the thermoneutral volcano peak, exceeding the efficiency\nof the current record platinum. The richness of local chemical environment in\nmoire structures provides a unique way to tune the reactivity for various\nchemical reactions. Our study establishes a recipe for designing superior\ncatalysts from the simple twist or stacking of formerly inactive catalytic\nmetals, and proposes structural moire as a promising nanoengineering method to\ntune surface properties for chemical adsorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 17:59:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 21:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

To model this decision, we use the Brazilian Air\nForce's Aerospace Simulation Environment (Ambiente de Simula\\c{c}\\~ao\nAeroespacial - ASA in Portuguese), which generated 3,729 constructive\nsimulations lasting 12 minutes each and a total of 10,316 engagements.

This metric considers the distances of the\naircraft of the same team and the opposite team, the point of Combat Air\nPatrol, and the number of missiles used. By defining the engagement status\nright before it starts and the average of the DCA index throughout the\nengagement, we create a supervised learning model to determine the quality of a\nnew engagement. An algorithm based on decision trees, working with the XGBoost\nlibrary, provides a regression model to predict the DCA index with a\ncoefficient of determination close to 0.8 and a Root Mean Square Error of 0.05\nthat can furnish parameters to the BVR pilot to decide whether or not to\nengage.

In the first paper in\nthis series, detailed morphological analysis of high-excitation radio galaxies\n(HERGs) with intermediate radio powers suggested that the importance of\ntriggering via galaxy mergers and interactions increases strongly with AGN\nradio power and weakly with optical emission-line luminosity. Here, we use an\nonline classification interface to expand our morphological analysis to a much\nlarger sample of 155 active galaxies (3CR radio galaxies, radio-intermediate\nHERGs and Type 2 quasars) that covers a broad range in both 1.4 GHz radio power\nand [OIII]$\\lambda$5007 emission-line luminosity. All active galaxy samples are\nfound to exhibit excesses in their rates of morphological disturbance relative\nto 378 stellar-mass- and redshift-matched non-active control galaxies\nclassified randomly and blindly alongside them. These excesses are highest for\nthe 3CR HERGs (4.7$\\sigma$) and Type 2 quasar hosts (3.7$\\sigma$), supporting\nthe idea that galaxy mergers provide the dominant triggering mechanism for\nthese subgroups. When the full active galaxy sample is considered, there is\nclear evidence to suggest that the enhancement in the rate of disturbance\nrelative to the controls increases strongly with [OIII]$\\lambda$5007\nemission-line luminosity but not with 1.4 GHz radio power. Evidence that the\ndominant AGN host types change from early-type galaxies at high radio powers to\nlate-type galaxies at low radio powers is also found, suggesting that\ntriggering by secular, disk-based processes holds more importance for\nlower-power radio AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

In this work, we introduce an automated approach that replaces\nan expert demonstration with a Youtube video for learning a tool manipulation\nstrategy. The main contributions are twofold. First, we design an alignment\nprocedure that aligns the simulated environment with the real-world scene\nobserved in the video. This is formulated as an optimization problem that finds\na spatial alignment of the tool trajectory to maximize the sparse goal reward\ngiven by the environment. Second, we describe an imitation learning approach\nthat focuses on the trajectory of the tool rather than the motion of the human.\nFor this we combine reinforcement learning with an optimization procedure to\nfind a control policy and the placement of the robot based on the tool motion\nin the aligned environment. We demonstrate the proposed approach on spade,\nscythe and hammer tools in simulation, and show the effectiveness of the\ntrained policy for the spade on a real Franka Emika Panda robot demonstration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 18:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

As energy\nand number eigenstates, they have an exactly defined number of quanta, and most\nfaithfully express the particle nature of fields. These properties make them\nattractive for many applications in metrology, and quantum simulation and\ninformation processing. Yet, Fock states are notoriously difficult to generate.\nThe problem is especially acute in optics, where it is difficult to\ndeterministically produce Fock states with more than a single photon, let alone\nat macroscopic scales. This is in part due to a dearth of mechanisms to produce\nlarge Fock states, as well as the deleterious effects of linear dissipation.\nHere, we introduce a new effect in the physics of nonlinear bosons, arising\nfrom the interplay of dissipation and Kerr nonlinearity. In this effect, a\nnonlinear resonance is dissipationless when it has a particular number of\nquanta (e.g., photons) inside it, and lossy otherwise. This loss, which results\nfrom nonlinear interference, leads to several new quantum statistical effects.\nFor example, it leads to spontaneous condensation of intensity noise, which may\nenable generation of large Fock and extremely photon-number-squeezed states of\nlight. We also show how this effect has implications for new classes of\noptoelectronic devices such as lasers, which can stabilize extremely low-noise\nstates in an equilibrium between gain and the nonlinear loss that we introduce.\nThroughout the text, we present examples of systems that may realize these\neffects.

In a\npromising model proposed by Dziembowski (2016), these signals are suggested to\nbe due to the excitation of non-radial modes with degrees 7, 8 and 9 (Cepheids)\nor 8 and 9 (RR Lyrae). Such modes usually have low amplitudes in photometric\ndata. Spectroscopic time series offer an unexplored and promising way forward.\nWe simulated time series of synthetic line profiles for a representative\nfirst-overtone classical Cepheid model and added a low-amplitude non-radial\nmode. We studied sets of spectra with dense sampling and without noise,\nso-called 'perfect' cases, as well as more realistic samplings and\nsignal-to-noise levels. Besides the first-overtone mode and the non-radial\nmode, also the harmonics of both modes and combination signals were often\ndetected, but a sufficiently high sampling and signal-to-noise ratio prove\nessential. The amplitudes of the non-radial mode and its harmonic depend on the\nazimuthal order $m$. The inclination is also an important factor determining\nthe detectability of the non-radial mode and/or its harmonic. We compared the\nresults obtained for the predicted high degrees with those for lower-degree\nmodes. Finally, we studied the sampling requirements for detecting the\nnon-radial mode. Our findings can be used to plan a spectroscopic observing\ncampaign tailored to uncover the nature of these mysterious modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 18:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

In experiments in English, Finnish,\nMandarin, and random regular languages, we demonstrate that neural language\nmodels interpolate between these two forms of generalization: their predictions\nare well-approximated by a log-linear combination of local and global\npredictive distributions. We then show that, in some languages, noise mediates\nthe two forms of generalization: noise applied to input tokens encourages\nglobal generalization, while noise in history representations encourages local\ngeneralization. Finally, we offer a preliminary theoretical explanation of\nthese results by proving that the observed interpolation behavior is expected\nin log-linear models with a particular feature correlation structure.

While\nexperimental CCS databases exist, they are currently small; thus, we used a CCS\nprediction tool, DarkChem, to provide theoretical CCS values for use in this\nstudy.

For posted price\nauctions, we no longer have access to samples.

How many pricing\nqueries are needed to estimate a given parameter of the underlying\ndistribution?\n  We give tight upper and lower bounds on the number of pricing queries\nrequired to find an approximately optimal reserve price for general, regular\nand MHR distributions.

The aim of this article is to\nprovide a unified and geometric view of strong duality of COPs for the known\nresults. For our framework, we employ a COP minimizing a linear function in a\nvector variable $x$ subject to a single hyperplane constraint $x \\in H$ and two\ncone constraints $x \\in K_1$, $x \\in K_2$. It can be identically reformulated\nas a simpler COP with the single hyperplane constraint $x \\in H$ and the single\ncone constraint $x \\in K_1 \\cap K_2$. This simple COP and its dual as well as\ntheir duality relation can be represented geometrically, and they have no\nduality gap without any constraint qualification. The dual of the original\ntarget COP is equivalent to the dual of the reformulated COP if the Minkowski\nsum of the duals of the two cones $K_1$ and $K_2$ is closed or if the dual of\nthe reformulated COP satisfies a certain Slater condition. Thus, these two\nconditions make it possible to transfer all duality results, including the\nexistence and/or boundedness of optimal solutions, on the reformulated COP to\nthe ones on the original target COP, and further to the ones on a standard\nprimal-dual pair of COPs with symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 04:16:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 13:14:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 02:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

In the mechanism, a forget gate, which\nwas introduced to control information flow in a hidden state in the RNN, has\nrecently been re-interpreted as a representative of the time scale of the\nstate, i.e., a measure how long the RNN retains information on inputs. On the\nbasis of this interpretation, several parameter initialization methods to\nexploit prior knowledge on temporal dependencies in data have been proposed to\nimprove learnability. However, the interpretation relies on various unrealistic\nassumptions, such as that there are no inputs after a certain time point. In\nthis work, we reconsider this interpretation of the forget gate in a more\nrealistic setting. We first generalize the existing theory on gated RNNs so\nthat we can consider the case where inputs are successively given. We then\nargue that the interpretation of a forget gate as a temporal representation is\nvalid when the gradient of loss with respect to the state decreases\nexponentially as time goes back. We empirically demonstrate that existing RNNs\nsatisfy this gradient condition at the initial training phase on several tasks,\nwhich is in good agreement with previous initialization methods. On the basis\nof this finding, we propose an approach to construct new RNNs that can\nrepresent a longer time scale than conventional models, which will improve the\nlearnability for long-term sequential data.

To eliminate the need to install\nforce sensors, UKFs (unscented Kalman filters) are developed to estimate the\nforces applied by the leader and follower. Stability analysis is conducted to\nprove the tracking error of the closed-loop system. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the good performance of the tracking controller. The experiments\nshow the controllers of the leader and the follower can work in the real world,\nbut the tracking errors were affected by the disturbance of airflow in a\nrestricted space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 06:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

However, the poor performance\nof concerned foreground targets, e.g., traffic lights and poles, still limits\nits further practical applications. In urban scenes, foreground targets are\nalways concealed in their surrounding stuff because of the special camera\nposition and 3D perspective projection. What's worse, it exacerbates the\nunbalance between foreground and background classes in high-level features due\nto the continuous expansion of the reception field. We call it Feature\nCamouflage. In this paper, we present a novel add-on module, named Feature\nBalance Network (FBNet), to eliminate the feature camouflage in urban-scene\nsegmentation. FBNet consists of two key components, i.e., Block-wise BCE(BwBCE)\nand Dual Feature Modulator(DFM). BwBCE serves as an auxiliary loss to ensure\nuniform gradients for foreground classes and their surroundings during\nbackpropagation. At the same time, DFM intends to enhance the deep\nrepresentation of foreground classes in high-level features adaptively under\nthe supervision of BwBCE. These two modules facilitate each other as a whole to\nease feature camouflage effectively.

Our theoretical framework contributes a\ntheoretical validation of mini-batch learning on graphs and leads to new\nlearning-theoretic results on generalization bounds as well as\nsize-generalizability without assumptions on the input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 08:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

Third, in most existing models, different features share the same\nembedding size which leads to memory inefficiency. To address these three\nissues mentioned above, we propose Automatic Interaction Machine (AIM) with\nthree core components, namely, Feature Interaction Search (FIS), Interaction\nFunction Search (IFS) and Embedding Dimension Search (EDS), to select\nsignificant feature interactions, appropriate interaction functions and\nnecessary embedding dimensions automatically in a unified framework.\nSpecifically, FIS component automatically identifies different orders of\nessential feature interactions with useless ones pruned; IFS component selects\nappropriate interaction functions for each individual feature interaction in a\nlearnable way; EDS component automatically searches proper embedding size for\neach feature. Offline experiments on three large-scale datasets validate the\nsuperior performance of AIM. A three-week online A/B test in the recommendation\nservice of a mainstream app market shows that AIM improves DeepFM model by 4.4%\nin terms of CTR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 08:39:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 06:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

Accurate action localization requires the utilization of\nboth temporal and spatial information. Recent attempts achieve this by using\ncomputationally intensive 3D CNN architectures or highly redundant two-stream\narchitectures with optical flow, making them both unsuitable for real-time,\nonline applications. To accomplish activity localization under highly\nchallenging real-time constraints, we propose utilizing fast and efficient\nkey-point based bounding box prediction to spatially localize actions. We then\nintroduce a tube-linking algorithm that maintains the continuity of action\ntubes temporally in the presence of occlusions. Further, we eliminate the need\nfor a two-stream architecture by combining temporal and spatial information\ninto a cascaded input to a single network, allowing the network to learn from\nboth types of information. Temporal information is efficiently extracted using\na structural similarity index map as opposed to computationally intensive\noptical flow. Despite the simplicity of our approach, our lightweight\nend-to-end architecture achieves state-of-the-art frame-mAP of 74.7% on the\nchallenging UCF101-24 dataset, demonstrating a performance gain of 6.4% over\nthe previous best online methods. We also achieve state-of-the-art video-mAP\nresults compared to both online and offline methods.

However, metaphorical expressions evolve over time due to\nvarious reasons, such as cultural and societal impact. Metaphorical expressions\nare known to co-evolve with language and literal word meanings, and even drive,\nto some extent, this evolution. This poses the question of whether different,\npossibly time-specific, representations of literal meanings may impact the\nmetaphor detection task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study\nthat examines the metaphor detection task with a detailed exploratory analysis\nwhere different temporal and static word embeddings are used to account for\ndifferent representations of literal meanings. Our experimental analysis is\nbased on three popular benchmarks used for metaphor detection and word\nembeddings extracted from different corpora and temporally aligned using\ndifferent state-of-the-art approaches. The results suggest that the usage of\ndifferent static word embedding methods does impact the metaphor detection task\nand some temporal word embeddings slightly outperform static methods. However,\nthe results also suggest that temporal word embeddings may provide\nrepresentations of the core meaning of the metaphor even too close to their\ncontextual meaning, thus confusing the classifier. Overall, the interaction\nbetween temporal language evolution and metaphor detection appears tiny in the\nbenchmark datasets used in our experiments. This suggests that future work for\nthe computational analysis of this important linguistic phenomenon should first\nstart by creating a new dataset where this interaction is better represented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 08:43:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 16:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

Our\nobservations of NML Cyg were combined with complementary archival data to\nenable a search for signatures of morphological complexity in the circumstellar\nenvironment, using emission lines from 15 molecular species.

Furthermore,\nto reproduce CO emission with three-dimensional radiative transfer models\nrequired a spherical outflow with three superposed conical outflows, one\ntowards and one away from the observer, and one in the plane of the sky. These\ncomponents are higher in density than the spherical outflow by up to an order\nof magnitude. We hence propose that NML Cyg's circumstellar environment\nconsists of a small number of high-density large-scale coherent outflows\nembedded in a spherical wind.

In the latter,\nit was found that steric interactions of ions with the electrode's walls, which\nresult in the so-called Stern layer, are sufficient to explain the experimental\nresults. As only symmetric ion sizes in a restricted primitive model were\nexamined, it is instructive to investigate systems of unequal ion sizes that\nlead to modified Stern layers. In this work, we explore the impact of ion\nasymmetry on the reversible heat production for each electrode separately. In\nthis context, we further study an extension of the primitive model where\nhydration shells of ions can evade in the vicinity of electrode's walls. We\nfind a strong dependence on system parameters such as the particle sizes and\nthe total volume taken by particles. Here, we even found situations where one\nelectrode was heated and the other electrode was cooled at the same time during\ncharging, while, in sum, both electrodes together behaved very similarly to the\nalready mentioned experimental results. Thus, heat production should also be\nmeasured in experiments for each electrode separately. By this, the importance\nof certain ingredients that we proposed to model electrolytes could be\nconfirmed or ruled out experimentally, finally leading to a deeper\nunderstanding of the physics of EDLs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 08:59:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 13:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

The nuclear timescale mass transfer leads to observable\ncounterparts: the semi-detached so-called massive Algol binaries. However,\ncomprehensive model predictions for these systems are sparse. We study them\nusing a large grid of ~10,000 detailed binary evolution models calculated with\nthe stellar evolution code MESA, covering initial donor masses between 10-40\nM$_{\\odot}$ and initial orbital periods above 1.4 d, at a metallicity suitable\nfor the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our models imply ~30, or ~3% of the\n~1,000 core hydrogen burning O-star binaries in the LMC to be currently in the\nsemi-detached phase. Our donor models are up to 25-times more luminous than\nsingle stars of identical mass and effective temperature, which agrees with the\nobserved Algols. A comparison of our models with the observed orbital periods\nand mass ratios implies rather conservative mass transfer in some systems,\nwhile very inefficient one in others. This is generally well reproduced by our\nspin-dependent mass transfer algorithm, except for the lowest considered\nmasses. The observations reflect the slow increase of the surface nitrogen\nenrichment of the donors during the semi-detached phase all the way to CNO\nequilibrium. We also investigate the properties of our models after core\nhydrogen depletion of the donor star, when these models correspond to\nWolf-Rayet/helium+OB star binaries. A dedicated spectroscopic survey of massive\nAlgol systems may allow to derive the dependence of the efficiency of thermal\ntimescale mass transfer on the binary parameters, as well as the efficiency of\nsemiconvective mixing in the stellar interior. This would be a crucial step\ntowards reliable binary models up to the formation of supernovae and compact\nobjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 09:01:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 10:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

The symmetry of\nthe monolayers allows for two different types of alignment, in which the\nmomentum-direct interlayer transitions are either valley-conserving (R-type\nalignment) or changing the valley index (H-type anti-alignment). Here, we study\nthe valley polarization dynamics of ILE in magnetic fields up to 30~Tesla by\ntime-resolved photoluminescence (PL). For all ILE types, we find a finite\ninitial PL circular degree of polarization ($DoP$) after unpolarized excitation\nin applied magnetic fields.

By contrast, for ILE in R-type\nHS, the PL $DoP$ shows a decrease and a zero crossing before saturating with\nopposite polarization.

It is shown that the proposed approach allows\nsubstantially enhanced performance when compared to cosine distance-based\napproaches, yielding a detailed description of the specific patterns of\nconnectivity between the nodes. The impressive ability of the proposed\nmethodology to emphasize the modular structure of networks is also illustrated\nwith respect to the iris dataset and C.~elegans neuronal network connectivity\ndata with remarkable results. The reported methodology and results pave the way\nto a significant number of possible theoretical and applied developments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 09:10:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 11:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

A lengthening\ninsensitive language has the dual property. A semi-decision procedure is then\nintroduced to reliably prove shortening insensitive properties or deny\nlengthening insensitive properties while working with a reduction of a system.\nA reduction has the property that it can only shorten runs.

In this paper, we\nargue that the effect of the social relations should be inhomogeneous, that is,\ntwo socially-related users may only share the same preference on some specific\nitems, while for the other products, their preferences can be inconsistent or\neven contradictory. Inspired by this idea, we build a novel social\nrecommendation model, where the traditional pair-wise \"user-user'' relation is\nextended to the triple relation of \"user-item-user''. To well handle such\nhigh-order relations, we base our framework on the hypergraph. More\nspecifically, each hyperedge connects a user-user-item triplet, representing\nthat the two users share similar preferences on the item. We develop a Social\nHyperGraph Convolutional Network (short for SHGCN) to learn from the complex\ntriplet social relations. With the hypergraph convolutional networks, the\nsocial relations can be modeled in a more fine-grained manner, which more\naccurately depicts real users' preferences, and benefits the recommendation\nperformance. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate our\nmodel's effectiveness. Studies on data sparsity and hyper-parameter studies\nfurther validate our model's rationality.

Here, we\nshow the millimeter VLBI image of the source, which we obtained with the Event\nHorizon Telescope at $228$GHz. Compared to previous observations, we image\nCentaurus A's jet at a tenfold higher frequency and sixteen times sharper\nresolution and thereby probe sub-lightday structures. We reveal a\nhighly-collimated, asymmetrically edge-brightened jet as well as the fainter\ncounterjet. We find that Centaurus A's source structure resembles the jet in\nMessier 87 on ${\\sim}500r_g$ scales remarkably well. Furthermore, we identify\nthe location of Centaurus A's SMBH with respect to its resolved jet core at\n${\\lambda}1.3$mm and conclude that the source's event horizon shadow should be\nvisible at THz frequencies. This location further supports the universal scale\ninvariance of black holes over a wide range of masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 09:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

Due to the complex structure and low contrast background,\nautomatic liver vessel segmentation remains particularly challenging. Most of\nthe related researches adopt FCN, U-net, and V-net variants as a backbone.\nHowever, these methods mainly focus on capturing multi-scale local features\nwhich may produce misclassified voxels due to the convolutional operator's\nlimited locality reception field.\n  Methods: We propose a robust end-to-end vessel segmentation network called\nInductive BIased Multi-Head Attention Vessel Net(IBIMHAV-Net) by expanding swin\ntransformer to 3D and employing an effective combination of convolution and\nself-attention. In practice, we introduce the voxel-wise embedding rather than\npatch-wise embedding to locate precise liver vessel voxels, and adopt\nmulti-scale convolutional operators to gain local spatial information.

We generate via advanced Deep Learning (DL) techniques artificial\nleaf images in an automatized way. We aim to dispose of a source of training\nsamples for AI applications for modern crop management. Such applications\nrequire large amounts of data and, while leaf images are not truly scarce,\nimage collection and annotation remains a very time--consuming process. Data\nscarcity can be addressed by augmentation techniques consisting in simple\ntransformations of samples belonging to a small dataset, but the richness of\nthe augmented data is limited: this motivates the search for alternative\napproaches. Methods. Pursuing an approach based on DL generative models, we\npropose a Leaf-to-Leaf Translation (L2L) procedure structured in two steps:\nfirst, a residual variational autoencoder architecture generates synthetic leaf\nskeletons (leaf profile and veins) starting from companions binarized skeletons\nof real images. In a second step, we perform translation via a Pix2pix\nframework, which uses conditional generator adversarial networks to reproduce\nthe colorization of leaf blades, preserving the shape and the venation pattern.\nResults. The L2L procedure generates synthetic images of leaves with a\nrealistic appearance. We address the performance measurement both in a\nqualitative and a quantitative way; for this latter evaluation, we employ a DL\nanomaly detection strategy which quantifies the degree of anomaly of synthetic\nleaves with respect to real samples. Conclusions. Generative DL approaches have\nthe potential to be a new paradigm to provide low-cost meaningful synthetic\nsamples for computer-aided applications. The present L2L approach represents a\nstep towards this goal, being able to generate synthetic samples with a\nrelevant qualitative and quantitative resemblance to real leaves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 10:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

Today, the traditional statistical analyses approaches may seem\nquestionable to practitioners in light of ubiquitous historical covariate\ninformation.\n  Several methodological developments aim at incorporating historical\ninformation in the design and analysis of future clinical trials, most\nimportantly Bayesian information borrowing, propensity score methods,\nstratification, and covariate adjustment. Recently, adjusting the analysis with\nrespect to a prognostic score, which was obtained from some machine learning\nprocedure applied to historical data, has been suggested and we study the\npotential of this approach for randomised clinical trials.\n  In an idealised situation of a normal outcome in a two-arm trial with 1:1\nallocation, we derive a simple sample size reduction formula as a function of\ntwo criteria characterising the prognostic score: (1) The coefficient of\ndetermination $R^2$ on historical data and (2) the correlation $\\rho$ between\nthe estimated and the true unknown prognostic scores. While maintaining the\nsame power, the original total sample size $n$ planned for the unadjusted\nanalysis reduces to $(1 - R^2 \\rho^2) \\times n$ in an adjusted analysis.\nRobustness in less ideal situations was assessed empirically. We conclude that\nthere is potential for substantially more powerful or smaller trials, but only\nwhen prognostic scores can be accurately estimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 11:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

Towards this, a new\nlearning paradigm called Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed that brings\nthe potential of DL to these domains while addressing privacy and data\nownership issues. FL enables remote clients to learn a shared ML model while\nkeeping the data local. However, conventional FL systems face several\nchallenges such as scalability, complex infrastructure management, and wasted\ncompute and incurred costs due to idle clients. These challenges of FL systems\nclosely align with the core problems that serverless computing and\nFunction-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms aim to solve. These include rapid\nscalability, no infrastructure management, automatic scaling to zero for idle\nclients, and a pay-per-use billing model. To this end, we present a novel\nsystem and framework for serverless FL, called FedLess. Our system supports\nmultiple commercial and self-hosted FaaS providers and can be deployed in the\ncloud, on-premise in institutional data centers, and on edge devices. To the\nbest of our knowledge, we are the first to enable FL across a large fabric of\nheterogeneous FaaS providers while providing important features like security\nand Differential Privacy.

In particular, regions such as M42 in Orion have neutral hydrogen\nshells, suggesting that the ionising radiation is trapped closer to the star.\nWe first derive formulae for wind bubble evolution in non-uniform density\nfields, focusing on singular isothermal sphere density fields with a power law\nindex of -2. We find that a classical \"Weaver\"-like expansion velocity becomes\nconstant in such a density distribution. We then calculate the structure of the\nphotoionised shell around such wind bubbles, and determine at what point the\nmass in the shell cannot absorb all of the ionising photons emitted by the\nstar, causing an \"overflow\" of ionising radiation. We also estimate\nperturbations from cooling, gravity, magnetic fields and instabilities, all of\nwhich we argue are secondary effects for the conditions studied here. Our\nwind-driven model provides a consistent explanation for the behaviour of M42 to\nwithin the errors given by observational studies.

II (up to $\\sim$100 GeV) and the $Fermi$ Large Area Telescope (LAT)\nto be the result of curvature radiation due to primary particles in the pulsar\nmagnetosphere and current sheet. We present phase-resolved spectra and\nenergy-dependent light curves using an extended slot gap and current sheet\nmodel, invoking a step function for the accelerating electric field as\nmotivated by kinetic simulations. We include a refined calculation of the\ncurvature radius of particle trajectories in the lab frame, impacting the\nparticle transport, predicted light curves, and spectra. Our model reproduces\nthe decrease of the flux of the first peak relative to the second one,\nevolution of the bridge emission, near-constant phase positions of peaks, and\nnarrowing of pulses with increasing energy. We can explain the first of these\ntrends because we find that the curvature radii of the particle trajectories in\nregions where the second $\\gamma$-ray light curve peak originates are\nsystematically larger than those associated with the first peak, implying that\nthe spectral cutoff of the second peak is correspondingly larger. However, an\nunknown azimuthal dependence of the $E$-field as well as uncertainty in the\nprecise spatial origin of the GeV emission, precludes a simplistic\ndiscrimination of emission mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 11:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Alternative geometrical visual cues, such\nas lines, which can often be found within these scenarios, can become\nparticularly useful. Moreover, these scenarios typically present structural\nregularities, such as parallelism or orthogonality, and hold the Manhattan\nWorld assumption. Under these premises, in this work, we introduce MSC-VO, an\nRGB-D -based visual odometry approach that combines both point and line\nfeatures and leverages, if exist, those structural regularities and the\nManhattan axes of the scene. Within our approach, these structural constraints\nare initially used to estimate accurately the 3D position of the extracted\nlines. These constraints are also combined next with the estimated Manhattan\naxes and the reprojection errors of points and lines to refine the camera pose\nby means of local map optimization. Such a combination enables our approach to\noperate even in the absence of the aforementioned constraints, allowing the\nmethod to work for a wider variety of scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a\nnovel multi-view Manhattan axes estimation procedure that mainly relies on line\nfeatures.

The dynamics of individual\noscillators is governed by the superconducting Josephson junction.\nSurprisingly, the repulsive interactions establish a symmetry of compelete\nsynchrony in the ring, which is broken with increasing interactions when the\njunctions pass through serials of asynchronous states (periodic and chaotic),\nbut finally emerge into chimera states. The chimera pattern appears in chaotic\nrotational motion of the three junctions when two junctions evolve coherently\nwhile the third junction is incoherent. For larger repulsive coupling, the\njunctions evolves into another chimera pattern in a periodic state when two\njunctions remain coherent in rotational motion and one transits to incoherent\nlibrational motion.

To address this, we investigate non-deterministic\nrewriting systems (multiway systems) of the Wolfram model. We express these\nrewriting systems as homotopy types. Using this new formulation, we outline how\nspatial structures can be functorially inherited from pregeometric\ntype-theoretic constructions. We show how higher homotopy types are constructed\nfrom rewriting rules. These correspond to morphisms of an $n$-fold category.\nSubsequently, the $n \\to \\infty$ limit of the Wolfram model rulial multiway\nsystem is identified as an $\\infty$-groupoid, with the latter being relevant\ngiven Grothendieck's homotopy hypothesis. We then go on to show how this\nconstruction extends to the classifying space of rulial multiway systems, which\nforms a multiverse of multiway systems and carries the formal structure of an\n${\\left(\\infty, 1\\right)}$-topos. This correspondence to higher categorical\nstructures offers a new way to understand how spaces relevant to physics may\narise from pregeometric combinatorial models.

Instead, geometry is inherited functorially by higher structures. This is\nrelevant for formally justifying different choices of underlying spacetime\ndiscretization adopted by models of quantum gravity.

However, the direct\nuse of RL algorithms in the RS setting is impractical due to challenges like\noff-policy training, huge action spaces and lack of sufficient reward signals.\nRecent RL approaches for RS attempt to tackle these challenges by combining RL\nand (self-)supervised sequential learning, but still suffer from certain\nlimitations. For example, the estimation of Q-values tends to be biased toward\npositive values due to the lack of negative reward signals. Moreover, the\nQ-values also depend heavily on the specific timestamp of a sequence.\n  To address the above problems, we propose negative sampling strategy for\ntraining the RL component and combine it with supervised sequential learning.\nWe call this method Supervised Negative Q-learning (SNQN).

Typically, the complex and dynamic nature of multi-tier\nenvironments incurs difficulties in meeting such demands, because tiers are\ndependent on each other which in turn makes bottlenecks of a tier shift to\nescalate in subsequent tiers. However, the optimization process of existing\napproaches produces single-tier-driven schedules that do not employ the\ndifferential impact of SLA violations in executing client jobs. Furthermore,\nthe impact of schedules optimized at the tier level on the performance of\nschedules formulated in subsequent tiers tends to be ignored, resulting in a\nless than optimal performance when measured at the multi-tier level. Thus,\nfailing in committing job obligations incurs SLA penalties that often take the\nform of either financial compensations, or losing future interests and\nmotivations of unsatisfied clients in the service provided. In this paper, a\nscheduling and allocation approach is proposed to formulate schedules that\naccount for differential impacts of SLA violation penalties and, thus, produce\nschedules that are optimal in financial performance. A queue virtualization\nscheme is designed to facilitate the formulation of optimal schedules at the\ntier and multi-tier levels of the cloud environment. Because the scheduling\nproblem is NP-hard, a biologically inspired approach is proposed to mitigate\nthe complexity of finding optimal schedules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 13:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

This phenomenon - anomalous dissipation - is sometimes\ncalled the `zeroth law of turbulence' as it underpins many celebrated\ntheoretical predictions. Another robust feature observed in turbulence is that\nvelocity structure functions $S_p(\\ell) :=\\langle |\\delta_\\ell u|^p\\rangle$\nexhibit persistent power-law scaling in the inertial range, namely $S_p(\\ell)\n\\sim |\\ell|^{\\zeta_p}$ for exponents $\\zeta_p>0$ over an ever-increasing (with\nReynolds) range of scales. This behavior indicates that the velocity field\nretains some fractional differentiability uniformly in the Reynolds number.

Many real-world domains are, by definition, class\nimbalanced by virtue of having a majority class that naturally has many more\ninstances than its minority class (e.g. genuine bank transactions occur much\nmore often than fraudulent ones). Many methods have been proposed to solve the\nclass imbalance problem, among the most popular being oversampling techniques\n(such as SMOTE). These methods generate synthetic instances in the minority\nclass, to balance the dataset, performing data augmentations that improve the\nperformance of predictive machine learning (ML) models. In this paper we\nadvance a novel data augmentation method (adapted from eXplainable AI), that\ngenerates synthetic, counterfactual instances in the minority class. Unlike\nother oversampling techniques, this method adaptively combines exist-ing\ninstances from the dataset, using actual feature-values rather than\ninterpolating values between instances. Several experiments using four\ndifferent classifiers and 25 datasets are reported, which show that this\nCounterfactual Augmentation method (CFA) generates useful synthetic data points\nin the minority class. The experiments also show that CFA is competitive with\nmany other oversampling methods many of which are variants of SMOTE. The basis\nfor CFAs performance is discussed, along with the conditions under which it is\nlikely to perform better or worse in future tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 14:14:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

We compared this noise structure with either phonon\ndensity of states or Raman spectrum of each topological insulator (TI),\nrespectively. In (BiSb)2Te3, the comparison revealed that the noise peaks track\nthe van Hove singularities in the phonon density of states. It resulted that\nbulk atomic oscillators are responsible for the noise peaks. The most intense\nnoise peak observed in (BiSb)2Te3 at 50 K is attributed to the thermal motion\nof the Bi atoms. Other less intense noise peaks are assigned to either a single\nphonon mode or multi-phonon combinations. We found that thermal motions of Bi\nand Te2 atoms in different symmetry directions are involved in most of the\nphonon combinations, which stand for the signature of the lattice\nanharmonicity. The noise increase observed in both (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and BiSbTeSe1.6\nabove a specific temperature threshold is attributed to the\nanharmonicity-induced strengthening of the carrier-phonon coupling. In the case\nof BiSbTeSe1.6, we show that all noise singularities are mirrored in the Raman\nspectrum of a structurally close TI (BiSbTeSe2) in the whole temperature range.\nThis indicates that although transport can be at the surface or in the bulk or\nboth of them, the carrier-phonon interaction is the only source of 1/f\nfluctuations in TIs. Inherently, these results imply that microscopic origin of\n1/f noise in solid is in the perpetual thermal motion of the atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 14:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

We explore the use of\nclustering to identify locations of interest to African Elephants in regions of\nSub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis was performed using publicly available\ndatasets for tracking African elephants at Kruger National Park (KNP), South\nAfrica; Etosha National Park, Namibia; as well as areas in Burkina Faso and the\nCongo. Using the DBSCAN and KMeans clustering algorithms, we calculate clusters\nand centroids to simplify elephant movement data and highlight important\nlocations of interest. Through a comparison of feature spaces with and without\ntemperature, we show that temperature is an important feature to explain\nmovement clustering. Recognizing the importance of temperature, we develop a\ntechnique to add external temperature data from an API to other geospatial\ndatasets that would otherwise not have temperature data. After addressing the\nhurdles of using external data with marginally different timestamps, we\nconsider the quality of this data, and the quality of the centroids of the\nclusters calculated based on this external temperature data. Finally, we\noverlay these centroids onto satellite imagery and locations of human\nsettlements to validate the real-life applications of the calculated centroids\nto identify locations of interest for elephants. As expected, we confirmed that\nelephants tend to cluster their movement around sources of water as well as\nsome human settlements, especially those with water holes. Identifying key\nlocations of interest for elephants is beneficial in predicting the movement of\nelephants and preventing poaching.

Example cases in thermal conduction, linear\nelasticity and incompressible flow are presented to demonstrate utility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 15:01:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 22:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

From the input boundary, we first\nsynthesize a human-activity map that reflects both the spatial configuration\nand human-environment interaction in an architectural space. We propose to\nproduce the human-activity map either automatically by a pre-trained generative\nadversarial network (GAN) model, or semi-automatically by synthesizing it with\nuser manipulation of the furniture. Second, we feed the human-activity map into\nour deep framework ActFloor-GAN to guide a pixel-wise prediction of room types.\nWe adopt a re-formulated cycle-consistency constraint in ActFloor-GAN to\nmaximize the overall prediction performance, so that we can produce\nhigh-quality room layouts that are readily convertible to vectorized\nfloorplans. Experimental results show several benefits of our approach. First,\na quantitative comparison with prior methods shows superior performance of\nleveraging the human-activity map in predicting piecewise room types.

In the present study, a discussion on the closed\nsurface requirement is provided for the frequency domain FWH formulation,\nalthough we believe that the approach presented here can also be applied for\nthe time-domain methodology. We show that all sources computed on the closed\npermeable surface may play an important role if the acoustic prediction is\nsought at observer positions distributed along the entire circular arc.\nHowever, results obtained for 2D and 3D model problems show that, if wisely\ndesigned, a permeable FWH surface composed only by a finite patch, i.e., an\nincomplete surface, can be employed to accurately predict the noise at specific\nobserver positions. In this case, the surface must be placed between the line\nof sight from the sources to the observers, for example, in flyover or sideline\nlocations. In the current applications, results from finite surfaces agree with\nthe expected values as long as the source magnitudes decay on elements distant\nfrom the true incident source, i.e., the airframe. Hence, in order for this\napproach to be valid, the sources cannot be truncated.

To test the robustness of\nouter light measurements across different data sets, we compare the surface\nbrightness profiles of massive galaxies using four independent data sets: the\nHyper Suprime-Cam survey (HSC), the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS),\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the Dragonfly Wide Field Survey\n(Dragonfly). We use customized pipelines for HSC and DECaLS to achieve better\nsky background subtraction. For galaxies at $z<0.05$, Dragonfly has the best\ncontrol of systematics, reaching surface brightness levels of $\\mu_r \\sim 30$\nmag/arcsec$^{2}$. At $0.19<z<0.50$, HSC can reliably recover surface brightness\nprofiles to $\\mu_{r} \\sim 28.5$ mag/arcsec$^{2}$ reaching $R=100 - 150$ kpc.\nDECaLS surface brightness profiles show good agreement with HSC but are noisier\nat large radii. The median profiles of galaxy ensembles in both HSC and DECaLS\nreach $R > 200$ kpc without significant bias. At $0.19<z<0.50$, DECaLS and HSC\nmeasurements of the stellar mass contained within 100 kpc agree within 0.05\ndex. Finally, we use weak gravitational lensing to show that measurements of\nouter light with DECaLS at $0.19<z<0.50$ show a similar promise as HSC as a low\nscatter proxy of halo mass. The tests and results from this paper represent an\nimportant step forward for accurate measurements of the outer light of massive\ngalaxies and demonstrate that outer light measurements from DECam imaging will\nbe a promising method for finding galaxy clusters for DES and DESI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 15:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Among three variants of nonparametric indices, both the popular CAS\nasymmetry parameter and the outer asymmetry parameter (A_outer) yield robust\nmeasures of morphological distortion for star-forming galaxies and type 2 AGNs,\nwhile only A_outer is effective for type 1 AGNs. The shape asymmetry, by\ncomparison, is affected more adversely by background noise. Asymmetry indices >\n0.4 effectively trace systems that are candidate ongoing mergers.

Moreover, type 2\nAGNs are morphologically indistinguishable from their type 1 counterparts. The\nlevel of AGN activity does not correlate with asymmetry, not even among the\nmajor merger candidates. As a by-product, we find, consistent with previous\nstudies, that the average asymmetry of star-forming galaxies increases above\nthe main sequence, although not all major mergers exhibit enhanced star\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 15:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

However it has remained\nchallenging to formulate this concept properly within a single Landau level.\nRecently a low-energy noncommutative field theory for bosons at Landau-level\nfilling factor $\\nu=1$ has been formulated by Dong and Senthil. In the limit of\nlong-wavelength and small-amplitude gauge fluctuation, they found it reduces to\nthe celebrated Halperin-Lee-Read theory of composite fermion liquid. In this\nwork we consider a Bose-Fermi mixture at total filling factor $\\nu=1$.\nDifferent from previous work, the number density of composite fermions in the\nmixture and corresponding Fermi momentum can be tuned by changing the filling\nfactor of bosons, $\\nu_b = 1 -\\nu_f$. This tunability enables us to study the\ndilute limit $\\nu_b\\ll 1$, which allows for a controlled and asymptotically\nexact calculation of the energy dispersion and effective mass of composite\nfermions. Furthermore, the approximation of the low-energy description by a\ncommutative field theory is manifestly justified. Most importantly, we\ndemonstrate gauge fluctuations acquire a Higgs mass due to the presence of a\ncomposite boson condensate, as a result of which the system behaves like a\ngenuine Landau Fermi liquid. Combined with the irrelevance of four-fermion\ninteraction in the dilute limit, we are able to obtain asymptotically exact\nproperties of this composite fermion Fermi liquid. In the opposite limit of\n$\\nu_f\\ll 1$, the Higgs mass goes to zero and we find crossover between Fermi\nliquid and non-Fermi liquid as temperature increases. Observing these\nproperties either experimentally or numerically provides unambiguous evidence\nof not only the composite fermions and the Fermi surface they form, but also\nthe presence of emergent gauge fields and their fluctuations due to strong\ncorrelation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 15:44:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Jan 2022 15:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

These online APIs enable authenticated third-party services\nand applications (apps) to access a user's account data for tasks such as\nsingle sign-on (SSO), calendar integration, and sending email on behalf of the\nuser, among others. Despite their prevalence, API access could pose significant\nprivacy and security risks, where a third-party could have unexpected\nprivileges to a user's account. To gauge users' perceptions and concerns\nregarding third-party apps that integrate with online APIs, we performed a\nmulti-part online survey of Google users. First, we asked n = 432 participants\nto recall if and when they allowed third-party access to their Google account:\n89% recalled using at least one SSO and 52% remembered at least one third-party\napp. In the second survey, we re-recruited n = 214 participants to ask about\nspecific apps and SSOs they've authorized on their own Google accounts. We\ncollected in-the-wild data about users' actual SSOs and authorized apps: 86%\nused Google SSO on at least one service, and 67% had at least one third-party\napp authorized. After examining their apps and SSOs, participants expressed the\nmost concern about access to personal information like email addresses and\nother publicly shared info. However, participants were less concerned with\nbroader -- and perhaps more invasive -- access to calendars, emails, or cloud\nstorage (as needed by third-party apps). This discrepancy may be due in part to\ntrust transference to apps that integrate with Google, forming an implied\npartnership. Our results suggest opportunities for design improvements to the\ncurrent third-party management tools offered by Google; for example, tracking\nrecent access, automatically revoking access due to app disuse, and providing\npermission controls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 15:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

Extending this supervised scheme further, we introduce a new\ntype of teacher model for connectionist temporal classification (CTC)-based\nsequence models, namely Oracle Teacher, that leverages both the source inputs\nand the output labels as the teacher model's input.

In this paper, a novel approach based on Temporal Fusion\nTransformer (TFT) was proposed to predict departure and arrival delays\nsimultaneously for multiple airports at once. This approach can capture complex\ntemporal dynamics of the inputs known at the time of prediction and then\nforecast selected delay metrics up to four hours into the future. When dealing\nwith weather inputs, a self-supervised learning (SSL) model was developed to\nencode high-dimensional weather data into a much lower-dimensional\nrepresentation to make the training of TFT more efficiently and effectively.\nThe initial results show that the TFT-based delay prediction model achieves\nsatisfactory performance measured by smaller prediction errors on a testing\ndataset. In addition, the interpretability analysis of the model outputs\nidentifies the important input factors for delay prediction.

Instead of reconstructing a CAD model from point clouds via surface\nreconstruction and a subsequent boundary conforming mesh generation, a direct\nanalysis without pre-processing is possible using embedded domain finite\nelement methods. These methods use non-boundary conforming meshes which calls\nfor a weak enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions. For point cloud based\nmodels, Dirichlet boundary conditions are usually imposed using a diffuse\ninterface approach. This leads to a significant computational overhead due to\nthe necessary computation of domain integrals. Additionally, undesired side\neffects on the gradients of the solution arise which can only be controlled to\nsome extent. This paper develops a new sharp interface approach for point cloud\nbased models which avoids both issues. The computation of domain integrals is\ncircumvented by an implicit approximation of corresponding Voronoi diagrams of\nhigher order and the resulting sharp approximation avoids the side-effects of\ndiffuse approaches.

In this paper, we propose a multitask\nlearning method for visual-audio saliency prediction and sound source\nlocalization on multi-face video by leveraging visual, audio and face\ninformation. Specifically, we first introduce a large-scale database of\nmulti-face video in visual-audio condition (MVVA), containing eye-tracking data\nand sound source annotations. Using this database, we find that sound\ninfluences human attention, and conversly attention offers a cue to determine\nsound source on multi-face video. Guided by these findings, a visual-audio\nmulti-task network (VAM-Net) is introduced to predict saliency and locate sound\nsource. VAM-Net consists of three branches corresponding to visual, audio and\nface modalities. Visual branch has a two-stream architecture to capture spatial\nand temporal information. Face and audio branches encode audio signals and\nfaces, respectively. Finally, a spatio-temporal multi-modal graph (STMG) is\nconstructed to model the interaction among multiple faces. With joint\noptimization of these branches, the intrinsic correlation of the tasks of\nsaliency prediction and sound source localization is utilized and their\nperformance is boosted by each other. Experiments show that the proposed method\noutperforms 12 state-of-the-art saliency prediction methods, and achieves\ncompetitive results in sound source localization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 14:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Starting from a\ndataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum\naccounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart\ncontracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchanges and\nlending protocols have high degree and centrality values, that interactions\namong protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and\nthat known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols.\nTherefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested\nset of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols.
