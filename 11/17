In this work, we study a mobile impurity,\nrepresenting a small quantum bath, that interacts locally with an Anderson\ninsulator with a finite density of localized particles. Using static Hartree\napproximation to obtain an effective disorder strength, we formulate an\nanalytic criterion for the perturbative stability of the localization. Next, we\nuse an approximate dynamical Hartree method and the quasi-exact time-evolved\nblock decimation (TEBD) algorithm to study the dynamics of the system. We find\nthat the dynamical Hartree approach which completely ignores entanglement\nbetween the impurity and localized particles predicts the delocalization of the\nsystem.

Finally, using an extension of the density matrix renormalization\ngroup algorithm to excited states (DMRG-X), we approximate the highly excited\neigenstates of the system.

Focusing on the\nstandard first and second price auction mechanisms, we first show, using convex\nduality, that the optimal (infinite dimensional) bidding policy can be\nrepresented by a single finite vector of so-called \"pseudo-bids\". Using this\nresult we are able to show that, in contrast to the first price auction, the\noptimal solution in the second price case turns out to be a very simple\npiecewise constant function of time. Moreover, despite the fact that the\noptimal solution for the first price auction is genuinely dynamic, we show that\nthere remains a close connection between the two cases and that, empirically,\nthere is almost no difference between optimal behavior in either setting.\nFinally, we detail methods for implementing our bidding policies in practice\nwith further numerical simulations illustrating the performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 17:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Unlike the classical\nMIMO composed of discrete antennas, CAP-MIMO has a quasi-continuous antenna\nsurface, which is expected to generate any current distribution (i.e., pattern)\nand induce controllable spatial electromagnetic waves. In this way, the\ninformation is directly modulated on the electromagnetic waves, which makes it\npromising to approach the ultimate capacity of finite apertures. The pattern\ndesign is the key factor to determine the communication performance of\nCAP-MIMO, but it has not been well studied in the literature. In this paper, we\ndevelop the pattern-division multiplexing (PDM) to design the patterns for\nCAP-MIMO. Specifically, we first study and model a typical multi-user CAP-MIMO\nsystem, which allows us to formulate the sum-rate maximization problem.

Recently, with the advancement of deep learning\nand availability of large datasets, speech separation has been formulated as a\nsupervised learning problem. These approaches aim to learn discriminative\npatterns of speech, speakers, and background noise using a supervised learning\nalgorithm, typically a deep neural network. A long-lasting problem in\nsupervised speech separation is finding the correct label for each separated\nspeech signal, referred to as label permutation ambiguity. Permutation\nambiguity refers to the problem of determining the output-label assignment\nbetween the separated sources and the available single-speaker speech labels.\nFinding the best output-label assignment is required for calculation of\nseparation error, which is later used for updating parameters of the model.\nRecently, Permutation Invariant Training (PIT) has been shown to be a promising\nsolution in handling the label ambiguity problem. However, the overconfident\nchoice of the output-label assignment by PIT results in a sub-optimal trained\nmodel.

The chiral vortical effect (CVE) is an anomalous chiral\ncurrent along a rotation axis, expressed in terms of a gravimagnetic field and\na gravitational anomaly. Another one, the chiral torsional effect (CTE), arises\nfrom hydrodynamically independent frame fields and connection. We discuss the\nrelation of CVE, CTE and gravitational anomalies for relativistic fermions from\nthe perspective of torsion and the Nieh-Yan anomaly. The DC transport\ncoefficients of the two anomalies are found to be closely related depending\nwhether or not torsion is non-zero in the hydrodynamics. The relativistic\nanomaly from torsion is well defined if instead of an ultraviolet divergent\nterm, the chemical potential or temperature enter. The anomaly term is 2nd\norder in gradients and contributes in linear response for CTE, implying also\nthe same for CVE. As an example, we consider chiral $p+ip$ Weyl\nsuperfluids/conductors. At low-energies, the system is effectively relativistic\nalong a special anisotropy axis. The hydrodynamics is governed by two\nvelocities, normal velocity $\\boldsymbol{v}_n$ and superfluid velocity\n$\\boldsymbol{v}_s$. The two anomalies follow from the normal component rotation\nand the dependence of the momentum density on the superfluid velocity (order\nparameter). In the CVE the chiral current is produced by solid body rotation of\nthe normal component with (angular) velocity $\\boldsymbol{v}_n=\n\\boldsymbol\\Omega \\times \\boldsymbol{r}$. In the CTE, a chiral current is\nproduced the vorticity $\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{v}_s$, which in the\nlow-energy effective theory is torsion.

PDS 70 is one of the few cases where\nrobust evidence favours the presence of two planetary mass companions inside\nthe gap of the transition disk. Those planets are believed to be going through\nthe last stages of accretion from the protoplanetary disk, a process likely\nmediated by a circumplanetary disk (CPD).

There are various approaches for Topic Detection, among which\nthe Clustering approach is selected in this paper. Clustering requires distance\nand calculating distance needs embedding. The aim of this research is to\nsimultaneously study the three factors of embedding methods, distance metrics\nand clustering methods and their interaction. A dataset including one-month\ntweets collected with COVID-19-related hashtags is used for this study. Five\nmethods, from earlier to new methods, are selected among the embedding methods:\nWord2Vec, fastText, GloVe, BERT and T5. Five clustering methods are\ninvestigated in this paper that are: k-means, DBSCAN, OPTICS, spectral and\nJarvis-Patrick. Euclidian distance and Cosine distance as the most important\ndistance metrics in this field are also examined. First, more than 7,500 tests\nare performed to tune the parameters. Then, all the different combinations of\nembedding methods with distance metrics and clustering methods are investigated\nby silhouette metric. The number of these combinations is 50 cases. First, the\nresults of these 50 tests are examined. Then, the rank of each method is taken\ninto account in all the tests of that method. Finally, the major variables of\nthe research (embedding methods, distance metrics and clustering methods) are\nstudied separately. Averaging is performed over the control variables to\nneutralize their effect. The experimental results show that T5 strongly\noutperforms other embedding methods in terms of silhouette metric. In terms of\ndistance metrics, cosine distance is weakly better. DBSCAN is also superior to\nother methods in terms of clustering methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 17:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

The\ncentral quantifiers, 'change probabilities', are based on counting monotone\nchanges in discretizations of a profile. These probabilities, which are usually\nvarying with the scale, can be reinterpreted as scale-dependent Hurst\nexponents. For a large class of Gaussian stochastic processes change\nprobabilities are shown to be directly related to the classical Hurst exponent,\nwhich generalizes a relationship known for fractional Brownian motion. While\nbeing related to this classical roughness measure, the proposed method is more\ngenerally applicable, increasing therefore the flexibility of modeling and\ninvestigating surface profiles.

The generative adversarial network\n(GAN) has proven to be an effective deep learning framework for image\nsuper-resolution.

This phenomenon is linked to\ncomplex hydration effects that result in a net entropy gain upon phase\nseparation. To decipher the underlying molecular mechanism, we use all-atom\nmolecular dynamics simulations along with the two-phase thermodynamic method\nfor entropy calculation. Based on simulations of a single BSA protein in\nvarious salt solutions (NaCl, CaCl_2, MgCl_2, and YCl_3) at temperatures (T)\nranging 283-323 K, we find that the cation-protein binding affinity increases\nwith T, reflecting its thermodynamic driving force to be entropic in origin. We\nshow that in the cation binding process, many tightly bound water molecules\nfrom the solvation shells of a cation and the protein are released to the bulk,\nresulting in entropy gain. To rationalize the LCST behavior, we calculate the\n{\\zeta}-potential that shows charge inversion of the protein for solutions\ncontaining multivalent ions. The {\\zeta}-potential increases with T. Performing\nsimulations of two BSA proteins, we demonstrate that the protein-protein\nbinding is mediated by multiple cation bridges and involves similar dehydration\neffects that cause a large entropy gain which more than compensates for\nrotational and translational entropy losses of the proteins. Thus, the LCST\nbehavior is entropy-driven, but the associated solvation effects are markedly\ndifferent from hydrophobic hydration. Our findings have direct implications for\ntuning the phase behavior of biological and soft-matter systems, e.g., protein\ncondensation and crystallization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 18:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

In the context of how the brain learns, one\naspect of gradient descent that appears biologically difficult to realize (if\nnot implausible) is that its updates rely on feedback from later layers to\nearlier layers through the same connections. Such bidirected links are\nrelatively few in brain networks, and even when reciprocal connections exist,\nthey may not be equi-weighted. Random Feedback Alignment (Lillicrap et al.,\n2016), where the backward weights are random and fixed, has been proposed as a\nbio-plausible alternative and found to be effective empirically. We investigate\nhow and when feedback alignment (FA) works, focusing on one of the most basic\nproblems with layered structure -- low-rank matrix factorization. In this\nproblem, given a matrix $Y_{n\\times m}$, the goal is to find a low rank\nfactorization $Z_{n \\times r}W_{r \\times m}$ that minimizes the error\n$\\|ZW-Y\\|_F$. Gradient descent solves this problem optimally. We show that FA\nconverges to the optimal solution when $r\\ge \\mbox{rank}(Y)$. We also shed\nlight on how FA works. It is observed empirically that the forward weight\nmatrices and (random) feedback matrices come closer during FA updates. Our\nanalysis rigorously derives this phenomenon and shows how it facilitates\nconvergence of FA*, a closely related variant of FA. We also show that FA can\nbe far from optimal when $r < \\mbox{rank}(Y)$. This is the first provable\nseparation result between gradient descent and FA. Moreover, the\nrepresentations found by gradient descent and FA can be almost orthogonal even\nwhen their error $\\|ZW-Y\\|_F$ is approximately equal. As a corollary, these\nresults also hold for training two-layer linear neural networks when the\ntraining input is isotropic, and the output is a linear function of the input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 00:34:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 00:36:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 02:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

Using\nsimulated data, we measure the lowest detectable NFW mass at each location of\nthe lens plane, in the form of detailed \\emph{sensitivity maps}. In summary, we\nfind that: (i) the lowest detectable mass $M_{\\rm low}$ decreases linearly as\nthe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases and the sensitive area is larger when\nwe decrease the noise; (ii) a moderate increase in angular resolution (0.07\" vs\n0.09\") and pixel scale (0.01\" vs 0.04\") improves the sensitivity by on average\n0.25 dex in halo mass, with more significant improvement around the most\nsensitive regions; (iii) the sensitivity to low-mass objects is largest for\nbright and complex lensed galaxies located inside the caustic curves and lensed\ninto larger Einstein rings (i.e $r_{E}\\geq1.0\"$). We find that for the\nsensitive mock images considered in this work, the minimum mass that we can\ndetect at the redshift of the lens lies between $1.5\\times10^{8}$ and\n$3\\times10^{9}M_{\\odot}$. We derive analytic relations between $M_{\\rm low}$,\nthe SNR and resolution and discuss the impact of the lensing configuration and\nsource structure.

While these attributes position MATBG as a ground-breaking material\nplatform for revolutionary calorimetric applications2, these properties have so\nfar not been experimentally shown. Here we reveal the ultra-sensitive\ncalorimetric properties of a superconducting MATBG device, by monitoring its\ntemperature dependent critical current Ic under continuous laser heating with a\nwavelength of 1550nm. From the bolometric effect, we are able to extract the\ntemperature dependence of the electronic thermal conductance Gth, which\nremarkably has a non-zero value Gth = 0.19 pW/K at 35mK and in the low\ntemperature limit is consistent with a power law dependence, as expected for\nnodal superconductors. Photo-voltage measurements on this non-optimized device\nreveal a peak responsivity of S = 5.8 x 10^7 V/W when the device is biased\nclose to Ic, with a noise-equivalent power of NEP = 5.5 x 10^-16 WHz^-1/2.\nAnalysis of the intrinsic perfor-mance shows that a theoretically achievable\nlimit is defined by thermal fluctuations and can be as low as NEPTEF < 10^-20\nWHz-1/2, with operation speeds as fast as ~ 500 ns. This establishes\nsuperconducting MATBG as a revolutionizing active material for ultra-sensitive\nphoton-detection applications, which could enable currently unavailable\ntechnologies such as THz photon-number-resolving single-photon-detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 19:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

We first take the\nsecond-order Taylor expansion of the value function. The Bellman optimality\nequation is then approximated by a partial differential equation, which only\nrelies on the first and second moments of the transition model. By combining\nthe kernel representation of the value function, we then design an efficient\npolicy iteration algorithm whose policy evaluation step can be represented as a\nlinear system of equations characterized by a finite set of supporting states.\nWe first validate the proposed method through extensive simulations in $2D$\nobstacle avoidance and $2.5D$ terrain navigation problems. The results show\nthat the proposed approach leads to a much superior performance over several\nbaselines. We then develop a system that integrates our decision-making\nframework with onboard perception and conduct real-world experiments in both\ncluttered indoor and unstructured outdoor environments. The results from the\nphysical systems further demonstrate the applicability of our method in\nchallenging real-world environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 19:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

In this work, we propose\na novel problem -- sequential scene flow estimation (SSFE) -- that aims to\npredict 3D scene flow for all pairs of point clouds in a given sequence. This\nis unlike the previously studied problem of scene flow estimation which focuses\non two frames.\n  We introduce the SPCM-Net architecture, which solves this problem by\ncomputing multi-scale spatiotemporal correlations between neighboring point\nclouds and then aggregating the correlation across time with an order-invariant\nrecurrent unit. Our experimental evaluation confirms that recurrent processing\nof point cloud sequences results in significantly better SSFE compared to using\nonly two frames. Additionally, we demonstrate that this approach can be\neffectively modified for sequential point cloud forecasting (SPF), a related\nproblem that demands forecasting future point cloud frames.\n  Our experimental results are evaluated using a new benchmark for both SSFE\nand SPF consisting of synthetic and real datasets. Previously, datasets for\nscene flow estimation have been limited to two frames. We provide non-trivial\nextensions to these datasets for multi-frame estimation and prediction. Due to\nthe difficulty of obtaining ground truth motion for real-world datasets, we use\nself-supervised training and evaluation metrics.

A point\nscintillator detector was coupled to a gated amplifier and a real-time\ncontroller for dose monitoring and feedback control loop. The controller was\nprogrammed to integrate dose and measure pulse width of each radiation pulse\nand gate the LINAC beam when the prescribed dose was delivered.

Additionally, the scintillator was characterized\nin terms of its radiation stability, mean dose-rate, and dose per pulse\ndependence. Dose integration was performed for each radiation pulse and\ndisplayed in real-time. The scintillator was shown to be linear with mean\ndose-rate (40-380 Gy/s) and dose per pulse (0.3-1.3 Gy/Pulse) to within +/- 3%.\nHowever, the plastic scintillator was subject to significant radiation damage\n(16%/kGy) and would need to be calibrated frequently.

Many models aim in accurately reconstructing the magnetic\nfield topology of CMEs, considering its importance in assessing their impact on\nmodern technology and human activities in space and on ground. However, so far\nthere is little discussion about how the details of the magnetic structure of a\nspheromak affect its evolution through the ambient field in the modelling\ndomain, and what impact this has on the accuracy of magnetic field topology\npredictions. If the spheromak has its axis of symmetry (geometric axis) at an\nangle with respect to the direction of the ambient field, then the spheromak\nstarts rotating so that its symmetry axis finally aligns with the ambient\nfield. When using the spheromak in space weather forecasting models this\ntilting can happen already during insertion and significantly affects the\nresults. In this paper we highlight this issue previously not examined in the\nfield of space weather and we estimate the angle by which the spheromak rotates\nunder different conditions. To do this we generated simple purely radial\nambient magnetic field topologies (weak/strong positive/negative) and inserted\nspheromaks with varying initial speed and tilt, and magnetic helicity sign. We\nemploy different physical and geometric criteria to locate the magnetic centre\nof mass and axis of symmetry of the spheromak.

However, the nature\nof the bodies which pollute white dwarfs is not well understood: are they small\nasteroids, minor planets, or even terrestrial planets? We present a novel\nmethod to infer pollutant masses from detections of Ni, Cr and Si. During\ncore--mantle differentiation, these elements exhibit variable preference for\nmetal and silicate at different pressures (i.e., object masses), affecting\ntheir abundances in the core and mantle. We model core--mantle differentiation\nself-consistently using data from metal--silicate partitioning experiments. We\nplace statistical constraints on the differentiation pressures, and hence\nmasses, of bodies which pollute white dwarfs by incorporating this calculation\ninto a Bayesian framework. We show that Ni observations are best suited to\nconstraining pressure when pollution is mantle-like, while Cr and Si are better\nfor core-like pollution. We find 3 systems (WD0449-259, WD1350-162 and\nWD2105-820) whose abundances are best explained by the accretion of fragments\nof small parent bodies ($<0.2M_\\oplus$). For 2 systems (GD61 and WD0446-255),\nthe best model suggests the accretion of fragments of Earth-sized bodies,\nalthough the observed abundances remain consistent ($<3\\sigma$) with the\naccretion of undifferentiated material. This suggests that polluted white\ndwarfs potentially accrete planetary bodies of a range of masses. However, our\nresults are subject to inevitable degeneracies and limitations given current\ndata.

Our focus is on the trade-off between maximizing\nthroughput and minimizing latency in these networks. For every constant\nthroughput rate, we characterize (up to a constant factor) the minimum latency\nachievable by an oblivious reconfigurable network design that satisfies the\ngiven throughput guarantee. The trade-off between these two objectives turns\nout to be surprisingly subtle: the curve depicting it has an unexpected\nscalloped shape reflecting the fact that load-balancing becomes more difficult\nwhen the average length of routing paths is not an integer because equalizing\nall the path lengths is not possible.

Our new HST observations in the optical have allowed\nus to resolve the pulsar from a close-by galaxy and measure the optical fluxes\nmore accurately. Using the newly measured fluxes and a new calibration of the\nHST's far-UV detector, we fit the optical-UV pulsar's spectrum with a model\nthat consists of a nonthermal power-law ($f_\\nu\\propto \\nu^\\alpha$) and a\nthermal blackbody components.

The\ntemperature is lower than reported previously, but still much higher than\npredicted by NS passive cooling scenarios for such an old pulsar.

The analysis explicitly recognizes the occurrence\nof dynamics on disparate spatiotemporal scales, yielding simplified partial\ndifferential equations governing the coupled evolution of slow large-scale\nhydrostatic flows and fast small-scale isotropic instabilities and internal\nwaves. The dynamics captured by the coupled reduced equations is illustrated in\nthe context of two-dimensional strongly stratified Kolmogorov flow. A\nnoteworthy feature of the reduced model is that the fluctuations are\nconstrained to satisfy quasilinear (QL) dynamics about the comparably\nslowly-varying large-scale fields. Crucially, this QL reduction is not invoked\nas an ad hoc closure approximation, but rather is derived in a physically\nrelevant and mathematically consistent distinguished limit. Further analysis of\nthe resulting slow-fast QL system shows how the amplitude of the fast\nstratified-shear instabilities is slaved to the slowly-evolving mean fields to\nensure the marginal stability of the latter. Physically, this marginal\nstability condition appears to be compatible with recent evidence of\nself-organized criticality in both observations and simulations of stratified\nturbulence. lgorithmically, the slaving of the fluctuation fields enables\nnumerical simulations to be time-evolved strictly on the slow time scale of the\nhydrostatic flow. The reduced equations thus provide a solid mathematical\nfoundation for future studies of three-dimensional strongly stratified\nturbulence in extreme parameter regimes of geophysical relevance and suggest\navenues for new sub-grid-scale parameterizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 22:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

This behavior is related to the exponential cost\nreduction of its generated energy and the nearly unconstrained available\npotential of its natural resources. The cost reduction results from the\ncontinuous improvements in development, research, manufacturing, and\ninstallation, also showing a growth of its installation power per power plant\nor aero generator. We prove that if the historic exponential growth is followed\nin the future, it is possible to decarbonize the world's electric energy\nsystems' power supply in 2026. Furthermore, the global demand on primary energy\ncan be supplied in 2030, which leads to the total suppression of CO2 emissions\nrelated to the energy need of humanity. Because of the related cost reduction,\nenergy costs are not anymore relevant. Our extrapolation is based on the\ncontinuation of the historic growth functions of the globally installed PV and\nthe wind power plants, and we also discuss the conditions necessary to enable a\ntransition to such a 100% renewable energy production. Considering a\nnon-constrained growth of VRE power plants' installation power, decarbonization\nrelated to energy generation and use can be accomplished in a much shorter time\nframe as previously scheduled.

Accurate analyses of the density, the velocity, and\nrelated quantities such as the vorticity are performed by exploiting the fact\nthat ColDICE can follow locally the phase-space sheet at the quadratic level.\nTo test LPT predictions beyond shell-crossing, we employ a ballistic\napproximation, which assumes that the velocity field is frozen just after\nshell-crossing. In the generic case, where the amplitudes of the sine waves are\nall different, high-order LPT predictions match very well the exact solution,\neven beyond collapse. As expected, convergence slows down when going from\nquasi-1D dynamics where one wave dominates over the two others, to the\naxial-symmetric configuration, where all the amplitudes of the waves are equal.\nIt is also noticed that LPT convergence is slower when considering velocity\nrelated quantities. Additionally, the structure of the system at and beyond\ncollapse given by LPT and the simulations agrees very well with singularity\ntheory predictions, in particular with respect to the caustic and vorticity\npatterns that develop beyond collapse. Again, this does not apply to\naxial-symmetric configurations, that are still correct from the qualitative\npoint of view, but where multiple foldings of the phase-space sheet produce\nvery high density contrasts, hence a strong backreaction of the gravitational\nforce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 23:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

The formulation of the lemma involves a\ngraph with one vertex per event, with edges indicating potential negative\ndependence. The word \"Local\" in LLL reflects that the condition for the\nnegative correlation can be expressed solely in terms of the neighborhood of\neach vertex. In contrast to this local view, Shearer developed an exact\ncriterion for the avoidance probability to be strictly positive, but it\ninvolves summing over all independent sets of the graph.\n  In this work we make two contributions. The first is to develop a hierarchy\nof increasingly powerful, increasingly non-local lemmata for bounding the\navoidance probability from below, each lemma associated with a different set of\nwalks in the graph. Already, at its second level, our hierarchy is stronger\nthan all known local lemmata. To demonstrate its power we prove new bounds for\nthe negative-fugacity singularity of the hard-core model on several lattices, a\ncentral problem in statistical physics.\n  Our second contribution is to prove that Shearer's connection between the\nprobabilistic setting and the independent set polynomial holds for\n\\emph{arbitrary supermodular} functions, not just probability measures. This\nmeans that all LLL machinery can be employed to bound from below an arbitrary\nsupermodular function, based only on information regarding its value at\nsingleton sets and partial information regarding their interactions. We show\nthat this readily implies both the quantum LLL of Ambainis, Kempe, and\nSattath~[JACM 2012], and the quantum Shearer criterion of Sattath, Morampudi,\nLaumann, and Moessner~[PNAS 2016].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 23:49:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

Predictive models could play a significant\nrole in informing architects and designers of the impact of their design\ndecisions on energy consumption in buildings during early design stages. A\nbuilding outline is a significant predictor of the final energy consumption and\nis conceptually determined by architects in the early design phases.

The results show that buildings with square\nshapes, in general, are more energy-efficient compared to buildings with T, U,\nand L shapes of the same volume. Also, T, U, and L shape samples show very\nsimilar behavior in terms of energy consumption. Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) is applied to assess the variables' correlations on data distribution;\nthe results show that wall material specifications explain about 40% of data\nvariation.

One such method is the CORAL method, which is based on\nan earlier binary label extension framework and achieves rank consistency among\nits output layer tasks by imposing a weight-sharing constraint.

It is thus crucial to comprehensively test the fairness of these\napplications before deployment. Existing fairness testing methods suffer from\nthe following limitations: 1) applicability, i.e., they are only applicable for\nstructured data or text without handling the high-dimensional and abstract\ndomain sampling in the semantic level for image classification applications; 2)\nfunctionality, i.e., they generate unfair samples without providing testing\ncriterion to characterize the model's fairness adequacy. To fill the gap, we\npropose DeepFAIT, a systematic fairness testing framework specifically designed\nfor deep image classification applications. DeepFAIT consists of several\nimportant components enabling effective fairness testing of deep image\nclassification applications: 1) a neuron selection strategy to identify the\nfairness-related neurons; 2) a set of multi-granularity adequacy metrics to\nevaluate the model's fairness; 3) a test selection algorithm for fixing the\nfairness issues efficiently. We have conducted experiments on widely adopted\nlarge-scale face recognition applications, i.e., VGGFace and FairFace.

To improve the\nperformance of surveillance systems, a real-time temporal handgun detection\nsystem should be built. Using Temporal Yolov5, an architecture based on\nQuasi-Recurrent Neural Networks, temporal information is extracted from video\nto improve the results of handgun detection. Moreover, two publicly available\ndatasets are proposed, labeled with hands, guns, and phones.

Many numerical simulations of this process have been\nconducted, but detailed simulations and analysis of gap formation by a\nsuper-Jupiter mass planet have not been thoroughly conducted. We performed\ntwo-dimensional numerical hydrodynamic simulations of the gap formation process\nby a super-Jupiter mass planet and examined the eccentricity of the gap. When\nthe planet is massive, the radial motion of gas is excited, causing the\neccentricity of the gap's outer edge to increase. Our simulations showed that\nthe critical planetary mass for the eccentric gap was $\\sim3~M_{\\rm J}$ in a\ndisk with $\\alpha=4.0\\times10^{-3}$ and $h/r=0.05$, a finding that was\nconsistent with that reported in a previous work.

The onset of gap eccentricity enhanced the\nsurface density inside the gap, shallowing the gap more than the empirical\nrelation derived in previous studies for a planet heavier than the critical\nmass. Therefore, our results suggest that the mass accretion rate, which\nstrongly depends on the gas surface density in the gap is also enhanced for\nsuper-Jupiter mass planets.

TorchGeo\nis also the first library to provide pre-trained models for multispectral\nsatellite imagery (e.g., models that use all bands from the Sentinel-2\nsatellites), allowing for advances in transfer learning on downstream remote\nsensing tasks with limited labeled data. We use TorchGeo to create reproducible\nbenchmark results on existing datasets and benchmark our proposed method for\npreprocessing geospatial imagery on the fly. TorchGeo is open source and\navailable on GitHub: https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 02:47:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2021 20:15:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 22:19:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 18:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

This need becomes critical when\nalgorithms are used in automated decision making systems that can hugely impact\npeople's lives.\n  Many approaches have been proposed to make learning algorithms fair by\ndetecting and mitigating bias in different stages of optimization. However, due\nto a lack of a universal definition of fairness, these algorithms optimize for\na particular interpretation of fairness which makes them limited for real world\nuse. Moreover, an underlying assumption that is common to all algorithms is the\napparent equivalence of achieving fairness and removing bias. In other words,\nthere is no user defined criteria that can be incorporated into the\noptimization procedure for producing a fair algorithm. Motivated by these\nshortcomings of existing methods, we propose the CONFAIR procedure that\nproduces a fair algorithm by incorporating user constraints into the\noptimization procedure.

One such critical\nscenario is the Search and Rescue effort in the event of a disaster where\ntimely discovery and help deployment is of utmost importance. This paper\ndemonstrates the applicability of a bio-inspired technique, namely Ant\nAlgorithms (AA), in optimizing the search time for a near optimal path to a\ntrapped victim, followed by the application of Dijkstra's algorithm in the\nrescue phase. The inherent exploratory nature of AA is put to use for a faster\nmapping and coverage of the unknown search space.

As an essential\nlow-level pre-processing stage, a deraining network should clear the rain\nstreaks and preserve the fine semantic details. However, most existing methods\nonly consider low-level image restoration. That limits their performances at\nhigh-level tasks requiring precise semantic information. To address this issue,\nin this paper, we present a segmentation-aware progressive network (SAPNet)\nbased upon contrastive learning for single image deraining. We start our method\nwith a lightweight derain network formed with progressive dilated units (PDU).\nThe PDU can significantly expand the receptive field and characterize\nmulti-scale rain streaks without the heavy computation on multi-scale images. A\nfundamental aspect of this work is an unsupervised background segmentation\n(UBS) network initialized with ImageNet and Gaussian weights. The UBS can\nfaithfully preserve an image's semantic information and improve the\ngeneralization ability to unseen photos. Furthermore, we introduce a perceptual\ncontrastive loss (PCL) and a learned perceptual image similarity loss (LPISL)\nto regulate model learning. By exploiting the rainy image and groundtruth as\nthe negative and the positive sample in the VGG-16 latent space, we bridge the\nfine semantic details between the derained image and the groundtruth in a fully\nconstrained manner. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world rainy\nimages show our model surpasses top-performing methods and aids object\ndetection and semantic segmentation with considerable efficacy.

As one of the central\nchallenges, crop yield prediction has become a pressing task in the machine\nlearning field.

First, we apply the mass-flow\nconservation law to specify traffic feasibility and present continuous-time\ndynamics for modeling traffic as a network problem by defining a network of\ninterconnected roads (NOIR). The traffic congestion control is formulated as a\nboundary control problem and we use the concept of statetransition matrix to\nhelp with the optimization of boundary flow by solving a constrained optimal\ncontrol problem using quadratic programming.

Because it is inexpensive,\neasy to implement, and noninvasive, it also represents an excellent candidate\nmodality for use in the BCI setting. Nonetheless, a complete understanding of\nhow EEG measurements (voltage fluctuations) relate to information processing in\nthe brain remains somewhat elusive. A deeper understanding of the\nneuroanatomical underpinnings of the EEG signal may help explain\ninter-individual variability in evoked and induced potentials, which may\nimprove BCI therapies targeted to the individual. According to classic\nbiophysical models, EEG fluctuations are primarily a reflection of locally\nsynchronized neuronal oscillations within the gray matter oriented\napproximately orthogonal to the scalp. In contrast, global models ignore local\nsignals due to dendritic processing, and suggest that propagation delays due to\nwhite matter architecture are responsible for the EEG signal, and are capable\nof explaining the coherence between numerous rhythms (e.g., alpha) at spatially\ndistinct areas of the scalp. Recently, combined local-global models suggest\nthat the EEG signal may reflect a superposition of local processing along with\nglobal contributors including transduction along white matter tracts in the\nbrain. Incorporating both local and global (e.g., white matter) priors into EEG\nsource models may therefore improve source estimates. These models may also\nhelp disentangle which aspects of the EEG signal are predicted to colocalize\nspatially with measurements from functional MRI (fMRI). Here, we explore the\npossibility that white matter conductivity contributes to EEG measurements via\na generative model based on classic axonal transduction models, and discuss its\npotential implications for source estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 07:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

Dynamic resource management such as load\nbalancing and energy-saving policies can request multiple migrations when the\nalgorithms are triggered periodically. There exist notable research efforts in\ndynamic resource management that alleviate single migration overheads, such as\nsingle migration time and co-location interference while selecting the\npotential VMs and migration destinations. However, by neglecting the resource\ndependency among potential migration requests, the existing solutions of\ndynamic resource management can result in the Quality of Service (QoS)\ndegradation and Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during the migration\nschedule. Therefore, it is essential to integrate both single and multiple\nmigration overheads into VM reallocation planning. In this paper, we propose a\nconcurrency-aware multiple migration selector that operates based on the\nmaximal cliques and independent sets of the resource dependency graph of\nmultiple migration requests.

This paper raises the following\nquestions: (i) can we unlearn a single or multiple class(es) of data from a ML\nmodel without looking at the full training data even once? (ii) can we make the\nprocess of unlearning fast and scalable to large datasets, and generalize it to\ndifferent deep networks? We introduce a novel machine unlearning framework with\nerror-maximizing noise generation and impair-repair based weight manipulation\nthat offers an efficient solution to the above questions. An error-maximizing\nnoise matrix is learned for the class to be unlearned using the original model.\nThe noise matrix is used to manipulate the model weights to unlearn the\ntargeted class of data. We introduce impair and repair steps for a controlled\nmanipulation of the network weights.

With\nvery few update steps, we show excellent unlearning while substantially\nretaining the overall model accuracy. Unlearning multiple classes requires a\nsimilar number of update steps as for a single class, making our approach\nscalable to large problems.

Logratios between pairs of compositional parts (pairwise\nlogratios) are the easiest to interpret in many research problems. When the\nnumber of parts is large, some form of logratio selection is a must, for\ninstance by means of an unsupervised learning method based on a stepwise\nselection of the pairwise logratios that explain the largest percentage of the\nlogratio variance in the compositional dataset. In this article we present\nthree alternative stepwise supervised learning methods to select the pairwise\nlogratios that best explain a dependent variable in a generalized linear model,\neach geared for a specific problem. The first method features unrestricted\nsearch, where any pairwise logratio can be selected. This method has a complex\ninterpretation if some pairs of parts in the logratios overlap, but it leads to\nthe most accurate predictions. The second method restricts parts to occur only\nonce, which makes the corresponding logratios intuitively interpretable. The\nthird method uses additive logratios, so that $K-1$ selected logratios involve\nexactly $K$ parts. This method in fact searches for the subcomposition with the\nhighest explanatory power. Once the subcomposition is identified, the\nresearcher's favourite logratio representation may be used in subsequent\nanalyses, not only pairwise logratios.

It operates in two\nstages: a fast and lightweight planning phase, where we draft a high-level\nscene layout, followed by an attention-based execution phase, where the layout\nis being refined, evolving into a rich and detailed picture. Our model moves\naway from conventional black-box GAN architectures that feature a flat and\nmonolithic latent space towards a transparent design that encourages\nefficiency, controllability and interpretability. We demonstrate GANformer2's\nstrengths and qualities through a careful evaluation over a range of datasets,\nfrom multi-object CLEVR scenes to the challenging COCO images, showing it\nsuccessfully achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual quality,\ndiversity and consistency.

Detecting pedestrians with substantial appearance diversities such\nas different pedestrian silhouettes, different viewpoints or different\ndressing, remains a crucial challenge. Instead of learning each of these\ndiverse pedestrian appearance features individually as most existing methods\ndo, we propose to perform contrastive learning to guide the feature learning in\nsuch a way that the semantic distance between pedestrians with different\nappearances in the learned feature space is minimized to eliminate the\nappearance diversities, whilst the distance between pedestrians and background\nis maximized. To facilitate the efficiency and effectiveness of contrastive\nlearning, we construct an exemplar dictionary with representative pedestrian\nappearances as prior knowledge to construct effective contrastive training\npairs and thus guide contrastive learning. Besides, the constructed exemplar\ndictionary is further leveraged to evaluate the quality of pedestrian proposals\nduring inference by measuring the semantic distance between the proposal and\nthe exemplar dictionary. Extensive experiments on both daytime and nighttime\npedestrian detection validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 08:34:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 08:52:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 07:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

For wave scattering in a layered orthotropic medium, this\nquestion is affirmatively answered for the first time in this paper. In each\northotropic medium, the permittivity tensor uniquely determines a change of\ncoordinates, that transforms the governing anisotropic Helmholtz equation into\nan isotropic Helmholtz equation in the new coordinate system. This leads us to\npropose a novel Sommerfeld radiation condition (SRC) to rigorously characterize\noutgoing waves in the layered orthotropic medium. Naturally, the SRC motivates\na regionalized PML (RPML) to truncate the scattering problem, in the sense that\na standard PML is set up in the new coordinate system in each orthotropic\nregion. It is revealed that the RPML is unconditionally stable compared with\nthe unstable uniaxial PML. A high-accuracy boundary integral equation (BIE)\nmethod is developed to solve the resulting boundary value problem.

In almost all cases, the resulting coarse-grained stochastic\npartial differential equations carry a short-scale cutoff -- which is also\nreflected in numerical discretisation schemes. We draw together our recent\nfindings concerning the construction of such schemes and the interpretation of\ntheir continuum limits, focusing for simplicity on models with a purely\ndiffusive scalar field, such as `Model B' which describes phase separation in\nbinary fluid mixtures. We address the requirement that the steady state entropy\nproduction rate (EPR) must vanish for any stochastic hydrodynamic model in\nthermal equilibrium. Only if this is achieved can the given discretisation\nscheme be relied upon to correctly calculate the nonvanishing EPR for `active\nfield theories' in which new terms are deliberately added to the fluctuating\nhydrodynamic equations that break detailed balance. To compute the correct\nprobabilities of forward and time-reversed paths (whose ratio determines the\nEPR) we must make a careful treatment of so-called `spurious drift' and other\nclosely related terms that depend on the discretisation scheme. We show that\nsuch subtleties can arise not only in the temporal discretisation (as is well\ndocumented for stochastic ODEs with multiplicative noise) but also from spatial\ndiscretisation, even when noise is additive, as most active field theories\nassume. We then review how such noise can become multiplicative, via\noff-diagonal couplings to additional fields that encode thermodynamically the\nunderlying chemical processes responsible for activity. In this case the\nspurious drift terms need careful accounting, not just to evaluate correctly\nthe EPR, but also to numerically implement the Langevin dynamics itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 09:24:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 12:09:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

We parameterize the problem\nwith two parameters: the size of the thread pool as well as the number of\ncontext switches for each task. The size of the thread pool determines the\nnumber of workers running concurrently. The number of context switches\ndetermines how many times a worker can be swapped out while executing a single\ntask - like many verification problems for multithreaded recursive programs,\nthe context bounding is important for decidability.\n  We show that the safety verification problem for thread-pooled,\ncontext-bounded, Boolean programs is EXPSPACE-complete, even if the size of the\nthread pool and the context bound are given in binary.

The\nqubit placement algorithm exploits the iterated local search framework to find\na desirable initial mapping for the reduced symmetric form of the original\ncircuit. The qubit routing method generates the physical circuit through\nmulti-agent communication and collaboration. Each agent inserts the ancillary\ngates independently according to its environment state. The quality of the\nphysical circuit evolves according to an information-exchanging mechanism\nbetween agents, which combines the local search and global search.

Here, we aim to study how the density inhomogeneity\nin the longitudinal and radial directions modify the periods and damping times\nof kink oscillations, and how this effect would be reflected in observations.\nWe solve the ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations through two different\nmethods: a) performing 3D numerical simulations, and b) solving a 2D\ngeneralised eigenvalue problem. We study the dependence of the periods, damping\ntimes and amplitudes of transverse kink oscillations on the ratio between the\ndensities at the centre and at the ends of the tube, and on the average\ndensity. We apply forward modelling on our 3D simulations to compute synthetic\nH$\\alpha$ profiles. We confirm that the ratio of the period of the fundamental\noscillation mode to the period of the first harmonic increases as the ratio of\nthe central density to the footpoint density is increased or as the averaged\ndensity of the tube is decreased. We find that the damping times due to\nresonant absorption decrease as the central to footpoint density ratio\nincreases. Contrary to the case of longitudinally homogeneous tubes, we find\nthat the damping time to period ratio also increases as the density ratio is\nincreased or the average density is reduced.

Furthermore, the expectation is that an\nunknown number of subsets describe functions showing very different\ncharacteristics.

Our method aims to find a suitable\napproximation that is robust to outliers and represents the best or worst case\nin a way that will apply to as many types as possible.

Second, we combine these members and define a weighting\nthat uses the properties of the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) to increase the\ninfluence of non-outliers and to decrease outliers. The weighting ensures\nrobustness to outliers and makes sure that approximations are suitable for most\ntypes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 11:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

Recently, magnetic quantum oscillations and\nmetallic low-temperature thermal conductivity have been observed in the Kondo\ninsulator YbB$_{12}$, whose resistivity is a few orders of magnitude higher\nthan those of conventional metals. As yet, these unusual observations are not\nfully understood. Here we present a detailed investigation of the behavior of\nYbB$_{12}$ under intense magnetic fields using both transport and torque\nmagnetometry measurements. A low-field Hall anomaly, reminiscent of the Hall\nresponse associated with \"strange-metal\" physics, develops at $T < 1.5$ K. At\ntwo characteristic magnetic fields ($\\mu_0H_1= 19.6$ T and $\\mu_0H_2 \\sim 31$\nT), signatures appear in the Hall coefficient, magnetic torque, and\nmagnetoresistance. We suggest that they are likely to be field-induced Lifshitz\ntransitions. Moreover, above 35 T, the background resistivity displays an\nunusual, nonmetallic $T^{\\alpha}$-behavior, with $\\alpha$ being field-dependent\nand varying between -1.5 and -2. By normalizing the Shubnikov-de Haas\noscillation amplitude to this $T^{\\alpha}$-dependence, the calculated cyclotron\nmass becomes more consistent with that deduced from de Haas-van Alphen\noscillations. Our results support a novel two-fluid scenario in YbB$_{12}$: a\nFermi-liquid-like fluid of charge-neutral quasiparticles coexists with charge\ncarriers that remain in a nonmetallic state. The former experience successive\nLifshitz transitions and develop Landau quantization in applied magnetic\nfields, whilst scattering between both fluids allows the Shubnikov-de Haas\neffect to be observed in the electrical transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 12:02:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 06:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

Taking\nthis starting point seriously turns out to have considerable explanatory power,\nand several key ideas are developed from it: (1) past experience, encoded in\nprior expectations, has an influence over the future that is analogous to\nregularization as known from machine learning; (2) action generation\n(interpreted as constraint satisfaction) is a special case of such\nregularization; (3) the concept of attractors in dynamical systems provides a\nuseful lens through which prior expectations, regularization, and action\ninduction can be viewed; these thus appear as different perspectives on the\nsame phenomenon; (4) the phylogenetically ancient imperative of acting to\nensure and thereby observe conditions beneficial for survival is likely the\nsame as that which underlies perceptual inference.

At larger pump fluency the spectral purification is even\nmore effective with up to a 6.6 times reduction in $g_2(0)$, which is due to\nthe suppression of higher order excitons and shell states experiencing even\nlarger blueshift. Our results indicate the potential for synthesis engineered\ngiant shell quantum dots, with further increased biexciton blueshift, for\nquantum optical applications requiring both high purity and brightness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 13:15:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 10:14:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 15:23:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 13:35:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

Determining precise and consistent parameters\n(radius, temperature, color excess, and projection factor) of Cepheid pulsating\nstars is therefore very important. With the high-precision parallaxes delivered\nby the early third Gaia data release, we aim to derive various parameters of\nCepheid stars in order to calibrate the period-luminosity and period-radius\nrelations and to investigate the relation of period to p-factor. We applied an\nimplementation of the parallax-of-pulsation method through the algorithm called\nSpectro-Photo-Interferometry of Pulsating Stars, which combines all types of\navailable data for a variable star in a global modeling of its pulsation. We\npresent the SPIPS modeling of a sample of 63 Galactic Cepheids.

We then derive new\ncalibrations of the period-luminosity and period-radius relations. After\ninvestigating the dependences of the p-factor on the parameters of the stars,\nwe find a high dispersion of its values and no evidence of its correlation with\nthe period or with any other parameters.

We generate a set of simulated sky maps with CMB and polarized\nforeground emission, and inject instrumental noise and polarization angle\noffsets to the 22 (partially overlapping) LiteBIRD frequency channels. Our\nin-flight angle calibration relies on nulling the EB cross correlation of the\npolarized signal in each channel. This calibration step has been carried out by\ntwo independent groups with a blind analysis, allowing an accuracy of the order\nof a few arc-minutes to be reached on the estimate of the angle offsets. Both\nthe corrected and uncorrected multi-frequency maps are propagated through the\nforeground cleaning step, with the goal of computing clean CMB maps. We employ\ntwo component separation algorithms, the Bayesian-Separation of Components and\nResiduals Estimate Tool (B-SeCRET), and the Needlet Internal Linear Combination\n(NILC). We find that the recovered CMB maps obtained with algorithms that do\nnot make any assumptions about the foreground properties, such as NILC, are\nonly mildly affected by the angle miscalibration. However, polarization angle\noffsets strongly bias results obtained with the parametric fitting method. Once\nthe miscalibration angles are corrected by EB nulling prior to the component\nseparation, both component separation algorithms result in an unbiased\nestimation of the r parameter. While this work is motivated by the conceptual\ndesign study for LiteBIRD, its framework can be broadly applied to any CMB\npolarization experiment. In particular, the combination of simulation plus\nblind analysis provides a robust forecast by taking into account not only\ndetector sensitivity but also systematic effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 14:24:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 09:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

Typically, separate pathways have been considered to\nextract hazardous transition metals or phosphate, independently from each\nother. Investigations on the simultaneous removal of multiple components have\nbeen studied only to a limited extent. Here, we report the synthesis routes for\nCo- and Ni-struvites (NH4MPO4.6H2O, M = Ni2+, Co2+ ), which allow for P,\nammonia and metal co precipitation. By evaluating different reaction\nparameters, the phase and stability of transition metal struvites, as well as\ntheir crystal morphologies, and sizes could be optimized. Ni-struvite is stable\nin a wide reactant concentration range and at different metal/phosphorus (M/P)\nratios, whereas Co-struvite only forms at low M/P ratios. Detailed\ninvestigations of the precipitation process using ex situ and in situ\ntechniques provided insights into the crystallization mechanisms/crystal\nengineering of these materials. M-struvites crystallize via intermediate\ncolloidal nanophases, which subsequently aggregate and condense to final\ncrystals after extended reaction times. However, the exact reaction kinetics of\nthe formation of a final crystalline product varies significantly depending on\nthe metal cation involved in the precipitation process: several seconds (Mg) to\nminutes (Ni) to hours (Co). The achieved level of control over the morphology\nand size, makes precipitation of metal struvites a promising method for direct\nmetal recovery and binding them in the form of valuable phosphate raw\nmaterials. Under this paradigm, the crystals can be potentially upcycled as\nprecursor powders for electrochemical applications, which require transition\nmetal phosphates (TMPs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 14:26:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 13:39:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:42:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 13:54:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 10:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

These methods provide\nhigh spatiotemporal resolution on particle dynamics and allow for concurrent\nspectroscopic measurements. This review article begins with a survey of\nexisting techniques and of applications where RT-FD-SPT has played an important\nrole. We then systematically discuss each of the core components of RT-FD-SPT\nin order to develop an understanding of the trade-offs that must be made in\nalgorithm design and to create a clear picture of the important differences,\nadvantages, and drawbacks of existing approaches. These components are feedback\ntracking and control, ranging from simple proportional-integral-derivative\ncontrol to advanced nonlinear techniques, estimation to determine particle\nlocation from the measured data, including both online and offline algorithms,\nand techniques for calibrating and characterizing different RT-FD-SPT methods.\nWe then introduce a collection of metrics for RT-FD-SPT to help guide\nexperimentalists in selecting a method for their particular application and to\nhelp reveal where there are gaps in the techniques that represent opportunities\nfor further development.

For example, brand X\nmay seek to hire an influencer Y to create sponsored content to be posted on\nsocial media platform Z. This problem has a hidden action component (the brand\nmay not be able or willing to observe the amount of effort exerted by the\ninfluencer), but also a private type component (influencers may have different\ncosts per unit-of-effort).\n  This \"effort\" and \"cost per unit-of-effort\" perspective naturally leads to a\nprincipal-agent problem with hidden action and single-dimensional private type,\nwhich generalizes both the classic principal-agent hidden action model of\ncontract theory \\`a la Grossman and Hart [1983] and the (procurement version)\nof single-dimensional mechanism design \\`a la Myerson [1981]. A natural goal in\nthis model is to design an incentive-compatible contract, which consist of an\nallocation rule that maps types to actions, and a payment rule that maps types\nto payments for the stochastic outcomes of the chosen action.\n  Our main contribution is a linear programming (LP) duality based\ncharacterization of implementable allocation rules for this model, which\napplies to both discrete and continuous types. This characterization shares\nimportant features of Myerson's celebrated characterization result, but also\ndeparts from it in significant ways. We present several applications, including\na polynomial-time algorithm for finding the optimal contract with a constant\nnumber of actions. This is in sharp contrast to recent work on hidden action\nproblems with multi-dimensional private information, which has shown that the\nproblem of computing an optimal contract for constant numbers of actions is\nAPX-hard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:16:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 20:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

These layered metal-organic samples show up to four anti-crossings\nin their dispersions correlating in energy with the respective degree of ZnPc\nfluorination. By means of complementary structural and theoretical data, we\nattribute the observed anti-crossings to three main scenarios of surface\nplasmon coupling: i) to aggregated $\\alpha $-phase regions within the FnZnPc\nlayers at 1.75 eV and 1.85 eV , ii) to a coexisting F16ZnPc $\\beta $-polymorph\nat 1.51 eV, and iii) to monomers, preferentially located at the metal\ninterface, at 2.15 eV.

When compared with all other changes, we find a\nstatistically significant difference in one metric for all rules and two\nmetrics for a subset of rules.

Inspired by Stackelberg\ngames, we introduce four novel preference communication protocols to aid agents\nin arriving at adequate solutions. Each protocol describes a specific approach\nfor one agent to communicate preferences over their actions and how another\nagent responds. Additionally, to study when communication emerges, we introduce\na communication protocol where agents must learn when to communicate.

In some cases, such characteristics can be calculated,\nbut this is possible for a limited number of real models. However, in most\ncases, it is possible to calculate or estimate the stationary values of the\ncharacteristics of the studied models. We can use linear Markov processes to\nmodel how the overwhelming majority of queuing systems (QS), reliability\nsystems, and queuing networks (QNS) operate; the processes are regenerative in\nmany cases. In the case when the regeneration period of the Markov process has\na finite average value, this process is ergodic.

But while vaccines offer a measure of protection\nagainst this specific outbreak, a new era of pandemics has been predicted. In\naddition to this, COVID-19 has drawn attention to post-viral syndromes and the\nhealthcare burden they entail. It seems integral that knowledge of viral\nmechanisms is increased through as wide a research field as possible. To this\nend we propose that quantum biology might offer essential new insights into the\nproblem, especially with regards to the important first step of virus-host\ninvasion. Research in quantum biology often centres around energy or charge\ntransfer. While this is predominantly in the context of photosynthesis there\nhas also been some suggestion that cellular receptors such as olfactory or\nneural receptors might employ vibration assisted electron tunnelling to augment\nthe lock-and-key mechanism. Quantum tunnelling has also been observed in enzyme\nfunction. Enzymes are implicated in the invasion of host cells by the\nSARS-CoV-2 virus. Receptors such as olfactory receptors also appear to be\ndisrupted by COVID-19. Building on these observations we investigate the\nevidence that quantum tunnelling might be important in the context of infection\nwith SARS-CoV-2. We illustrate this with a simple model relating the vibronic\nmode of, for example, a viral spike protein to the likelihood of charge\ntransfer in an idealised receptor. Our results show a distinct parameter regime\nin which the vibronic mode of the spike protein enhances electron transfer.\nWith this in mind, novel therapeutics to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission could\npotentially be identified by their vibrational spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 12:39:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

Currently, muon momentum is\nestimated by reconstructing the muon path using a strong magnetic field and\nmuon trackers. Alternatively, time-of-flight or multiple Coulomb scattering\ntechniques are less frequently applied, especially when there is a need to\navoid using a magnetic field. However, the measurement resolution is much lower\nthan that of magnetic spectrometers, approximately 20% in the muon momentum\nrange of 0.5 to 4.5 GeV/c whereas it is nearly 10% or less when using magnets\nand trackers.

By\nrestricting attention to spherical bodies and Lagrangian functions with a\nquadratic kinetic energy and potential energies that solely depend on positions\nand attitudes, we show that the discrete Lagrangian map exhibits the same\nmathematical structure, up to terms of second order, of explicit Newmark or\nvelocity Verlet algorithms, both known to be variational time integrators.\nThese preserving properties, together with linear convergence of trajectories\nand quadratic convergence of total energy, are born out by two examples, namely\nthe dynamics on $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ of a three-dimensional pendulum, and the\nnonlinear dynamics on $\\mathrm{SE}(3)^n$ that results from the impact of a\nparticle-binder torus against a rigid wall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 22:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}
