Among these policies,\nthe inter-regional collaborative pandemic control is a prominent example, which\nhas become much more important for an increasingly inter-connected world facing\na global pandemic like COVID-19. Different patterns of collaborative strategies\nhave been observed among different systems of regions, yet it lacks an\nanalytical process to reason for the legitimacy of those strategies. In this\npaper, we use the inter-regional collaboration for pandemic control as an\nexample to demonstrate the necessity of MARL in reasoning, and thereby\nlegitimizing policies enforcing such inter-regional collaboration. Experimental\nresults in an exemplary environment show that our MARL approach is able to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of restrictions on individual\nliberty for collaborative supply of public goods. Different optimal policies\nare learned by our MARL agents under different collaboration levels, which\nchange in an interpretable pattern of collaboration that helps to balance the\nlosses suffered by regions of different types, and consequently promotes the\noverall welfare.

The former group\nof algorithms often produces blurry and oversmoothed outputs particularly in\nthe presence of higher levels of degradation, whereas the latter generates\nfaces which sometimes by no means resemble the individuals in the input images.\nIn this paper, a novel face super-resolution approach will be introduced, in\nwhich the hallucinated face is forced to lie in a subspace spanned by the\navailable training faces. Therefore, in contrast to the majority of existing\nface hallucination techniques and thanks to this face subspace prior, the\nreconstruction is performed in favor of recovering person-specific facial\nfeatures, rather than merely increasing image quantitative scores. Furthermore,\ninspired by recent advances in the area of 3D face reconstruction, an efficient\n3D dictionary alignment scheme is also presented, through which the algorithm\nbecomes capable of dealing with low-resolution faces taken in uncontrolled\nconditions.

This results in a poor performance of the\nconventional monolithic solvers like the Newton-Raphson method. In order to\ncircumvent this issue, researchers opt for the alternate minimization\n(staggered) solvers. Staggered solvers are robust for the phase-field based\nfracture simulations as the displacement and the phase-field sub-problems are\nconvex in nature. Nevertheless, the staggered solver requires very large number\nof iterations (of the order of thousands) to converge. In this work, a robust\nmonolithic solver is presented for the phase-field fracture problem. The solver\nadopts a fracture energy-based arc-length method and an adaptive\nunder-relaxation scheme. The arc-length method enables the simulation to\novercome critical points (snap-back, snap-through instabilities) during the\nloading of a specimen. The use of an under-relaxation scheme stabilizes the\nsolver by preventing the divergence due to an ill-behaving stiffness matrix.\nThe efficiency of the proposed solver is further amplified with an adaptive\nmesh refinement scheme based on PHT-splines within the framework of\nisogeometric analysis.

The most variable and hard-to-predict part is the third\ncomplementarity-determining region of the antibody heavy chain (CDR H3).\nLately, deep learning has been employed to solve the task of CDR H3 prediction.\nHowever, current state-of-the-art methods are not end-to-end, but rather they\noutput inter-residue distances and orientations to the RosettaAntibody package\nthat uses this additional information alongside statistical and physics-based\nmethods to predict the 3D structure. This does not allow a fast screening\nprocess and, therefore, inhibits the development of targeted synthetic\nantibodies. In this work, we present an end-to-end model to predict CDR H3 loop\nstructure, that performs on par with state-of-the-art methods in terms of\naccuracy but an order of magnitude faster.

The fundamental reason for such degeneration is that most GNNs are\ndeveloped based on the I.I.D hypothesis. In such a setting, GNNs tend to\nexploit subtle statistical correlations existing in the training set for\npredictions, even though it is a spurious correlation. However, such spurious\ncorrelations may change in testing environments, leading to the failure of\nGNNs. Therefore, eliminating the impact of spurious correlations is crucial for\nstable GNNs. To this end, we propose a general causal representation framework,\ncalled StableGNN. The main idea is to extract high-level representations from\ngraph data first and resort to the distinguishing ability of causal inference\nto help the model get rid of spurious correlations. Particularly, we exploit a\ngraph pooling layer to extract subgraph-based representations as high-level\nrepresentations. Furthermore, we propose a causal variable distinguishing\nregularizer to correct the biased training distribution. Hence, GNNs would\nconcentrate more on the stable correlations. Extensive experiments on both\nsynthetic and real-world OOD graph datasets well verify the effectiveness,\nflexibility and interpretability of the proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Nov 2021 18:57:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 02:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

Unlike CNNs, ViT represents an input image\nas a sequence of image patches. The patch-based input image representation\nmakes the following question interesting: How does ViT perform when individual\ninput image patches are perturbed with natural corruptions or adversarial\nperturbations, compared to CNNs? In this work, we study the robustness of ViT\nto patch-wise perturbations. Surprisingly, we find that ViTs are more robust to\nnaturally corrupted patches than CNNs, whereas they are more vulnerable to\nadversarial patches. Furthermore, we discover that the attention mechanism\ngreatly affects the robustness of vision transformers. Specifically, the\nattention module can help improve the robustness of ViT by effectively ignoring\nnatural corrupted patches. However, when ViTs are attacked by an adversary, the\nattention mechanism can be easily fooled to focus more on the adversarially\nperturbed patches and cause a mistake. Based on our analysis, we propose a\nsimple temperature-scaling based method to improve the robustness of ViT\nagainst adversarial patches.

In order to explore possible equilibrium\nconfigurations of the magnetic field inside these stars, we have performed\n3D-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of initially random\nmagnetic fields in stably stratified and barotropic stars with an ideal-gas\nequation of state using the {\\sc Pencil Code}, a high-order finite-difference\ncode for compressible hydrodynamic flows in the presence of magnetic fields. In\nbarotropic (isentropic) stars, we confirm previous results in the sense that\nall initial magnetic fields we tried decay away, unable to reach a stable\nequilibrium. In the case of stably stratified stars (with radially increasing\nspecific entropy), initially random magnetic fields appear to always evolve to\na stable equilibrium. However, the nature of this equilibrium depends on the\ndissipation mechanisms considered. If magnetic diffusivity (or\nhyperdiffusivity) is included, the final state is more axially symmetric and\ndominated by large wavelengths than the initial state, whereas this is not the\ncase if only viscosity (or hyperviscosity) is present. In real stars, the main\nmechanism allowing them to relax to an equilibrium is likely to be phase\nmixing, which we argue is more closely mimicked by viscosity. Therefore, we\nconclude that, depending on its formation mechanism, the equilibrium magnetic\nfield in these stars could in principle be very asymmetric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Nov 2021 20:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

In this work, we attempt to incorporate these findings into the theory\nof mechanism design. We consider players that have a preference for\ntruth-telling and will only lie if their benefit from lying is sufficiently\nlarger than the loss of the others. To accommodate such players, we introduce\n$\\alpha$-moral mechanisms, in which the gain of a player from misreporting his\ntrue value, comparing to truth-telling, is at most $\\alpha$ times the loss that\nthe others incur due to misreporting.\n  We develop a theory of moral mechanisms in the canonical setting of\nsingle-item auctions. We identify similarities and disparities to the standard\ntheory of truthful mechanisms. In particular, we show that the allocation\nfunction does not uniquely determine the payments and is unlikely to admit a\nsimple characterization. In contrast, recall that monotonicity characterizes\nthe allocation function of truthful mechanisms.\n  Our main technical effort is invested in determining whether the auctioneer\ncan exploit the preference for truth-telling of the players to extract more\nrevenue comparing to truthful mechanisms. We show that the auctioneer can\nextract more revenue when the values of the players are correlated, even when\nthere are only two players. However, we show that truthful mechanisms are\nrevenue-maximizing even among moral ones when the values of the players are\nindependently drawn from certain identical distributions. As a by product we\nget an alternative proof to Myerson's characterization in the settings that we\nconsider. We flesh out this approach by providing an alternative proof to\nMyerson's characterization that does not involve moral mechanisms whenever the\nvalues are independently drawn from regular distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Nov 2021 20:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

To mitigate these\nconstraints, we exploit the multiband and carrier frequency switching\ncapabilities of wireless transceivers and propose to acquire channel state\ninformation (CSI) in multiple bands spread over a large frequency aperture.

NGC 1851 is one of several globular clusters for which multiple\nstellar populations of the subgiant branch have been clearly identified and a\ndifference in metallicity detected. A crucial piece of information on the\nformation history of this cluster can be provided by the sum of A(C+N+O)\nabundances. However, these values have lacked a general consensus thus far. The\nseparation of the subgiant branch can be based on age and/or A(C+N+O) abundance\ndifferences. Aims. Our main aim was to determine carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen\nabundances for evolved giants in the globular cluster NGC1851 in order to check\nwhether or not the double populations of stars are coeval. Methods.\nHigh-resolution spectra, observed with the FLAMES-UVES spectrograph on the ESO\nVLT telescope, were analysed using a differential model atmosphere method.\nResults. We provide abundances of up to 29 chemical elements for a sample of 45\ngiants in NGC 1851. The investigated stars can be separated into two\npopulations with a difference of 0.07 dex in the mean metallicity, 0.3 dex in\nthe mean C/N, and 0.35 dex in the mean s-process dominated element-to-iron\nabundance ratios [s/Fe].

As the averaged A(C+N+O)\nvalues between the two populations do not differ, additional evidence is given\nthat NGC 1851 is composed of two clusters, the metal-rich cluster being by\nabout 0.6 Gyr older than the metal-poor one.

This means that if P1 and P2 are two\nof these principles, then, under all the other usually adopted postulates for\nthe set of natural numbers (e.g., Peano axioms other than the induction axiom),\nP1 implies P2 and vice-versa. In this paper, we shows that, for a reasonable\nformalization, based on Peano arithmetic, some of the alleged implications\nbetween these principles hold only if an additional, independent condition is\nassumed, namely: every nonzero natural number is a successor.

Neither appears to cause significant dissipation in the\ncontemporary solar system. But these discussions have overlooked heating\nderived from the spatial variation of the primary's field across the interior\nof the secondary. This leads to Lorentz force-driven currents around paths\nentirely internal to the secondary, with resulting ohmic heating. We examine\nthree ways to drive such currents, by the cross product of: (1) the secondary's\nazimuthal orbital velocity with the non-axially symmetric field of the primary;\n(2) the radial velocity (due to non-zero eccentricity) of the secondary with\nthe primary's field; or (3) the out-of-plane velocity (due to non-zero\ninclination) with the primary's field. The first of these operates even for a\nspin-locked secondary whose orbit has zero eccentricity, in strong contrast to\ntidal dissipation. We show that Jupiter's moon Io today could dissipate about\n600 GW (more than likely current radiogenic heating) in the outer hundred\nmeters of its metallic core by this mechanism. Had Io ever been at 3 jovian\nradii instead of its current 5.9, it could have been dissipating 15,000 GW.\nOhmic dissipation provides a mechanism that could operate in any solar system\nto drive inward migration of secondaries that then necessarily comes to a halt\nupon reaching a sufficiently close distance to the primary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 04:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

However, this pipeline is\nsub-optimal for the target task for two reasons. First, they only fuse\nhigh-level features produced by uni-modal encoders separately, which hinders\nsufficient cross-modal learning. Second, the uni-modal encoders are pre-trained\nindependently, which brings inconsistency between pre-trained uni-modal tasks\nand the target multi-modal task. Besides, this pipeline often ignores or makes\nlittle use of intuitively beneficial instance-level features. To relieve these\nproblems, we propose MaIL, which is a more concise encoder-decoder pipeline\nwith a Mask-Image-Language trimodal encoder. Specifically, MaIL unifies\nuni-modal feature extractors and their fusion model into a deep modality\ninteraction encoder, facilitating sufficient feature interaction across\ndifferent modalities. Meanwhile, MaIL directly avoids the second limitation\nsince no uni-modal encoders are needed anymore.

First for general sets, and then a refinement\nfor normed spaces. The PI for normed spaces yields the Moore-Penrose inverse\nwhen the operator is a matrix. We present conditions for existence and\nuniqueness of a PI and establish theoretical results investigating its\nproperties, such as continuity, its value for operator compositions and\nprojection operators, and others. Analytic expressions are given for the PI of\nsome well-known, non-invertible, nonlinear operators, such as hard- or\nsoft-thresholding and ReLU. Finally, we analyze a neural layer and discuss\nrelations to wavelet thresholding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 07:15:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 06:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

The lack of labels makes\ncollaborative learning impractical in many realistic settings. Self-supervised\nlearning can address this challenge by learning from unlabeled data.\nContrastive learning (CL), a self-supervised learning approach, can effectively\nlearn visual representations from unlabeled image data. However, the\ndistributed data collected on clients are usually not independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID) among clients, and each client may only have\nfew classes of data, which degrades the performance of CL and learned\nrepresentations. To tackle this problem, we propose a collaborative contrastive\nlearning framework consisting of two approaches: feature fusion and\nneighborhood matching, by which a unified feature space among clients is\nlearned for better data representations. Feature fusion provides remote\nfeatures as accurate contrastive information to each client for better local\nlearning. Neighborhood matching further aligns each client's local features to\nthe remote features such that well-clustered features among clients can be\nlearned.

Hence, we present an innovative framework\nfor 3D medical image segmentation with one-shot and weakly-supervised settings.\nFirstly a propagation-reconstruction network is proposed to project scribbles\nfrom annotated volume to unlabeled 3D images based on the assumption that\nanatomical patterns in different human bodies are similar. Then a dual-level\nfeature denoising module is designed to refine the scribbles based on\nanatomical- and pixel-level features. After expanding the scribbles to pseudo\nmasks, we could train a segmentation model for the new class with the noisy\nlabel training strategy. Experiments on one abdomen and one head-and-neck CT\ndataset show the proposed method obtains significant improvement over the\nstate-of-the-art methods and performs robustly even under severe class\nimbalance and low contrast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 09:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

Six emotions were categorized for this study, such as\n- happy, angry, neutral, sad, disgust, and fear.

We carefully selected language-independent prosodic\nfeatures, adopted a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, and conducted three\nexperiments to carry out our proposition.

We show\nthat the Tisserand relation partitions the inclination-semi-major axis\nparameter space of the three-body problem into distinct regions depending on\nthe asteroid's Tisserand parameter T or equivalently its orbital inclination\nI_infinity far from the planet. The Tisserand relation shows that asteroids\nwith I_infinity > 110 deg. (T < -1) cannot be injected inside the planet's\norbit. Injection onto retrograde orbits and high-inclination prograde orbits\noccurs inside the inclination corridor 45 deg. < I_infinity < 110 deg. (-1< T <\n2). Inclination dispersion across the inclination pathway for moderate and high\ninclinations is explained by the secular perturbations from the planet and is\nsmallest for polar orbits. When a planet-crossing asteroid temporarily leaves\nthe inclination pathway, its long term evolution still depends on its Tisserand\nparameter as evidenced by its eccentricity dispersion.

The\npotential benefits of RISs are currently being analyzed and various approaches\nare being proposed to address some challenges for their integration in wireless\nnetworks. Currently available studies to quantify the potential gains of\ndeploying RISs in wireless networks are limited to simple network topologies,\nwhile no system-level assessments have been reported to date. Network-level,\ne.g., on the scale of hundreds of square meters, simulations are, however, the\nfirst step to quantify the actual value of emerging technologies and the\nsteppingstone before considering large scale system-level experimental\nevaluations and network deployments. Towards this direction, this article\nreports the first system-level simulation results and analysis of an RIS\ndeployment in a typical urban city that is served by a fifth-generation\ncellular network. The obtained system-level simulation results unveil that the\nbenefits of RISs vary depending on the operating frequency and the size of the\nsurfaces. Specifically, we investigate the performance improvement that RISs\ncan provide, in terms of outdoor and indoor coverage and ergodic rate, when\ndeployed in mid (C-band) and high (millimeter-wave) frequency bands. For\nexample, the obtained results unveil that the deployment of RISs enhances the\ncoverage of cell-edge users from 77% to 95% in the C-band and from 46% to 95%\nin the millimeter-wave band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 10:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

In the present work, we investigate RTILs in which both the\nweakly coordinating cation and AHA bind CO2.

Quite unusually, the\nintramolecular electrostatic attraction plays an essential role in stabilizing\nthe zwitterionic products of the CO2 chemisorption. The difference of\nchemisorption performance between the families of RTILs is linked to sterical\nhindrances and nucleophilicities of the {\\alpha}- and \\b{eta}-carbon atoms of\nthe aprotic cations.

It has been an\nactive research topic that attracts extensive attention over the last two\ndecades. In recent years, machine learning (ML) based detectors, especially\ndeep learning-based ones, have demonstrated impressive capability on clone\ndetection. It seems that this longstanding problem has already been tamed owing\nto the advances in ML techniques. In this work, we would like to challenge the\nrobustness of the recent ML-based clone detectors through code\nsemantic-preserving transformations. We first utilize fifteen simple code\ntransformation operators combined with commonly-used heuristics (i.e., Random\nSearch, Genetic Algorithm, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo) to perform equivalent\nprogram transformation. Furthermore, we propose a deep reinforcement\nlearning-based sequence generation (DRLSG) strategy to effectively guide the\nsearch process of generating clones that could escape from the detection. We\nthen evaluate the ML-based detectors with the pairs of original and generated\nclones. We realize our method in a framework named CloneGen. CloneGen In\nevaluation, we challenge the two state-of-the-art ML-based detectors and four\ntraditional detectors with the code clones after semantic-preserving\ntransformations via the aid of CloneGen. Surprisingly, our experiments show\nthat, despite the notable successes achieved by existing clone detectors, the\nML models inside these detectors still cannot distinguish numerous clones\nproduced by the code transformations in CloneGen. In addition, adversarial\ntraining of ML-based clone detectors using clones generated by CloneGen can\nimprove their robustness and accuracy.

As pressure increases, the strengthened\nH$-$H covalent bonding not only induces a hardening of optical phonon modes but\nalso reduces the electron-phonon matrix elements related to the low-frequency\noptical modes, thereby leading to a lowering of the EPC constant. It is thus\ndemonstrated that H-derived low-frequency phonon modes play an important role\nin the pressure-induced variation of $T_c$ in CaH$_6$.

Many exact and approximate algorithms have been developed for STP,\nbut they suffer from high computational complexity and weak worst-case solution\nguarantees, respectively. Heuristic algorithms are also developed. However,\neach of them requires application domain knowledge to design and is only\nsuitable for specific scenarios. Motivated by the recently reported observation\nthat instances of the same NP-hard combinatorial problem may maintain the same\nor similar combinatorial structure but mainly differ in their data, we\ninvestigate the feasibility and benefits of applying machine learning\ntechniques to solving STP. To this end, we design a novel model Vulcan based on\nnovel graph neural networks and deep reinforcement learning. The core of Vulcan\nis a novel, compact graph embedding that transforms highdimensional graph\nstructure data (i.e., path-changed information) into a low-dimensional vector\nrepresentation. Given an STP instance, Vulcan uses this embedding to encode its\npathrelated information and sends the encoded graph to a deep reinforcement\nlearning component based on a double deep Q network (DDQN) to find solutions.\nIn addition to STP, Vulcan can also find solutions to a wide range of NP-hard\nproblems (e.g., SAT, MVC and X3C) by reducing them to STP.

Inspired by human brain memory mechanisms, modern\nmachine learning systems have been working to endow machine with lifelong\nlearning capability through better remembering while pushing the forgetting as\nthe antagonist to overcome. Nevertheless, this idea might only see the half\npicture. Up until very recently, increasing researchers argue that a brain is\nborn to forget, i.e., forgetting is a natural and active process for abstract,\nrich, and flexible representations. This paper presents a learning model by\nactive forgetting mechanism with artificial neural networks. The active\nforgetting mechanism (AFM) is introduced to a neural network via a\n\"plug-and-play\" forgetting layer (P\\&PF), consisting of groups of inhibitory\nneurons with Internal Regulation Strategy (IRS) to adjust the extinction rate\nof themselves via lateral inhibition mechanism and External Regulation Strategy\n(ERS) to adjust the extinction rate of excitatory neurons via inhibition\nmechanism. Experimental studies have shown that the P\\&PF offers surprising\nbenefits: self-adaptive structure, strong generalization, long-term learning\nand memory, and robustness to data and parameter perturbation. This work sheds\nlight on the importance of forgetting in the learning process and offers new\nperspectives to understand the underlying mechanisms of neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 14:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

This relationship\ncharacterizes the phenomenon that one text corpus would influence the topics to\nbe discussed in the other text corpus in the future.

Specifically, a transfer-enhanced dual-channel\nheterogeneous dependency attention network is devised in Isomer to model short\ntexts using heterogeneous dependency graphs. These heterogeneous dependency\ngraphs not only consider different types of information but also incorporate\nexternal knowledge. Experiments studies show that our model outperforms recent\nmodels on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the results suggest that our method\ncaptures the importance of various information features to focus on informative\ncontextual words.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 11:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

However, the recreation of test\nscenarios for evaluating safety applications is a very challenging task. This\nis mainly due to the randomness in communication, difficulty in recreating\nvehicle movements precisely, and safety concerns for certain scenarios. We\npropose to develop a standalone Remote Vehicle Emulator that can reproduce V2V\nmessages of remote vehicles from simulations or previous tests. This is\nexpected to accelerate the development cycle significantly. Remote Vehicle\nEmulator is a unique and easily configurable emulation cum simulation setup to\nallow Software in the Loop (SIL) testing of connected vehicle applications\nrealistically and safely. It will help in tailoring numerous test scenarios,\nexpediting algorithm development and validation, and increasing the probability\nof finding failure modes. This, in turn, will help improve the quality of\nsafety applications while saving testing time and reducing cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Nov 2021 19:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

In this paper, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN)-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for subject-independent drowsiness\nrecognition from single-channel EEG signals. Different from existing deep\nlearning models that are mostly treated as black-box classifiers, the proposed\nmodel can explain its decisions for each input sample by revealing which parts\nof the sample contain important features identified by the model for\nclassification. This is achieved by a visualization technique by taking\nadvantage of the hidden states output by the LSTM layer. Results show that the\nmodel achieves an average accuracy of 72.97% on 11 subjects for leave-one-out\nsubject-independent drowsiness recognition on a public dataset, which is higher\nthan the conventional baseline methods of 55.42%-69.27%, and state-of-the-art\ndeep learning methods. Visualization results show that the model has discovered\nmeaningful patterns of EEG signals related to different mental states across\ndifferent subjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 10:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

These are even used by government agencies to spread\nimportant information through their verified Facebook accounts and official\nTwitter handles, as they can reach a huge population within a limited time\nwindow. However, many deceptive activities like propaganda and rumor can\nmislead users on a daily basis. In these COVID times, fake news and rumors are\nvery prevalent and are shared in a huge number which has created chaos in this\ntough time. And hence, the need for Fake News Detection in the present scenario\nis inevitable. In this paper, we survey the recent literature about different\napproaches to detect fake news over the Internet. In particular, we firstly\ndiscuss fake news and the various terms related to it that have been considered\nin the literature. Secondly, we highlight the various publicly available\ndatasets and various online tools that are available and can debunk Fake News\nin real-time. Thirdly, we describe fake news detection methods based on two\nbroader areas i.e., its content and the social context. Finally, we provide a\ncomparison of various techniques that are used to debunk fake news.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 13:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}
