We numerically evaluate the scalar power spectra with\nthe effective scalar potential based on this theory. Furthermore, we evaluate\nthe fractional abundances of PBHs by comparing two methods the Press-Schechter\napproach and the peak theory, while focusing on explaining the dark matter in\nthe Universe. By using the resulting scalar power spectrum we evaluate the\namount of GWs.

Various approaches have been explored,\nbased on different shapes given to the cells. Interestingly, homotopy type\ntheory encompasses a definition of weak $\\omega$-groupoid in a globular\nsetting, since every type carries such a structure. Starting from this remark,\nBrunerie could extract this definition of globular weak\n$\\omega$\\nobreakdash-groupoids, formulated as a type theory. By refining its\nrules, Finster and Mimram have then defined a type theory called CaTT, whose\nmodels are weak $\\omega$-categories. Here, we generalize this approach to\nmonoidal weak $\\omega$-categories. Based on the principle that they should be\nequivalent to weak $\\omega$-categories with only one $0$-cell, we are able to\nderive a type theory MCaTT whose models are monoidal categories. This requires\nchanging the rules of the theory in order to encode the information carried by\nthe unique $0$-cell. The correctness of the resulting type theory is shown by\ndefining a pair of translations between our type theory MCaTT and the type\ntheory CaTT. Our main contribution is to show that these translations relate\nthe models of our type theory to the models of the type theory CaTT consisting\nof $\\omega$-categories with only one $0$-cell, by analyzing in details how the\nnotion of models interact with the structural rules of both type theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 18:37:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

However, CO2 ice band strengths are diminished in\nthe spectra collected over mid and high sub-observer latitudes. This\nsub-observer latitudinal trend may result from radiolytic production of CO2\nmolecules at high latitudes and subsequent migration of this constituent to low\nlatitude cold traps. We detected a subtle feature near 2.13 microns in two\nspectra collected over high sub-observer latitudes, which might result from a\n'forbidden' transition mode of CO2 ice that is substantially stronger in well\nmixed substrates composed of CO2 and H2O ice, consistent with regolith-mixed\nCO2 ice grains formed by radiolysis. Additionally, we detected a 2.35-micron\nfeature in some low sub-observer latitude spectra, which might result from CO\nformed as part of a CO2 radiolytic production cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 19:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

First, we review the basic concepts of magnons and quantum\nentanglement and discuss the generation and manipulation of quantum states of\nmagnons, such as single-magnon states, squeezed states and quantum many-body\nstates including Bose-Einstein condensation and the resulting spin\nsuperfluidity. We discuss how magnonic systems can be integrated and entangled\nwith quantum platforms including cavity photons, superconducting qubits,\nnitrogen-vacancy centers, and phonons for coherent information transfer and\ncollaborative information processing. The implications of these hybrid quantum\nsystems for non-Hermitian physics and parity-time symmetry are highlighted,\ntogether with applications in quantum memories and high-precision measurements.\nFinally, we present an outlook on the opportunities in quantum magnonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 21:32:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 09:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

A powerful class of such \"payoff control\"\nstrategies was discovered by Press and Dyson (2012). Their so-called\n\"zero-determinant\" (ZD) strategies allow a player to unilaterally enforce a\nlinear relationship between both players' payoffs. It was subsequently shown by\nChen and Zinger (2014) that when the slope of this linear relationship is\npositive, ZD strategies are robustly effective against a selfishly optimizing\nco-player, in that all adapting paths of the selfish player lead to the maximal\npayoffs for both players (at least when there are certain restrictions on the\ngame parameters). In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of selfish\nlearning against a fixed player in more general settings, for both ZD and\nnon-ZD strategies. We first prove that in any symmetric $2\\times 2$ game, the\nselfish player's final strategy must be of a certain form and cannot be fully\nstochastic. We then show that there are prisoner's dilemma interactions for\nwhich selfish optimization does not always lead to maximal payoffs against\nfixed ZD strategies with positive slope. We give examples of selfish adapting\npaths that lead to locally but not globally optimal payoffs, undermining the\nrobustness of payoff control strategies. For non-ZD strategies, these\npathologies arise regardless of the original restrictions on the game\nparameters. Our results illuminate the difficulty of implementing robust payoff\ncontrol and selfish optimization, even in the simplest context of playing\nagainst a fixed strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 22:06:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 14:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

As a promising solution,\ndeep learning-based high-quality MR image restoration has been investigated to\ngenerate highly-resolved and motion artifact-free MR images from lower\nresolution images acquired with shortened acquisition time or motion\nartifact-corrupted images. However, numerous problems still exist to prevent\ndeep learning approaches from becoming practical in the clinic environment.\nSpecifically, most of the prior works focus solely on the network but ignore\nthe impact of various down-sampling strategies on the acquisition time.\nBesides, the long inference time and high GPU consumption are also the\nbottlenecks to deploy most of the prior works in clinics. Furthermore, prior\nstudies employ random movement in retrospective motion artifact generation,\nresulting in uncontrollable severity of motion artifact.

To overcome all these problems, we adopted a unified\nframework of 2D deep learning neural network for both 3D MRI super-resolution\nand motion artifact reduction, demonstrating such a framework can achieve\nbetter performance in 3D MRI restoration tasks compared to other\nstate-of-the-art methods and remain the GPU consumption and inference time\nsignificantly low, thus easier to deploy.

In\nthe layers in which the Fe-peak elements dominate the mean opacity (the\nso-called Z-bump), Ni is the second contributor to the Rosseland opacity after\niron, according to the Opacity Project data. Reliable nickel cross sections are\ntherefore mandatory for building realistic stellar models, especially for\nmain-sequence pulsators such as $\\beta$ Cep and slowly pulsating B stars, whose\noscillations are triggered by the $\\kappa$-mechanism of the Fe-peak elements.\nUnfortunately, the Opacity Project data for Ni were extrapolated from those of\nFe, and previous studies have shown that they were underestimated in comparison\nto detailed calculations. We investigate the impact of newly computed\nmonochromatic cross sections on the Rosseland mean opacity of Ni and on the\nstructure of main-sequence massive pulsators. We compare our results with the\nwidely used Opacity Project and OPAL data. Monochromatic cross sections for Ni\nwere obtained with the SCO-RCG code. The Toulouse-Geneva evolution code was\nused to build the stellar models. With the new data, the Rosseland opacities of\nNi are roughly the same as those of the Opacity Project or OPAL at high\ntemperatures ($\\log\\ T>6$). At lower temperatures, significant departures are\nobserved; the ratios are up to six times higher with SCO-RCG. These\ndiscrepancies span a wider temperature range in the comparison with OPAL than\nin comparison with the Opacity Project. For massive star models, the results of\nthe comparison with a structure computed with Opacity Project data show that\nthe Rosseland mean of the global stellar mixture is only marginally altered in\nthe Z-bump.

However, image blurriness caused by defocus or motion, which\noften occurs when capturing scenes in the wild, significantly degrades its\nreconstruction quality. To address this problem, We propose Deblur-NeRF, the\nfirst method that can recover a sharp NeRF from blurry input. We adopt an\nanalysis-by-synthesis approach that reconstructs blurry views by simulating the\nblurring process, thus making NeRF robust to blurry inputs. The core of this\nsimulation is a novel Deformable Sparse Kernel (DSK) module that models\nspatially-varying blur kernels by deforming a canonical sparse kernel at each\nspatial location. The ray origin of each kernel point is jointly optimized,\ninspired by the physical blurring process. This module is parameterized as an\nMLP that has the ability to be generalized to various blur types. Jointly\noptimizing the NeRF and the DSK module allows us to restore a sharp NeRF. We\ndemonstrate that our method can be used on both camera motion blur and defocus\nblur: the two most common types of blur in real scenes.

The real-time simulation of open quantum systems was advanced\nsignificantly by the recent development of chain mapping techniques and the use\nof matrix product states that exploit the intrinsic entanglement structure in\nopen quantum systems. The computational cost of simulating open quantum\nsystems, however, remains high when the bath is excited to high-lying quantum\nstates. We develop an approach to reduce the computational costs in such cases.\nThe interaction representation for the open quantum system is used to\ndistribute excitations among the bath degrees of freedom so that the occupation\nof each bath oscillator is ensured to be low. The interaction picture also\ncauses the matrix dimensions to be much smaller in a matrix product state of a\nchain-mapped open quantum system than in the Schr\\\"odinger picture.

TinyDefectNet comprises of just ~427K\nparameters and has a computational complexity of ~97M FLOPs, yet achieving a\ndetection accuracy of a state-of-the-art architecture for the task of surface\ndefect detection on the NEU defect benchmark dataset. As such, TinyDefectNet\ncan achieve the same level of detection performance at 52$\\times$ lower\narchitectural complexity and 11x lower computational complexity. Furthermore,\nTinyDefectNet was deployed on an AMD EPYC 7R32, and achieved 7.6x faster\nthroughput using the native Tensorflow environment and 9x faster throughput\nusing AMD ZenDNN accelerator library. Finally, explainability-driven\nperformance validation strategy was conducted to ensure correct decision-making\nbehaviour was exhibited by TinyDefectNet to improve trust in its usage by\noperators and inspectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 04:19:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

However, the traditional FL suffers from model\ninaccuracy since it trains local models using hard labels of data and ignores\nuseful information of incorrect predictions with small probabilities. Although\nvarious solutions try to tackle the bottleneck of the traditional FL, most of\nthem introduce significant communication and memory overhead, making the\ndeployment of large-scale AIoT devices a great challenge. To address the above\nproblem, this paper presents a novel Distillation-based Federated Learning\n(DFL) architecture that enables efficient and accurate FL for AIoT\napplications. Inspired by Knowledge Distillation (KD) that can increase the\nmodel accuracy, our approach adds the soft targets used by KD to the FL model\ntraining, which occupies negligible network resources. The soft targets are\ngenerated by local sample predictions of each AIoT device after each round of\nlocal training and used for the next round of model training. During the local\ntraining of DFL, both soft targets and hard labels are used as approximation\nobjectives of model predictions to improve model accuracy by supplementing the\nknowledge of soft targets. To further improve the performance of our DFL model,\nwe design a dynamic adjustment strategy for tuning the ratio of two loss\nfunctions used in KD, which can maximize the use of both soft targets and hard\nlabels.

We assume that a non-parametric Markovian causal model\nrepresentative of the data generation procedure is given. The edges emanating\nfrom the sensitive nodes in the causal graph, such as race, are assumed to be\nthe sources of unfairness. We first quantify Edge Flow in any edge X -> Y,\nwhich is the belief of observing a specific value of Y due to the influence of\na specific value of X along X -> Y. We then quantify Edge Unfairness by\nformulating a non-parametric model in terms of edge flows.

To\nachieve sensor fusion, complementary filters are used in current\ngravitational-wave detectors to combine relative displacement sensors and\ninertial sensors for active seismic isolation. Complementary filters are a set\nof digital filters, which have transfer functions that are summed to unity.\nCurrently, complementary filters are shaped and tuned manually rather than\noptimized, which can be suboptimal and hard to reproduce for future detectors.\nIn this paper, an optimization-based method called $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$\nsynthesis is proposed for synthesizing optimal complementary filters according\nto the sensor noises themselves. The complementary filter design problem is\nconverted into an optimization problem that seeks minimization of an objective\nfunction equivalent to the maximum difference between the super sensor noise\nand the lower bound in logarithmic scale. The method is exemplified by\nsynthesizing complementary filters for sensor fusion of 1) a relative\ndisplacement sensor and an inertial sensor, 2) a relative displacement sensor\ncoupled with seismic noise and an inertial sensor, and 3) hypothetical\ndisplacement sensor and inertial sensor, which have slightly different noise\ncharacteristics compared to the typical ones. In all cases, the method produces\ncomplementary filters that suppress the super sensor noise equally close to the\nlower bound at all frequencies in logarithmic scale. The synthesized filters\ncontain features that better suppress the sensor noises compared to the\npre-designed complementary filters. Overall, the proposed method allows the\nsynthesis of optimal complementary filters according to the sensor noises\nthemselves and is a better and versatile method for solving sensor fusion\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 07:19:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 11:09:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 02:10:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 21:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

To achieve this goal, a small student model is trained to\nexploit the knowledge of a large well-trained teacher model. However, due to\nthe capacity gap between the teacher and the student, the student's performance\nis hard to reach the level of the teacher. Regarding this issue, existing\nmethods propose to reduce the difficulty of the teacher's knowledge via a proxy\nway. We argue that these proxy-based methods overlook the knowledge loss of the\nteacher, which may cause the student to encounter capacity bottlenecks. In this\npaper, we alleviate the capacity gap problem from a new perspective with the\npurpose of averting knowledge loss. Instead of sacrificing part of the\nteacher's knowledge, we propose to build a more powerful student via\nadversarial collaborative learning. To this end, we further propose an\nAdversarial Collaborative Knowledge Distillation (ACKD) method that effectively\nimproves the performance of knowledge distillation. Specifically, we construct\nthe student model with multiple auxiliary learners. Meanwhile, we devise an\nadversarial collaborative module (ACM) that introduces attention mechanism and\nadversarial learning to enhance the capacity of the student. Extensive\nexperiments on four classification tasks show the superiority of the proposed\nACKD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 07:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

While existing\nunsupervised methods are able to learn image denoising without ground-truth\nclean images, they either show poor performance or work under impractical\nsettings (e.g., paired noisy images). In this paper, we present a practical\nunsupervised image denoising method to achieve state-of-the-art denoising\nperformance. Our method only requires single noisy images and a noise model,\nwhich is easily accessible in practical raw image denoising. It performs two\nsteps iteratively: (1) Constructing a noisier-noisy dataset with random noise\nfrom the noise model; (2) training a model on the noisier-noisy dataset and\nusing the trained model to refine noisy images to obtain the targets used in\nthe next round.

To evaluate raw image\ndenoising performance in real-world applications, we build a high-quality raw\nimage dataset SenseNoise-500 that contains 500 real-life scenes.

The inference of the latent deteriorating\nprocess is needed in advance for choosing an optimal maintenance policy to be\ncarried out.

State-of-the-art deep learning models are known to suffer from issues\nthat range from poor robustness, inability to adapt to novel task settings, to\nrequiring rigid and inflexible configuration assumptions. Collective behavior,\ncommonly observed in nature, tends to produce systems that are robust,\nadaptable, and have less rigid assumptions about the environment configuration.\nCollective intelligence, as a field, studies the group intelligence that\nemerges from the interactions of many individuals. Within this field, ideas\nsuch as self-organization, emergent behavior, swarm optimization, and cellular\nautomata were developed to model and explain complex systems. It is therefore\nnatural to see these ideas incorporated into newer deep learning methods.

Nevertheless, it is not trivial to explore the inherently\nunnatural interaction between sparse 3D points and dense 2D pixels. To ease\nthis difficulty, the recent proposals generally project the 3D points onto the\n2D image plane to sample the image data and then aggregate the data at the\npoints. However, this approach often suffers from the mismatch between the\nresolution of point clouds and RGB images, leading to sub-optimal performance.\nSpecifically, taking the sparse points as the multi-modal data aggregation\nlocations causes severe information loss for high-resolution images, which in\nturn undermines the effectiveness of multi-sensor fusion. In this paper, we\npresent VPFNet -- a new architecture that cleverly aligns and aggregates the\npoint cloud and image data at the `virtual' points. Particularly, with their\ndensity lying between that of the 3D points and 2D pixels, the virtual points\ncan nicely bridge the resolution gap between the two sensors, and thus preserve\nmore information for processing. Moreover, we also investigate the data\naugmentation techniques that can be applied to both point clouds and RGB\nimages, as the data augmentation has made non-negligible contribution towards\n3D object detectors to date.

The MWA began observing these events within 30 to 60s of their\nhigh-energy detection, enabling us to capture any dispersion delayed signals\nemitted by short GRBs for a typical range of redshifts. We conducted transient\nsearches at the GRB positions on timescales of 5s, 30s and 2min, resulting in\nthe most constraining flux density limits on any associated transient of 0.42,\n0.29, and 0.084Jy, respectively. We also searched for dispersed signals at a\ntemporal and spectral resolution of 0.5s and 1.28MHz but none were detected.\nHowever, the fluence limit of 80-100Jy ms derived for GRB 190627A is the most\nstringent to date for a short GRB. We compared the fluence and persistent\nemission limits to short GRB coherent emission models, placing constraints on\nkey parameters including the radio emission efficiency of the nearly merged\nneutron stars ($\\lesssim10^{-4}$), the fraction of magnetic energy in the GRB\njet ($\\lesssim2\\times10^{-4}$), and the radio emission efficiency of the\nmagnetar remnant ($\\lesssim10^{-3}$). Comparing the limits derived for our full\nGRB sample to the same emission models, we demonstrate that our 30-min flux\ndensity limits were sensitive enough to theoretically detect the persistent\nradio emission from magnetar remnants up to a redshift of $z\\sim0.6$. Our\nnon-detection of this emission could imply that some GRBs in the sample were\nnot genuinely short or did not result from a binary neutron star merger, the\nGRBs were at high redshifts, these mergers formed atypical magnetars, the\nradiation beams of the magnetar remnants were pointing away from Earth, or the\nmajority did not form magnetars but rather collapse directly into black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 09:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

One of these is the gravitationally confined detonation model. In this\ncase a weak deflagration burns to the surface, wraps around the bound core, and\ncollides at the antipode. A subsequent detonation is then initiated in the\ncollision area. Since the parameter space for this scenario, that is, varying\ncentral densities and ignition geometries, has not been studied in detail, we\nused pure deflagration models of a previous parameter study dedicated to Type\nIax supernovae as initial models to investigate the gravitationally confined\ndetonation scenario. We aim to judge whether this channel can account for one\nof the many subgroups of Type Ia supernovae, or even normal events. To this\nend, we employed a comprehensive pipeline for three-dimensional Type Ia\nsupernova modeling that consists of hydrodynamic explosion simulations, nuclear\nnetwork calculations, and radiative transfer. The observables extracted from\nthe radiative transfer are then compared to observed light curves and spectra.\nThe study produces a wide range in masses of synthesized 56 Ni ranging from\n0.257 to 1.057 $M_\\odot$ , and, thus, can potentially account for subluminous\nas well as overluminous Type Ia supernovae in terms of brightness. However, a\nrough agreement with observed light curves and spectra can only be found for\n91T-like objects. Although several discrepancies remain, we conclude that the\ngravitationally confined detonation model cannot be ruled out as a mechanism to\nproduce 91T-like objects.

The open-shell character of\nRu(acac)$_3$, which is not taken into account in our DFT approach, is expected\nto give rise to a wide multiplet structure, which is not resolved in our PES\nsignals but whose presence might be inferred from the additional striking\nfeatures observed in the PECD curves. Nevertheless, the DFT-based assignment of\nthe electronic bands leads to the characterisation of the ionized orbitals. In\nline with other recent works, the results confirm that PECD persists\nindependently on the localization and/or on the achiral or chiral nature of the\ninitial orbital, but is rather a probe of the molecular potential as a whole.\nOverall, the measured PECD signals on Ru(acac)$_3$, a system exhibiting D$_3$\npropeller-type chirality, are of similar magnitude compared to those on\nasymmetric-carbon-based chiral organic molecules which constitute the vast\nmajority of species investigated so far, thus suggesting that PECD is a\nuniversal mechanism, inherent to any type of chirality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 09:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

However, undesirable SS is\ngenerated during physiological process such as collective cell migration (CCM)\nand influences the biological processes such as morphogenesis, wound healing\nand cancer invasion. Despite extensive research devoted to study the stress\ngeneration caused by CCM, we still do not fully understand the main cause of SS\ngeneration. An attempt is made here to offer some answers to these questions by\nconsidering the rearrangement of cell monolayers. The SS generation represents\na consequence of natural and forced convection. While forced convection is\ndependent on cell speed, the natural convection is induced by the gradient of\ntissue surface tension. The phenomenon is known as the Marangoni effect. The\ngradient of tissue surface tension induces directed cell spreading from the\nregions of lower tissue surface tension to the regions of higher tissue surface\ntension. This directed cell migration is described by the Marangoni flux.

It is highly desirable to reasonably\nperceive the environment and accurately control the agent. In the navigation\ntask, we introduce an Agent-Centric Relation Graph (ACRG) for learning the\nvisual representation based on the relationships in the environment. ACRG is a\nhighly effective and reasonable structure that consists of two relationships,\ni.e., the relationship among objects and the relationship between the agent and\nthe target. On the one hand, we design the Object Horizontal Relationship Graph\n(OHRG) that stores the relative horizontal location among objects. Note that\nthe vertical relationship is not involved in OHRG, and we argue that OHRG is\nsuitable for the control strategy. On the other hand, we propose the\nAgent-Target Depth Relationship Graph (ATDRG) that enables the agent to\nperceive the distance to the target. To achieve ATDRG, we utilize image depth\nto represent the distance. Given the above relationships, the agent can\nperceive the environment and output navigation actions. Given the visual\nrepresentations constructed by ACRG and position-encoded global features, the\nagent can capture the target position to perform navigation actions.\nExperimental results in the artificial environment AI2-Thor demonstrate that\nACRG significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in unseen testing\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 10:06:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 08:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

To date, however, many capacity expansion models lean heavily\ntowards only minimising system cost and only studying a few cost projections.\nHere, we address both criticisms in unison. While taking account of technology\ncost uncertainties, we apply methods from multi-objective optimisation to\nexplore trade-offs in a fully renewable European electricity system between\nincreasing system cost and extremising the use of individual technologies for\ngenerating, storing and transmitting electricity to build robust insights about\nwhat actions are viable within given cost ranges. We identify boundary\nconditions that must be met for cost-efficiency regardless of how cost\ndevelopments will unfold; for instance, that some grid reinforcement and\nlong-term storage alongside a significant amount of wind capacity appear\nessential. But, foremost, we reveal that near the cost-optimum a broad spectrum\nof regionally and technologically diverse options exists in any case, which\nallows policymakers to navigate around public acceptance issues. The analysis\nrequires managing many computationally demanding scenario runs efficiently, for\nwhich we leverage multi-fidelity surrogate modelling techniques using sparse\npolynomial chaos expansions and low-discrepancy sampling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 10:48:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

Current low-light image enhancement models focus on\nthe improvement of low lightness only, or simply deal with all the degeneration\nfactors as a whole, therefore leading to a sub-optimal performance. In this\npaper, we propose to decouple the enhancement model into two sequential stages.\nThe first stage focuses on improving the scene visibility based on a pixel-wise\nnon-linear mapping. The second stage focuses on improving the appearance\nfidelity by suppressing the rest degeneration factors. The decoupled model\nfacilitates the enhancement in two aspects. On the one hand, the whole\nlow-light enhancement can be divided into two easier subtasks. The first one\nonly aims to enhance the visibility. It also helps to bridge the large\nintensity gap between the low-light and normal-light images. In this way, the\nsecond subtask can be shaped as the local appearance adjustment. On the other\nhand, since the parameter matrix learned from the first stage is aware of the\nlightness distribution and the scene structure, it can be incorporated into the\nsecond stage as the complementary information. In the experiments, our model\ndemonstrates the state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and\nquantitative comparisons, compared with other low-light image enhancement\nmodels. In addition, the ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of\nour model in multiple aspects, such as model structure and loss function.

However, current quantization methods are\nbased on uniform precision and fail to account for the varying performance\nsensitivity at different model components to quantization errors. In this\npaper, novel mixed precision DNN quantization methods are proposed by applying\nlocally variable bit-widths to individual TCN components of a TF masking based\nmulti-channel speech separation system.

Of the HI dwarf sample, 2% (3) are ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), 12%\nhave a transition-type morphology, 5% are tidal dwarf candidates, and 10%\nappear to be disrupted objects. In our optically selected sample, 9.5% of the\ndEs, 7% of the UDGs and 10% of the classical dwarfs are HI-bearing. The\nHI-bearing dwarfs have on average bluer colors than the dwarfs without detected\nHI. We find relations between the stellar and HI masses, gas fraction, color\nand absolute magnitude consistent with previous studies of dwarfs probing\nsimilar masses and environments. For 79% of the dwarfs identified as satellites\nof massive early-type galaxies, we find that the HI mass increases with the\nprojected distance to the host. Using the HI line width, we estimate dynamical\nmasses and find that 5% (7) of the dwarfs are dark matter deficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 12:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Among geometric primitives, superquadrics are well known for\ntheir ability to represent a wide range of shapes with few parameters. However,\nas the first and foremost step, recovering superquadrics accurately and\nrobustly from 3D data still remains challenging. The existing methods are\nsubject to local optima and sensitive to noise and outliers in real-world\nscenarios, resulting in frequent failure in capturing geometric shapes. In this\npaper, we propose the first probabilistic method to recover superquadrics from\npoint clouds. Our method builds a Gaussian-uniform mixture model (GUM) on the\nparametric surface of a superquadric, which explicitly models the generation of\noutliers and noise. The superquadric recovery is formulated as a Maximum\nLikelihood Estimation (MLE) problem. We propose an algorithm, Expectation,\nMaximization, and Switching (EMS), to solve this problem, where: (1) outliers\nare predicted from the posterior perspective; (2) the superquadric parameter is\noptimized by the trust-region reflective algorithm; and (3) local optima are\navoided by globally searching and switching among parameters encoding similar\nsuperquadrics. We show that our method can be extended to the\nmulti-superquadrics recovery for complex objects. The proposed method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and\nrobustness on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

The orbits of the two\nplanet are initially circular and coplanar to each other, but misaligned with\nrespect to the binary orbital plane. The binary-planet and planet-planet\ninteractions result in complex planet tilt oscillations. We use analytic models\nand numerical simulations to explore the effects of various values of the\nplanet semi-major axes, binary eccentricity, and initial inclination. Around a\ncircular orbit binary, secular tilt oscillations are driven by planet-planet\ninteractions and are periodic. In that case, planets undergo mutual libration\nif close together and circulation if far apart with an abrupt transition at a\ncritical separation. Around an eccentric orbit binary, secular tilt\noscillations are driven by both planet-planet interactions and binary-planet\ninteractions. These oscillations generally display more than one frequency and\nare generally not periodic. The transition from mutual planet libration to\ncirculation is not sharp and there is a range of separations for which the\nplanets are on orbits that are sometimes mutually librating and sometimes\ncirculating. In addition, at certain separations, there are resonances for\nwhich tilt oscillations are complicated but periodic. For planets that are\nhighly misaligned with respect to an eccentric orbit binary, there are\nstationary (non-oscillating) tilt configurations that are generalisations of\npolar configurations for the single planet case. Tilt oscillations of highly\ninclined planets occur for initial tilts that depart from the stationary\nconfiguration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 13:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Specifically, we\nfirst show that a traditional convolution with kernel size k x k can be\ndecomposed into k^2 individual 1x1 convolutions, followed by shift and\nsummation operations. Then, we interpret the projections of queries, keys, and\nvalues in self-attention module as multiple 1x1 convolutions, followed by the\ncomputation of attention weights and aggregation of the values. Therefore, the\nfirst stage of both two modules comprises the similar operation.

However, the defense\nmethods that have good effect in natural images may not be suitable for medical\ndiagnostic tasks. The preprocessing methods (e.g., random resizing,\ncompression) may lead to the loss of the small lesions feature in the medical\nimage. Retraining the network on the augmented data set is also not practical\nfor medical models that have already been deployed online. Accordingly, it is\nnecessary to design an easy-to-deploy and effective defense framework for\nmedical diagnostic tasks. In this paper, we propose a Robust and Retrain-Less\nDiagnostic Framework for Medical pretrained models against adversarial attack\n(i.e., MedRDF). It acts on the inference time of the pertained medical model.\nSpecifically, for each test image, MedRDF firstly creates a large number of\nnoisy copies of it, and obtains the output labels of these copies from the\npretrained medical diagnostic model. Then, based on the labels of these copies,\nMedRDF outputs the final robust diagnostic result by majority voting. In\naddition to the diagnostic result, MedRDF produces the Robust Metric (RM) as\nthe confidence of the result. Therefore, it is convenient and reliable to\nutilize MedRDF to convert pre-trained non-robust diagnostic models into robust\nones. The experimental results on COVID-19 and DermaMNIST datasets verify the\neffectiveness of our MedRDF in improving the robustness of medical diagnostic\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 14:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

We emphasize that such assumption is unrealistic for\nreal-world applications since group label annotations are expensive and can\nconflict with privacy issues. In this paper, we consider a more practical\nscenario, dubbed as Algorithmic Group Fairness with the Partially annotated\nGroup labels (Fair-PG). We observe that the existing methods to achieve group\nfairness perform even worse than the vanilla training, which simply uses full\ndata only with target labels, under Fair-PG. To address this problem, we\npropose a simple Confidence-based Group Label assignment (CGL) strategy that is\nreadily applicable to any fairness-aware learning method. CGL utilizes an\nauxiliary group classifier to assign pseudo group labels, where random labels\nare assigned to low confident samples. We first theoretically show that our\nmethod design is better than the vanilla pseudo-labeling strategy in terms of\nfairness criteria.

In this paper, we used a\nmixed-methods approach to investigate why this is happening and how developers\nmight change their practices. We base our analysis against 5 leading data\nprotection frameworks that set out requirements and recommendations for data\ncollection in children's apps. To understand developers' perspectives and\nconstraints, we conducted 134 surveys and 20 semi-structured interviews with\npopular Android children's app developers. Our analysis revealed that\ndevelopers largely respect children's best interests; however, they have to\nmake compromises due to limited monetisation options, perceived harmlessness of\ncertain third-party libraries, and lack of availability of design guidelines.\nWe identified concrete approaches and directions for future research to help\novercome these barriers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 15:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

Here we propose a measure, called\nfermionic nonlinearity, to quantify the classical simulatability of quantum\ncircuits designed for simulating fermionic Hamiltonians. Specifically, we\nconstruct a Monte Carlo type classical algorithm based on the classical\nsimulatability of fermionic linear optics, whose sampling overhead is\ncharacterized by the fermionic nonlinearity. As a demonstration of these\ntechniques, we calculate the upper bound of the fermionic nonlinearity of a\nrotation gate generated by four fermionic modes under the dephasing noise.\nMoreover, we estimate the sampling costs of the unitary coupled cluster singles\nand doubles quantum circuits for hydrogen chains subject to the dephasing\nnoise.

It is also known as the anisotropy of\nacoustic sensor imaging, that is, when autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs)\ncarry sonar to detect the same target from different angles, the intensity\nvariation between image pairs is sometimes very large, which makes the\ntraditional matching algorithm almost ineffective.

Currently, a variety of\nguidelines and a handful of niche tools exist to account for and tackle\nindividual challenges. However, it is also well established that many\norganizations face practical challenges in navigating these considerations from\na risk management perspective. Therefore, new methodologies are needed to\nprovide a well-vetted and real-world applicable structure and path through the\nchecks and balances needed for ethically assessing and guiding the development\nof AI. In this paper we show that a multidisciplinary research approach,\nspanning cross-sectional viewpoints, is the foundation of a pragmatic\ndefinition of ethical and societal risks faced by organizations using AI.\nEqually important is the findings of cross-structural governance for\nimplementing eAI successfully. Based on evidence acquired from our\nmultidisciplinary research investigation, we propose a novel data-driven risk\nassessment methodology, entitled DRESS-eAI. In addition, through the evaluation\nof our methodological implementation, we demonstrate its state-of-the-art\nrelevance as a tool for sustaining human values in the data-driven AI era.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 12:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

A case study is\npresented here independently examining a published meta-analysis of randomized\ntrials claiming that soy protein intake improves cardiovascular health.\nCounting and p-value plotting techniques (standard p-value plot, p-value\nexpectation plot, and volcano plot) are used. Counting (search space) analysis\nindicates that reported p-values from the meta-analysis could be biased low due\nto multiple testing and multiple modeling. Plotting techniques used to\nvisualize the behavior of the data set used for meta-analysis suggest that\nstatistics drawn from the base papers do not satisfy key assumptions of a\nrandom-effects meta-analysis. These assumptions include using unbiased\nstatistics all drawn from the same population. Also, publication bias is\nunaddressed in the meta-analysis.
