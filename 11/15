High temporal\nfidelity will allow for unprecedented investigations into the nature of\nvariable objects -- those objects that vary in brightness over time. A major\nbottleneck in data processing pipelines is constructing light curve solutions\nfor catalogs of variable objects, as it is well-known that period finding\nalgorithms are computationally expensive. Furthermore, there are many period\nfinding algorithms that are often suited for specific science cases. In this\npaper, we present the first GPU-accelerated Super Smoother algorithm. Super\nSmoother is general purpose and uses cross-validation to fit line segments to a\ntime series, and as such, is more computationally expensive than other\nalgorithms, such as Lomb-Scargle. Because the algorithm requires making several\nscans over the input time series for a tested frequency, we also propose a\nnovel generalized-validation variant of Super Smoother that only requires a\nsingle scan over the data. We compare the performance of our algorithms to\nanalogous parallel multi-core CPU implementations on three catalogs of data,\nand show that it is generally advantageous to use the GPU algorithm over the\nCPU counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our single-pass variant of\nSuper Smoother is roughly equally as accurate at finding correct period\nsolutions as the original algorithm. Our software supports several features,\nsuch as batching the computation to eliminate the possibility of exceeding\nglobal memory on the GPU, processing a single object or batches of objects, and\nwe allow for scaling the algorithm across multiple GPUs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 17:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

The role of direction-changing\ncollisions in shaping the neutrino flavor field in these environments is\nimportant and poorly understood; it has not been treated self-consistently.\nThere has been progress, via numerical integration, to include the effects of\ncollisions in the dynamics of the neutrino flavor field. While this has led to\nimportant insights, integration is limited by its requirement that full initial\nconditions must be assumed known. On the contrary, feedback from collisions to\nthe neutrino field is a boundary value problem. Numerical integration\ntechniques are poorly equipped to handle that formulation.

Constrained coding is used in\nFlash devices to increase reliability via mitigating inter-cell interference\nthat stems from charge propagation among cells. Recently, capacity-achieving\nconstrained codes were introduced to serve that purpose in modern Flash\ndevices, which have more than two levels per cell.

At\nthe core of this novel framework is an \"abstracted aerosol representation\" that\nallows a given chemical mechanism to be solved in atmospheric models with\ndifferent aerosol representations (e.g., sectional, modal, or\nparticle-resolved). This is accomplished by treating aerosols as a collection\nof condensed phases that are implemented according to the aerosol\nrepresentation of the host model. The framework also allows multiple chemical\nprocesses (e.g., gas- and aerosol-phase chemical reactions, emissions,\ndeposition, photolysis, and mass-transfer) to be solved simultaneously as a\nsingle system. The flexibility of the model is achieved by (1) using an\nobject-oriented design that facilitates extensibility to new types of chemical\nprocesses and to new ways of representing aerosol systems; (2) runtime model\nconfiguration using JSON input files that permits making changes to any part of\nthe chemical mechanism without recompiling the model; this widely used,\nhuman-readable format allows entire gas- and aerosol-phase chemical mechanisms\nto be described with as much complexity as necessary; and (3) automated\ncomprehensive testing that ensures stability of the code as new functionality\nis introduced.

Cloud formation, the expected outcome\nof thermal instability (TI), will be suppressed in a dynamic flow, however, due\nto the stretching of fluid elements that accompanies acceleration. It is\ntherefore unlikely that cloud formation occurs during the launching phase of a\nsupersonic outflow. In this paper, we show that the most favorable conditions\nfor dynamical TI in highly supersonic outflows are found at radii beyond the\nacceleration zone, where the growth rate of entropy modes is set by the linear\ntheory rate for a static plasma. This finding implies that even mildly\nrelativistic outflows can become clumpy, and we explicitly demonstrate this\nusing hydrodynamical simulations of ultrafast outflows. We describe how the\ncontinuity and heat equations can be used to appreciate another impediment\n(beside mode disruption due to the stretching) to making an outflow clumpy:\nbackground flow conditions may not allow the plasma to enter a TI zone in the\nfirst place. The continuity equation reveals that both impediments are in fact\ntightly coupled, yet one is easy to overcome. Namely, time variability in the\nradiation field is found to be a robust means of placing gas in a TI zone.

We evaluate with real-world\nexperiments on a set of everyday-like multi-stage tasks, which we show that our\nmethod can solve from a single demonstration.

This could help public health informatics studies produce\nmore timely results during crises, with a reduced risk of misleading results.\n  Methods: Emotion and sentiment classifiers were applied to COVID-19 data\nbefore and after debiasing the classifiers using unsupervised contrastive\nclustering. Contrastive clustering approximates the degree to which tokens\nexhibit a causal versus correlational relationship with emotion or sentiment,\nby contrasting the tokens' relative salience to topics versus emotions or\nsentiments.\n  Results: Contrastive clustering distinguishes correlation from causation for\ntokens with an F1 score of 0.753. Masking bias prone tokens from the classifier\ninput decreases the classifier's overall F1 score by 0.02 (anger) and 0.033\n(negative sentiment), but improves the F1 score for sentences annotated as bias\nprone by 0.155 (anger) and 0.103 (negative sentiment).

Better physics-based forecasts\nrequire improvements in the models themselves, which can be a substantial\nscientific challenge, as well as improvements in the underlying resolution,\nwhich can be computationally prohibitive. An emerging class of weather models\nbased on neural networks represents a paradigm shift in weather forecasting:\nthe models learn the required transformations from data instead of relying on\nhand-coded physics and are computationally efficient.

However, all known\npolynomial query algorithms are highly adaptive, requiring at least $N$ rounds\nof querying the oracle. A natural question is whether these can be efficiently\nsolved in a highly parallel manner, namely, with $\\mathrm{poly}(N)$ queries\nusing only poly-logarithmic rounds of adaptivity.\n  An important step towards understanding the adaptivity needed for efficient\nparallel SFM was taken recently in the work of Balkanski and Singer who showed\nthat any SFM algorithm making $\\mathrm{poly}(N)$ queries necessarily requires\n$\\Omega(\\log N/\\log \\log N)$ rounds.

In the terahertz frequency range, the\nelectrically pumped quantum cascade laser (QCL) is a suitable candidate for the\ndual-comb operation. However, free running terahertz QCL dual-comb sources\nnormally show limited optical bandwidths ($\\sim$100-200 GHz). Although the\nresonant microwave injection locking has been widely used to broaden the\nemission spectra of terahertz QCLs by modulating the laser drive current at the\ncavity round-trip frequency, it is hard to be employed to broaden the dual-comb\nbandwidths due to the large phase noise induced by the resonant injection and\nnon-ideal microwave circuits. Therefore, it is challenging to obtain broadband\nterahertz dual-comb sources that can fully exploits the laser gain bandwidth.\nHere, we employ an off-resonant microwave injection to significantly broaden\nthe dual-comb bandwidth of a terahertz QCL dual-comb source emitting around 4.2\nTHz. The measured optical dual-comb bandwidth is broadened from 147 GHz in free\nrunning to $>$450 GHz under the off-resonant injection. The broadened dual-comb\nbandwidth is experimentally proved by the transmission measurements of a filter\nand a GaAs etalon. By performing a simple numerical analysis based on a rate\nequation model, we explain that the broadband dual-comb operation under the\noff-resonant microwave injection could be resulted from a wider lasing\nbandwidth and a higher degree of phase matching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 01:29:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 08:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Due to the large number\nof voxels, rather than consider the voxel-to-voxel correlations between all\nvoxels, a small set of seed voxels are chosen. Consequently, the network\nidentification may depend on the selected seeds. As an alternative, we propose\nto fit first-order linear models with sparse priors on the coefficients to\nmodel activity across the entire set of cortical grey matter voxels as a linear\ncombination of a smaller subset of voxels.

Our \\textit{Recursive Self Enhancement Reinforcement\nLearning}(RSE-RL) model views the identification and correction of artifacts as\na recursive self-learning and self-improvement exercise and consists of two\nmajor sub-modules: (i) The latent feature sub-space clustering/grouping\nobtained through variational auto-encoders enabling rapid identification of the\ncorrespondence and discrepancy between noisy and clean image patches. (ii) The\nadaptive learned transformation is controlled by a soft actor-critic agent that\nprogressively filters and enhances the noisy patches using its closest feature\ndistance neighbors of clean patches. Artificial artifacts that may be\nintroduced in a patch-based ISP, are also removed through a reward-based\nde-blocking recovery and image enhancement. We demonstrate the self-improvement\nfeature of our model by recursively training and testing on images, wherein the\nenhanced images resulting from each epoch provide a natural data augmentation\nand robustness to the RSE-RL training-filtering pipeline. Our method shows\nadvantage for heterogeneous noise and artifact removal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 02:23:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2022 16:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Focusing on convergence and\nequilibria analysis, a number of new results are provided. First, we show that\nfor networks with generic system parameters, there exist a finite number of\nequilibria. Exploiting monotone systems theory, we further prove that for\nbivirus networks with generic system parameters, then convergence to an\nequilibrium occurs for all initial conditions, except possibly for a set of\nmeasure zero.

Testing\nan entire population, however, requires significant resources. Group testing\ncan enable large-scale screening, but dilution degrades its sensitivity,\nreducing its effectiveness as an infection control measure. Analysis of this\ntradeoff typically assumes pooled samples are independent. Building on recent\nempirical results in the literature, we argue that this assumption\nsignificantly underestimates group testing's true benefits. Indeed, placing\nsamples from a social group into the same pool correlates a pool's samples.\nHence, a positive pool likely contains multiple positive samples, increasing a\npooled test's sensitivity and also tending to reduce the number of pools\nrequiring follow-up testing. We prove that under a general correlation\nstructure, pooling correlated samples together (called correlated pooling)\nachieves higher sensitivity and requires fewer tests per positive identified\ncompared to independently pooling the samples (called naive pooling) using the\nsame pool size within the classic two-stage Dorfman procedure. To the best of\nour knowledge, our work is the first to theoretically characterize\ncorrelation's effect on sensitivity and test usage under models of general\ncorrelation structure and realistic test errors. Under a 1% starting\nprevalence, simulation results estimate that correlated pooling requires 12.9%\nfewer tests than naive pooling to achieve infection control. Thus, we argue\nthat correlation is an important consideration for policy-makers designing\ninfection control interventions: it makes screening more attractive for\ninfection control and it suggests that sample collection should maximize\ncorrelation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 03:36:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 23:00:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 20:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

Atomic diffusion is\nparticularly important in these envelopes, producing chemically peculiar\nobjects such as Am and HgMn stars. Aims: An exoplanet candidate around the B6\nstar HD 235349 was identified by TESS. Here we determine the nature of this\ntransiting object and identify possible chemical peculiarities in the star.\nMethods: HD 235349 was observed using the long-slit spectrograph at Tartu\nObservatory, as well as photometrically by the TESS mission. The spectra were\nmodeled to determine stellar parameters and chemical abundances. The\nphotometric light curve was then analyzed in the context of the stellar\nparameters to determine properties of the transiting object. Results: We find\nthe transiting object is a low-mass stellar companion, not a planet. However,\nthe primary of this eclipsing binary is a rare type of chemically peculiar\nstar. A strong overabundance of P is found with overabundances of Ne and Nd,\nand mild overabundances of Ti and Mn, while He is mildly underabundant.

To select informative regions under partial\nobservability, the model uses Bayesian Optimal Experiment Design. First, it\nsynthesizes the features of the unobserved regions based on the already\nobserved regions. Then, it uses the predicted features to estimate the expected\ninformation gain (EIG) attained, should various regions be attended. Finally,\nthe model attends to the actual content on the location where the EIG mentioned\nabove is maximum. The model uses a) a recurrent feature aggregator to maintain\na recurrent state, b) a linear classifier to predict the class label, c) a\nPartial variational autoencoder to predict the features of unobserved regions.\nWe use normalizing flows in Partial VAE to handle multi-modality in the\nfeature-synthesis problem. We train our model using a differentiable objective\nand test it on five datasets. Our model gains 2-10% higher accuracy than the\nbaseline models when both have seen only a couple of glimpses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 04:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

The numerical method is based on the second-order\nbackward differentiation formula in time, combined with an implicit treatment\nof the linear diffusion term and explicit extrapolation for the nonlinear\nterms. Afterward, a projection step is applied to normalize the numerical\nsolution at a point-wise level. This numerical scheme has shown extensive\nadvantages in the practical computations for the physical model with large\ndamping parameters, which comes from the fact that only a linear system with\nconstant coefficients (independent of both time and the updated magnetization)\nneeds to be solved at each time step, and has greatly improved the numerical\nefficiency.

Intuitively, we feel that akin to human\ndecisions, judgments of artificial agents should necessarily be grounded in\nsome moral principles. Yet a decision-maker (whether human or artificial) can\nonly make truly ethical (based on any ethical theory) and fair (according to\nany notion of fairness) decisions if full information on all the relevant\nfactors on which the decision is based are available at the time of\ndecision-making.

Stakeholders from different industries, international foundations,\ngovernmental organisations and standards institutions quickly improvised and\ncreated various codes of ethics attempting to regulate AI. A major concern is\nthe large homogeneity and presumed consensualism around these principles. While\nit is true that some ethical doctrines, such as the famous Kantian deontology,\naspire to universalism, they are however not universal in practice. In fact,\nethical pluralism is more about differences in which relevant questions to ask\nrather than different answers to a common question. When people abide by\ndifferent moral doctrines, they tend to disagree on the very approach to an\nissue. Even when people from different cultures happen to agree on a set of\ncommon principles, it does not necessarily mean that they share the same\nunderstanding of these concepts and what they entail. In order to better\nunderstand the philosophical roots and cultural context underlying ethical\nprinciples in AI, we propose to analyse and compare the ethical principles\nendorsed by the Chinese National New Generation Artificial Intelligence\nGovernance Professional Committee (CNNGAIGPC) and those elaborated by the\nEuropean High-level Expert Group on AI (HLEGAI).

Recent studies show gaps and rings in the dust\ndistribution of disks younger than 1 Myr, suggesting that planet formation may\nstart already at the Class I stage. To understand what chemistry planets will\ninherit, it is crucial to characterize the chemistry of Class I sources and to\ninvestigate how chemical complexity evolves from Class 0 protostars to\nprotoplanetary disks. The goal is twofold: to obtain a census of the molecular\ncomplexity in a sample of four Class I protostars, and to compare it with the\nchemical compositions of earlier and later phases of the Sun-like star\nformation process. We performed IRAM-30m observations towards Class I objects\n(L1489-IRS, B5-IRS1, L1455-IRS1, and L1551-IRS5). The column densities of the\ndetected species are derived assuming LTE or LVG.

Meanwhile, little\nattention has been paid to the security and privacy risks of generative models,\nsuch as generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this paper, we propose the\nfirst set of training dataset property inference attacks against GANs.\nConcretely, the adversary aims to infer the macro-level training dataset\nproperty, i.e., the proportion of samples used to train a target GAN with\nrespect to a certain attribute. A successful property inference attack can\nallow the adversary to gain extra knowledge of the target GAN's training\ndataset, thereby directly violating the intellectual property of the target\nmodel owner. Also, it can be used as a fairness auditor to check whether the\ntarget GAN is trained with a biased dataset. Besides, property inference can\nserve as a building block for other advanced attacks, such as membership\ninference. We propose a general attack pipeline that can be tailored to two\nattack scenarios, including the full black-box setting and partial black-box\nsetting. For the latter, we introduce a novel optimization framework to\nincrease the attack efficacy. Extensive experiments over four representative\nGAN models on five property inference tasks show that our attacks achieve\nstrong performance.

This paper thus proposes a\nnovel channel-wise feature denoising fingerprint PAD (CFD-PAD) method by\nhandling the redundant noise information ignored in previous studies. The\nproposed method learns important features of fingerprint images by weighing the\nimportance of each channel and identifying discriminative channels and \"noise\"\nchannels.

This\nlimitation can be overcome employing Pb of archaeological origin, where several\nhalf-lives of $^{210}$Pb have gone by.

We demonstrate that the reversible polymer assembly and phase\nbehavior can be controlled by the addition of (non-adsorbing) rigid colloidal\ndiscs which act as an entropic reorienting ``template\" onto the supramolecular\npolymers. Using a particle-based second-virial theory that correlates the\nvarious entropies associated with the polymers and discs, we demonstrate that\nsmall fractions of discotic additives promote the formation of a polymer\nnematic phase. At larger disc concentrations, however, the phase is disrupted\nby collective disc alignment in favor of a discotic nematic fluid in which the\npolymers are dispersed anti-nematically. We show that the anti-nematic\narrangement of the polymers generates a non-exponential molecular-weight\ndistribution and stimulates the formation of oligomeric species. At sufficient\nconcentrations the discs facilitate a liquid-liquid phase separation which can\nbe brought into simultaneously coexistence with the two fractionated nematic\nphases, providing evidence for a four-fluid coexistence in reversible\nshape-dissimilar hard-core mixtures without cohesive interparticle forces. We\nstipulate the conditions under which such a phenomenon could be found in\nexperiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 09:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

The\nvariables in the evolution equations are mean counts of subgraph states and are\nreferred to as moments. Due to interaction between neighbours, each moment\nequation is a function of higher-order moments, such that an infinite hierarchy\nof equations arises. Hence, the derivation requires truncation at a given\norder, and, an approximation of the highest-order moments in terms of\nlower-order ones,known as a closure formula. Recent systematic approximations\nhave either restricted focus to closed moment equations for SIR epidemic\nspreading or to unclosed moment equations for arbitrary dynamics. In this\npaper, we develop a general procedure that automates both derivation and\nclosure of arbitrary order moment equations for dynamics with nearest-neighbour\ninteractions on undirected networks. Automation of the closure step was made\npossible by our generalised closure scheme,which systematically decomposes the\nlargest subgraphs into their smaller components.We show that this decomposition\nis exact if these components form a tree, there is independence at distances\nbeyond their graph diameter, and there is spatial homogeneity.

In particular, within porous materials,\nthe presence of boundaries with complex shapes entangles the longitudinal and\ntransverse degrees of freedom inducing a coupling between the transport of the\nsuspension and the density inhomogeneities induced by the walls.\n  Colloidal suspension confined within model porous media are characterized by\nmeans of active microrheology where a net force is applied on a single colloid\n(tracer particle) whose transport properties are then studied. The trajectories\nprovided by active microrheology are exploited to determine the local transport\ncoefficients. In order to asses the role of the colloid-colloid interactions we\ncompare the case of a tracer embedded in a colloidal suspension to the case of\na tracer suspended in an ideal bath.\n  Our results show that the friction coefficient increases and the passage time\ndistribution widens upon increasing the corrugation of the channel. These\nfeatures are obtained for a tracer suspended in a (thermalized) colloidal bath\nas well as for the case of an ideal thermal bath. These results highlight the\nrelevance of the confinement on the transport and show a mild dependence on the\ncolloidal/thermal bath. Finally, we rationalize our numerical results with\n  a semi-analytical model. Interestingly, the predictions of the model are\nquantitatively reliable for mild external forces, hence providing a reliable\ntool for predicting the transport across porous materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 10:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

The aim of this paper\nwas to elucidate the origin of the gas content in the debris discs via various\nsimple molecules that are often detected in the less-evolved Class II discs. We\npresent millimetre molecular line observations of nine circumstellar discs\naround A-type stars: four CO-rich debris discs (HD 21997, HD 121617, HD 131488,\nHD 131835) and five old Herbig Ae protoplanetary discs (HD 139614, HD 141569,\nHD 142666, HD 145718, HD 100453). The sources were observed with the Atacama\nLarge Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Bands 5 and 6 with 1-2''\nresolution. The Herbig Ae discs are detected in the CO isotopologues, CN, HCN,\nHCO$^+$, C2H, and CS lines. In contrast, only CO isotopologues are detected in\nthe debris discs, showing a similar amount of CO to that found in the Herbig Ae\nprotoplanetary discs. Using chemical and radiative transfer modelling, we show\nthat the abundances of molecules other than CO in debris discs are expected to\nbe very low. We consider multiple sets of initial elemental abundances with\nvarious degrees of H2 depletion. We find that the HCO+ lines should be the\nsecond brightest after the CO lines and that their intensities strongly depend\non the overall CO/H$_2$ ratio of the gas. However, even in the ISM-like\nscenario, the simulated HCO+ emission remains weak as required by our\nnon-detections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 10:26:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

A major\nchallenge in the a posteriori error analysis of AVEMs is the presence of the\nstabilization term, which is of the same order as the residual-type error\nestimator but prevents the equivalence of the latter with the energy error.\nUnder the assumption that any chain of recursively created hanging nodes has\nuniformly bounded length, we show that the stabilization term can be made\narbitrarily small relative to the error estimator provided the stabilization\nparameter of the scheme is sufficiently large. This quantitative estimate leads\nto stabilization-free upper and lower a posteriori bounds for the energy error.\nThis novel and crucial property of VEMs hinges on the largest subspace of\ncontinuous piecewise linear functions and the delicate interplay between its\ncoarser scales and the finer ones of the VEM space.

While some studies\nhave shown that the onset of the runaway greenhouse may be delayed due to an\novershoot of the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) -- compared to the\nSimpson-Nakajima threshold -- by radiatively inactive gases, there is still no\nconsensus on whether this is occurring and why. Here, we used a suite of 1D\nradiative-convective models to study the runaway greenhouse transition, with\nparticular emphasis on taking into account the radical change in the amount of\nwater vapour (from trace gas to dominant gas). The aim of this work is twofold:\nfirst, to determine the most important physical processes and parametrisations\naffecting the OLR; and second, to propose reference OLR curves for N$_2$+H$_2$O\natmospheres. Through multiple sensitivity tests, we list and select the main\nimportant physical processes and parametrisations that need to be accounted for\nin 1D radiative-convective models to compute an accurate estimate of the OLR\nfor N$_2$+H$_2$O atmospheres. The reference OLR curve is computed with a 1D\nmodel built according to the sensitivity tests. These tests also allow us to\ninterpret the diversity of results already published in the literature.\nMoreover, we provide a correlated-k table able to reproduce line-by-line\ncalculations with high accuracy. We find that the transition between an\nN$_2$-dominated atmosphere and an H$_2$O-dominated atmosphere induces an\novershoot of the OLR compared to the (pure H$_2$O) Simpson-Nakajima asymptotic\nlimit. This overshoot is first due to a transition between foreign and\nself-broadening of the water absorption lines, and second to a transition\nbetween dry and moist adiabatic lapse rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 10:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

We combine this\nparametrization with differentiable ODE solvers to form the NeuralPDE Model,\nwhich explicitly takes into account the fact that the data is governed by\ndifferential equations.

Gaining\ncentralized control over the edge nodes can be challenging due to security\nissues and threats. Among several security issues, data integrity attacks can\nlead to inconsistent data and intrude edge data analytics. Further\nintensification of the attack makes it challenging to mitigate and identify the\nroot cause. Therefore, this paper proposes a new concept of data quarantine\nmodel to mitigate data integrity attacks by quarantining intruders. The\nefficient security solutions in cloud, ad-hoc networks, and computer systems\nusing quarantine have motivated adopting it in edge computing. The data\nacquisition edge nodes identify the intruders and quarantine all the suspected\ndevices through dimensionality reduction. During quarantine, the proposed\nconcept builds the reputation scores to determine the falsely identified\nlegitimate devices and sanitize their affected data to regain data integrity.\nAs a preliminary investigation, this work identifies an appropriate machine\nlearning method, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), for dimensionality\nreduction. The LDA results in 72.83% quarantine accuracy and 0.9 seconds\ntraining time, which is efficient than other state-of-the-art methods.

The first was to\nestablish a new CTV-to-PTV expansion which considers the closest and most\ncritical organ at risk (OAR). The second goal was to investigate the impact of\nthe planning target volume (PTV) margin size on the tumor control probability\n(TCP) dependent on the geometrical setup uncertainties. The aim was to achieve\na smaller margin expansion close to the OAR while allowing a moderately larger\nexpansion in less critical areas further away from the OAR and most importantly\nwhile maintaining the TCP. Methods and Materials: Imaging data of radiation\ntherapy (RT) plans from pet dogs which had undergone RT for brain tumor were\nused to estimate the clinic specific rotational setup uncertainties. A\nMonte-Carlo methodology used to quantify the implications of those\nuncertainties on the TCP. A computational CTV-to-PTV expansion method based on\nprobability density was established. All required software modules were\ndeveloped and integrated into a software package which directly interacts with\nthe Varian Eclipse treatment planning system. Results: The rotational setup\nuncertainties were obtained from 44 dog patients. Their frequency distributions\nwere analysed, and the mean values and standard deviations were determined. To\ninvestigate the impact on the TCP, several uniform and non-isotropic PTV\ntargets were created. Standardized RT plans with equal optimization constraints\nwere defined and automatically applied and calculated on these targets. The\nresulting TCPs were then evaluated and compared. Conclusion: The non-isotropic\nmargins were found to result in larger TCPs with smaller margin excess volume.\nFurther we have presented an additional application of the newly established\nCTV-to-PTV expansion method for radiation therapy of the spinal axis of human\npatients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 11:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

A necessary\ncondition is the existence of an anisotropic XMCD signal for the local magnetic\natom, which can arise from a spin anisotropy either in the ground state or the\nfinal state. The angular dependence of the XMCD as a function of the beam\ndirection has an unusual behavior. The maximum dichroism is not aligned along\nthe spin direction, but depends on the relative orientation of the spin with\nrespect to the atomic orientation. Therefore, different geometries can result\nin the same angular dependence, and the spin direction can only be determined\nif the atomic orientation is known.

A valid safety certificate is an energy function\nindicating that safe states are with low energy, and there exists a\ncorresponding safe control policy that allows the energy function to always\ndissipate. The safety certificate and the safe control policy are closely\nrelated to each other and both challenging to synthesize. Therefore, existing\nlearning-based studies treat either of them as prior knowledge to learn the\nother, which limits their applicability with general unknown dynamics. This\npaper proposes a novel approach that simultaneously synthesizes the\nenergy-function-based safety certificate and learns the safe control policy\nwith CRL. We do not rely on prior knowledge about either an available\nmodel-based controller or a perfect safety certificate.

A key concern is irradiation-induced\ndegradation of its normally excellent thermal transport properties.

Five\nsamples were exposed to 20 MeV self-ions at RT to achieve damage levels ranging\nfrom 3.2 x 10-4 to 3.2 displacements per atom (dpa). Transient grating\nspectroscopy with insitu heating was then used to study thermal diffusivity\nevolution as a function of temperature. Using a kinetic theory model, an\nequivalent point defect density is estimated from the measured thermal\ndiffusivity. The results showed a prominent recovery of thermal diffusivity\nbetween 450 K and 650 K, which coincides with the onset of mono-vacancy\nmobility.

For doses\nof 3.2 x 10-2 dpa or higher, on the other hand, a residual reduction in thermal\ndiffusivity remains even after 1073 K annealing.

Learning and then composing modules to\nsolve different tasks provides an abstraction to address the principal\nchallenges of CL including catastrophic forgetting, backward and forward\ntransfer across tasks, and sub-linear model growth. We introduce local module\ncomposition (LMC), an approach to modular CL where each module is provided a\nlocal structural component that estimates a module's relevance to the input.\nDynamic module composition is performed layer-wise based on local relevance\nscores. We demonstrate that agnosticity to task identities (IDs) arises from\n(local) structural learning that is module-specific as opposed to the task-\nand/or model-specific as in previous works, making LMC applicable to more CL\nsettings compared to previous works. In addition, LMC also tracks statistics\nabout the input distribution and adds new modules when outlier samples are\ndetected. In the first set of experiments, LMC performs favorably compared to\nexisting methods on the recent Continual Transfer-learning Benchmark without\nrequiring task identities. In another study, we show that the locality of\nstructural learning allows LMC to interpolate to related but unseen tasks\n(OOD), as well as to compose modular networks trained independently on\ndifferent task sequences into a third modular network without any fine-tuning.\nFinally, in search for limitations of LMC we study it on more challenging\nsequences of 30 and 100 tasks, demonstrating that local module selection\nbecomes much more challenging in presence of a large number of candidate\nmodules.

The state-of-the-art\nfault localization techniques, however, produce coarse-grained results that can\ndeter manual debugging or mislead automated repair tools. In this work, we\nfocus specifically on the fine-grained identification of code elements (i.e.,\ntokens) that must be changed to fix a buggy program: we refer to it as fix\nlocalization. This paper introduces a neural network architecture (named Beep)\nthat builds on AST paths to predict the buggy code element as well as the\nchange action that must be applied to repair a program. Leveraging massive data\nof bugs and patches within the CoCoNut dataset, we trained a model that was (1)\neffective in localizing the buggy tokens with the Mean First Rank significantly\nhigher than a statistics based baseline and a machine learning-based baseline,\nand (2) effective in predicting the repair operators (with the associated buggy\ncode elements) with a Recall@1= 30-45% and the Mean First Rank=7-12 (evaluated\nby CoCoNut, ManySStuBs4J, and Defects4J datasets). To showcase how fine-grained\nfix localization can help program repair, we employ it in two repair pipelines\nwhere we use either a code completion engine to predict the correct token or a\nset of heuristics to search for the suitable donor code. A key strength of\naccurate fix localization for program repair is that it reduces the chance of\npatch overfitting, a challenge in generate-and-validate automated program\nrepair: both two repair pipelines achieve a correctness ratio of 100%, i.e.,\nall generated patches are found to be correct. Moreover, accurate fix\nlocalization helps enhance the efficiency of program repair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 13:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

It is crucial for future surveys like the\n$LiteBIRD$ satellite, which aims at constraining the primordial signal leftover\nby Inflation with an accuracy on $r$ of the order 1e-3. Variations of the dust\nproperties along and between lines of sight lead to distortions of the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) that can not be easily anticipated by standard\ncomponent separation methods. This issue can be tackled with a moment expansion\nof the dust SED, an innovative parametrization method imposing minimal\nassumptions on the sky complexity. In this paper, we apply this formalism to\nthe $B$-mode cross-angular power spectra computed from simulated $LiteBIRD$\npolarization data at frequencies between 100 and 402 GHz, containing CMB, dust\nand instrumental noise. The spatial variation of the dust spectral parameters\n(spectral index $\\beta$ and temperature $T$) in our simulations, lead to\nsignificant biases on $r$ if not properly taken into account.

Control of multi-strain pathogens can be\ncomplicated by the high strain diversity often observed in endemic settings. It\nis not well understood how high strain diversity is maintained in populations,\ngiven that they compete with each other both directly (within an individual\nhost) and indirectly (via host immunity). Previous modelling studies have\ninvestigated how indirect competition affects the prevalence and diversity of\nstrains. However, these studies often make simplifying assumptions about the\ndirect competition that occurs within hosts. Currently, little data is\navailable to validate these assumptions, hence there is a need to clarify how\nsensitive model outputs are to these assumptions. In this study, we compare the\ndynamics of multi-strain pathogens under different assumptions about direct\ncompetition between strains using an agent-based model. We find that the\nassumptions made about direct competition can affect the epidemiological\ndynamics, particularly when there is no long-term immunity following infections\nand a low rate of importation of non-circulating strains. Our results suggest\nthat while direct and indirect competition can each decrease strain diversity\nwhen they act in isolation, they may increase strain diversity when they act\ntogether. This finding highlights the importance of examining sensitivity to\nassumptions about strain competition. In particular, omitting consideration of\ndirect competition can lead to inaccurate estimates of the likely effectiveness\nof control strategies as changes in strain diversity shift the level of direct\nstrain competition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 14:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 04:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

Furthermore, we investigate the source shapes by\napproximating the derived intensity distributions using 2D Gaussian profiles\nwith elliptical half-maximum contours.

Network symmetries can be\ndetermined by finding a {\\it balanced coloring} of the graph, which is a node\npartition in which each cluster of nodes receives the same information (color)\nfrom the rest of the graph. In recent work we saw that biological networks such\nas gene regulatory networks, metabolic networks and neural networks in\norganisms ranging from bacteria to yeast and humans are rich in fibration\nsymmetries related to the graph balanced coloring.

There is a transition from n-type to p-type\nbehavior in the layers as a function of nitrogen concentration varying from 48\nat. % to 52 at. % in CrN films.

As a result\nof the change in stoichiometry, the lattice parameter and the Seebeck\ncoefficient increase together with the increase of N in CrN1+d; in particular,\nthe Seebeck value coefficient transitions from -50 uV.K-1 for CrN0.97 to +75\nuV.K-1 for CrN1.1.

Unlike other quantum coarse-graining\nprocedures, ours always gives a well-defined unique coarse-graining of phase\nspace. Our coarse-graining is also unique in that the volumes of phase space\nassociated with macro-states are computed from differential manifolds whose\nmetric components are constructed from the Lie group symmetries that generate\n$\\{|\\bar{\\Gamma}^{\\rho}\\rangle\\}$. We call these manifolds surfaces of\nignorance, and their volumes quantify the lack of information in $\\rho$ as\nmeasured by quantum information entropies. To show that these volumes behave\nlike information entropies, we compare them to the von Neumann and linear\nentropies for states whose symmetries are given by $SO(3)$, $SU(2)$, and\n$SO(N)$. We also show that our procedure reproduces features of Boltzmann's\noriginal coarse-graining by showing that the majority of phase space consists\nof states near or at equilibrium. As a consequence of this coarse-graining, it\nis shown that an inherent flag variety structure underlies composite Hilbert\nspaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 15:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

One of the primary effects applied to images\ncaptured in portrait mode is a synthetic shallow depth of field (DoF). The\nsynthetic DoF (or bokeh effect) selectively blurs regions in the image to\nemulate the effect of using a large lens with a wide aperture. In addition,\nmany applications now incorporate a new image motion attribute (NIMAT) to\nemulate background motion, where the motion is correlated with estimated depth\nat each pixel. In this work, we follow the trend of rendering the NIMAT effect\nby introducing a modification on the blur synthesis procedure in portrait mode.\nIn particular, our modification enables a high-quality synthesis of multi-view\nbokeh from a single image by applying rotated blurring kernels. Given the\nsynthesized multiple views, we can generate aesthetically realistic image\nmotion similar to the NIMAT effect. We validate our approach qualitatively\ncompared to the original NIMAT effect and other similar image motions, like\nFacebook 3D image. Our image motion demonstrates a smooth image view transition\nwith fewer artifacts around the object boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 15:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

Network cycles are often of\nparticular interest in many applications, such as ecological studies, and an\nunexplored area has been how to incorporate networks' cycles within the\ninferential framework in an explicit way. The recently developed Spherical\nNetwork Family of models (SNF) offers a flexible formulation for modelling\nmultiple network data that permits any type of metric. This has opened up the\npossibility to formulate network models that focus on network properties\nhitherto not possible or practical to consider. In this article we propose a\nnovel network distance metric that measures similarities between networks with\nrespect to their cycles, and incorporate this within the SNF model to allow\ninferences that explicitly capture information on cycles.

We further propose a novel\ncomputational framework to allow posterior inferences from the intractable SNF\nmodel for moderate sized networks. Lastly, we apply the resulting methodology\nto a set of ecological network data studying aggressive interactions between\nspecies of fish.

One category of methods such\nas the Deep Galerkin Method (DGM) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)\naim to approximate the solution of the PDEs.

Finally,\nit is shown that a simple calibration procedure allows a well-resolved\nmonitoring of the contact area during resistive-nanoindentation performed on\nsamples with complex rheologies (ductile thin film on an elastic substrate).\nComparison to analytical and numerical approaches highlights the strength of\nresistive-nanoindentation for continuous area monitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 14:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

Developing an AI able to drive a\ncar without human intervention and a small robot to deliver packages in the\ncity may seem like different problems, nevertheless from the point of view of\nperception and vision, both problems have several similarities. The main\nsolutions we currently find focus on the environment perception through visual\ninformation using Computer Vision techniques, Machine Learning, and various\nalgorithms to make the robot understand the environment or scene, move, adapt\nits trajectory and perform its tasks (maintenance, exploration, etc.) without\nthe need for human intervention. In this work, we develop a small-scale\nautonomous vehicle from scratch, capable of understanding the scene using only\nvisual information, navigating through industrial environments, detecting\npeople and obstacles, or performing simple maintenance tasks.

Variational autoencoder is one of the\ncomputer-aided design methods which explores the chemical space based on\nexisting molecular dataset. Quantum machine learning has emerged as an atypical\nlearning method that may speed up some classical learning tasks because of its\nstrong expressive power. However, near-term quantum computers suffer from\nlimited number of qubits which hinders the representation learning in high\ndimensional spaces. We present a scalable quantum generative autoencoder\n(SQ-VAE) for simultaneously reconstructing and sampling drug molecules, and a\ncorresponding vanilla variant (SQ-AE) for better reconstruction. The\narchitectural strategies in hybrid quantum classical networks such as,\nadjustable quantum layer depth, heterogeneous learning rates, and patched\nquantum circuits are proposed to learn high dimensional dataset such as,\nligand-targeted drugs. Extensive experimental results are reported for\ndifferent dimensions including 8x8 and 32x32 after choosing suitable\narchitectural strategies. The performance of quantum generative autoencoder is\ncompared with the corresponding classical counterpart throughout all\nexperiments. The results show that quantum computing advantages can be achieved\nfor normalized low-dimension molecules, and that high-dimension molecules\ngenerated from quantum generative autoencoders have better drug properties\nwithin the same learning period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 00:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

The environment\nthat these applications operate in is often highly dynamic, and, as a result,\nthe wireless network technology used needs to be able to adapt to changing\nconditions, which makes mesh networking a good fit. Hence, in this work, we\nconsider Thread and Bluetooth Mesh, two prominent mesh networking technologies.\nWe measure one-way point-to-point latency using these technologies and show the\ncumulative probability distribution of the latency for varying payload size. We\ncarry out the measurements under static conditions in an open-air environment.\nOur results show that Thread achieves lower latency than Bluetooth Mesh,\nespecially for larger payloads. Furthermore, we show that Thread meets some of\nthe latency targets set out for 5G. However, since Thread networks are slow to\nadapt to network changes, Thread may still not be suitable for application\nrequiring low latency. Bluetooth mesh, on the other hand, does not meet any of\nthe latency targets, although it is close when the payload is small (less than\n11 bytes). Overall, there needs to be further optimization before these\ntechnologies can be used for reliable and low-latency communication in dynamic\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 20:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}
