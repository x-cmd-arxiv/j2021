We measured the porosity\nand lithology of the carbonate rock using three and two industry-standard ways,\nrespectively, as reference values.

The degrees of freedom of\nsuch a model can be partitioned in free and prescribed sets to define the\nboundary conditions. A multi-partition problem involves multiple partitions of\nthe same discretization, typically corresponding to different loading\nscenarios. As a result, solving multi-partition problems involves multiple\nfactorization/preconditionings of the system matrix, requiring a high\ncomputational effort. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to efficiently\ncalculate the responses and accompanying design sensitivities in such\nmulti-partition problems using static condensation for use in gradient-based\ntopology optimization. A main problem class that benefits from the proposed\nmethod is the topology optimization of small-displacement\nmulti-input-multi-output compliant mechanisms. However, the method is\napplicable to any linear problem. We present its formulation and an algorithmic\ncomplexity analysis to estimate computational advantages for both direct and\niterative solution methods to solve the system of equations, verified by\nnumerical experiments. It is demonstrated that substantial gains are achievable\nfor large-scale multi-partition problems. This is especially true for problems\nwith both a small set of number of degrees of freedom that fully describes the\nperformance of the structure and with large similarities between the different\npartitions. A major contribution to the gain is the lack of large adjoint\nanalyses required to obtain the sensitivities of the performance measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 16:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

The current tension is over $4\\sigma$ and standard\nsirens will be able to provide a completely independent measurement. Dark\nsirens (binary black hole or neutron star mergers with no electromagnetic\ncounterparts) can be informative if the missing redshift information is\nprovided through the use of galaxy catalogues to identify potential host\ngalaxies of the merger. However, galaxy catalogue incompleteness affects this\nanalysis, and accurate modelling of it is essential for obtaining an unbiased\nmeasurement of $H_0$. Previously this has been done by assuming uniform\ncompleteness within the sky area of a gravitational wave event. This paper\npresents an updated methodology in which the completeness of the galaxy\ncatalogue is estimated in a directionally-dependent matter, by pixelating the\nsky and computing the completeness of the galaxy catalogue along each line of\nsight. The $H_0$ inference for a single event is carried out on a\npixel-by-pixel basis, and the pixels are combined for the final result. A\nreanalysis of the events in the first gravitational wave transient catalogue\n(GWTC-1) leads to an improvement on the measured value of $H_0$ of\napproximately 5% compared to the 68.3% highest-density interval of the\nequivalent LIGO and Virgo result, with $H_0= 68.8^{+15.9}_{-7.8}$ km s$^{-1}$\nMpc$^{-1}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 17:00:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 10:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-28"}

Besides, when\ncollecting user statistics longitudinally, privacy progressively degrades.\nIndeed, the \"multiple\" settings in combination (i.e., many attributes and\nseveral collections throughout time) impose several challenges, for which this\npaper proposes the first solution for frequency estimates under LDP. To tackle\nthese issues, we extend the analysis of three state-of-the-art LDP protocols\n(Generalized Randomized Response -- GRR, Optimized Unary Encoding -- OUE, and\nSymmetric Unary Encoding -- SUE) for both longitudinal and multidimensional\ndata collections. While the known literature uses OUE and SUE for two rounds of\nsanitization (a.k.a. memoization), i.e., L-OUE and L-SUE, respectively, we\nanalytically and experimentally show that starting with OUE and then with SUE\nprovides higher data utility (i.e., L-OSUE). Also, for attributes with small\ndomain sizes, we propose Longitudinal GRR (L-GRR), which provides higher\nutility than the other protocols based on unary encoding. Last, we also propose\na new solution named Adaptive LDP for LOngitudinal and Multidimensional\nFREquency Estimates (ALLOMFREE), which randomly samples a single attribute to\nbe sent with the whole privacy budget and adaptively selects the optimal\nprotocol, i.e., either L-GRR or L-OSUE.

Key\nparameters of the parent body (formation time, radius, and porosity) are\nestimated by fitting thermal histories of EL6 chondrites (LON 94100,\nNeuschwanstein, Khairpur, Blithfield, Daniel's Kuil), constrained mainly by\nI-Xe and Ar-Ar ages and their respective closure temperatures.

The data are obtained from the Turkish Income and Living\nConditions Study, where the outcome variable is self-rated health (SRH), which\nis ordinal in nature. The analysis of these data is to compare covariate\nsub-groups and draw region- and family-level inferences in terms of SRH.\nParameters and random-effects are sampled from the joint posterior densities\nfollowing a Bayesian paradigm. Three criteria are used for model selection:\nWatenable information criterion, log pseudo marginal likelihood, and deviance\ninformation criterion. All three suggest that we need to account for both\nregion- and family-level variabilities in order to model SRH. The extent to\nwhich the models replicate the observed data is examined by posterior\npredictive checks. Differences in SRH are found between levels of economic and\ndemographic variables, regions of Turkey, and families who participated in the\nsurvey.

During this process, the planetary f-mode may experience a phase of\ndiffusive growth, allowing its energy to quickly build up to large values. In\nYu et al. (2021, ApJ, 917, 31), we demonstrated that nonlinear mode\ninteractions between a parent f-mode and daughter f- and p-modes expand the\nparameter space over which the diffusive growth of the parent is triggered. We\nextend that study by incorporating (1) the angular momentum transfer between\nthe orbit and the mode, and consequently the evolution of the pericenter\ndistance, (2) a phenomenological correction to the nonlinear frequency shift at\nhigh parent mode energies, and (3) dissipation of the parent's energy due to\nboth turbulent convective damping of the daughter modes and strongly nonlinear\nwave-breaking events. The new ingredients allow us to follow the coupled\nevolution of the mode and orbit over $\\gtrsim 10^4$ years, covering the\ndiffusive evolution from its onset to its termination. We find that the\nsemi-major axis shrinks by a factor of nearly ten over $10^4$ years,\ncorresponding to a tidal quality factor $\\mathcal{Q}\\sim10$. The f-mode's\ndiffusive growth terminates while the eccentricity is still high, at around\ne=0.8-0.95. Using these results, we revisit the eccentricity distribution of\nproto-hot Jupiters.

The saturation of this instability has been\nextensively studied in symmetric configurations where the interpenetrating\nplasmas share the same properties (velocity, density, temperature). In many\nphysical settings, however, the most common configuration is that of asymmetric\nplasma flows. For instance, the precursor of relativistic collisionless shock\nwaves involves a hot, dilute beam of accelerated particles reflected at the\nshock front and a cold, dense inflowing background plasma. To determine the\nappropriate criterion for saturation in this case, we have performed\nlarge-scale 2D particle-in-cell simulations of counterstreaming\nelectron-positron pair and electron-ion plasmas. We show that, in\ninterpenetrating pair plasmas, the relevant criterion is that of magnetic\ntrapping as applied to the component (beam or plasma) that carries the larger\ninertia of the two; namely, the instability growth suddenly slows down once the\nquiver frequency of those particles equals or exceeds the instability growth\nrate. We present theoretical approximations for the saturation level. These\nfindings remain valid for electron-ion plasmas provided that electrons and ions\nare close to equipartition in the plasma flow of larger inertia. Our results\ncan be directly applied to the physics of relativistic, weakly magnetized shock\nwaves, but they can also be generalized to other cases of study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 17:20:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

However,\nunwanted interactions between qubits (so-called parasitic gates) can be\nparticularly problematic and degrade the performance of quantum applications.\nIn this work, we present two software methods to mitigate parasitic two-qubit\ngate errors. The first approach is built upon the KAK decomposition and keeps\nthe original unitary decomposition for the error-free native two-qubit gate. It\ncounteracts a parasitic two-qubit gate by only applying single-qubit rotations\nand therefore has no two-qubit gate overhead. We show the optimal choice of\nsingle-qubit mitigation gates. The second approach applies a numerical\noptimisation algorithm to re-compile a target unitary into the error-parasitic\ntwo-qubit gate plus single-qubit gates. We demonstrate these approaches on the\nCPhase-parasitic iSWAP-like gates. The KAK-based approach helps decrease\nunitary infidelity by a factor of 3 compared to the noisy implementation\nwithout error mitigation. When arbitrary single-qubit rotations are allowed,\nrecompilation could completely mitigate the effect of parasitic errors but may\nrequire more native gates than the KAK-based approach.

We find the\nbirefringence in MoO$_3$ nanosheets compares favorably with other 2D materials\nthat exhibit strong birefringence, such as black phosphorus, ReS$_2$, or\nReSe$_2$, in particular in the visible spectral range where MoO$_3$ has the\nunique advantage of transparency. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of\nMoO$_3$ for dielectric encapsulation by reporting linewidth narrowing and\nreduced inhomogeneous broadening of 2D excitons and optically active quantum\nemitters, respectively, in a prototypical monolayer transition-metal\ndichalcogenide semiconductor. These results show the potential of MoO$_3$ as a\n2D dielectric layer for manipulation of the light polarization in vertical 2D\nheterostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 17:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

The response of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes to incident\n{\\gamma}-ray-initiated showers in the atmosphere changes as the telescopes age\ndue to exposure to light and weather. These aging processes affect the\nreconstructed energies of the events and {\\gamma}-ray fluxes. Aims. This work\ndiscusses the implementation of signal calibration methods for the Very\nEnergetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) to account for\nchanges in the optical throughput and detector performance over time. Methods.\nThe total throughput of a Cherenkov telescope is the product of\ncamera-dependent factors, such as the photomultiplier tube gains and their\nquantum efficiencies, and the mirror reflectivity and Winston cone response to\nincoming radiation. This document summarizes different methods to determine how\nthe camera gains and mirror reflectivity have evolved over time and how we can\ncalibrate this changing throughput in reconstruction pipelines for imaging\natmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The implementation is validated against seven\nyears of observations with the VERITAS telescopes of the Crab Nebula, which is\na reference object in very-high-energy astronomy. Results. Regular optical\nthroughput monitoring and the corresponding signal calibrations are found to be\ncritical for the reconstruction of extensive air shower images. The proposed\nimplementation is applied as a correction to the signals of the photomultiplier\ntubes in the telescope simulation to produce fine-tuned instrument response\nfunctions. This method is shown to be effective for calibrating the acquired\n{\\gamma}-ray data and for recovering the correct energy of the events and\nphoton fluxes. At the same time, it keeps the computational effort of\ngenerating Monte Carlo simulations for instrument response functions affordably\nlow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 17:43:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 14:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Four MPC variants are considered: a one-shot\ncontroller with perfect forecasting yielding optimal control; a limited-horizon\ncontroller with perfect forecasting; a mean forecasting-based controller; and a\ntwo-stage stochastic programming controller using historical scenarios. In all\ncases, the MPC model for water temperature and electricity price are exact;\nonly water demand is uncertain. For comparison, both ES and PPO learn neural\nnetwork-based policies by directly interacting with the simulated environment\nunder the same scenarios used by MPC. All methods are then evaluated on a\nseparate one-week continuation of the demand time series. We demonstrate that\noptimal control for this problem is challenging, requiring more than 8-hour\nlookahead for MPC with perfect forecasting to attain the minimum cost. Despite\nthis challenge, both ES and PPO learn good general purpose policies that\noutperform mean forecast and two-stage stochastic MPC controllers in terms of\naverage cost and are more than two orders of magnitude faster at computing\nactions.

The description of this scenario is, however, complicated\nby the Schwinger effect, which gives rise to highly nonlinear dynamics.\nHypermagnetogenesis during axion inflation in the absence of nonlinear effects\nis well studied and known to result in a hypermagnetic energy density that\nscales like $H^4\\,e^{2\\pi\\xi}/\\xi^5$, where $\\xi$ is proportional to the time\nderivative of the axion-vector coupling in units of the Hubble rate $H$. In\nthis paper, we generalize this result to the full SM case by consistently\ntaking into account the Schwinger pair production of all SM fermions. To this\nend, we employ the novel gradient-expansion formalism that we recently\ndeveloped in [2109.01651], and which is based on a set of vacuum expectation\nvalues for bilinear hyperelectromagnetic functions in position space. We\nparametrize the numerical output of our formalism in terms of three parameters\n($\\xi$, $H$, and $\\Delta$, where the latter accounts for the damping of\nsubhorizon gauge-field modes because of the finite conductivity of the medium)\nand work out semianalytical fit functions that describe our numerical results\nwith high accuracy.

Although they can be estimated via automatic\ndifferentiation of a learned density model, this can amplify estimation errors\nand is expensive in high dimensional settings. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a method to directly estimate high order derivatives (scores) of a\ndata density from samples. We first show that denoising score matching can be\ninterpreted as a particular case of Tweedie's formula.

Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that such situations are not fine-tuned, but are actually global\nattractors within certain cosmological frameworks, with the universe naturally\nevolving towards such long-lasting periods of stasis for a wide variety of\ninitial conditions. The existence of this kind of stasis therefore gives rise\nto a host of new theoretical possibilities across the entire cosmological\ntimeline, ranging from potential implications for primordial density\nperturbations, dark-matter production, and structure formation all the way to\nearly reheating, early matter-dominated eras, and even the age of the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 18:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

The\nintegrated-light kinematics provide a velocity dispersion of $11.76\\pm0.66$\nkm/s inside $75^{\\prime\\prime}$. After applying appropriate corrections to\ncrowding in the central regions, we achieve consistent velocity dispersion\nvalues using velocities from individual stars. Crowding corrections need to be\napplied when targeting individual stars in high density stellar environments.\nFrom integrated light, we measure the surface brightness profile and find a\nshallow cusp towards the center. Axisymmetric, orbit-based models measure the\nstellar mass-to-light ratio, black hole mass and parameters for a dark matter\nhalo. At large radii it is important to consider possible tidal effects from\nthe Milky Way so we include a variety of assumptions regarding the tidal\nradius. For every set of assumptions, models require a central black hole\nconsistent with a mass $(3.3 \\pm 2) \\times 10^6\\, M_\\odot$. The no-black-hole\ncase for any of our assumptions is excluded at over 95% significance, with\n$6.4<\\Delta\\chi^2<14$. A black hole of this mass would have significant effect\non dwarf galaxy formation and evolution. The dark halo parameters are heavily\naffected by the assumptions for the tidal radii, with the circular velocity\nonly constrained to be above 30 km/s. Reasonable assumptions for the tidal\nradius result in stellar orbits consistent with an isotropic distribution in\nthe velocities. These more realistic models only show strong constraints for\nthe mass of the central black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 19:07:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

We found large varieties in their\nproperties, relevant for understanding their evolutionary stage. We started by\nquantifying their occurrences, the duration of the 'on' (active) and 'off'\n(dying) phase, and we compared the results with models of the evolution of\nradio galaxies. In addition to these extreme phases, the resolved spectral\nindex images can also reveal interesting secrets about the evolution of\napparently normal radio galaxies. The spectral information can be connected\nwith, and used to improve, the Fanaroff--Riley classification, and we present\none example of this, illustrating what the combination of the LOFAR and Apertif\nsurveys now allow us to do routinely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 19:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

The key challenge is that there is not much visibility into ML\ninference execution on edge devices, and very little awareness of potential\nissues during the edge deployment process. We present ML-EXray, an end-to-end\nframework, which provides visibility into layer-level details of the ML\nexecution, and helps developers analyze and debug cloud-to-edge deployment\nissues.

Evaluations show that ML-EXray can effectively\ncatch deployment issues, such as pre-processing bugs, quantization issues,\nsuboptimal kernels, etc. Using ML-EXray, users need to write less than 15 lines\nof code to fully examine the edge deployment pipeline. Eradicating these\nissues, ML-EXray can correct model performance by up to 30%, pinpoint\nerror-prone layers, and guide users to optimize kernel execution latency by two\norders of magnitude.

In VQA, a series of questions are posed based on a set of images and\nthe task at hand is to arrive at the answer. To achieve this, we take a\nsymbolic reasoning based approach using the framework of formal logic. The\nimage and the questions are converted into symbolic representations on which\nexplicit reasoning is performed. We propose a formal logic framework where (i)\nimages are converted to logical background facts with the help of scene graphs,\n(ii) the questions are translated to first-order predicate logic clauses using\na transformer based deep learning model, and (iii) perform satisfiability\nchecks, by using the background knowledge and the grounding of predicate\nclauses, to obtain the answer.

The main equation in the\none-dimensional case writes $\\partial_t u_m-\\Delta u_m=mu_m+f(t,x,u_m)$, where\n$m=m(x)$ is the control, which must satisfy some $L^\\infty$ bounds ($0\\leq\nm\\leq 1$ a.e.) and an $L^1$ constraint ($\\int m=m_0$ is fixed), and where $f$\nis a non-linearity that must only satisfy that any solution of this equation is\npositive at any given time.

An in-depth analysis of the\nwave-buoy data collected during the 2017 PIPERS programme in the Ross Sea is\nconducted. Standard techniques are used to estimate the spatial rate of wave\nattenuation $\\alpha$ and the influence of a number of potential physical\ndrivers on its dependence on wave period $T$ is investigated. A power-law is\nshown to consistently describe the $\\alpha(T)$ relationship, in line with other\nrecent analyses. The two parameters describing this relationship are found to\ndepend significantly on sea ice concentration, mean wave period and wind\ndirection, however. Looking at cross-correlations between these physical\ndrivers, three regimes of ice-induced wave attenuation are identified, which\ncharacterise different ice, wave and wind conditions, and very possibly\ndifferent processes causing this observed attenuation. This analysis suggests\nthat parametrisations of ice-induced wave decay in spectral wave models should\nbe piecewise, so their dependence on local ice, wave and wind conditions is\ndescribed in some way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 20:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

Although mass spectrometry is applied\nin many areas, the vast majority of small molecules lack experimental reference\nspectra. For over seventy years, spectrum prediction has remained a key\nchallenge in the field. Existing deep learning methods do not leverage global\nstructure in the molecule, potentially resulting in difficulties when\ngeneralizing to new data. In this work we propose a new model, MassFormer, for\naccurately predicting tandem mass spectra. MassFormer uses a graph transformer\narchitecture to model long-distance relationships between atoms in the\nmolecule. The transformer module is initialized with parameters obtained\nthrough a chemical pre-training task, then fine-tuned on spectral data.\nMassFormer outperforms competing approaches for spectrum prediction on multiple\ndatasets, and is able to recover prior knowledge about the effect of collision\nenergy on the spectrum. By employing gradient-based attribution methods, we\ndemonstrate that the model can identify relationships between fragment peaks.\nTo further highlight MassFormer's utility, we show that it can match or exceed\nexisting prediction-based methods on two spectrum identification tasks.

The best estimate is obtained by\nmaximising OT over the given family. As OT calculations are done after mapping\ndata to a lower dimensional space, our method scales well with the original\ndata dimension. We demonstrate the idea with neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 21:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

G-estimation and dynamic weighted ordinary least squares\n(dWOLS) are double robust statistical methods that can be used to identify\noptimal adaptive treatment strategies. They require both a model for the\noutcome and a model for the treatment and are consistent if at least one of\nthese models is correctly specified. It is underappreciated that these methods\nadditionally require modeling all existing treatment-confounder interactions to\nyield consistent estimators. Identifying partially adaptive treatment\nstrategies that tailor treatments according to only a few covariates, ignoring\nsome interactions, may be preferable in practice. It has been proposed to\ncombine inverse probability weighting and G-estimation to address this issue,\nbut we argue that the resulting estimator is not expected to be double robust.\nBuilding on G-estimation and dWOLS, we propose alternative estimators of\npartially adaptive strategies and demonstrate their double robustness. We\ninvestigate and compare the empirical performance of six estimators in a\nsimulation study. As expected, estimators combining inverse probability\nweighting with either G-estimation or dWOLS are biased when the treatment model\nis incorrectly specified.

Existing safety mechanisms such as adversarial training,\nadversarial detection, and robust learning are not always adapted to all\ndisturbances in which the agent is deployed. Those disturbances include moving\nadversaries whose behavior can be unpredictable by the agent, and as a matter\nof fact harmful to its learning. Ensuring the safety of critical systems also\nrequires methods that give formal guarantees on the behaviour of the agent\nevolving in a perturbed environment. It is therefore necessary to propose new\nsolutions adapted to the learning challenges faced by the agent. In this paper,\nfirst we generate adversarial agents that exhibit flaws in the agent's policy\nby presenting moving adversaries. Secondly, We use reward shaping and a\nmodified Q-learning algorithm as defense mechanisms to improve the agent's\npolicy when facing adversarial perturbations. Finally, probabilistic model\nchecking is employed to evaluate the effectiveness of both mechanisms. We have\nconducted experiments on a discrete grid world with a single agent facing\nnon-learning and learning adversaries. Our results show a diminution in the\nnumber of collisions between the agent and the adversaries.

Mating is constrained by physical and\ngenetic proximity, and offspring inherit nuclear genomes from both parents,\nwith recombination. The model predicts macroscopic patterns including a\ncommunity's long-term species diversity, its species abundance distribution,\nspeciation and extinction rates, as well as intra- and inter-specific genetic\nvariation. We explore how these long-term outcomes depend upon the microscopic\nparameters of reproduction: individual fitness governed by mito-nuclear\ncompatibility, constraints on mating compatibility, and ecological carrying\ncapacity. We find that strong selection for mito-nuclear compatibility reduces\nthe equilibrium number of species after a radiation, increases the species'\nabundances, while simultaneously increasing both speciation and extinction\nrates. The negative correlation between species diversity and diversification\nrates in our model agrees with the broad empirical pattern of lower species\ndiversity and higher speciation/extinction rates in temperate regions, compared\nto the tropics.

The algorithms developed describe an extensive\ntoolkit of methods for circumventing the deleterious effects of noise in the\ncontext of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) framework.\nWe offer two primary contributions, both focused on noisy data acquired from a\nsystem x' = f(x). First, we propose, for use in high-noise settings, an\nextensive toolkit of critically enabling extensions for the SINDy regression\nmethod, to progressively cull functionals from an over-complete library and\nyield a set of sparse equations that regress to the derivate x'. These\ninnovations can extract sparse governing equations and coefficients from\nhigh-noise time-series data (e.g. 300% added noise).

The enabling modules in the toolkit are combined\ninto a single method, but the individual modules can be tactically applied in\nother equation discovery methods (SINDy or not) to improve results on\nhigh-noise data. Second, we propose a technique, applicable to any model\ndiscovery method based on x' = f(x), to assess the accuracy of a discovered\nmodel in the context of non-unique solutions due to noisy data. Currently, this\nnon-uniqueness can obscure a discovered model's accuracy and thus a discovery\nmethod's effectiveness.

The antipredator response may\ninfluence spatial pattern formation and ecosystem stability but requires an\norganism's cost to contribute to the collective effort. We investigate a\nnonhierarchical tritrophic system, whose predator-prey interactions are\ndescribed by the rock-paper-scissors game rules. In our spatial stochastic\nsimulations, the radius of antipredator response defines the maximum prey group\nsize that disturbs the predator's action, determining the individual cost to\nparticipate in antipredator strategies. We consider that each organism\ncontributes equally to the collective effort, having its mobility limited by\nthe proportion of energy devoted to the antipredator reaction. Our outcomes\nshow that the antipredator response leads to spiral patterns, with the\nsegregation of organisms of the same species occupying departed spatial\ndomains.

Finally, our findings show that although the\nincrease of the predation risk for a more localized antipredator response, the\nhigh mobility constraining benefits species coexistence.

Methods: A nationally representative Bangladesh Demographic and\nHealth Survey 2014 data of 17,863 women is used to address the research\nquestions. In the study, two response variables are constructed from the five\nattitude questions, and a series of individual and community-level predictors\nare tested.

Results: Statistical analyses reveal that among the\nindividual-level independent variables age at first marriage, respondent's\neducation, decision score, religion, NGO membership, access to information,\nhusband's education, normalized wealth score, and division indicator have\nsignificant effects on the women's attitude towards IPV.

The central\nassumption is that the underlying, possibly infinite-dimensional parameter,\nlies in a known convex set, potentially leading to partial identification of\nthe welfare effect. An example of such restrictions is the smoothness of\ncounterfactual outcome functions. As the main theoretical result, I obtain a\nfinite-sample decision rule (i.e., a function that maps data to a decision)\nthat is optimal under the minimax regret criterion. This rule is easy to\ncompute, yet achieves optimality among all decision rules; no ad hoc\nrestrictions are imposed on the class of decision rules.

However, the complex scene structure of a\nface image still makes it a challenge to generate videos with face poses\nsignificantly deviating from the source image. On one hand, without knowing the\nfacial geometric structure, generated face images might be improperly\ndistorted. On the other hand, some area of the generated image might be\noccluded in the source image, which makes it difficult for GAN to generate\nrealistic appearance. To address these problems, we propose a structure aware\nface animation (SAFA) method which constructs specific geometric structures to\nmodel different components of a face image. Following the well recognized\nmotion based face animation technique, we use a 3D morphable model (3DMM) to\nmodel the face, multiple affine transforms to model the other foreground\ncomponents like hair and beard, and an identity transform to model the\nbackground. The 3DMM geometric embedding not only helps generate realistic\nstructure for the driving scene, but also contributes to better perception of\noccluded area in the generated image. Besides, we further propose to exploit\nthe widely studied inpainting technique to faithfully recover the occluded\nimage area. Both quantitative and qualitative experiment results have shown the\nsuperiority of our method.

We identified 11 CS, 8\nH13CO+, and 6 SiO clumps with radii of 0.1-0.5pc. The CS and H13CO+ clumps are\nmainly divided into two velocity components, one at 4kms-1 and the other at\n12kms-1, while the SiO clumps have velocities between the two components. The\nSiO emission is distributed toward the UCHII ring, where the 4kms-1 component\nclumps of CS and H13CO+ also exist. The 12kms-1 component clumps of CS are\ndetected at the east and west of the UCHII ring with an apparent hole toward\nthe ring. The clump masses vary from 4.4x10^2 M_SUN to 4.9x10^4 M_SUN with the\nmean values of 0.94x10^4M_SUN, 0.88x10^4M_SUN, and 2.2x10^4M_SUN for the CS,\nH13CO+, and SiO clumps, respectively.

The proposed method\nis based on two assumptions: first, that the bone surface is smooth (not\nfractal) permitting the definition of a tangent plane and, second, that the\ninterface between marrow and bone tissue phases is orientable. This permits the\nanalysis of bone adaptation using the well-developed mathematics of geometric\nflows and the numerical techniques of the level set method. Most importantly,\ntopological changes such as holes forming in plates and rods disconnecting can\nbe treated formally and simulated naturally. First, the relationship between\nbiological theories of bone adaptation and the mathematical object describing\ngeometric flow is described. This is termed the adaptation function, $F$, and\nis the multi-scale link described by Frost's Utah paradigm between cellular\ndynamics and bone structure. Second, a model of age-related bone loss termed\ncurvature-based bone adaptation is presented. Using previous literature, it is\nshown that curvature-based bone adaptation is the limiting continuous equation\nof simulated bone atrophy, a discrete model of bone aging. Interestingly, the\nparameters of the model can be defined in such a way that the flow is\nvolume-preserving. This implies that bone health can in principle change in\nways that fundamentally cannot be measured by areal or volumetric bone mineral\ndensity, requiring structure-level imaging. Third, a numerical method is\ndescribed and two in silico experiments are performed demonstrating the\nnon-volume-preserving and volume-preserving cases. Taken together, recognition\nof bone adaptation as a geometric flow permits the recruitment of mathematical\nand numerical developments over the last 50 years to understanding and\ndescribing the complex surface of bone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 03:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

Modern datasets can have\nmultiple correlated time series, which are often generated with global (shared)\nregularities and local (specific) dynamics. In this paper, we seek to tackle\nsuch forecasting problems with DeepDGL, a deep forecasting model that\ndisentangles dynamics into global and local temporal patterns. DeepDGL employs\nan encoder-decoder architecture, consisting of two encoders to learn global and\nlocal temporal patterns, respectively, and a decoder to make multi-step\nforecasting. Specifically, to model complicated global patterns, the vector\nquantization (VQ) module is introduced, allowing the global feature encoder to\nlearn a shared codebook among all time series. To model diversified and\nheterogenous local patterns, an adaptive parameter generation module enhanced\nby the contrastive multi-horizon coding (CMC) is proposed to generate the\nparameters of the local feature encoder for each individual time series, which\nmaximizes the mutual information between the series-specific context variable\nand the long/short-term representations of the corresponding time series. Our\nexperiments on several real-world datasets show that DeepDGL outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 03:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

In this study, we explore\nthe effects of extremely high diffusivity on the ocean circulation and surface\nclimate of Earth-like planets in one asynchronous rotation orbit.

We first demonstrate how a chain of spintronic resonators\ncan function as synapses and make convolutions by sequentially rectifying\nradio-frequency signals encoding consecutive sets of inputs. We show that a\nparallel implementation is possible with multiple chains of spintronic\nresonators to avoid storing intermediate computational steps in memory.

To tackle this problem, we propose a dual\nprototypical contrastive learning approach tailored to the FSS task to capture\nthe representative semanticfeatures effectively. The main idea is to encourage\nthe prototypes more discriminative by increasing inter-class distance while\nreducing intra-class distance in prototype feature space.

Observations have shown\nthat the core of eruption-productive regions are often a sheared magnetic\narcade, i.e., a single bipolar configuration, and, particularly, the\ncorresponding magnetic polarities at the photosphere are elongated along a\nstrong-gradient polarity inversion line (PIL). It remains unclear what\nmechanism triggers the eruption in a single bipolar field and why the one with\na strong PIL is eruption-productive. Recently, using high accuracy simulations,\nwe have established a fundamental mechanism of solar eruption initiation that a\nbipolar field as driven by quasi-static shearing motion at the photosphere can\nform an internal current sheet, and then fast magnetic reconnection triggers\nand drives the eruption. Here we investigate the behavior of the fundamental\nmechanism with different photospheric magnetic flux distributions, i.e.,\nmagnetograms, by combining theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Our\nstudy shows that the bipolar fields of different magnetograms, as sheared\ncontinually, all exhibit similar evolutions from the slow storage to fast\nrelease of magnetic energy in accordance with the fundamental mechanism, which\ndemonstrates the robustness of the mechanism. We further found that the\nmagnetograms with stronger PIL produce larger eruptions, and the key reason is\nthat the sheared bipolar fields with stronger PIL can achieve more\nnon-potentiality, and their internal current sheet can form at a lower height\nand with a larger current density, by which the reconnection can be more\nefficient. This also provides a viable trigger mechanism for the observed\neruptions in active region with strong PIL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 08:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

The randomized\nwork-stealing (RWS) scheduler plays a crucial role in this ecosystem. In this\npaper, we study two important topics related to the randomized work-stealing\nscheduler.\n  Our first contribution is a simplified, classroom-ready version of analysis\nfor the RWS scheduler. The theoretical efficiency of the RWS scheduler has been\nanalyzed for a variety of settings, but most of them are quite complicated. In\nthis paper, we show a new analysis, which we believe is easy to understand, and\ncan be especially useful in education. We avoid using the potential function in\nthe analysis, and we assume a highly asynchronous setting, which is more\nrealistic for today's parallel machines.\n  Our second and main contribution is some new parallel cache complexity for\nalgorithms using the RWS scheduler. Although the sequential I/O model has been\nwell-studied over the past decades, so far very few results have extended it to\nthe parallel setting. The parallel cache bounds of many existing algorithms are\naffected by a polynomial of the span, which causes a significant overhead for\nhigh-span algorithms. Our new analysis decouples the span from the analysis of\nthe parallel cache complexity. This allows us to show new parallel cache bounds\nfor a list of classic algorithms. Our results are only a polylogarithmic factor\noff the lower bounds, and significantly improve previous results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 08:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

Sparse CNNs often introduce variations in the layer shapes and\nsizes, which can prevent dense accelerators from performing well on sparse CNN\nmodels. Recently proposed sparse accelerators like SCNN, Eyeriss v2, and\nSparTen, actively exploit the two-sided or full sparsity, that is, sparsity in\nboth weights and activations, for performance gains. These accelerators,\nhowever, either have inefficient micro-architecture, which limits their\nperformance, have no support for non-unit stride convolutions and\nfully-connected (FC) layers, or suffer massively from systematic load\nimbalance. To circumvent these issues and support both sparse and dense models,\nwe propose Phantom, a multi-threaded, dynamic, and flexible neural\ncomputational core. Phantom uses sparse binary mask representation to actively\nlookahead into sparse computations, and dynamically schedule its computational\nthreads to maximize the thread utilization and throughput. We also generate a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) mesh architecture of Phantom neural computational cores,\nwhich we refer to as Phantom-2D accelerator, and propose a novel dataflow that\nsupports all layers of a CNN, including unit and non-unit stride convolutions,\nand FC layers. In addition, Phantom-2D uses a two-level load balancing strategy\nto minimize the computational idling, thereby, further improving the hardware\nutilization. To show support for different types of layers, we evaluate the\nperformance of the Phantom architecture on VGG16 and MobileNet.

Here, we go beyond the hexagonal crystals and investigate the chiral\nphonons in systems with fourfold rotational symmetry. We clarify the symmetry\nrequirements for the emergence of chiral phonons in both 2D square lattices and\n3D tetragonal lattices. For 2D, the realization of $C_4$ chiral phonons\nrequires the breaking of time-reversal symmetry; while for 3D, they can exist\non the $C_4$-invariant path in a chiral tetragonal lattice. These phonons have\nthe advantage that they can be more readily coupled with optical transitions,\nwhich facilitates their experimental detection.

Among those\nmodels, Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) give control over the generation by\nexposing latent variables, although they usually suffer from low synthesis\nquality. In this paper, we introduce a Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder\n(RAVE) allowing both fast and high-quality audio waveform synthesis. We\nintroduce a novel two-stage training procedure, namely representation learning\nand adversarial fine-tuning. We show that using a post-training analysis of the\nlatent space allows a direct control between the reconstruction fidelity and\nthe representation compactness. By leveraging a multi-band decomposition of the\nraw waveform, we show that our model is the first able to generate 48kHz audio\nsignals, while simultaneously running 20 times faster than real-time on a\nstandard laptop CPU.

Multiple versions of this basic question have been\nconsidered, and by now we know algorithms that are fast both in practice and in\ntheory. However, the rapid increase in the amount of generated and stored data\nbrings the need of designing algorithms that operate directly on compressed\nrepresentations of data. In the compressed pattern matching problem we are\ngiven a compressed representation of the text, with $n$ being the length of the\ncompressed representation and $N$ being the length of the text, and an\nuncompressed pattern of length $m$. The most challenging (and yet relevant when\nworking with highly repetitive data, say biological information) scenario is\nwhen the chosen compression method is capable of describing a string of\nexponential length (in the size of its representation). An elegant formalism\nfor such a compression method is that of straight-line programs, which are\nsimply context-free grammars describing exactly one string. While it has been\nknown that compressed pattern matching problem can be solved in $O(m+n\\log N)$\ntime for this compression method, designing a linear-time algorithm remained\nopen. We resolve this open question by presenting an $O(n+m)$ time algorithm\nthat, given a context-free grammar of size $n$ that produces a single string\n$t$ and a pattern $p$ of length $m$, decides whether $p$ occurs in $t$ as a\nsubstring.

Most of the modelling of interstellar dust infrared emission\nspectrum is done by assuming some variations around a single temperature\ngreybody approximation. For example, the foreground modelling of Planck mission\nmaps involves a unique dust temperature T along a given line-of-sight with a\nunique emissivity index \\b{eta}. The two parameters are then fitted and\ntherefore variable from one line-of-sight to the other. Aims. Our aim is to go\nbeyond that modelling in an economical way. Methods. We model the dust spectrum\nwith a temperature distribution around the mean value and show that only the\nsecond temperature moment matters. We advocate the use of the temperature\nlogarithm as the proper variable. Results. If the interstellar medium is not\ntoo heterogeneous, there is a universal analytical spectrum, which is derived\nhere, that goes beyond the greybody assumption.

Since\nbinary interaction with a stellar or planetary companion is thought to be the\nunderlying mechanism behind large-scale structures, we included the effects of\nUV radiation originating from a stellar companion in our chemical kinetics\nmodel. The one-dimensional model provides a first approximation of its effects\non the chemistry throughout the outflow. The presence of a close-by stellar\ncompanion can strongly influence the chemistry within the entire outflow. Its\nimpact depends on the intensity of the radiation (set by the stellar radius and\nblackbody temperature) and on the extinction the UV radiation experiences (set\nby the outflow density, density structure, and assumed radius of dust\nformation). Parent species can be photodissociated by the companion, initiating\na rich photon-driven chemistry in the inner parts of the outflow. The outcome\ndepends on the balance between two-body reactions and photoreactions. If\ntwo-body reactions dominate, chemical complexity within the outflow increases.\nThis can make the abundance profiles of daughters appear like those of parents,\nwith a larger inner abundance and a gaussian decline. If photoreactions\ndominate, the outflow can appear molecule-poor. We model three stellar\ncompanions. The impact of a red dwarf companion is limited. Solar-like\ncompanions show the largest effect, followed by a white dwarf. A stellar\ncompanion can also lead to the formation of unexpected species. The outflow's\nmolecular content, especially combined with abundance profiles, can indicate a\nstellar companion's presence.

How to accurately evaluate the adversarial robustness\nof DNNs is critical for their deployment in real-world applications. An ideal\nindicator of robustness is adversarial risk. Unfortunately, since it involves\nmaximizing the 0-1 loss, calculating the true risk is technically intractable.\nThe most common solution for this is to compute an approximate risk by\nreplacing the 0-1 loss with a surrogate one. Some functions have been used,\nsuch as Cross-Entropy (CE) loss and Difference of Logits Ratio (DLR) loss.\nHowever, these functions are all manually designed and may not be well suited\nfor adversarial robustness evaluation. In this paper, we leverage AutoML to\ntighten the error (gap) between the true and approximate risks. Our main\ncontributions are as follows. First, AutoLoss-AR, the first method to search\nfor surrogate losses for adversarial risk, with an elaborate search space, is\nproposed. The experimental results on 10 adversarially trained models\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method: the risks evaluated using\nthe best-discovered losses are 0.2% to 1.6% better than those evaluated using\nthe handcrafted baselines. Second, 5 surrogate losses with clean and readable\nformulas are distilled out and tested on 7 unseen adversarially trained models.\nThese losses outperform the baselines by 0.8% to 2.4%, indicating that they can\nbe used individually as some kind of new knowledge. Besides, the possible\nreasons for the better performance of these losses are explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 11:47:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 08:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

However, the magnetic\nfield can introduce other transport effects, some of which are deleterious. An\nunderstanding of these processes is thus crucial for accurate modelling of MIF.\nWe generalise past work exploiting self-similar solutions to describe transport\nprocesses in planar geometry and compare the model to the\nradiation-magnetohydrodynamics code Chimera. We solve the 1D extended MHD\nequations under pressure balance, making no assumptions about the ratio of\nmagnetic and thermal pressures in the plasma. The resulting ODE boundary value\nproblem is solved using a shooting method, combining an implicit ODE solver and\na Newton-Raphson root finder. We show that the Nernst effect dominates over\nresistive diffusion in high $\\beta$ plasma, but its significance is reduced as\nthe $\\beta$ decreases. On the other hand, we find that Ettingshausen and Ohmic\nheating effects are dominant in low $\\beta$ plasma, and can be observable in\neven order unity $\\beta$ plasma, though in the presence of a strong temperature\ngradient heat conduction remains dominant. We then present a test problem for\nthe Ohmic heating and Ettingshausen effects which will be useful to validate\ncodes modelling these effects. We also observe that the Ettingshausen effect\nplays a role in preventing temperature separation when Ohmic heating is strong.\nNeglecting this term may lead to overestimates for the electron temperature at\na vacuum-plasma interface, such as at the edge of a z-pinch.

Traditional news recommendation methods usually use\nsingle news information, which is insufficient to encode news and user\nrepresentation. Recent research uses multiple channel news information, e.g.,\ntitle, category, and body, to enhance news and user representation. However,\nthese methods only use various attention mechanisms to fuse multi-view\nembeddings without considering deep digging higher-level information contained\nin the context. These methods encode news content on the word level and jointly\ntrain the attention parameters in the recommendation network, leading to more\ncorpora being required to train the model. We propose an Event Extraction-based\nNews Recommendation (EENR) framework to overcome these shortcomings, utilizing\nevent extraction to abstract higher-level information. EENR also uses a\ntwo-stage strategy to reduce parameters in subsequent parts of the\nrecommendation network. We train the Event Extraction module by external\ncorpora in the first stage and apply the trained model to the news\nrecommendation dataset to predict event-level information, including event\ntypes, roles, and arguments, in the second stage. Then we fuse multiple channel\ninformation, including event information, news title, and category, to encode\nnews and users.

Several defense methods have been developed to detect\nmalicious samples, with the common assumption that the latent representations\nof benign and malicious samples extracted by the infected model exhibit\ndifferent distributions. However, a comprehensive study on the distributional\ndifferences is missing. In this paper, we investigate such differences\nthoroughly via answering three questions: 1) What are the characteristics of\nthe distributional differences? 2) How can they be effectively reduced? 3) What\nimpact does this reduction have on difference-based defense methods? First, the\ndistributional differences of multi-level representations on the regularly\ntrained backdoored models are verified to be significant by introducing Maximum\nMean Discrepancy (MMD), Energy Distance (ED), and Sliced Wasserstein Distance\n(SWD) as the metrics. Then, ML-MMDR, a difference reduction method that adds\nmulti-level MMD regularization into the loss, is proposed, and its\neffectiveness is testified on three typical difference-based defense methods.\nAcross all the experimental settings, the F1 scores of these methods drop from\n90%-100% on the regularly trained backdoored models to 60%-70% on the models\ntrained with ML-MMDR.

We examine and compare\ndifferent possible ways of assigning temperatures to energies or equivalently\nto eigenstates in such systems. A commonly used assignment of temperature in\nthe context of thermalization is based on the canonical energy-temperature\nrelationship, which depends only on energy eigenvalues and not on the structure\nof eigenstates. For eigenstates, we consider defining temperature by minimizing\nthe distance between (full or reduced) eigenstate density matrices and\ncanonical density matrices. We show that for full eigenstates, the minimizing\ntemperature depends on the distance measure chosen and matches the canonical\ntemperature for the trace distance; however, the two matrices are not close.\nWith reduced density matrices, the minimizing temperature has fluctuations that\nscale with subsystem and system size but appears to be independent of distance\nmeasure.

This paper focuses on\ndynamic attack trees and their min time metric, i.e. the minimal time to attack\na system. For general attack trees, calculating min time efficiently is an open\nproblem, with the fastest current method being enumerating all minimal attacks,\nwhich is NP-hard. This paper presents three tools for calculating min time.\nFirst, we introduce a novel method for general dynamic attack trees based on\nmixed integer linear programming. Second, we show how the computation can be\nsped up by identifying the modules of an attack tree, i.e. subtrees connected\nto the rest of the attack tree via only one node. Finally, we define a general\nsemantics for dynamic attack trees that significantly relaxes the restrictions\non attack trees compared to earlier work, allowing us to apply our methods to a\nwide variety of attack trees. Experiments on both a case study of a server\ncluster and a synthetic testing set of large attack trees verify that both the\ninteger linear programming approach and modular analysis considerably decrease\nthe computation time of attack time analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 13:04:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 09:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Once the\nimage is downscaled, it is difficult to be reconstructed via upscaling due to\nthe loss of information. To make these two processes more compatible and\nimprove the reconstruction performance, some efforts model them as a joint\nencoding-decoding task, with the constraint that the downscaled (i.e. encoded)\nlow-resolution (LR) image must preserve the original visual appearance. To\nimplement this constraint, most methods guide the downscaling module by\nsupervising it with the bicubically downscaled LR version of the original\nhigh-resolution (HR) image. However, this bicubic LR guidance may be suboptimal\nfor the subsequent upscaling (i.e. decoding) and restrict the final\nreconstruction performance. In this paper, instead of directly applying the LR\nguidance, we propose an additional invertible flow guidance module (FGM), which\ncan transform the downscaled representation to the visually plausible image\nduring downscaling and transform it back during upscaling. Benefiting from the\ninvertibility of FGM, the downscaled representation could get rid of the LR\nguidance and would not disturb the downscaling-upscaling process. It allows us\nto remove the restrictions on the downscaling module and optimize the\ndownscaling and upscaling modules in an end-to-end manner. In this way, these\ntwo modules could cooperate to maximize the HR reconstruction performance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve\nstate-of-the-art (SotA) performance on both downscaled and reconstructed\nimages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 13:17:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2023 11:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

We propose a hybrid tracking system for mobile devices that\nprovides lightweight tracking with 6 Degrees of Freedom and hides the\noffloading latency from users' perception. A practical, reliable and unreliable\ncommunication mechanism is used to achieve fast response and consistency of\ncrucial information. We also propose a multi-object image retrieval pipeline\nthat executes fast and accurate image recognition tasks on the cloud and edge\nservers. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of\nEdgeXAR by building mobile AR Apps upon it. Regarding the Quality of Experience\n(QoE), the mobile AR Apps powered by EdgeXAR framework run on average at the\nspeed of 30 frames per second with precise tracking of only 1~2 pixel errors\nand accurate image recognition of at least 97% accuracy. As compared to\nVuforia, one of the leading commercial AR frameworks, EdgeXAR transmits 87%\nless data while providing a stable 30 FPS performance and reducing the\noffloading latency by 50 to 70% depending on the transmission medium. Our work\nfacilitates the large-scale deployment of AR as the next generation of\nubiquitous interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 14:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

Using these custom models we revisit the presence\nof the common uncorrelated red noise signal previously reported in the EPTA DR2\nand show that the data still supports it with a high statistical significance.\nNext, we confirm that there is no preference for or against the Hellings-Downs\nspatial correlations expected for the stochastic gravitational-wave background.\nThe main conclusion of the EPTA DR2 paper remains unchanged despite a very\nsignificant change in the noise model of each pulsar. However, modelling the\nnoise is essential for the robust detection of gravitational waves and its\nimpact could be significant when analysing the next EPTA data release, which\nwill include a larger number of pulsars and more precise measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 14:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

The layers of a DNN can be mapped onto different nodes located\nin the cloud, edge and shop floor for preserving privacy. The quality of the\ndata that is fed into and processed through the DNN is of utmost importance for\ncritical tasks, such as inspection and quality control. Distributed Data\nValidation Networks (DDVNs) are used to validate the quality of the data.\nHowever, they are prone to single points of failure when an attack occurs. This\npaper proposes QUDOS, an approach that enhances the security of a distributed\nDNN that is supported by DDVNs using quorums. The proposed approach allows\nindividual nodes that are corrupted due to an attack to be detected or excluded\nwhen the DNN produces an output. Metrics such as corruption factor and success\nprobability of an attack are considered for evaluating the security aspects of\nDNNs. A simulation study demonstrates that if the number of corrupted nodes is\nless than a given threshold for decision-making in a quorum, the QUDOS approach\nalways prevents attacks. Furthermore, the study shows that increasing the size\nof the quorum has a better impact on security than increasing the number of\nlayers. One merit of QUDOS is that it enhances the security of DNNs without\nrequiring any modifications to the algorithm and can therefore be applied to\nother classes of problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 15:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

We argue that the standard practice of adopting an exponential\nmodel for the disk all the way to its center is inadequate because it\nimplicitly neglects the fact of star formation (SF) quenching (SFQ) in the\ncenters of LTGs. Extrapolating the fit for the observable star-forming zone of\nthe disk (outside the bulge) inwardly overestimates the true surface brightness\nof the disk in its SF-quenched central zone. We refer to this effect as Dio.\nThe primary consequence of the neglect of Dio in bulge-disk decomposition\nstudies is the oversubtraction of the disk underneath the bulge, leading to a\nsystematic underestimation of the luminosity of the latter. Framed in the\npicture of galaxy downsizing and inside-out SFQ, Dio is expected to\ndifferentially impact galaxies across redshift and stellar mass M*, thus\nleading to systematic and complex biases in the scatter and slope of various\ngalaxy scaling relations. We conjecture that correction for Dio will lead to a\ndownbending of the bulge vs. super-massive black hole (SMBH) relation for\ngalaxies below log(M*/Msolar)~10.7. A decreasing M(SMBH)/M* ratio with\ndecreasing M* would help consistently explain the scarcity and weakness of\naccretion-powered nuclear activity in low-mass spiral galaxies.

By taking\ninto account the physical limitation of the surface in the stabilization trend,\na more advanced level of reliability is achieved that provides higher\nfunctionalities such as push recovery on low-friction surfaces and prevents the\nstabilizer from overreacting.

To overcome the\npotential time instability, we considered using the Burton--Miller-type\nboundary integral equation (BMBIE) instead of the ordinary boundary integral\nequation (OBIE), which consists of the single- and double-layer potentials. In\naddition, we introduced a smooth temporal basis, i.e. the B-spline temporal\nbasis of order $d$, whereas $d=1$ was used together with the OBIE in a previous\nstudy [Takahashi 2014]. Corresponding to these new techniques, we generalised\nthe interpolation-based fast multipole method that was developed in\n\\cite{takahashi2014}. In particular, we constructed the multipole-to-local\nformula (M2L) so that even for $d\\ge 2$ we can maintain the computational\ncomplexity of the entire algorithm, i.e. $O(N_{\\rm s}^{1+\\delta} N_{\\rm t})$,\nwhere $N_{\\rm s}$ and $N_{\\rm t}$ denote the number of boundary elements and\nthe number of time steps, respectively, and $\\delta$ is theoretically estimated\nas $1/3$ or $1/2$. The numerical examples indicated that the BMBIE is\nindispensable for solving the homogeneous Dirichlet problem, but the order $d$\ncannot exceed 1 owing to the doubtful cancellation of significant digits when\ncalculating the corresponding layer potentials. In regard to the homogeneous\nNeumann problem, the previous TDBEM based on the OBIE with $d=1$ can be\nunstable, whereas it was found that the BMBIE with $d=2$ can be stable and\naccurate. The present study will enhance the usefulness of the TDBEM for 3D\nscalar wave problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 15:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Following\nthe blockage of a coronary artery, the regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA)\nof the ischemic myocardial segments is the earliest change to set in.\nEchocardiography is the fundamental tool to assess any RWMA. Assessing the\nmotion of the left ventricle (LV) wall only from a single echocardiography view\nmay lead to missing the diagnosis of MI as the RWMA may not be visible on that\nspecific view. Therefore, in this study, we propose to fuse apical 4-chamber\n(A4C) and apical 2-chamber (A2C) views in which a total of 12 myocardial\nsegments can be analyzed for MI detection. The proposed method first estimates\nthe motion of the LV wall by Active Polynomials (APs), which extract and track\nthe endocardial boundary to compute myocardial segment displacements. The\nfeatures are extracted from the A4C and A2C view displacements, which are\nconcatenated and fed into the classifiers to detect MI. The main contributions\nof this study are 1) creation of a new benchmark dataset by including both A4C\nand A2C views in a total of 260 echocardiography recordings, which is publicly\nshared with the research community, 2) improving the performance of the prior\nwork of threshold-based APs by a Machine Learning based approach, and 3) a\npioneer MI detection approach via multi-view echocardiography by fusing the\ninformation of A4C and A2C views. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod achieves 90.91% sensitivity and 86.36% precision for MI detection over\nmulti-view echocardiography.
