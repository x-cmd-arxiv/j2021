In\nour work, we propose instead, to refine the mined bitexts via automatic\nediting: given a sentence in a language xf, and a possibly imperfect\ntranslation of it xe, our model generates a revised version xf' or xe' that\nyields a more equivalent translation pair (i.e., <xf, xe'> or <xf', xe>).

As a matter of fact, maintaining a reduced thermal budget\nthroughout all processing steps of GeSn devices is essential to avoid possible\nmaterial degradation. This constraint is exacerbated by the need for higher Sn\ncontents along with an enhanced strain relaxation to achieve efficient\nmid-infrared devices. Herein, as a low thermal budget solution for post-epitaxy\nprocessing, we elucidate the effects of laser thermal annealing (LTA) on\nstrain-relaxed Ge$_{0.89}$Sn0$_{.11}$ layers and Ni-Ge$_{0.89}$Sn0$_{.11}$\ncontacts. Key diffusion and recrystallization processes are proposed and\ndiscussed in the light of systematic microstructural studies. LTA treatment at\na fluence of 0.40 J/cm2 results in a 200-300 nm-thick layer where Sn atoms\nsegregate toward the surface and in the formation of Sn-rich columnar\nstructures in the LTA-affected region. These structures are reminiscent to\nthose observed in the dislocation-assisted pipe-diffusion mechanism, while the\nburied GeSn layers remain intact. Moreover, by tailoring the LTA fluence, the\ncontact resistance can be reduced without triggering phase separation across\nthe whole GeSn multi-layer stacking. Indeed, a one order of magnitude decrease\nin the Ni-based specific contact resistance was obtained at the highest LTA\nfluence, thus confirming the potential of this method for the functionalization\nof direct bandgap GeSn materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 16:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

In terms of circuit\ncomplexity, FOE- and FO(RPR)-rewritability guarantee answering OMQs in uniform\nAC0 and NC1, respectively.\n  We proceed in three steps. First, we define a hierarchy of 2D DL-Lite/LTL\nontology languages and investigate the FO-rewritability of OMQs with atomic\nqueries by constructing projections onto 1D LTL OMQs and employing recent\nresults on the FO-rewritability of propositional LTL OMQs. As the projections\ninvolve deciding consistency of ontologies and data, we also consider the\nconsistency problem for our languages. While the undecidability of consistency\nfor 2D ontology languages with expressive Boolean role inclusions might be\nexpected, we also show that, rather surprisingly, the restriction to Krom and\nHorn role inclusions leads to decidability (and ExpSpace-completeness), even if\none admits full Booleans on concepts. As a final step, we lift some of the\nrewritability results for atomic OMQs to OMQs with expressive positive temporal\ninstance queries. The lifting results are based on an in-depth study of the\ncanonical models and only concern Horn ontologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 16:38:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 11:10:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 11:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

However, TTVs can also act as a detection bias that\ncan prevent the detection of small planets in transit surveys that would\notherwise be detected by standard algorithms such as the Boxed Least Square\nalgorithm (BLS) if their orbit was not perturbed. This bias is especially\npresent for surveys with a long baseline, such as Kepler, some of the TESS\nsectors, and the upcoming PLATO mission. Here we introduce a detection method\nthat is robust to large TTVs, and illustrate its use by recovering and\nconfirming a pair of resonant super-Earths with ten-hour TTVs around\nKepler-1705. The method is based on a neural network trained to recover the\ntracks of low-signal-to-noise-ratio(S/N) perturbed planets in river diagrams.\nWe recover the transit parameters of these candidates by fitting the light\ncurve. The individual transit S/N of Kepler-1705b and c are about three times\nlower than all the previously known planets with TTVs of 3 hours or more,\npushing the boundaries in the recovery of these small, dynamically active\nplanets. Recovering this type of object is essential for obtaining a complete\npicture of the observed planetary systems, and solving for a bias not often\ntaken into account in statistical studies of exoplanet populations. In\naddition, TTVs are a means of obtaining mass estimates which can be essential\nfor studying the internal structure of planets discovered by transit surveys.\nFinally, we show that due to the strong orbital perturbations, it is possible\nthat the spin of the outer resonant planet of Kepler-1705 is trapped in a sub-\nor super-synchronous spin-orbit resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 17:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-15"}

As an alternative method to existing approaches that rely on\nstandard data augmentations or model regularization, APA alleviates overfitting\nby employing the generator itself to augment the real data distribution with\ngenerated images, which deceives the discriminator adaptively. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of APA in improving synthesis quality\nin the low-data regime.

Hence, knowledge base completion (KBC) on temporal knowledge\nbases (TKB), where each statement \\textit{may} be associated with a temporal\nscope, has attracted growing attention. Prior works assume that each statement\nin a TKB \\textit{must} be associated with a temporal scope. This ignores the\nfact that the scoping information is commonly missing in a KB. Thus prior work\nis typically incapable of handling generic use cases where a TKB is composed of\ntemporal statements with/without a known temporal scope. In order to address\nthis issue, we establish a new knowledge base embedding framework, called\nTIME2BOX, that can deal with atemporal and temporal statements of different\ntypes simultaneously. Our main insight is that answers to a temporal query\nalways belong to a subset of answers to a time-agnostic counterpart. Put\ndifferently, time is a filter that helps pick out answers to be correct during\ncertain periods. We introduce boxes to represent a set of answer entities to a\ntime-agnostic query. The filtering functionality of time is modeled by\nintersections over these boxes. In addition, we generalize current evaluation\nprotocols on time interval prediction. We describe experiments on two datasets\nand show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods\non both link prediction and time prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 18:17:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-15"}

Then Moseley\nand Wang [2017] considered the dual of Dasgupta's objective function for\nsimilarity-based weights and showed that both random partitioning and average\nlinkage have approximation ratio $1/3$ which has been improved in a series of\nworks to $0.585$ [Alon et al. 2020].

How dust forms\nin such quantities remains poorly understood; theories of dust formation\npredict lower total masses and much faster formation rates than observations\nimply. One suggestion to reconcile observations and theory was made by Dwek et\nal. (2019), who proposed that the dust forms very rapidly, and because of its\noptical depth, is not initially observationally detectable, only being\ngradually revealed as the ejecta expand. Observational dust masses at early\ntimes would then only be lower limits. Using a large grid of radiative transfer\nmodels covering dust masses from 10$^{-4}$ to 1M$_\\odot$ to calculate both the\nspectral energy distribution and the emission line profiles from clumpy dust\nshells, we show that this cannot be the case. Some clump distributions allow\ndust masses of $\\sim$0.01 M$_\\odot$ to be concealed in clumps and still predict\nan SED consistent with the observations. However, these geometries predict\nemission line profiles which are inconsistent with the observations. Similarly,\nclump geometries which reproduce the observed emission line profiles with dust\nmasses >0.01 M$_\\odot$ do not reproduce the SED. However, models with\n$\\sim$10$^{-3}$ M$_\\odot$ of amorphous carbon can reproduce both the SED and\nthe emission line profiles. We conclude that no large masses of dust can be\nhidden from view in the ejecta of SN 1987A at early epochs, and that the\nmajority of dust must thus have formed at epochs >1000 days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Therefore we examine the effect of\nsingularly perturbing the problem by adding the structure perimeter to the\ncost. For a uniaxial and a shear load in two space dimensions, corresponding\nenergy scaling laws were already derived in the literature. This work now\nderives the scaling law for the case of a uniaxial load in three space\ndimensions, which can be considered the simplest three-dimensional setting.

In\nrecent years, the interest in confined fluids has grown, driven by research on\nunconventional hydrocarbon resources -- shale gas and shale oil, much of which\nare confined in nanopores. When fluids are confined in nanopores, many of their\nproperties differ from those of the same fluid in the bulk. These properties\ninclude density, freezing point, transport coefficients, thermal expansion\ncoefficient, and elastic properties. The elastic moduli of a fluid confined in\nthe pores contribute to the overall elasticity of the fluid-saturated porous\nmedium and determine the speed at which elastic waves traverse through the\nmedium. Wave propagation in fluid-saturated porous media is pivotal for\ngeophysics, as elastic waves are used for characterization of formations and\nrock samples. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of experimental\nworks on wave propagation in fluid-saturated nanoporous media, as well as\ntheoretical works focused on calculation of compressibility of fluids in\nconfinement. We discuss models that bridge the gap between experiments and\ntheory, revealing a number of open questions that are both fundamental and\napplied in nature.

Therefore, there is a demand for\nthe combined experimental-modeling studies on porous samples with various\ncharacteristic pore sizes.

When evaluating an\nRPQ, the evaluation of a Kleene closure (i.e., Kleene plus or Kleene star) is\nvery expensive. Furthermore, when multiple RPQs include a Kleene closure as a\ncommon sub-query, repeated evaluations of the common sub-query cause serious\nperformance degradation. In this paper, we present a novel concept of RPQ-based\ngraph reduction, which significantly simplifies the original graph through\nedge-level and vertex-level reductions. Interestingly, RPQ-based graph\nreduction can replace the evaluation of the Kleene closure on the large\noriginal graph to that of the transitive closure to the small reduced graph. We\nthen propose a reduced transitive closure (RTC) as a lightweight structure for\nefficiently sharing the result of a Kleene closure. We also present an RPQ\nevaluation algorithm, RTCSharing, which treats each clause in the disjunctive\nnormal form of the given RPQ as a batch unit. If the batch units include a\nKleene closure as a common sub-query, we share the lightweight RTC instead of\nthe heavyweight result of the Kleene closure. RPQ-based graph reduction further\nenables us to formally represent the result of an RPQ including a Kleene\nclosure as a relational algebra expression including the RTC. Through the\nformal expression, we optimize the evaluation of the batch unit by eliminating\nuseless and redundant operations of the previous method. Experiments show that\nRTCSharing improves the performance significantly by up to 73.86 times compared\nwith existing methods in terms of query response time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 19:53:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 19:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

A prominent\nframework for addressing such control problems is Optimal Feedback Control\n(OFC). OFC generates control actions that optimize behaviorally relevant\ncriteria by integrating noisy sensory stimuli and the predictions of an\ninternal model using the Kalman filter or its extensions. However, a\nsatisfactory neural model of Kalman filtering and control is lacking because\nexisting proposals have the following limitations: not considering the delay of\nsensory feedback, training in alternating phases, and requiring knowledge of\nthe noise covariance matrices, as well as that of systems dynamics. Moreover,\nthe majority of these studies considered Kalman filtering in isolation, and not\njointly with control. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel\nonline algorithm which combines adaptive Kalman filtering with a model free\ncontrol approach (i.e., policy gradient algorithm). We implement this algorithm\nin a biologically plausible neural network with local synaptic plasticity\nrules. This network performs system identification and Kalman filtering,\nwithout the need for multiple phases with distinct update rules or the\nknowledge of the noise covariances. It can perform state estimation with\ndelayed sensory feedback, with the help of an internal model. It learns the\ncontrol policy without requiring any knowledge of the dynamics, thus avoiding\nthe need for weight transport. In this way, our implementation of OFC solves\nthe credit assignment problem needed to produce the appropriate sensory-motor\ncontrol in the presence of stimulus delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 20:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

Both fields\nhave grappled to understand over-trust and trust calibration, as well as how to\nmeasure trust expectations, risk, and vulnerability. This paper presents\ninitial steps in closing the gap between these fields. Using insights and\nexperimental findings from interdependence theory and social psychology, this\nwork starts by analyzing a large game theory competition data set to\ndemonstrate that the strongest predictors for a wide variety of human-human\ntrust interactions are the interdependence-derived variables for commitment and\ntrust that we have developed.

We thus operationalize irrationality in the\nlanguage of MDPs, by altering the Bellman optimality equation, and use this\nframework to study how these alterations would affect inference.\n  We find that wrongly modeling a systematically irrational human as\nnoisy-rational performs a lot worse than correctly capturing these biases -- so\nmuch so that it can be better to skip inference altogether and stick to the\nprior! More importantly, we show that an irrational human, when correctly\nmodelled, can communicate more information about the reward than a perfectly\nrational human can. That is, if a robot has the correct model of a human's\nirrationality, it can make an even stronger inference than it ever could if the\nhuman were rational.

We find that thin drops experience compressive elastic stresses but\nthe total in-plane stresses are tensile. The mechanical response of the drop is\ndictated by the initial profile of the solid skeleton, which controls the\nin-plane deformation, the dominant components of elastic stress, and sets a\nlimit on the depth of delamination that can potentially occur. Our theory\nsuggests that the alignment of desiccation fractures in colloidal drops is\nselected by the shape of the drop at the point of gelation. We propose that the\nemergence of three distinct fracture patterns in dried blood drops is a\nconsequence of a non-monotonic drop profile at gelation. We also show that\ndepletion fronts, which separate wet and dry solid, can invade the drop from\nthe contact line and localise the generation of mechanical stress during\ndrying.

Owing to its concrete connections with Gr\\\"obner basis theory,\nas well as its applicability in several areas like computational complexity,\ncombinatorial geometry, and coding theory, an important line of enquiry is to\nunderstand the affine Hilbert function of structured sets of points in the\naffine space.\n  In this work, we determine the affine Hilbert function (over the reals) of\narbitrary unions of layers of points in a uniform grid (a finite grid with the\ncomponent sets having equispaced points), where each layer of points is\ndetermined by a fixed sum of components for all the points. This extends a\nresult of Bernasconi and Egidi (Inf. Comput. 1999) from the Boolean cube\nsetting to the uniform grid setting.\n  Our proofs follow a similar outline as that of Bernasconi and Egidi. However,\nthere are two bottlenecks that arise in the uniform grid setting. We resolve\nthese by using (i) a classical fact that a symmetric Jordan basis exists for\nthe function space on a uniform grid, and (ii) an extension to multisets of an\nalgebraic interpretation by Friedl and R\\'onyai (Discrete Math. 2003) of the\nnotion of order shattering.\n  The affine Hilbert function is, in fact, a stronger notion than the\nfinite-degree Zariski closure, which is yet another important tool in the\npolynomial method toolkit. We conclude by giving an alternative proof of a\ncombinatorial characterization of a variant of finite-degree Zariski closures,\nfor unions of layers in uniform grids, obtained in an earlier work of the\nauthor (arXiv, 2021).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 23:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

We show analytically that, under weak field excitation\nrelevant to natural photosynthesis conditions, an N-photon Fock state input and\na corresponding coherent state input give rise to equal density matrices in the\nexcited manifold.

In particular, we are interested in whether\nthis roughness reduction is caused by the microplastics as floating particles,\nor by the surfactants which follow similar transport paths as microplastics.\nFor this purpose, we experimentally test the effects of floating particles and\nsurfactants on surface roughness, quantified by the mean square slope (MSS),\nwith waves generated by a mechanical wave maker or by wind. For microplastics,\nwe find that their effect on wave energy and MSS critically depends on the\nsurface area fraction of coverage, irrespective of the particle sizes in the\ntest range. The damping by particles is observed only for fractions above\n$O(5-10\\%)$, which is much higher than the realistic ocean condition. For\nsurfactants, their damping effect on mechanically generated irregular waves\ngenerally increases with the concentration of surfactants, but no optimal\nconcentration corresponding to maximum damping is observed, in contrast to\nprevious studies based on monochromatic waves. In wind-wave experiments, the\npresence of surfactants suppresses the wave generation, due to the combined\neffects of reduced wind shear stress and increased wave damping.

Quantization creates random noise. As a way to compensate\nfor this noise, during training, we propose to quantize some weights while\nkeeping others in floating-point precision.

The pulsar is known to exhibit subpulse\ndrifting, mode changing, and nulling. Our observations reveal four distinct\nsub-pulse drifting modes of emission (A, B, C, and D) for this pulsar, with the\ndrift periodicities of 17.9 $P_1$, 5.8 $P_1$, 8 $P_1$, 14.1 $P_1$, respectively\n(where $P_1$ is the pulsar rotation period), two of which exhibit some new\nfeatures that were not reported in the previous studies. We also investigate\nthe possible spark configuration, characterised by the number of sparks ($n$)\nin the carousel patterns of these four drift modes, and our analysis suggests\ntwo representative solutions for the number of sparks for a carousel rotation\nperiod, $P_4$, which lies in the range of $13$ to $16$. The large frequency\ncoverage of our data (300-750 MHz) is also leveraged to explore the frequency\ndependence of single-pulse characteristics of the pulsar emission, particularly\nthe frequency-dependent subpulse behaviour and the emission heights for the\nobserved drift modes. Our analysis suggests a clear modal dependence of\ninferred emission heights. We discuss the implications for the pulsar emission\nmechanism and its relation to the proposed spark configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 06:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

However, initial\nlogic locking techniques were vulnerable to the Boolean satisfiability\n(SAT)-based attacks. In response, researchers proposed various SAT-resistant\nlocking techniques such as point function-based locking and symmetric\ninterconnection (SAT-hard) obfuscation. We focus on the latter since point\nfunction-based locking suffers from various structural vulnerabilities. The\nSAT-hard logic locking technique, InterLock [1], achieves a unified logic and\nrouting obfuscation that thwarts state-of-the-art attacks on logic locking. In\nthis work, we propose a novel link prediction-based attack, UNTANGLE, that\nsuccessfully breaks InterLock in an oracle-less setting without having access\nto an activated IC (oracle). Since InterLock hides selected timing paths in\nkey-controlled routing blocks, UNTANGLE reveals the gates and interconnections\nhidden in the routing blocks upon formulating this task as a link prediction\nproblem. The intuition behind our approach is that ICs contain a large amount\nof repetition and reuse cores. Hence, UNTANGLE can infer the hidden timing\npaths by learning the composition of gates in the observed locked netlist or a\ncircuit library leveraging graph neural networks. We show that circuits\nwithstanding SAT-based and other attacks can be unlocked in seconds with 100%\nprecision using UNTANGLE in an oracle-less setting.

Thus, it is necessary to\nstudy the different regression slopes at different quantiles, especially in\nsituations where the quantile coefficients share some common feature.

The\npaper also analyses which texts provide better keywords like positive sentences\nor all sentences of the document. From the unsupervised algorithms, YAKE,\nTopicRank, MultipartiteRank, and KPMiner are employed for keyword extraction.\nFrom the supervised algorithms, KEA and WINGNUS are employed for keyword\nextraction. To assess the similarity of the extracted keywords with\nexpert-provided keywords, Jaccard, Cosine, and Cosine with word vector\nsimilarity indexes are employed in this study. The experiment shows that the\nMultipartiteRank keyword extraction technique measured with cosine with word\nvector similarity index produces the best result with 92% similarity with\nexpert provided keywords. This study can help the NLP researchers working with\nthe EDLC domain or recommender systems to select more suitable keyword\nextraction and similarity index calculation techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 08:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

Typically, a human\nteaching strategy would involve assessing a student's knowledge progress for\ntailoring the teaching materials in a way that enhances the learning progress.\nA human teacher would achieve this by tracing a student's knowledge over\nimportant learning concepts in a task. Albeit, such teaching strategy is not\nwell exploited yet in machine learning as current machine teaching methods tend\nto directly assess the progress on individual training samples without paying\nattention to the underlying learning concepts in a learning task. In this\npaper, we propose a novel method, called Knowledge Augmented Data Teaching\n(KADT), which can optimize a data teaching strategy for a student model by\ntracing its knowledge progress over multiple learning concepts in a learning\ntask. Specifically, the KADT method incorporates a knowledge tracing model to\ndynamically capture the knowledge progress of a student model in terms of\nlatent learning concepts. Then we develop an attention pooling mechanism to\ndistill knowledge representations of a student model with respect to class\nlabels, which enables to develop a data teaching strategy on critical training\nsamples. We have evaluated the performance of the KADT method on four different\nmachine learning tasks including knowledge tracing, sentiment analysis, movie\nrecommendation, and image classification. The results comparing to the\nstate-of-the-art methods empirically validate that KADT consistently\noutperforms others on all tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 10:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

Once only a conceptual idea to solve physics simulations, quantum\ncomputation is today a reality, with numerous machines able to execute quantum\nalgorithms. One of the hardest challenges in quantum computing is reliability.\nQubits are highly sensitive to noise, which can make the output useless.\nMoreover, lately it has been shown that superconducting qubits are extremely\nsusceptible to external sources of faults, such as ionizing radiation. When\nadopted in large scale, radiation-induced errors are expected to become a\nserious challenge for qubits reliability. In this paper, we propose an\nevaluation of the impact of transient faults in the execution of quantum\ncircuits. Inspired by the Architectural and Program Vulnerability Factors,\nwidely adopted to characterize the reliability of classical computing\narchitectures and algorithms, we propose the Quantum Vulnerability Factor (QVF)\nas a metric to measure the impact that the corruption of a qubit has on the\ncircuit output probability distribution. First, we model faults based on the\nlatest studies on real machines and recently performed radiation experiments.\nThen, we design a quantum fault injector, built over Qiskit, and characterize\nthe propagation of faults in quantum circuits. We report the finding of more\nthan 15,000,000 fault injections, evaluating the reliability of three quantum\ncircuits and identifying the faults and qubits that are more likely than others\nto impact the output. With our results, we give guidelines on how to map the\nqubits in the real quantum computer to reduce the output error and to reduce\nthe probability of having a radiation-induced corruption to modify the output.\nFinally, we compare the simulation results with experiments on physical quantum\ncomputers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 10:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

To combat these attacks, security practitioners\nactively summarize and exchange their knowledge about attacks across\norganizations in the form of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports. However,\nas CTI reports written in natural language texts are not structured for\nautomatic analysis, the report usage requires tedious manual efforts of cyber\nthreat intelligence recovery. Additionally, individual reports typically cover\nonly a limited aspect of attack patterns (techniques) and thus are insufficient\nto provide a comprehensive view of attacks with multiple variants. To take\nadvantage of threat intelligence delivered by CTI reports, we propose AttacKG\nto automatically extract structured attack behavior graphs from CTI reports and\nidentify the adopted attack techniques. We then aggregate cyber threat\nintelligence across reports to collect different aspects of techniques and\nenhance attack behavior graphs into technique knowledge graphs (TKGs). In our\nevaluation against 1,515 real-world CTI reports from diverse intelligence\nsources, AttacKG effectively identifies 28,262 attack techniques with 8,393\nunique Indicators of Compromises (IoCs). To further verify the accuracy of\nAttacKG in extracting threat intelligence, we run AttacKG on 16 manually\nlabeled CTI reports.

In this paper, a system for speech emotion recognition (SER) based on\nspeech signal is proposed, which uses new techniques in different stages of\nprocessing. The system consists of three stages: feature extraction, feature\nselection, and finally feature classification. In the first stage, a complex\nset of long-term statistics features is extracted from both the speech signal\nand the glottal-waveform signal using a combination of new and diverse features\nsuch as prosodic, spectral, and spectro-temporal features. One of the\nchallenges of the SER systems is to distinguish correlated emotions. These\nfeatures are good discriminators for speech emotions and increase the SER's\nability to recognize similar and different emotions. This feature vector with a\nlarge number of dimensions naturally has redundancy. In the second stage, using\nclassical feature selection techniques as well as a new quantum-inspired\ntechnique to reduce the feature vector dimensionality, the number of feature\nvector dimensions is reduced. In the third stage, the optimized feature vector\nis classified by a weighted deep sparse extreme learning machine (ELM)\nclassifier. The classifier performs classification in three steps: sparse\nrandom feature learning, orthogonal random projection using the singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) technique, and discriminative classification in the last\nstep using the generalized Tikhonov regularization technique. Also, many\nexisting emotional datasets suffer from the problem of data imbalanced\ndistribution, which in turn increases the classification error and decreases\nsystem performance. In this paper, a new weighting method has also been\nproposed to deal with class imbalance, which is more efficient than existing\nweighting methods. The proposed method is evaluated on three standard emotional\ndatabases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 11:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

An\nexperimental energy resolution of $\\approx 70$ keV (FWHM) was attained,\nrevealing fine structure in the excitation-energy region of the ISGMR. The IS0\nstrength distributions in the nuclei studied were obtained with the\nDifference-of-Spectrum (DoS) technique. The theoretical comparison is based on\nthe quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) with a representative set\nof Skyrme forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 12:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

For\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), the increasing electron correlation\neffect can induce the ferrovalley (FV) to half-valley-metal (HVM) to quantum\nanomalous Hall (QAH) to HVM to FV transitions.

The HVM state is at the boundary of the QAH phase, whose carriers are\nintrinsically 100\\% valley polarized. With the in-plane magnetic anisotropy, no\nspecial QAH states and prominent valley polarization are observed. However, for\nboth out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic anisotropy, sign-reversible Berry\ncurvature can be observed with increasing $U$.

However, current approaches for unsupervised\nobject-centric scene representation are incapable of aggregating information\nfrom multiple observations of a scene. As a result, these \"single-view\" methods\nform their representations of a 3D scene based only on a single 2D observation\n(view). Naturally, this leads to several inaccuracies, with these methods\nfalling victim to single-view spatial ambiguities. To address this, we propose\nThe Multi-View and Multi-Object Network (MulMON) -- a method for learning\naccurate, object-centric representations of multi-object scenes by leveraging\nmultiple views. In order to sidestep the main technical difficulty of the\nmulti-object-multi-view scenario -- maintaining object correspondences across\nviews -- MulMON iteratively updates the latent object representations for a\nscene over multiple views. To ensure that these iterative updates do indeed\naggregate spatial information to form a complete 3D scene understanding, MulMON\nis asked to predict the appearance of the scene from novel viewpoints during\ntraining. Through experiments, we show that MulMON better-resolves spatial\nambiguities than single-view methods -- learning more accurate and disentangled\nobject representations -- and also achieves new functionality in predicting\nobject segmentations for novel viewpoints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 13:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

A conventional\nsuperconductor is a perfect diamagnet expelling magnetic fields out of its\nvolume, a phenomenon known as Meissner effect. Here, we show that the simple\nadsorption of a monolayer of chiral molecules, which are non-magnetic in\nsolution, onto the surface of a conventional superconductor can markedly change\nits diamagnetic Meissner response. By measuring the internal magnetic field\nprofile in superconducting Nb thin films under an applied transverse field by\nlow-energy muon spin rotation spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the local field\nprofile inside Nb is considerably modified upon molecular adsorption in a way\nthat also depends on the applied field direction. The modification is not\nlimited to the chiral molecules/Nb interface, but it is long ranged and occurs\nover a length scale comparable to the superconducting coherence length.\nZero-field muon spin spectroscopy measurements in combination with our\ntheoretical analysis show that odd-frequency spin-triplet states induced by the\nchiral molecules are responsible for the modification of the Meissner response\nobserved inside Nb. These results indicate that a chiral\nmolecules/superconductor system supports odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs due\nto the molecules acting as a spin active layer and therefore they imply that\nsuch system can be used as a simpler alternative to superconductor/ferromagnet\nor superconductor/topological insulator hybrids for the generation and\nmanipulation of unconventional spin-triplet superconducting states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 14:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

Deep neural networks (DNN) with\ndeterministic weights cannot express their prediction uncertainties, thereby\npose critical risks for applications where the consequences of mispredictions\nare fatal such as surgical robotics. To address this limitation, Bayesian\ninference of a DNN has gained attention. Using Bayesian inference, not only the\nprediction itself, but the prediction confidence can also be extracted for\nplanning risk-aware actions. However, Bayesian inference of a DNN is\ncomputationally expensive, ill-suited for real-time and/or edge deployment. An\napproximation to Bayesian DNN using Monte Carlo Dropout (MC-Dropout) has shown\nhigh robustness along with low computational complexity. Enhancing the\ncomputational efficiency of the method, we discuss a novel CIM module that can\nperform in-memory probabilistic dropout in addition to in-memory weight-input\nscalar product to support the method. We also propose a compute-reuse\nreformulation of MC-Dropout where each successive instance can utilize the\nproduct-sum computations from the previous iteration.

Their suitability is demonstrated\nin two case studies representing a regionalization task in an\nenvironmental-science context, and a classification task from remotely-sensed\nland cover classification. In these case studies, the SPEPs and SVIPs of\ngeostatistical methods, linear models, random forest, and hybrid algorithms\nshow striking differences but also relevant similarities. Limitations of\nrelated cross-validation techniques are outlined, and the case is made that\nmodelers should focus their model assessment and interpretation on the intended\nspatial prediction horizon. The range of autocorrelation, in contrast, is not a\nsuitable criterion for defining spatial cross-validation test sets. The novel\ndiagnostic tools enrich the toolkit of spatial data science, and may improve ML\nmodel interpretation, selection, and design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 01:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}
