However, the computation of an adversarial\nperturbation for a new data point requires solving a time-consuming\noptimization problem from scratch. To generate a stronger attack, it normally\nrequires updating a data point with more iterations. In this paper, we show the\nexistence of a meta adversarial perturbation (MAP), a better initialization\nthat causes natural images to be misclassified with high probability after\nbeing updated through only a one-step gradient ascent update, and propose an\nalgorithm for computing such perturbations. We conduct extensive experiments,\nand the empirical results demonstrate that state-of-the-art deep neural\nnetworks are vulnerable to meta perturbations. We further show that these\nperturbations are not only image-agnostic, but also model-agnostic, as a single\nperturbation generalizes well across unseen data points and different neural\nnetwork architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 16:01:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 12:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

The\nreduced velocity distribution highlights the emergence of non-Gaussianity in\nour generalized AOUP model which becomes more evident as the spatial dependence\nof the velocity profile becomes more pronounced. Then, we focus on the\ntime-dependent properties of the system. Velocity autocorrelation functions are\nstudied in the steady-state combining numerical and analytical methods derived\nunder suitable approximations. We observe a non-monotonic decay in the temporal\nshape of the velocity autocorrelation function which depends on the ratio\nbetween the persistence length and the spatial period of the swim velocity.\nFinally, we numerically and analytically study the mean square displacement and\nthe long-time diffusion coefficient. The ballistic regime, observed in the\nsmall-time region, is deeply affected by the properties of the swim velocity\nlandscape which induces also a crossover to a sub-ballistic but superdiffusive\nregime for intermediate times. Finally, the long-time diffusion coefficient\ndecreases as the amplitude of the swim velocity oscillations increases because\nthe diffusion is determined by those regions where the particles are slow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 16:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

The spacecraft\nhosts two UV-optimized delta-doped charge-coupled devices fed by a 9-cm\ntelescope and a dichroic beam splitter. A dedicated science payload processor\nperforms near real-time onboard science image processing to dynamically change\ndetector integration times and gains to reduce the occurrence of pixel\nsaturation during strong M dwarf flaring events and provide adequate flare\nlight curve structure resolution while enabling the detection of low-amplitude\nrotational modulation. The processor independently controls the NUV and FUV\ndetectors. For each detector, it derives control updates from the most recent\ncompleted exposure and applies them to the next exposure. The detection of a\nflare event in the NUV channel resets the exposure in the FUV channel with new\nexposure parameters. Implementation testing of the control algorithm using\nsimulated light curves and full-frame images demonstrates a robust response to\nthe quiescent and flaring levels expected for the stars to be monitored by the\nmission. The SPARCS onboard autonomous exposure control algorithm is adaptable\nfor operation in future point source-targeting space-based and ground-based\nobservatories geared towards the monitoring of extreme transient astrophysics\nphenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 17:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

They enable precision frequency comparisons between atoms in\nseparate locations to probe the space-time variation of fundamental constants,\nthe properties of dark matter, and for geodesy. Measurements on independent\nsystems are limited by the standard quantum limit (SQL); measurements on\nentangled systems, in contrast, can surpass the SQL to reach the ultimate\nprecision allowed by quantum theory - the so-called Heisenberg limit. While\nlocal entangling operations have been used to demonstrate this enhancement at\nmicroscopic distances, frequency comparisons between remote atomic clocks\nrequire rapid high-fidelity entanglement between separate systems that have no\nintrinsic interactions. We demonstrate the first quantum network of entangled\noptical clocks using two $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions separated by a macroscopic distance\n(2 m), that are entangled using a photonic link. We characterise the\nentanglement enhancement for frequency comparisons between the ions. We find\nthat entanglement reduces the measurement uncertainty by a factor close to\n$\\sqrt{2}$, as predicted for the Heisenberg limit, thus halving the number of\nmeasurements required to reach a given precision. Practically, today's optical\nclocks are typically limited by laser dephasing; in this regime, we find that\nusing entangled clocks confers an even greater benefit, yielding a factor 4\nreduction in the number of measurements compared to conventional correlation\nspectroscopy techniques. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate this\nenhancement for measuring a frequency shift applied to one of the clocks.

In particular, copying with severe\nillumination changes is an impelling need, as models trained on daylight data\nwill perform poorly at nighttime. In this paper, we study the problem of Domain\nAdaptive Nighttime Semantic Segmentation (DANSS), which aims to learn a\ndiscriminative nighttime model with a labeled daytime dataset and an unlabeled\ndataset, including coarsely aligned day-night image pairs. To this end, we\npropose a novel Bidirectional Mixing (Bi-Mix) framework for DANSS, which can\ncontribute to both image translation and segmentation adaptation processes.\nSpecifically, in the image translation stage, Bi-Mix leverages the knowledge of\nday-night image pairs to improve the quality of nighttime image relighting. On\nthe other hand, in the segmentation adaptation stage, Bi-Mix effectively\nbridges the distribution gap between day and night domains for adapting the\nmodel to the night domain. In both processes, Bi-Mix simply operates by mixing\ntwo samples without extra hyper-parameters, thus it is easy to implement.\nExtensive experiments on Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving datasets demonstrate\nthe advantage of the proposed Bi-Mix and show that our approach obtains\nstate-of-the-art performance in DANSS.

In the paper, to address this\nissue, we introduce a novel approach, Global and Local Alignment Networks\n(GLA-Net). The global alignment network aims to transfer the input image from\nthe source domain to the target domain. To effectively do so, we learn the\nparameters (mean and standard deviation) of multivariate Gaussian distributions\nas style features by using an MLP-Mixer based style encoder. To transfer the\nstyle more accurately, we employ an adaptive instance normalization layer in\nthe encoder, with the parameters of the target multivariate Gaussian\ndistribution as input. We also adopt regularization and likelihood losses to\nfurther reduce the domain gap and produce high-quality outputs. Additionally,\nwe introduce a local alignment network, which employs a pretrained\nself-supervised model to produce an attention map via a novel local alignment\nloss, ensuring that the translation network focuses on relevant pixels.\nExtensive experiments conducted on five public datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod effectively generates sharper and more realistic images than existing\napproaches.

Recent works have shown that\nusing expressive policy function approximators and conditioning on future\ntrajectory information -- such as future states in hindsight experience replay\nor returns-to-go in Decision Transformer (DT) -- enables efficient learning of\nmulti-task policies, where at times online RL is fully replaced by offline\nbehavioral cloning, e.g. sequence modeling.

Understanding how this instability\noperates under realistic conditions expected in protoplanetary disks is\ntherefore crucial to assess the efficiency of planet formation. Contemporary\nmodels of protoplanetary disks show that magnetic fields are key to driving gas\naccretion through large-scale, laminar magnetic stresses. However, the effect\nof such magnetic fields on the streaming instability has not been examined in\ndetail. To this end, we study the stability of dusty, magnetized gas in a\nprotoplanetary disk. We find the streaming instability can be enhanced by\npassive magnetic torques and even persist in the absence of a global radial\npressure gradient. In this case, instability is attributed to the azimuthal\ndrift between dust and gas, unlike the classical streaming instability, which\nis driven by radial drift. This suggests that the streaming instability can\nremain effective inside dust-trapping pressure bumps in accreting disks. When a\nlive vertical field is considered, we find the magneto-rotational instability\ncan be damped by dust feedback, while the classic streaming instability can be\nstabilized by magnetic perturbations. We also find that Alfv\\'en waves can be\ndestabilized by dust-gas drift, but this instability requires nearly ideal\nconditions. We discuss the possible implications of these results for dust\ndynamics and planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

These relationships are\nequally important when dealing with nested data formats such as JSON. However,\nthe definition of functional and inclusion dependencies makes use of a flat,\nunnested relational model which misses many useful types of dependencies on\ndata which involve nested data models.\n  In this work, we identify types of dependencies which are not captured by\ntraditional functional and inclusion dependencies but which nevertheless\ncapture meaningful relationships among nested data. We also demonstrate how\nalgorithms for mining these traditional dependencies can be adapted to also\nmine nested dependencies. The first strategy simply flattens the input data and\nfeeds into unmodified existing algorithms. We present a second strategy which\ninstead adapts the algorithm to efficiently process JSON data as input which in\nsome cases leads to a reduction in runtime by multiple orders of magnitude on\nreal-world datasets. We further show how these algorithms can be adapted to\nproduce useful results in the presence of a percentage of incomplete or invalid\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 19:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

While\nTyped Racket satisfies the most stringent gradual-type soundness properties at\na significant performance cost, Reticulated Python seems to limit the\nperformance penalty to a tolerable degree and is nevertheless type sound. This\ncomparison raises the question of whether Transient checking is applicable to\nand beneficial for a rich migratory type system.\n  This paper reports on the surprising difficulties of adapting the Transient\nsemantics of Reticulated Python to the rich migratory type system of Typed\nRacket. The resulting implementation, Shallow Typed Racket, is faster than the\nstandard Deep Typed Racket but only when the Transient blame assignment\nstrategy is disabled. For language designers, this report provides valuable\nhints on how to equip an existing compiler to support a Transient semantics.\nFor theoreticians, the negative experience with Transient blame calls for a\nthorough investigation of this strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 19:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

PBT is an\nincreasingly important form of software testing. Furthermore, it serves as a\nconcrete gateway into the abstract area of formal methods. Specifically, we\nfocus on students learning PBT methods.\n  Inquiry: How well do students do at PBT? Our goal is to assess the quality of\nthe predicates they write as part of PBT. Prior work introduced the idea of\ndecomposing the predicate's property into a conjunction of independent\nsubproperties. Testing the predicate against each subproperty gives a\n\"semantic\" understanding of their performance.\n  Approach: The notion of independence of subproperties both seems intuitive\nand was an important condition in prior work. First, we show that this\ncondition is overly restrictive and might hide valuable information: it both\nundercounts errors and makes it hard to capture misconceptions. Second, we\nintroduce two forms of automation, one based on PBT tools and the other on\nSAT-solving, to enable testing of student predicates.

Effective teaching requires a clear\nunderstanding of student knowledge and progress.

For discrete\nconnections, they can also improve construction efficiency by acting as\nregistration devices that lock members in precise orientations. As more\ngeometrically complex spatial trusses are enabled by computational workflows\nand the demand for material-efficient spanning systems, there is a need to\nunderstand the effects of global form on the demands at the connections. For\nlarge-scale structures with irregular geometry, customizing individual nodes to\nmeet exact member orientations and force demands may be infeasible; conversely,\nstandardizing all connections results in oversized nodes and a compromise in\nregistration potential.

We define a complexity score for spatial truss design by the variance\nin the positions of the feature vectors in higher-dimensional space, providing\nan additional performance metric during early stage design exploration.

We introduce a lattice structure on\nancestral configurations, studying the directed graphs that provide graphical\nrepresentations of lattices of ancestral configurations. For a matching gene\ntree topology and species tree topology, we present a method for defining the\ndigraph of ancestral configurations from the tree topology by using iterated\ncartesian products of graphs. We show that a specific set of paths on the\ndigraph of ancestral configurations is in bijection with the set of labeled\nhistories -- a well-known phylogenetic object that enumerates possible temporal\norderings of the coalescences of a tree. For each of a series of tree families,\nwe obtain closed-form expressions for the number of labeled histories by using\nthis bijection to count paths on associated digraphs. Finally, we prove that\nour lattice construction extends to nonmatching tree pairs, and we use it to\ncharacterize pairs $(G,S)$ having the maximal number of ancestral\nconfigurations for a fixed $G$.

This can\nbe a daunting task especially in the case of organic farming since herbicides\ncannot be used. In this paper, we present the design of Cowbot, an autonomous\nweed mowing robot for pastures. Cowbot is an electric mower designed to operate\nin the rugged environments on cow pastures and provide a cost-effective method\nfor weed control in organic farms.

A buyer either participates\ndirectly in the auction or is represented by an intermediary, who represents a\nsubset of buyers. Our goal is to design robust mechanisms that are independent\nof the demand structure (i.e. how the buyers are partitioned across\nintermediaries), and perform well under a wide variety of possible contracts\nbetween intermediaries and buyers.\n  We first study the case of $k$ identical items where each buyer draws its\nprivate valuation for an item i.i.d. from a known $\\lambda$-regular\ndistribution. We construct a robust mechanism that, independent of the demand\nstructure and under certain conditions on the contracts between intermediaries\nand buyers, obtains a constant factor of the revenue that the mechanism\ndesigner could obtain had she known the buyers' valuations. In other words, our\nmechanism's expected revenue achieves a constant factor of the optimal welfare,\nregardless of the demand structure. Our mechanism is a simple posted-price\nmechanism that sets a take-it-or-leave-it per-item price that depends on $k$\nand the total number of buyers, but does not depend on the demand structure or\nthe downstream contracts.\n  Next we generalize our result to the case when the items are not identical.\nWe assume that the item valuations are separable. For this case, we design a\nmechanism that obtains at least a constant fraction of the optimal welfare, by\nusing a menu of posted prices. This mechanism is also independent of the demand\nstructure, but makes a relatively stronger assumption on the contracts between\nintermediaries and buyers, namely that each intermediary prefers outcomes with\na higher sum of utilities of the subset of buyers represented by it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 23:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

This limitation could pose a threat to the deployment of\nViT in the real industrial environment, especially in safety-critical\nscenarios. In this work, we propose PatchCensor, aiming to certify the patch\nrobustness of ViT by applying exhaustive testing. We try to provide a provable\nguarantee by considering the worst patch attack scenarios. Unlike empirical\ndefenses against adversarial patches that may be adaptively breached, certified\nrobust approaches can provide a certified accuracy against arbitrary attacks\nunder certain conditions. However, existing robustness certifications are\nmostly based on robust training, which often requires substantial training\nefforts and the sacrifice of model performance on normal samples. To bridge the\ngap, PatchCensor seeks to improve the robustness of the whole system by\ndetecting abnormal inputs instead of training a robust model and asking it to\ngive reliable results for every input, which may inevitably compromise\naccuracy. Specifically, each input is tested by voting over multiple inferences\nwith different mutated attention masks, where at least one inference is\nguaranteed to exclude the abnormal patch. This can be seen as complete-coverage\ntesting, which could provide a statistical guarantee on inference at the test\ntime. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PatchCensor is able to\nachieve high certified accuracy (e.g. 67.1% on ImageNet for 2%-pixel\nadversarial patches), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art techniques\nwhile achieving similar clean accuracy (81.8% on ImageNet).

Implicit trust of data is a\nmajor problem with using artificial intelligence or machine learning for CPS\nsecurity, because during critical attack detection time they are more at risk,\nwith greater likelihood and impact, of also being compromised.

Clients do not need to\nsubmit their local data to the server during training, and hence the local\ntraining data of clients is protected. In FL, distributed clients collect their\nlocal data independently, so the dataset of each client may naturally form a\ndistinct source domain. In practice, the model trained over multiple source\ndomains may have poor generalization performance on unseen target domains. To\naddress this issue, we propose FedADG to equip federated learning with domain\ngeneralization capability. FedADG employs the federated adversarial learning\napproach to measure and align the distributions among different source domains\nvia matching each distribution to a reference distribution. The reference\ndistribution is adaptively generated (by accommodating all source domains) to\nminimize the domain shift distance during alignment. In FedADG, the alignment\nis fine-grained since each class is aligned independently. In this way, the\nlearned feature representation is supposed to be universal, so it can\ngeneralize well on the unseen domains. Intensive experiments on various\ndatasets demonstrate that FedADG has comparable performance with the\nstate-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Nov 2021 01:02:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 04:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

As an\nalternative to single-property materials, we introduce a ternary sequential\nreaction scheme that exhibits diverse multimaterial properties by profoundly\naltering the polymer microstructure from within a single resin composition. In\nthis system, the photodosage during 3D printing sets both the shape and extent\nof conversion for each subsequent reaction.

While a few recent works attempt\nto transfer garments directly from one person to another, alleviating the need\nto collect paired datasets, their performance is impacted by the lack of paired\n(supervised) information.

With swIVA,\ntime frames of an observed signal with time-varying characteristics are\nclustered into several groups, each of which can be well handled by IVA using a\nsmall number of microphones, and thus accurate estimation can be achieved by\napplying IVA individually to each of the groups. Conventionally, a switching\nmechanism was introduced into a beamformer; however, no blind source separation\nalgorithms with a switching mechanism have been successfully developed until\nthis paper. In order to incorporate dereverberation capability, this paper\nfurther extends swIVA to blind Convolutional beamforming algorithm (swCIVA). It\nintegrates swIVA and switching Weighted Prediction Error-based dereverberation\n(swWPE) in a jointly optimal way. We show that both swIVA and swCIVA can be\noptimized effectively based on blind signal processing, and that their\nperformance can be further improved using a spatial guide for the\ninitialization. Experiments show that both proposed methods largely outperform\nconventional IVA and its Convolutional beamforming extension (CIVA) in terms of\nobjective signal quality and automatic speech recognition scores when using a\nrelatively small number of microphones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Nov 2021 12:31:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

In existing meta-learning approaches, learning tasks for training\nmeta-models are usually collected from public datasets, which brings the\ndifficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of meta-learning tasks with a large\namount of training data. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning approach\nbased on randomly generated meta-learning tasks to obtain a parametric loss for\nclassification learning based on big data. The loss is represented by a deep\nneural network, called meta-loss network (MLN). To train the MLN, we construct\na large number of classification learning tasks through randomly generating\ntraining data, validation data, and corresponding ground-truth linear\nclassifier. Our approach has two advantages. First, sufficient meta-learning\ntasks with large number of training data can be obtained easily. Second, the\nground-truth classifier is given, so that the difference between the learned\nclassifier and the ground-truth model can be measured to reflect the\nperformance of MLN more precisely than validation accuracy. Based on this\ndifference, we apply the evolutionary strategy algorithm to find out the\noptimal MLN. The resultant MLN not only leads to satisfactory learning effects\non generated linear classifier learning tasks for testing, but also behaves\nvery well on generated nonlinear classifier learning tasks and various public\nclassification tasks.

Stacking multiple AGA modules enables the recovery of\nboth high and low-level facial structures. We design the discriminator to learn\ndiscriminative features exploiting the relationship between the high-resolution\nimage and their corresponding facial attribute annotations. We then explore the\nuse of U-Net based architecture to refine existing predictions and synthesize\nfurther facial details. Extensive experiments across several metrics show that\nour AGA-GAN and AGA-GAN+U-Net framework outperforms several other cutting-edge\nface hallucination state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the viability\nof our method when every attribute descriptor is not known and thus,\nestablishing its application in real-world scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Nov 2021 13:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

Through jointly optimizing the constraining loss and the\nautoencoder's reconstruction loss, our method can learn more relevant features\nassociated with the given class, making the majority and minority samples more\ndistinguishable.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) based\nencoder-decoder techniques have advanced the performance of automated medical\nimage segmentation systems. Several such CNN-based methodologies utilize\ntechniques such as spatial- and channel-wise attention to enhance performance.\nAnother technique that has drawn attention in recent years is residual dense\nblocks (RDBs). The successive convolutional layers in densely connected blocks\nare capable of extracting diverse features with varied receptive fields and\nthus, enhancing performance.

Taking this into\nconsideration, we present a new phenomenological logistic model that is\nwell-suited for such power-law epidemic growth.\n  Methods: We empirically develop the logistic growth model using simple\nscaling arguments, known boundary conditions and a comparison with available\ndata from four countries, Belgium, China, Denmark and Germany, where (arguably)\neffective containment measures were put in place during the first wave of the\npandemic. A non-linear least-squares minimization algorithm is used to map the\nparameter space and make optimal predictions.\n  Results: Unlike other logistic growth models, our presented model is shown to\nconsistently make accurate predictions of peak heights, peak locations and\ncumulative saturation values for incomplete epidemic growth curves. We further\nshow that the power-law growth model also works reasonably well when\ncontainment and lock down strategies are not as stringent as they were during\nthe first wave of infections in 2020. On the basis of this agreement, the model\nwas used to forecast COVID-19 fatalities for the third wave in South Africa,\nwhich is currently in progress.\n  Conclusions: We anticipate that our presented model will be useful for a\nsimilar forecasting of COVID-19 induced infections/deaths in other regions as\nwell as other cases of infectious disease outbreaks, particularly when\npower-law scaling is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Nov 2021 08:39:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

The recent\ngenerative dataless methods construct document-specific category priors by\nusing seed word occurrences only, however, such category priors often contain\nvery limited and even noisy supervised signals. To remedy this problem, in this\npaper we propose a novel formulation of category prior. First, for each\ndocument, we consider its label membership degree by not only counting seed\nword occurrences, but also using a novel prototype scheme, which captures\npseudo-nearest neighboring categories. Second, for each label, we consider its\nfrequency prior knowledge of the corpus, which is also a discriminative\nknowledge for classification. By incorporating the proposed category prior into\nthe previous generative dataless method, we suggest a novel generative dataless\nmethod, namely Weakly Supervised Prototype Topic Model (WSPTM).
