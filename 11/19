A powerful approach is to use multi-qubit network nodes\nwhich provide the quantum memory and computational power to perform\nentanglement distillation, quantum error correction, and information\nprocessing. Nuclear spins associated with optically-active defects in diamond\nare promising qubits for this role. However, their dephasing during\nentanglement distribution across the optical network hinders scaling to larger\nsystems. In this work, we show that a single 13C spin in isotopically\nengineered diamond offers a long-lived quantum memory that is robust to the\noptical link operation of an NV centre. The memory lifetime is improved by two\norders-of-magnitude upon the state-of-the-art, and exceeds the best reported\ntimes for remote entanglement generation.

Over the past 20 years several attempts to include VaR in\nthe portfolio selection process have been proposed. However, using VaR as a\nrisk measure in portfolio optimization models leads to problems that are\ncomputationally hard to solve. In view of this, few practical applications of\nVaR in portfolio selection have appeared in the literature up to now. In this\npaper, we propose to add the VaR criterion to the classical Mean-Variance\napproach in order to better address the typical regulatory constraints of the\nfinancial industry. We thus obtain a portfolio selection model characterized by\nthree criteria: expected return, variance, and VaR at a specified confidence\nlevel. The resulting optimization problem consists in minimizing variance with\nparametric constraints on the levels of expected return and VaR. This model can\nbe formulated as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) problem. An\nextensive empirical analysis on seven real-world datasets demonstrates the\npractical applicability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the\nout-of-sample performance of the optimal Mean-Variance-VaR portfolios seems to\nbe generally better than that of the optimal Mean-Variance and Mean-VaR\nportfolios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 16:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

Here we focus on the\nnuclear species $^{60}$Fe and $^{26}$Al, which have the largest impact due to\ntheir relatively high abundances.

The most important variation arises from the diffusion length\nscale for the transport of SLRs within the cloud. The expected SLR\ndistributions are wide enough to include values inferred for the abundances in\nour Solar System, although most of the stars are predicted to have smaller\nenrichment levels. In addition, the ratio of $^{60}$Fe/$^{26}$Al is predicted\nto be greater than unity, on average, in contrast to Solar System results.

Our result aims at extending the theory of multivariate\nsub-Gaussian estimators to the quantum setting. Unlike classically, where any\nunivariate estimator can be turned into a multivariate estimator with at most a\nlogarithmic overhead in the dimension, no similar result can be proved in the\nquantum setting. Indeed, Heinrich ruled out the existence of a quantum\nadvantage for the mean estimation problem when the sample complexity is smaller\nthan the dimension. Our main result is to show that, outside this low-precision\nregime, there is a quantum estimator that outperforms any classical estimator.\nOur approach is substantially more involved than in the univariate setting,\nwhere most quantum estimators rely only on phase estimation. We exploit a\nvariety of additional algorithmic techniques such as amplitude amplification,\nthe Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, and quantum singular value transformation.\nOur analysis also uses concentration inequalities for multivariate truncated\nstatistics.\n  We develop our quantum estimators in two different input models that showed\nup in the literature before. The first one provides coherent access to the\nbinary representation of the random variable and it encompasses the classical\nsetting. In the second model, the random variable is directly encoded into the\nphases of quantum registers. This model arises naturally in many quantum\nalgorithms but it is often incomparable to having classical samples. We adapt\nour techniques to these two settings and we show that the second model is\nstrictly weaker for solving the mean estimation problem. Finally, we describe\nseveral applications of our algorithms, notably in measuring the expectation\nvalues of commuting observables and in the field of machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 16:35:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 12:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

G354.8$-$0.8 is a supernova\nremnant (SNR) whose centre is located 21 arcmin away of the pulsar, and with a\nmorphology that suggests an association with the pulsar. We want to assess the\nlikelihood of the association between PSR J1734$-$3333 and G354.8$-$0.8 or\nother nearby supernova remnants quantitatively, with the objective of shedding\nlight on the real age of this pulsar.

While parameter estimation for\nthe typical case of time-constant parameters does not pose larger issues, the\ndetermination of time-dependent parameters, e.g.~the transition rates of\ncompartmental models, remains notoriously difficult, in particular since the\nfunction class of these time-dependent parameters is unknown.\n  In this work, we present a novel method which utilizes the Augmented Kalman\nSmoother in combination with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to\nsimultaneously estimate all time-dependent parameters in an SIRD compartmental\nmodel. This approach only requires incidence data, but no prior knowledge on\nmodel parameters or any further assumptions on the function class of the\ntime-dependencies. In contrast to other approaches for the estimation of the\ntime-dependent reproduction number, no assumptions on the parameterization of\nthe serial interval distribution are required. With this method, we are able to\nadequately describe COVID-19 data in Germany and to give non-parametric\nmodel-based time course estimates for the effective reproduction number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 17:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

Whereas a large\nfraction of AGN jets reveal a change from parabolic to conical collimation\naround the Bondi radius, a small number of sources deviate from this standard\npicture, including the radio galaxy NGC1052. We study the jet width profile,\nwhich provides valuable information about the interplay between the central\nengine and accretion disk system and the collimation and acceleration zone of\nthe jets. We observed the double-sided active galaxy NGC1052 at six frequencies\nwith the VLBA in 2017 and at 22GHz with RadioAstron in 2016. These data are\ncombined with archival 15, 22, and 43 GHz multi-epoch VLBA observations. From\nridge-line fitting we obtained width measurements along the jet and counter-jet\nwhich were fitted with broken power-laws. We find a break in the jet\ncollimation profile at ~10^4 R_s (Schwarzschild radii). Downstream of the break\nthe collimation is conical with a power-law index of 1.0 - 1.2 (cylindrical 0;\nparabolic 0.5; conical 1). The upstream power-law index of 0.36 for the\napproaching jet is neither cylindrical nor parabolic and for the receding jet\nwith 0.16 close-to cylindrical. Both jets have an opening angle of ~30 degree\nat a distance of ~10^3 R_S and are well collimated with an opening angle of <10\ndegrees downstream of the break.

We observe that the\nlearning delta, the performance difference between the inherited and the\nlearned brain, is growing throughout the evolutionary process. This shows that\nevolution is producing robots with an increasing plasticity, that is,\nconsecutive generations are becoming better and better learners which in turn\nmakes them better and better at the given task.

We further exploit SF to\ndirectly compute a goal-conditioned policy for inter-landmark traversal, which\nwe use to execute plans to \"frontier\" landmarks at the edge of the explored\nstate space.

Optical-field sampling techniques take advantage of\nsome process that lasts much less than an optical cycle of the measured light\nwave. Most of them rely on the generation of free electrons either by a weak\nextreme ultraviolet pulse or by a strong optical pulse. The ability of such\ntechniques to detect weak signals is limited by undesirable effects associated\nwith ionization. An alternative is all-optical methods, where the fast process\nis a nonlinear wave mixing. Such photonic methods may rely on extreme\nultraviolet or optical pulses. They typically have better sensitivity, but\nsmaller bandwidth. Here we propose generalized heterodyne optical-sampling\ntechniques (GHOSTs), which overcome the bandwidth limit through controlling\nlight-pulse waveforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 18:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

In this\nwork, we propose an efficient Transformer model by making several key designs\nin the building blocks (multi-head attention and feed-forward network) such\nthat it can capture long-range pixel interactions, while still remaining\napplicable to large images. Our model, named Restoration Transformer\n(Restormer), achieves state-of-the-art results on several image restoration\ntasks, including image deraining, single-image motion deblurring, defocus\ndeblurring (single-image and dual-pixel data), and image denoising (Gaussian\ngrayscale/color denoising, and real image denoising). The source code and\npre-trained models are available at https://github.com/swz30/Restormer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 18:59:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 13:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

What would it mean to\nrethink robotics problems to formally account for this iterative nature of\nreward design? We propose that the robot not take the specified reward for\ngranted, but rather have uncertainty about it, and account for the future\ndesign iterations as future evidence. We contribute an Assisted Reward Design\nmethod that speeds up the design process by anticipating and influencing this\nfuture evidence: rather than letting the designer eventually encounter failure\ncases and revise the reward then, the method actively exposes the designer to\nsuch environments during the development phase.

We demonstrate a CNOT gate between two optical photons with an\naverage efficiency of 41.7(5)% at a postselected process fidelity of 81(2)%.\nMoreover, we extend the scheme to a CNOT gate with multiple target qubits and\nproduce entangled states of presently up to five photons. All these\nachievements are promising and have the potential to advance optical quantum\ninformation processing in which almost all advanced protocols would profit from\nhigh-efficiency logic gates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 19:19:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 15:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

Depending on symmetry with respect to time reversal\nand the presence or absence of a spin 1/2 there are three ensembles, the\nGaussian orthogonal (GOE), Gaussian unitary (GUE), and Gaussian symplectic\n(GSE) one. With a further particle-antiparticle symmetry the chiral variants of\nthese ensembles, the chiral orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic ensembles (the\nBDI, AIII, and CII in Cartan's notation) appear which are the main point of\ninterest in this paper. Following a recently published work on chiral random\nmatrix ensembles and their experimental realizations (Rehemanjiang et al., PRL\n124, 116801 (2020)), this is achieved by using dielectric cylinders placed\nbetween two parallel aluminium plates. These cylinders act as microwave\nresonators which are used to create tight-binding chains of finite length up to\nN=5. The different ensembles are achieved by using different types of\ncouplings: For the orthogonal case spatial proximity is used, for the unitary\ncase microwave circulators are used, and for the symplectic case a combination\nof circulators and cables is used to create the necessary symmetry. In all\ncases the predicted repulsion behavior between positive and negative\neigenvalues for energies close to zero are verified by a comparison with theory\ntaking the finite size of the systems into account. We will show that the\ndifference to the expected universal behavior is given by logarithmic\ncorrections only.

Often only historical sales\ndata are available, so we observe whether a customer purchased a product at the\nprice prescribed rather than the customer's true valuation. Such observational\ndata are influenced by historical pricing policies, which introduce\ndifficulties in evaluating the effectiveness of future policies. The goal of\nthis paper is to formulate loss functions that can be used for evaluating\npricing policies directly from observational data, rather than going through an\nintermediate demand estimation stage, which may suffer from bias. To achieve\nthis, we adapt ideas from machine learning with corrupted labels, where we\nconsider each observed purchase decision as a known probabilistic\ntransformation of the customer's valuation.

Compiler-based diversification improves the\nresilience of software systems by automatically generating different assembly\ncode versions of a given program. Existing techniques are efficient but do not\nhave a precise control over the quality of the generated variants. This paper\nintroduces Diversity by Construction (DivCon), a constraint-based approach to\nsoftware diversification. Unlike previous approaches, DivCon allows users to\ncontrol and adjust the conflicting goals of diversity and code quality. A key\nenabler is the use of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) to generate highly\ndiverse code efficiently. For larger problems, we propose a combination of LNS\nwith a structural decomposition of the problem. To further improve the\ndiversification efficiency of DivCon against JOP attacks, we propose an\napplication-specific distance measure tailored to the characteristics of JOP\nattacks. We evaluate DivCon with 20 functions from a popular benchmark suite\nfor embedded systems. These experiments show that the combination of LNS and\nour application-specific distance measure generates binary programs that are\nhighly resilient against JOP attacks. Our results confirm that there is a\ntrade-off between the quality of each assembly code version and the diversity\nof the entire pool of versions. In particular, the experiments show that DivCon\ngenerates near-optimal binary programs that share a small number of gadgets.\nFor constraint programming researchers and practitioners, this paper\ndemonstrates that LNS is a valuable technique for finding diverse solutions.\nFor security researchers and software engineers, DivCon extends the scope of\ncompiler-based diversification to performance-critical and resource-constrained\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 20:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel, dynamic QoS attribute prediction technique that assists any application\nto make optimal resource reservation requests at all times.

This method uses a finite element (FE) method to approximate the\nstresses and forces on a structural mesh and a finite difference (FD) method to\napproximate the momentum of the entire fluid-structure system on a Cartesian\ngrid. The fundamental approach used by this method follows the immersed\nboundary framework for modeling fluid-structure interaction (FSI), in which a\nforce spreading operator prolongs structural forces to a Cartesian grid, and a\nvelocity interpolation operator restricts a velocity field defined on that grid\nback onto the structural mesh. Force spreading and velocity interpolation both\nrequire projecting data onto the finite element space. Consequently, evaluating\neither coupling operator requires solving a matrix equation at every time step.\nMass lumping, in which the projection matrices are replaced by diagonal\napproximations, has the potential to accelerate this method considerably.\nConstructing the coupling operators also requires determining the locations on\nthe structure mesh where the forces and velocities are sampled. Here we show\nthat sampling the forces and velocities at the nodes of the structural mesh is\nequivalent to using lumped mass matrices in the coupling operators. A key\ntheoretical result of our analysis is that if both of these approaches are used\ntogether, the IFED method permits the use of lumped mass matrices derived from\nnodal quadrature rules for any standard interpolatory element.

During\nmanual harvesting of some fresh-market crops like strawberries and table\ngrapes, pickers spend significant amounts of time walking to carry full trays\nto a collection station at the edge of the field. A step toward increasing\nharvest automation for such crops is to deploy harvest-aid collaborative robots\n(co-bots) that transport the empty and full trays, thus increasing harvest\nefficiency by reducing pickers' non-productive walking times. This work\npresents the development of a co-robotic harvest-aid system and its evaluation\nduring commercial strawberry harvesting. At the heart of the system lies a\npredictive stochastic scheduling algorithm that minimizes the expected\nnon-picking time, thus maximizing the harvest efficiency. During the evaluation\nexperiments, the co-robots improved the mean harvesting efficiency by around\n10% and reduced the mean non-productive time by 60%, when the robot-to-picker\nratio was 1:3. The concepts developed in this work can be applied to robotic\nharvest-aids for other manually harvested crops that involve walking for crop\ntransportation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 22:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}

In today's world, where everyday tasks are inevitable\nwithout technology, this extensive use of computers paves the way for malicious\nactivity. As a result, it is important to provide solutions to defend against\nthese threats. Malware is one of the well-known and widely used means utilized\nfor doing destructive activities by malicious attackers. Producing malware from\nscratch is somewhat difficult, so attackers tend to obfuscate existing malware\nand prepare it to become an unrecognizable program. Since creating new malware\nfrom an old one using obfuscation is a creative task, there are some drawbacks\nto identifying obfuscated malwares. In this research, we propose a solution to\novercome this problem by converting the code to an image in the first step and\nthen using a semi-supervised approach combined with contrastive learning. In\nthis case, an obfuscation in the malware bytecode corresponds to an\naugmentation in the image. Hence, by utilizing meaningful augmentations, which\nsimulate some obfuscation changes and combine them to generate complex\nambiguity procedures, our proposed solution is able to construct, learn, and\ndetect a wide range of obfuscations.

According to the results, the proposed\nmethod overcomes the data shortage problem in malware classification, as its\naccuracy is 90.1% when just 10% of data is used for training the model.\nMoreover, training on basic malwares without obfuscation achieved 96.21 percent\naccuracy in detecting obfuscated malware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 23:38:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 16:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

A particular area in\ncomputer vision that is likely to benefit greatly from the incorporation of\nattention mechanisms in video action recognition. However, much of the current\nresearch's focus on attention mechanisms have been on spatial and temporal\nattention, which are unable to take advantage of the inherent motion found in\nvideos. Motivated by this, we develop a new attention mechanism called Motion\nAware Attention (M2A) that explicitly incorporates motion characteristics. More\nspecifically, M2A extracts motion information between consecutive frames and\nutilizes attention to focus on the motion patterns found across frames to\naccurately recognize actions in videos. The proposed M2A mechanism is simple to\nimplement and can be easily incorporated into any neural network backbone\narchitecture. We show that incorporating motion mechanisms with attention\nmechanisms using the proposed M2A mechanism can lead to a +15% to +26%\nimprovement in top-1 accuracy across different backbone architectures, with\nonly a small increase in computational complexity. We further compared the\nperformance of M2A with other state-of-the-art motion and attention mechanisms\non the Something-Something V1 video action recognition benchmark.

These braids satisfy the\nconstraint that the composite of the braids around the exceptional points is\nequal to the commutator of the braids on the fundamental cycles of the torus.\nIn three dimensions, there are exceptional knots and links, and the\nclassification depends on how they are embedded in the Brillouin zone\nthree-torus.

Understanding the\nsource of these properties could provide insight into the progenitor systems of\nSNe Ia. We aim to determine whether they are the result of the host galaxy's\ninterstellar dust or circumstellar dust. This is accomplished by analysing the\ncontinuum polarization of 66 SNe Ia in dust-rich spiral galaxies and 13 SNe Ia\nin dust-poor elliptical galaxies as a function of normalised galactocentric\ndistance. We find that there is a general trend of SNe Ia in spiral galaxies\ndisplaying increased polarization values when located closer to the host\ngalaxies' centre, while SNe Ia in elliptical host galaxies display low\npolarization. Furthermore, all highly polarized SNe Ia in spiral host galaxies\ndisplay polarization curves rising toward blue wavelengths, while no evidence\nof such polarization properties is shown in elliptical host galaxies. This\nindicates that the source of the peculiar polarization curves is likely the\nresult of interstellar material as opposed to circumstellar material. The\npeculiar polarization and extinction properties observed toward some SNe Ia may\nbe explained by the radiative torque disruption mechanism induced by the SN or\nthe interstellar radiation field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 23:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

Here we show that recognition sites, if\ncoupled to a time-dependent target, can rapidly evolve to complex states with\nlarger code length and smaller coding density than sites recognising a static\ntarget. The underlying fitness model contains selection for recognition, which\ndepends on the sequence similarity between site and target, and a uniform cost\nper unit of code length. Site sequences are shown to evolve in a specific\nadaptive ratchet, which produces selection of different strength for code\nextensions and compressions. Ratchet evolution increases the adaptive width of\nevolved sites, accelerating the adaptation to moving targets and facilitating\nrefinement and innovation of recognition functions.

A detection scheme in this context requires specifying not only when\nto stop sampling and which sources to identify as anomalous upon stopping, but\nalso which sources to sample at each time instance until stopping. A novel\nformulation for this problem is proposed, in which the number of anomalous\nsources is not necessarily known in advance and the number of sampled sources\nper time instance is not necessarily fixed. Instead, an arbitrary lower bound\nand an arbitrary upper bound are assumed on the number of anomalous sources,\nand the fraction of the expected number of samples over the expected time until\nstopping is required to not exceed an arbitrary, user-specified level. In\naddition to this sampling constraint, the probabilities of at least one false\nalarm and at least one missed detection are controlled below user-specified\ntolerance levels. A general criterion is established for a policy to achieve\nthe minimum expected time until stopping to a first-order asymptotic\napproximation as both familywise error rates go to zero. This criterion is used\nto prove the asymptotic optimality of a family of policies that sample each\nsource at each time instance with a probability that depends on the past\nobservations only through the current estimate of the subset of anomalous\nsources.

The specific form of the Hamiltonian used in RMHMC necessitates\n{\\it implicitly-defined} numerical integrators in order to sustain\nreversibility and volume-preservation, two properties that are necessary to\nestablish detailed balance of RMHMC. In practice, these implicit equations are\nsolved to a non-zero convergence tolerance via fixed-point iteration.

The purpose of this\nresearch is to elucidate these relationships through numerous case studies. Our\nanalysis reveals circumstances wherein the RMHMC algorithm is sensitive, and\ninsensitive, to these convergence tolerances. Our empirical analysis examines\nseveral aspects of the computation: (i) we examine the ergodicity of the RMHMC\nMarkov chain by employing statistical methods for comparing probability\nmeasures based on collections of samples; (ii) we investigate the degree to\nwhich detailed balance is violated by measuring errors in reversibility and\nvolume-preservation; (iii) we assess the efficiency of the RMHMC Markov chain\nin terms of time-normalized ESS.

Specifically, we show that by\nreconstructing many images aligned to an approximate canonical pose with a\nsingle network conditioned on a shared latent space, you can learn a space of\nradiance fields that models shape and appearance for a class of objects. We\ndemonstrate this by training models to reconstruct object categories using\ndatasets that contain only one view of each subject without depth or geometry\ninformation. Our experiments show that we achieve state-of-the-art results in\nnovel view synthesis and high-quality results for monocular depth prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 01:20:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 03:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

Relatively large (\\SI{18.7}{\\angstrom}), quasi-1D polarons are\nformed on the \\SI{300}{\\femto\\second} timescale with smaller\n(\\SI{4.2}{\\angstrom}) 3D polarons taking an order of magnitude longer\n(\\SI{4}{\\pico\\second}) to form. This difference appears to be a consequence of\nthe profoundly anisotropic electron-phonon coupling in SnSe, with strong\nFr\\\"ohlich coupling only to zone center polar optical phonons. These results\ndemonstrate that carriers in SnSe at optimal doping levels results in a high\npolaron density and that strong electron-phonon coupling is also critical to\nthe thermoelectric performance of this benchmark material and potentially\nhigh-performance thermoelectrics more generally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 02:35:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 02:22:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Insufficient consideration of semantic $Q, K$, and\n$V$ embedding may lead to a performance drop. In this paper, we propose three\ntypes of structures for $Q$, $K$, and $V$ embedding.

The maximum likelihood (ML)\ndecision rule is first derived for non-coherent detection of information bits\ntransmitted by multiple devices. To overcome the high complexity of the ML\ndetection, we propose a sub-optimal two-stage detection algorithm to balance\nthe computational complexity and error performance. In the first stage, we\nidentify transmit chirps (without knowing which EDs transmit them). In the\nsecond stage, we determine the EDs that transmit the specific chirps identified\nfrom the first stage. To improve the detection performance in the second stage,\nwe also optimize the transmit powers of EDs to minimize the similarity,\nmeasured by the Jaccard coefficient, between the received powers of any pair of\nEDs. As the power control optimization problem is non-convex, we use concepts\nfrom successive convex approximation to transform it to an approximate convex\noptimization problem that can be solved iteratively and guaranteed to reach a\nsub-optimal solution.

However, aneurysms can\nexhibit significant growth or rupture before these criteria are met;\nconversely, large aneurysms may exceed intervention criteria but remain stable\nover time. Without methods to evaluate the key factors driving aneurysm\ndevelopment, it is difficult to assign preventative treatment to patients most\nin need. In this work, we propose a fluid-structure instability that may cause\nblood vessels to dilate and form aneurysms, or induce existing aneurysms to\ngrow significantly. The ab-initio framework yields a stability parameter that\ndescribes the onset of this \"fluttering\" of the aortic wall, which may drive or\nsignal the presence of abnormal aortic growth. A retrospective study was\nconducted with 4D flow MRI data from 117 patients indicated for cardiac imaging\nand 100 normal subjects recruited prospectively as healthy volunteers. Both\ncohorts comprised subjects with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the\nfull thoracic aorta. The stability parameter was calculated for every subject\nfrom the earliest MRI data. For a 72 patient subcohort with at least one\nfollow-up imaging exam after the initial MRI scan, the growth of each patient's\naneurysm was forecast by the stability parameter and compared to the maximum\ngrowth rate observed in follow-up as well as any subsequent surgical\nintervention. A receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve was used to gauge\nthe stability parameter as a potential diagnostic physiomarker. The area under\nthe curve of the ROC analysis was 0.97. The proposed flutter type instability\nappears to offer accurate prediction of aneurysm development from patient\nspecific data that can inform precise, targeted management of disease\nprogression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 04:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}

The parabolized stability equations (PSE) are popular due to\ntheir extremely low cost but can only capture a single instability mode; all\nother modes are damped or distorted by regularization methods required to\nstabilize the spatial march, precluding PSE from properly capturing non-modal\nbehavior, acoustics, and interactions between multiple instability mechanisms.\nThe one-way Navier-Stokes (OWNS) equations properly retain all\ndownstream-traveling modes at a cost that is a fraction of that of global\nmethods but still one to two orders of magnitude higher than PSE. In this\npaper, we introduce a new variant of OWNS whose cost, both in terms of CPU time\nand memory requirements, approaches that of PSE while still properly capturing\nthe contributions of all downstream-traveling modes.

In stage two, We utilize unlabeled text data via\nTTS data-augmentation to incorporate language information into the model. We\nalso explore freezing the acoustic encoder at this stage. TTS data augmentation\nhelps us further reduce the WER by ~ 21% relatively. Finally, In stage three we\nreduce the WER by another 4% relative by using SSL from unlabeled audio data.\nOverall, our two-pass speech recognition system with a Monotonic Chunkwise\nAttention (MoChA) in the first pass and a full-attention in the second pass\nachieves a WER reduction of ~ 42% relative to the baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 05:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}

First, the main challenge with implementing the combined scaling\nrules of BASIC is the limited memory of accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs.

The ferromagnetic phase is stabilized below a\ndome-shaped transition line with the maximal Tc near van Hove filling. The\ntransition is second order at high temperatures and becomes first order at low\ntemperatures. When the interaction strength becomes large, another\nferromagnetic dome is realized near the band edge with a quantum critical point\nat the band edge and a first-order transition on the other edge of the dome.\nThe two ferromagnetic phases merge into one for further larger interaction\nstrength. By applying a magnetic field, wing structures develop from the\nfirst-order transition lines at zero field. The wing describes a first-order\ntransition surface, namely a metamagnetic transition. When the system is tuned\nclose to the band edge in the field, the wing can shrink and vanish, leading to\na quantum critical end point (QCEP) at zero temperature. This QCEP is a\nLifshitz point in the sense that the Fermi surface of either spin band\nvanishes. Close to the QCEP, another wing develops at very low temperatures in\na higher field region. For a large interaction strength, however, the QCEP\ndisappears. Furthermore, a metamagnetic transition occurs also inside the\nferromagnetic phase without a magnetic field. Consequently another wing also\ndevelops from that by applying the field. Our obtained phase diagrams are\ndiscussed as a possible connection to itinerant ferromagnetic systems such as\nUGe2, UCoAl, ZrZn2, and others including magnetocaloric effect materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 06:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}

Electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO)\nsignificantly improves its conductivity. However, the kinetics of this process\ndepends on the solvent, supporting electrolyte, pH, and numerous other factors.\nMost studies report the macroscopic views and ex-situ properties of reduced GO.\nTo expand the knowledge about GO reduction, in this study, we used cyclic\nvoltammetry (CV), simultaneous 2 points and 4 points resistance measurement\n(s24), conductive atomic force microscopy (AFM), and theoretical calculations.\nUsing CV, we demonstrated that the choice of supporting electrolyte (KCl or\nLiCl) influences the potential range in which electrochemical GO reduction\noccurs. The activation energy of this process was estimated to be below 30 kJ\nmol-1 in both electrolytes, being significantly lower than that required for\nthermal reduction of GO. Simultaneous in situ s24 resistance measurements\nsuggest that GO films reach a highly conductive state at deep negative\npotentials, with an abrupt, irreversible switch from non-conductive to the\nconductive state. However, conductive AFM presents a more exact picture of this\nprocess: the reduction of GO films starts locally while the formed conductive\nislands grow during the reduction. This mechanism was confirmed by theoretical\ncalculations indicating that the reduction starts on isolated oxygen-functional\ngroups over the GO basal plane, while clustered OH groups are more difficult to\nreduce. The presented results can help in tailoring reduced GO for a particular\nelectrochemical application by precisely controlling the reduction degree and\npercentage of the conductive area of the reduced GO films.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 07:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}

In this\npaper, we propose a Deep Domain Adaptation-based Crack Detection Network\n(DDACDN), which learns domain invariant features by taking advantage of the\nsource domain knowledge to predict the multi-category crack location\ninformation in the target domain, where only image-level labels are available.\nSpecifically, DDACDN first extracts crack features from both the source and\ntarget domain by a two-branch weights-shared backbone network. And in an effort\nto achieve the cross-domain adaptation, an intermediate domain is constructed\nby aggregating the three-scale features from the feature space of each domain\nto adapt the crack features from the source domain to the target domain.\nFinally, the network involves the knowledge of both domains and is trained to\nrecognize and localize pavement cracks. To facilitate accurate training and\nvalidation for domain adaptation, we use two challenging pavement crack\ndatasets CQU-BPDD and RDD2020. Furthermore, we construct a new large-scale\nBituminous Pavement Multi-label Disease Dataset named CQU-BPMDD, which contains\n38994 high-resolution pavement disease images to further evaluate the\nrobustness of our model.

Understanding how the heterogeneous\npattern forms is potentially important for understanding how crater rays form.\nPrevious studies predicted that the pattern formation is induced by inelastic\ncollisions of ejecta particles in the early stages of crater formation and is\nterminated by the ejecta's expanding motion. In this study, we test this\nprediction based on a hyper-velocity impact experiment together with N-body\nsimulations where the trajectories of inelastically colliding granular\nparticles are calculated. Our laboratory experiment suggests that pattern\nformation is already completed on a timescale comparable to the geometrical\nexpansion of the ejecta curtain, which is ~ 10 microseconds in our experiment.\nOur simulations confirm the previous prediction that the heterogeneous pattern\ngrows through initial inelastic collisions of particle clusters and subsequent\ngeometric expansion with no further cluster collisions. Furthermore, to better\nunderstand the two-stage evolution of the mesh pattern, we construct a simple\nanalytical model that assumes perfect coalescence of particle clusters upon\ncollision. The model shows that the pattern formation is completed on the\ntimescale of the system's expansion independently of the initial conditions.\nThe model also reproduces the final size of the clusters observed in our\nsimulations as a function of the initial conditions.

LoRaWAN uses ALOHA-style communication where\nit is almost impossible to schedule transmission between networks belonging to\ndifferent owners properly. The inability to schedule overlapping networks will\ncause inter-network interference, which will increase node-to-gateway message\nlosses and gateway-to-node acknowledgement failures. This problem is likely to\nget worse as the number of LoRaWAN networks increase. In response to this\nproblem, we propose IRONWAN, a wireless overlay network that shares\ncommunication resources without modifications to underlying protocols. It\nutilises the broadcast nature of radio communication and enables\ngateway-to-gateway communication to facilitate the search for failed messages\nand transmit failed acknowledgements already received and cached in overlapping\nnetwork's gateways. IRONWAN uses two novel algorithms, a Real-time Message\nInter-arrival Predictor, to highlight when a server has not received an\nexpected uplink message. The Interference Predictor ensures that extra\ngateway-to-gateway communication does not negatively impact communication\nbandwidth. We evaluate IRONWAN on a 1000-node simulator with up to ten gateways\nand a 10-node testbed with 2-gateways. Results show that IRONWAN can achieve up\nto 12\\% higher packet delivery ratio (PDR) and total messages received per node\nwhile increasing the minimum PDR by up to 28\\%.

In this paper, we present the first\nweakly-supervised approach to the SID problem. Although weak supervision has\nbeen considered in general saliency detection, it is mainly based on using\nclass labels for object localization. However, it is non-trivial to use only\nclass labels to learn instance-aware saliency information, as salient instances\nwith high semantic affinities may not be easily separated by the labels. As the\nsubitizing information provides an instant judgement on the number of salient\nitems, it is naturally related to detecting salient instances and may help\nseparate instances of the same class while grouping different parts of the same\ninstance. Inspired by this observation, we propose to use class and subitizing\nlabels as weak supervision for the SID problem. We propose a novel\nweakly-supervised network with three branches: a Saliency Detection Branch\nleveraging class consistency information to locate candidate objects; a\nBoundary Detection Branch exploiting class discrepancy information to delineate\nobject boundaries; and a Centroid Detection Branch using subitizing information\nto detect salient instance centroids. This complementary information is then\nfused to produce a salient instance map. To facilitate the learning process, we\nfurther propose a progressive training scheme to reduce label noise and the\ncorresponding noise learned by the model, via reciprocating the model with\nprogressive salient instance prediction and model refreshing. Our extensive\nevaluations show that the proposed method plays favorably against carefully\ndesigned baseline methods adapted from related tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 10:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}

The\nsequence representation plays a key role in the learning of matching degree\nbetween the dialogue context and the response. However, we observe that\ndifferent context-response pairs sharing the same context always have a greater\nsimilarity in the sequence representations calculated by PLMs, which makes it\nhard to distinguish positive responses from negative ones. Motivated by this,\nwe propose a novel \\textbf{F}ine-\\textbf{G}rained \\textbf{C}ontrastive (FGC)\nlearning method for the response selection task based on PLMs. This FGC\nlearning strategy helps PLMs to generate more distinguishable matching\nrepresentations of each dialogue at fine grains, and further make better\npredictions on choosing positive responses. Empirical studies on two benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed FGC learning method can generally and\nsignificantly improve the model performance of existing PLM-based matching\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 11:07:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 04:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

Throughout the paper we put focus on\nthe Li & Lee mortality model, which has become a standard for projecting\nmortality in Belgium and the Netherlands. We calibrate this mortality model on\nannual deaths and exposures at the level of individual ages. This type of\nmortality data is typically collected, produced and reported with a significant\ndelay of -- for some countries -- several years on a platform such as the Human\nMortality Database. To enable a timely evaluation of the impact of a pandemic\ndata point we have to rely on other data sources (e.g. the Short-Term Mortality\nFluctuations Data series) that swiftly publish weekly mortality data collected\nin age buckets. To be compliant with the design and calibration strategy of the\nLi & Lee model, we have to transform the weekly mortality data collected in age\nbuckets to yearly, age-specific observations. Therefore, our paper constructs a\nprotocol to ungroup the deaths and exposures registered in age buckets to\nindividual ages. To evaluate the impact of a pandemic shock, like COVID-19 in\nthe year 2020, we weigh this data point in either the calibration or projection\nstep.

Recent works have demonstrated that it is possible to reconstruct the\ntraining data from gradients for an image-classification model when its\narchitecture is known.

The\nshock so built propagates at the speed of sound and matter is exactly conserved\nat the front crossing. Yet, momentum and energy are only conserved up to order\n0 in powers of the shock amplitude. The density, velocity and pressure jumps\nare similar to those of a fluid shock, and an equivalent Mach number can be\ndefined. A similar process is possible in magnetohydrodynamic. Yet, such a\ndecomposition is found impossible for collisionless shocks due to the\ndispersive nature of ion acoustic waves. Weakly nonlinear corrections to their\nfrequency do not solve the problem.

Contrary\nto what most current literature suggests, the paradox was central to the\nBayesian testing methodology developed by Sir Harold Jeffreys in the late\n1930s. Jeffreys showed that the evidence against a point-null hypothesis\n$\\mathcal{H}_0$ scales with $\\sqrt{n}$ and repeatedly argued that it would\ntherefore be mistaken to set a threshold for rejecting $\\mathcal{H}_0$ at a\nconstant multiple of the standard error. Here we summarize Jeffreys's early\nwork on the paradox and clarify his reasons for including the $\\sqrt{n}$ term.\nThe prior distribution is seen to play a crucial role; by implicitly correcting\nfor selection, small parameter values are identified as relatively surprising\nunder $\\mathcal{H}_1$. We highlight the general nature of the paradox by\npresenting both a fully frequentist and a fully Bayesian version. We also\ndemonstrate that the paradox does not depend on assigning prior mass to a point\nhypothesis, as is commonly believed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 12:58:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 09:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

In this work, we\nview the server-orchestrated federated learning process as a hierarchical\nlatent variable model where the server provides the parameters of a prior\ndistribution over the client-specific model parameters. We show that with\nsimple Gaussian priors and a hard version of the well known\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, learning in such a model corresponds\nto FedAvg, the most popular algorithm for the federated learning setting. This\nperspective on FedAvg unifies several recent works in the field and opens up\nthe possibility for extensions through different choices for the hierarchical\nmodel. Based on this view, we further propose a variant of the hierarchical\nmodel that employs prior distributions to promote sparsity. By similarly using\nthe hard-EM algorithm for learning, we obtain FedSparse, a procedure that can\nlearn sparse neural networks in the federated learning setting. FedSparse\nreduces communication costs from client to server and vice-versa, as well as\nthe computational costs for inference with the sparsified network - both of\nwhich are of great practical importance in federated learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 12:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}

A statistical combination with an earlier\nsearch by the CMS Collaboration in the all-hadronic final state is performed to\nplace upper cross section limits on these two models. The new analysis extends\nthe lower range of resonance mass probed from 1.4 down to 0.7 TeV. For\nleft-handed, right-handed, and vector-like couplings, b$^*$ masses up to 3.0,\n3.0, and 3.2 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, respectively. The\nobserved upper limits represent the most stringent constraints on the b$^*$\nmodel to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 13:43:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 13:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

From this perspective, we\nintroduce a novel paradigm of DG, termed as Semi-Supervised Domain\nGeneralization (SSDG), to explore how the labeled and unlabeled source domains\ncan interact, and establish two settings, including the close-set and open-set\nSSDG. The close-set SSDG is based on existing public DG datasets, while the\nopen-set SSDG, built on the newly-collected web-crawled datasets, presents a\nnovel yet realistic challenge that pushes the limits of current technologies. A\nnatural approach of SSDG is to transfer knowledge from labeled data to\nunlabeled data via pseudo labeling, and train the model on both labeled and\npseudo-labeled data for generalization. Since there are conflicting goals\nbetween domain-oriented pseudo labeling and out-of-domain generalization, we\ndevelop a pseudo labeling phase and a generalization phase independently for\nSSDG. Unfortunately, due to the large domain gap, the pseudo labels provided in\nthe pseudo labeling phase inevitably contain noise, which has negative affect\non the subsequent generalization phase. Therefore, to improve the quality of\npseudo labels and further enhance generalizability, we propose a cyclic\nlearning framework to encourage a positive feedback between these two phases,\nutilizing an evolving intermediate domain that bridges the labeled and\nunlabeled domains in a curriculum learning manner...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 13:55:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 08:45:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 07:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

However, a common performance problem in such systems is\ndealing with straggler tasks that are slow running instances that increase the\noverall response time. Such tasks can significantly impact the system's Quality\nof Service (QoS) and the Service Level Agreements (SLA). To combat this issue,\nthere is a need for automatic straggler detection and mitigation mechanisms\nthat execute jobs without violating the SLA. Prior work typically builds\nreactive models that focus first on detection and then mitigation of straggler\ntasks, which leads to delays. Other works use prediction based proactive\nmechanisms, but ignore heterogeneous host or volatile task characteristics. In\nthis paper, we propose a Straggler Prediction and Mitigation Technique (START)\nthat is able to predict which tasks might be stragglers and dynamically adapt\nscheduling to achieve lower response times. Our technique analyzes all tasks\nand hosts based on compute and network resource consumption using an Encoder\nLong-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) network. The output of this network is then used\nto predict and mitigate expected straggler tasks. This reduces the SLA\nviolation rate and execution time without compromising QoS. Specifically, we\nuse the CloudSim toolkit to simulate START in a cloud environment and compare\nit with state-of-the-art techniques (IGRU-SD, SGC, Dolly, GRASS, NearestFit and\nWrangler) in terms of QoS parameters such as energy consumption, execution\ntime, resource contention, CPU utilization and SLA violation rate. Experiments\nshow that START reduces execution time, resource contention, energy and SLA\nviolations by 13%, 11%, 16% and 19%, respectively, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 14:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}

The automated analysis of blood vessels typically requires\nthe identification, or segmentation, of the blood vessels in an image or a set\nof images, which is usually a challenging task. Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) have been shown to provide excellent results regarding the segmentation\nof blood vessels. One important aspect of CNNs is that they can be trained on\nlarge amounts of data and then be made available, for instance, in image\nprocessing software for wide use. The pre-trained CNNs can then be easily\napplied in downstream blood vessel characterization tasks such as the\ncalculation of the length, tortuosity, or caliber of the blood vessels. Yet, it\nis still unclear if pre-trained CNNs can provide robust, unbiased, results on\ndownstream tasks when applied to datasets that they were not trained on. Here,\nwe focus on measuring the tortuosity of blood vessels and investigate to which\nextent CNNs may provide biased tortuosity values even after fine-tuning the\nnetwork to the new dataset under study. We show that the tortuosity values\nobtained by a CNN trained from scratch on a dataset may not agree with those\nobtained by a fine-tuned network that was pre-trained on a dataset having\ndifferent tortuosity statistics. In addition, we show that the improvement in\nsegmentation performance when fine-tuning the network does not necessarily lead\nto a respective improvement on the estimation of the tortuosity. To mitigate\nthe aforementioned issues, we propose the application of specific data\naugmentation techniques even in situations where they do not improve\nsegmentation performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 14:55:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 13:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

In the wireless\ncommunity, Federated Learning (FL) is of particular interest due to its\ncommunication efficiency and its ability to deal with the problem of non-IID\ndata. FL training can be accelerated by a wireless communication method called\nOver-the-Air Computation (AirComp) which harnesses the interference of\nsimultaneous uplink transmissions to efficiently aggregate model updates.\nHowever, since AirComp utilizes analog communication, it introduces inevitable\nestimation errors. In this paper, we study the impact of such estimation errors\non the convergence of FL and propose retransmissions as a method to improve FL\nconvergence over resource-constrained wireless networks. First, we derive the\noptimal AirComp power control scheme with retransmissions over static channels.\nThen, we investigate the performance of Over-the-Air FL with retransmissions\nand find two upper bounds on the FL loss function.

Numerical results demonstrate that the\nintroduction of retransmissions can lead to improved ML performance, without\nincurring extra costs in terms of communication or computation.

Since it was first\nproposed almost two decades ago, multiple computational models have been\nconstructed based on IBLT (i.e., IBL models). These models have been\ndemonstrated to be very successful in explaining and predicting human decisions\nin multiple decision making contexts. However, as IBLT has evolved, the initial\ndescription of the theory has become less precise, and it is unclear how its\ndemonstration can be expanded to more complex, dynamic, and multi-agent\nenvironments. This paper presents an updated version of the current theoretical\ncomponents of IBLT in a comprehensive and precise form. It also provides an\nadvanced implementation of the full set of theoretical mechanisms, SpeedyIBL,\nto unlock the capabilities of IBLT to handle a diverse taxonomy of individual\nand multi-agent decision-making problems. SpeedyIBL addresses a practical\ncomputational issue in past implementations of IBL models, the curse of\nexponential growth, that emerges from memory-based tabular computations. When\nmore observations accumulate over time, there is an exponential growth of the\nmemory of instances that leads directly to an exponential slow down of the\ncomputational time. Thus, SpeedyIBL leverages parallel computation with\nvectorization to speed up the execution time of IBL models. We evaluate the\nrobustness of SpeedyIBL over an existing implementation of IBLT in decision\ngames of increased complexity. The results not only demonstrate the\napplicability of IBLT through a wide range of decision making tasks, but also\nhighlight the improvement of SpeedyIBL over its prior implementation as the\ncomplexity of decision features and number of agents increase.

This long-standing picture is based on stellar models with\nHertzprung gap (HG) donors. Motivated by a finding that in low-metallicity\nbinaries, post-MS mass transfer may instead be initiated by core-helium burning\n(CHeB) donors, we use the MESA code to compute grids of detailed massive binary\nmodels at three metallicities: Solar and that of the Large and the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC, SMC). We find that metallicity strongly influences the\ncourse and outcome of mass transfer. We identify two novel types of post-MS\nmass transfer: (a) mass exchange on the long nuclear timescale that continues\nuntil the end of the CHeB phase, and (b) rapid mass transfer leading to\ndetached binaries with mass-losers that are only partially stripped of their\nenvelopes. In neither (a) or (b) does the donor become a fully stripped helium\nstar by the end of CHeB. Boundaries between the different types of post-MS mass\ntransfer are associated with the degree of rapid post-MS expansion and, for a\ngiven metallicity, are sensitive to the assumptions about internal mixing. At\nlow metallicity, we predict fewer hot fully stripped stars formed through\nbinary interactions and higher compactness of pre-supernova cores.\nNuclear-timescale post-MS mass transfer suggests a strong preference for\nmetal-poor host galaxies of ultra-luminous X-ray sources with black-hole (BH)\naccretors and massive donors, some of which might be the immediate progenitors\nof binary BH mergers.

Current profilers offer the advantage of\ngaining more coherent measurement data than available with point acoustic\nmeasurements, and it is desirable to exploit this property in laboratory and\nfield applications. The ADCP was tested in a towing tank, where turbulence was\ngenerated from a grid towed under controlled conditions. Grid-induced\nturbulence is a well-studied phenomenon and a good approximation for isotropic\nturbulence. Several previous experiments are available for comparison and there\nare developed theories within the topic. In the present experiments, an\nacoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV), which is an established instrument for\nturbulence measurements, was applied to validate the ADCP. It was found that\nthe mean flow measured with the ADCP was accurate within 4% of the ADV. The\nturbulent variance was reasonably well resolved by the ADCP when large grid\nbars were towed at a high speed, but largely overestimated for lower towing\nspeed and smaller grid bars. The effective cutoff frequency and turbulent eddy\nsize were characterized experimentally, which provides detailed guidelines for\nwhen the ADCP data can be trusted and will allow future experimentalists to\ndecide a priori if the Nortek Signature can be used in their setup. We conclude\nthat the ADCP is not suitable for resolving turbulent spectra in a small-scale\ngrid-induced flow due to the intrinsic Doppler noise and the low spatial and\ntemporal sample resolution relative to the turbulent scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 15:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}

The\nproduct quality is an important property that informs whether the products of\nthe process are within the specifications. In particular, the delays caused by\nsample processing (collection, laboratory measurements, results analysis,\nreporting) can lead to detrimental economic effects. One of the strategies to\ndeal with this problem is soft sensors. Soft sensors are a collection of models\nthat can be used to predict and forecast some infrequently measured properties\n(such as laboratory measurements of petroleum products) based on more frequent\nmeasurements of quantities like temperature, pressure and flow rate provided by\nphysical sensors. Soft sensors short-cut the pathway to obtain relevant\ninformation about the product quality, often providing measurements as\nfrequently as every minute. One of the applications of soft sensors is for the\nreal-time optimization of a chemical process by a targeted adaptation of\noperating parameters. Models used for soft sensors can have various forms,\nhowever, among the most common are those based on artificial neural networks\n(ANNs). While soft sensors can deal with some of the issues in the refinery\nprocesses, their development and deployment can pose other challenges that are\naddressed in this paper. Firstly, it is important to enhance the quality of\nboth sets of data (laboratory measurements and physical sensors) in a data\npre-processing stage (as described in Methodology section).

The current prediction models usually can only\nreflect the linear variation law, poorly handled or selectively ignore their\nnonlinear characteristics, so the prediction results are usually less accurate.\nThis paper uses a fund prediction method based on the ARIMA-LSTM hybrid model.\nAfter preprocessing the historical data, the first filter out the linear data\ncharacteristics with the ARIMA model, then pass the data to the LSTM model to\nextract the nonlinear characteristic by residual, and finally superposition the\nrespective prediction values of the two models to obtain the prediction results\nof the hybrid model. Empirically shows that the methods in the paper are more\naccurate and applicable than traditional fund prediction methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 10:44:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

Based on this, this paper\nproposes an improved deep recurrent DRQN-ARBR model because the existing\nquantitative trading model ignores the impact of irrational investor behavior\non the market, making the application effect poor in an environment where the\nstock market in China is non-efficiency. By changing the fully connected layer\nin the original model to the LSTM layer and using the emotion indicator ARBR to\nconstruct a trading strategy, this model solves the problems of the traditional\nDQN model with limited memory for empirical data storage and the impact of\nobservable Markov properties on performance. At the same time, this paper also\nimproved the shortcomings of the original model with fewer stock states and\nchose more technical indicators as the input values of the model. The\nexperimental results show that the DRQN-ARBR algorithm proposed in this paper\ncan significantly improve the performance of reinforcement learning in stock\ntrading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 10:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

In this review we\nidentify a set of ten limiting factors that can restrain, or halt back, an\nexponential growth of these variable renewable power plants (VREs) in the\nfuture. If the exponential growth slows down to a linear growth, such a case\nwould extent considerably the time to reduce the CO2 emissions and the related\nmitigation of climate change. A scenario that would result to a much higher\nrisk of a future continuation of the economic grow and thrive of the global\neconomy and human society.

We can\nformulate this problem as a dynamic programming equation, where the main\ndifficulty comes from the computation of the conditional expectations\nrepresenting the continuation values at each time step. In (Longstaff and\nSchwartz, 2001), these conditional expectations were estimated using\nregressions on a finite-dimensional vector space (typically a polynomial\nbasis).
