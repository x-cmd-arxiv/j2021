To tackle this problem, we propose an\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for category-level object pose estimation,\ncalled UDA-COPE. Inspired by recent multi-modal UDA techniques, the proposed\nmethod exploits a teacher-student self-supervised learning scheme to train a\npose estimation network without using target domain pose labels. We also\nintroduce a bidirectional filtering method between the predicted normalized\nobject coordinate space (NOCS) map and observed point cloud, to not only make\nour teacher network more robust to the target domain but also to provide more\nreliable pseudo labels for the student network training. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method both\nquantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, without leveraging target-domain GT\nlabels, our proposed method achieved comparable or sometimes superior\nperformance to existing methods that depend on the GT labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:00:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 02:13:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

Music from\ndifferent cultures establish different aesthetics by having different style\nconventions on these two aspects. We propose a framework that could be used to\nquantitatively compare music from different cultures by looking at these two\naspects.\n  The framework is based on an Music Information Dynamics model, a Variable\nMarkov Oracle (VMO), and is extended with a variational representation learning\nof audio. A variational autoencoder (VAE) is trained to map audio fragments\ninto a latent representation. The latent representation is fed into a VMO. The\nVMO then learns a clustering of the latent representation via a threshold that\nmaximizes the information rate of the quantized latent representation sequence.\nThis threshold effectively controls the sensibility of the predictive step to\nacoustic changes, which determines the framework's ability to track repetitions\non longer time scales. This approach allows characterization of the overall\ninformation contents of a musical signal at each level of acoustic sensibility.\n  Our findings under this framework show that sensibility to subtle acoustic\nchanges is higher for East-Asian musical traditions, while the Western works\nexhibit longer motivic structures at higher thresholds of differences in the\nlatent space. This suggests that a profile of information contents, analyzed as\na function of the level of acoustic detail can serve as a possible cultural\ncharacteristic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-25"}

In order to\nenhance the supernet's evaluation ability, one greedy strategy is to sample\ngood paths, and let the supernet lean towards the good ones and ease its\nevaluation burden as a result. However, in practice the search can be still\nquite inefficient since the identification of good paths is not accurate enough\nand sampled paths still scatter around the whole search space. In this paper,\nwe leverage an explicit path filter to capture the characteristics of paths and\ndirectly filter those weak ones, so that the search can be thus implemented on\nthe shrunk space more greedily and efficiently. Concretely, based on the fact\nthat good paths are much less than the weak ones in the space, we argue that\nthe label of \"weak paths\" will be more confident and reliable than that of\n\"good paths\" in multi-path sampling. In this way, we thus cast the training of\npath filter in the positive and unlabeled (PU) learning paradigm, and also\nencourage a \\textit{path embedding} as better path/operation representation to\nenhance the identification capacity of the learned filter. By dint of this\nembedding, we can further shrink the search space by aggregating similar\noperations with similar embeddings, and the search can be more efficient and\naccurate.

In this\npaper, we propose a neural network enhanced method to highlight similar users\nin semantic space.

To tackle this issue, we introduce the friend network\ninto personalized search to determine the closeness between users in another\nway. Since the friendship is often formed based on similar background or\ninterest, there are plenty of personalized signals hidden in the friend network\nnaturally.

As this trend continues,\nmodel training has become prohibitively costly, requiring access to powerful\ncomputing systems to train state-of-the-art networks. A large body of research\nhas been devoted to addressing the cost per iteration of training through\nvarious model compression techniques like pruning and quantization. Less effort\nhas been spent targeting the number of iterations. Previous work, such as\nforget scores and GraNd/EL2N scores, address this problem by identifying\nimportant samples within a full dataset and pruning the remaining samples,\nthereby reducing the iterations per epoch. Though these methods decrease the\ntraining time, they use expensive static scoring algorithms prior to training.\nWhen accounting for the scoring mechanism, the total run time is often\nincreased. In this work, we address this shortcoming with dynamic data pruning\nalgorithms. Surprisingly, we find that uniform random dynamic pruning can\noutperform the prior work at aggressive pruning rates. We attribute this to the\nexistence of \"sometimes\" samples -- points that are important to the learned\ndecision boundary only some of the training time. To better exploit the\nsubtlety of sometimes samples, we propose two algorithms, based on\nreinforcement learning techniques, to dynamically prune samples and achieve\neven higher accuracy than the random dynamic method. We test all our methods\nagainst a full-dataset baseline and the prior work on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,\nand we can reduce the training time by up to 2x without significant performance\nloss. Our results suggest that data pruning should be understood as a dynamic\nprocess that is closely tied to a model's training trajectory, instead of a\nstatic step based solely on the dataset alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:47:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-25"}

The previous works focus on dropping\ninsignificant tokens to reduce the computational cost of ViTs. But when the\ndropping ratio increases, this hard manner will inevitably discard the vital\ntokens, which limits its efficiency. To solve the issue, we propose a generic\nself-slimmed learning approach for vanilla ViTs, namely SiT. Specifically, we\nfirst design a novel Token Slimming Module (TSM), which can boost the inference\nefficiency of ViTs by dynamic token aggregation. As a general method of token\nhard dropping, our TSM softly integrates redundant tokens into fewer\ninformative ones. It can dynamically zoom visual attention without cutting off\ndiscriminative token relations in the images, even with a high slimming ratio.\nFurthermore, we introduce a concise Feature Recalibration Distillation (FRD)\nframework, wherein we design a reverse version of TSM (RTSM) to recalibrate the\nunstructured token in a flexible auto-encoder manner. Due to the similar\nstructure between teacher and student, our FRD can effectively leverage\nstructure knowledge for better convergence. Finally, we conduct extensive\nexperiments to evaluate our SiT. It demonstrates that our method can speed up\nViTs by 1.7x with negligible accuracy drop, and even speed up ViTs by 3.6x\nwhile maintaining 97% of their performance.

A major challenge facing\nlarge ground-based radio telescopes is achieving sufficient pointing accuracy\nfor observing at high frequencies, up to 116 GHz in the case of the GBT.\nAccurate pointing requires the ability to blindly acquire source locations and\nperform ad hoc corrections determined by observing nearby calibrator sources in\norder to obtain a starting position accurate to within a small margin of error\nof the target's location. The required pointing accuracy is dependent upon the\nhalf-power beamwidth, and for the higher-frequency end of GBT observing, this\nmeans that pointing must be accurate to within a few arcseconds RMS. The GBT's\noff-axis design is advantageous in that it eliminates blockage of the dish and\nreduces sidelobe interference, and there is no evidence that the resulting\nasymmetric structure adversely affects pointing accuracy. However, factors such\nas gravitational flexure, thermal deformation, azimuth track tilt and\nirregularity, and small misalignments and offset errors within the telescope's\nstructure cause pointing inaccuracies. A pointing model was developed for the\nGBT to correct for these effects. The model utilizes standard geometrical\ncorrections along with metrology data from the GBT's structural temperature\nsensors and data from measurements of the track levels. In this paper we\nprovide a summary of the GBT's pointing model and associated corrections, as\nwell as a discussion of relevant metrology systems and an analysis of its\ncurrent nighttime pointing accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

A robust exact differentiator is then constructed via the\nadaptation of a single parameter of a linear differentiator.

The dimer and monomer\nfluorescence emissions were observed simultaneously in all the solvents. The\nmonomer to dimer fluorescence intensity ratio has been calculated and found\nthat at a certain concentration of RhB the magnitude of the ratio is different\nin different solvents. The ratio becomes equivalent to one for 1.5 gm per l, 3\ngm per l and 4.2 gm per l, concentration of RhB in water, ethanol and propanol\nrespectively. This concentration of RhB at which the monomer to dimer ratio\nbecomes unity is proposed as critical concentration. Above this critical\nconcentration, the dimeric fluorescence dominates and below which the monomeric\nfluorescence dominates. Moreover, in the solvent for which the magnitude of\ncritical concentration is less the fluorophore molecule aggregates more easily\nand vice versa. So, water is found to be the most suitable solvent for RhB\nmolecules for self-aggregation than ethanol and propanol but with less dimeric\nquantum yield. It is also observed that the critical concentration varies\ninversely with the dielectric constant of the solvents. Altogether, it can be\nsaid that the proposed ratio and critical concentration quantify the\naggregation process of the fluorophore in the solvent. Hence, the critical\nconcentration value of the fluorophore could be assumed as the characteristic\nparameter to study the aggregation behaviour of the fluorophore in solvents.\nThe described method has the merit of use in the study of lasing ability and\nthe wavelength tunability of the dye laser gain media as well as in the heavy\nmetal sensing technology in water.

At\nits core, the USF allows for high-dynamic-range (HDR) signal reconstruction by\nconverting a continuous-time signal into folded, low-dynamic-range (LDR),\nmodulo samples. HDR reconstruction is then carried out by algorithmic unfolding\nof the folded samples. In hardware, however, implementing an ideal modulo\nfolding requires careful calibration, analog design and high precision. At the\ninterface of theory and practice, this paper explores a computational sampling\nstrategy that relaxes strict hardware requirements by compensating them via a\nnovel, mathematically guaranteed recovery method. Our starting point is a\ngeneralized model for USF. The generalization relies on two new parameters\nmodeling hysteresis and folding transients} in addition to the modulo\nthreshold. Hysteresis accounts for the mismatch between the reset threshold and\nthe amplitude displacement at the folding time and we refer to a continuous\ntransition period in the implementation of a reset as folding transient. Both\nthese effects are motivated by our hardware experiments and also occur in\nprevious, domain-specific applications. We show that the effect of hysteresis\nis beneficial for the USF and we leverage it to derive the first recovery\nguarantees in the context of our generalized USF model. Additionally, we show\nhow the proposed recovery can be directly generalized for the case of lower\nsampling rates. Our theoretical work is corroborated by hardware experiments\nthat are based on a hysteresis enabled, modulo ADC testbed comprising\noff-the-shelf electronic components. Thus, by capitalizing on a collaboration\nbetween hardware and algorithms, our paper enables an end-to-end pipeline for\nHDR sampling allowing more flexible hardware implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

However, the high-level textual information learned from\ncaption pretraining alone cannot effectively encode the details required for\npixel-wise segmentation. To address this, we propose a cross-modal\npseudo-labeling framework, which generates training pseudo masks by aligning\nword semantics in captions with visual features of object masks in images.\nThus, our framework is capable of labeling novel classes in captions via their\nword semantics to self-train a student model.

However,\nCD is usually insensitive to mismatched local density, and EMD is usually\ndominated by global distribution while overlooks the fidelity of detailed\nstructures. Besides, their unbounded value range induces a heavy influence from\nthe outliers. These defects prevent them from providing a consistent\nevaluation. To tackle these problems, we propose a new similarity measure named\nDensity-aware Chamfer Distance (DCD). It is derived from CD and benefits from\nseveral desirable properties: 1) it can detect disparity of density\ndistributions and is thus a more intensive measure of similarity compared to\nCD; 2) it is stricter with detailed structures and significantly more\ncomputationally efficient than EMD; 3) the bounded value range encourages a\nmore stable and reasonable evaluation over the whole test set. We adopt DCD to\nevaluate the point cloud completion task, where experimental results show that\nDCD pays attention to both the overall structure and local geometric details\nand provides a more reliable evaluation even when CD and EMD contradict each\nother. We can also use DCD as the training loss, which outperforms the same\nmodel trained with CD loss on all three metrics. In addition, we propose a\nnovel point discriminator module that estimates the priority for another guided\ndown-sampling step, and it achieves noticeable improvements under DCD together\nwith competitive results for both CD and EMD.

Most existing works attempt to solve both\nissues by exploiting spatial and temporal relationships. However, those works\nignore the fact that it is an inverse problem where multiple feasible solutions\n(i.e., hypotheses) exist. To relieve this limitation, we propose a\nMulti-Hypothesis Transformer (MHFormer) that learns spatio-temporal\nrepresentations of multiple plausible pose hypotheses. In order to effectively\nmodel multi-hypothesis dependencies and build strong relationships across\nhypothesis features, the task is decomposed into three stages: (i) Generate\nmultiple initial hypothesis representations; (ii) Model self-hypothesis\ncommunication, merge multiple hypotheses into a single converged representation\nand then partition it into several diverged hypotheses; (iii) Learn\ncross-hypothesis communication and aggregate the multi-hypothesis features to\nsynthesize the final 3D pose. Through the above processes, the final\nrepresentation is enhanced and the synthesized pose is much more accurate.\nExtensive experiments show that MHFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on\ntwo challenging datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.

When combined to\nprevious data, we obtain a grand total of 185 stars homogeneously analysed in\nNGC 6388 from high-resolution spectroscopy. The average radial velocity of the\n185 stars is 81.2+/-0.7, rms = 9.4 km/s. We obtain an average metallicity\n[Fe/H]=-0.480 dex, rms = 0.045 dex (35 stars) and [Fe/H]=-0.488 dex, rms =\n0.040 dex (150 stars) from the UVES and GIRAFFE samples, respectively.\nComparing these values to internal errors in abundance, we exclude the presence\nof a significant intrinsic metallicity spread within the cluster. Since about a\nthird of giants in NGC 6388 is claimed to belong to the \"anomalous red giants\"\nin the HST pseudo-colour map defining the so-called type-II GCs, we conclude\nthat either enhanced metallicity is not a necessary requisite to explain this\nclassification (as also suggested by the null iron spread for NGC 362) or NGC\n6388 is not a type-II globular cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

Once they reach the zero-age main sequence, their\nglobal rotation rate decreases during the main sequence until at least the\nsolar age, approximately following the empirical Skumanich's law and enabling\ngyrochronology. Older solar-type stars might then reach a point of transition\nwhen they stop braking, according to recent results of asteroseismology.\nAdditionally, recent 3D numerical simulations of solar-type stars show that\ndifferent regimes of differential rotation can be characterized with the Rossby\nnumber. In particular, anti-solar differential rotation (fast poles, slow\nequator) may exist for high Rossby number (slow rotators). If this regime\noccurs during the main sequence and, in general, for slow rotators, we may\nconsider how magnetic generation through the dynamo process might be impacted.\nIn particular, we consider whether slowly rotating stars are indeed subject to\nmagnetic cycles.\n  We find that kinematic $\\alpha$ $\\Omega$ dynamos allow for the presence of\nmagnetic cycles and global polarity reversals for both rotation regimes, but\nonly if the $\\alpha$-effect is saddled on the tachocline. If it is distributed\nin the convection zone, solar-type cases still possess a cycle and anti-solar\ncases do not. Conversely, we have not found any possibility for sustaining a\nmagnetic cycle with the traditional Babcock-Leighton flux-transport dynamos in\nthe anti-solar differential rotation regime due to flux addition. Graphic\ninterpretations are proposed in order to illustrate these cases. However, we\nfind that hybrid models containing both prescriptions can still sustain local\npolarity reversals at some latitudes.\n  We conclude that stars in the anti-solar differential rotation regime can\nsustain magnetic cycles only for very specific dynamo processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 19:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Earlier numerical studies have\nfound that the Galactic magnetic field and radiative cooling strongly affects\naccretion.

This represents a HVC that has\ncondensed out of the corona. We include the magnetic field in the corona to\nexamine its effect on accretion of the HVC and its associated cold gas.\nRemnants of the original cloud survive in all cases, although a strong magnetic\nfield causes it to split into several fragments. We find that mixing of cold\nand hot gas leads to cooling of coronal gas and an overall growth with time in\ncold gas mass, despite the low metallicity of the cloud and corona. The role of\nthe magnetic field is to (moderately to severely) suppress the mixing and\nsubsequent cooling, which in turn leads to less accretion compared to when the\nfield is absent. A stronger field leads to less suppression of condensation\nbecause it enhances Rayleigh-Taylor instability. However, magnetic tension in a\nstronger field substantially decelerates condensed cloudlets. These have\nvelocities typically a factor 3-8 below the velocity of the main cloud remnants\nby the end of the simulation.

During the\nepisode, hundreds of young massive stars formed in a disc orbiting Sgr A* in\nthe central half parsec. The recent discovery of a hypervelocity star S5-HVS1,\nejected by Sgr A* five Myr ago with a velocity vector consistent with the disc,\nsuggests that this event also produced binary star disruptions. The initial\nstellar disc has to be rather eccentric for this to occur. Such eccentric disks\ncan form from the tidal disruptions of molecular clouds. Here we perform\nsimulations of such disruptions, focusing on gas clouds on rather radial\ninitial orbits. As a result, stars formed in our simulations are on very\neccentric orbits ($\\bar{e}\\sim 0.6$) with a lopsided configuration. For some\nclouds counter-rotating stars are formed.

In an effort to understand these intriguing modifications, both\nexperimental and theoretical studies have focused on the ultrafast dynamics of\nvibrational polaritons. Here, following our recent work [J. Chem. Phys., 154,\n094124, (2021)], we systematically study the mechanism of polariton relaxation\nfor liquid CO2 under a weak external pumping. Classical cavity molecular\ndynamics (CavMD) simulations show that polariton relaxation results from the\ncombined effects of (i) cavity loss through the photonic component and (ii)\ndephasing of the bright-mode component to vibrational dark modes as mediated by\nintermolecular interactions. The latter polaritonic dephasing rate is\nproportional to the product of the weight of the bright mode in the polariton\nwave function and the spectral overlap between the polariton and dark modes.\nBoth these factors are sensitive to parameters such as the Rabi splitting and\ncavity mode detuning. Compared to a Fermi's golden rule calculation based on a\ntight-binding harmonic model, CavMD yields a similar parameter dependence for\nthe upper polariton relaxation lifetime but sometimes a modest disagreement for\nthe lower polariton. We suggest that this disagreement results from\npolariton-enhanced molecular nonlinear absorption due to molecular\nanharmonicity, which is not included in our analytical model. We also summarize\nrecent progress on probing nonreactive VSC dynamics with CavMD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 20:05:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 19:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

Most of these systems are nonlinear and demonstrate\nregular and chaotic behavior, different from the behavior of memoryless\nsystems. Finding periodic solutions is essential for understanding the regular\nand chaotic behavior of nonlinear systems. Fractional systems do not have\nperiodic solutions except fixed points. Instead, they have asymptotically\nperiodic solutions which, in the case of stable regular behavior, converge to\nthe periodic sinks (similar to regular dissipative systems) and, in the case of\nunstable/chaotic behavior, act as repellers. In one of his recent papers, the\nfirst author derived equations that allow calculations of asymptotically\nperiodic points for a wide class of discrete maps with memory.

In comparison to traditional semiconductor control\nelectronics (TSCE) located at room temperature, the signals generated by\nJosephson junction (JJ) based rf sources benefit from small device sizes, low\npower dissipation, intrinsic calibration, superior reproducibility, and\ninsensitivity to ambient fluctuations. Previous experiments to co-locate qubits\nand JJ-based control electronics resulted in quasiparticle poisoning of the\nqubit; degrading the qubit's coherence and lifetime.

Typical\nImbalanced Learning (IL) methods balance the data via intuitive class-wise\nresampling or reweighting. However, previous studies suggest that beyond\nclass-imbalance, intrinsic data difficulty factors like overlapping, noise, and\nsmall disjuncts also play critical roles. To handle them, many solutions have\nbeen proposed (e.g., noise removal, borderline sampling, hard example mining)\nbut are still confined to a specific factor and cannot generalize to broader\nscenarios, which raises an interesting question: how to handle both\nclass-agnostic difficulties and the class-imbalance in a unified way? To answer\nthis, we consider both class-imbalance and its orthogonal: intra-class\nimbalance, i.e., the imbalanced distribution over easy and hard samples. Such\ndistribution naturally reflects the complex influence of class-agnostic\nintrinsic data difficulties thus providing a new unified view for identifying\nand handling these factors during learning.

Ecologists use camera traps to remotely survey for the presence\nof specific animal species. Previous studies have shown that deep learning\nmodels can be trained to automatically detect and classify animals within\ncamera trap imagery with high levels of confidence. However, the ability to\ntrain these models is reliant upon having enough high-quality training data.\nWhat happens when the animal is rare or the data sets are non-existent? This\nresearch proposes an approach of using images of rare animals in captivity\n(focusing on the Scottish wildcat) to generate the training dataset. We explore\nthe challenges associated with generalising a model trained on captivity data\nwhen applied to data collected in the wild. The research is contextualised by\nthe needs of ecologists in planning/engineering. Following precedents from\nother research, this project establishes an ensemble for object detection,\nimage segmentation and image classification models which are then tested using\ndifferent image manipulation and class structuring techniques to encourage\nmodel generalisation. The research concludes, in the context of Scottish\nwildcat, that models trained on captivity imagery cannot be generalised to wild\ncamera trap imagery using existing techniques. However, final model\nperformances based on a two-class model Wildcat vs Not Wildcat achieved an\noverall accuracy score of 81.6% and Wildcat accuracy score of 54.8% on a test\nset in which only 1% of images contained a wildcat. This suggests using\ncaptivity images is feasible with further research. This is the first research\nwhich attempts to generate a training set based on captivity data and the first\nto explore the development of such models in the context of ecologists in\nplanning/engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 21:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

Recent foundation models (FMs)\nare robust to many distribution shifts and, therefore, should substantially\nimprove the performance of DG. In this work, we study generic ways to adopt\nCLIP, a Visual-Language Foundation Model, for DG problems in image\nclassification. While ERM greatly improves the accuracy with bigger backbones\nand training datasets using standard DG benchmarks, fine-tuning FMs is not\npractical in many real-world situations. We propose Domain Prompt Learning\n(DPL) as a novel approach for domain inference in the form of conditional\nprompt generation. DPL achieved a significant accuracy improvement with only\ntraining a lightweight prompt generator (a three-layer MLP), whose parameter is\nof equivalent scale to the classification projector in the previous DG\nliterature.

Such a detailed picture of the dislocation system enables mesoscale\nplasticity simulations based on dislocation properties.

An\nadditional benefit of our method is that the instance segmentation results of\nany number of people can be directly obtained from the supervised attention\nmatrix, thereby simplifying the pixel assignment pipeline.

Most existing models generate molecules by\nsequentially adding atoms. This often renders generated molecules with less\ncorrelation with target properties and low synthetic accessibility. Molecular\nfragments such as functional groups are more closely related to molecular\nproperties and synthetic accessibility than atoms. Here, we propose a\nfragment-based molecular generative model which designs new molecules with\ntarget properties by sequentially adding molecular fragments to any given\nstarting molecule. A key feature of our model is a high generalization ability\nin terms of property control and fragment types. The former becomes possible by\nlearning the contribution of individual fragments to the target properties in\nan auto-regressive manner. For the latter, we used a deep neural network that\npredicts the bonding probability of two molecules from the embedding vectors of\nthe two molecules as input.

Land planets also have the advantage of avoiding\nglobal freezing due to drier tropics, leading to a lower planetary albedo. In\nthis study, we systematically investigate the complete freezing limit for\nvarious surface water distribution using a three-dimensional dynamic\natmospheric model. As in a previous study, we found that a land planet climate\nhas dry tropics that result in less snow and fewer clouds. The complete\nfreezing limit decreases from that for aqua planets (92% S0, where S0 is\nEarth's present insolation) to that for land planets (77% S0) with an\nincreasing dry area. Values for the complete freezing limit for zonally uniform\nsurface water distributions are consistently lower than those for meridionally\nuniform surface water distribution. This is because the surface water\ndistribution in the tropics in the meridionally uniform cases causes ice-albedo\nfeedback until a planet lapses into the complete freezing state. For a surface\nwater distribution using the topographies of the terrestrial planets, the\ncomplete freezing limit has values near those for the meridionally uniform\ncases.

The invariant\nenergy quadratization (IEQ) method has been widely used to design energy stable\nnumerical schemes for phase-field or gradient flow models. Although there are\nmany merits of the IEQ method, one major disadvantage is that the IEQ method\nusually respects a modified energy law, where the modified energy is expressed\nin the auxiliary variables. Still, the dissipation laws in terms of the\noriginal energy are not guaranteed. Using the widely-used Cahn-Hilliard\nequation as an example, we demonstrate that the Runge-Kutta IEQ method indeed\ncan preserve the original energy dissipation laws for certain situations up to\narbitrary high-order accuracy. Interested readers are highly encouraged to\napply our idea to other phase-field equations or gradient flow models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 05:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

In empirical studies, researchers often adopt a\ntwo-stage procedure to first estimate the centrality and then infer the network\neffect using the estimated centrality. Despite its prevalent adoption, this\ntwo-stage procedure lacks theoretical backing and can fail in both estimation\nand inference. We, therefore, propose a unified framework, under which we prove\nthe shortcomings of the two-stage in centrality estimation and the undesirable\nconsequences in the regression. We then propose a novel supervised network\ncentrality estimation (SuperCENT) methodology that simultaneously yields\nsuperior estimations of the centrality and the network effect and provides\nvalid and narrower confidence intervals than those from the two-stage.

To provide personalized high quality recommendation results,\nconventional systems usually train pointwise rankers to predict the absolute\nvalue of objectives and leverage a distinct shallow tower to estimate and\nalleviate the impact of position bias. However, with such a training paradigm,\nthe optimization target differs a lot from the ranking metrics valuing the\nrelative order of top ranked items rather than the prediction precision of each\nitem. Moreover, as the existing system tends to recommend more relevant items\nat higher positions, it is difficult for the shallow tower based methods to\nprecisely attribute the user feedback to the impact of position or relevance.\nTherefore, there exists an exciting opportunity for us to get enhanced\nperformance if we manage to solve the aforementioned issues. Unbiased learning\nto rank algorithms, which are verified to model the relative relevance\naccurately based on noisy feedback, are appealing candidates and have already\nbeen applied in many applications with single categorical labels, such as user\nclick signals. Nevertheless, the existing unbiased LTR methods cannot properly\nhandle multiple feedback incorporating both categorical and continuous labels.\nAccordingly, we design a novel unbiased LTR algorithm to tackle the challenges,\nwhich innovatively models position bias in the pairwise fashion and introduces\nthe pairwise trust bias to separate the position bias, trust bias, and user\nrelevance explicitly.

Existing\nmethods mostly use the posterior penalty for dangerous actions, which means\nthat the agent is not penalized until experiencing danger. This fact causes\nthat the agent cannot learn a zero-violation policy even after convergence.\nOtherwise, it would not receive any penalty and lose the knowledge about\ndanger. In this paper, we propose the safe set actor-critic (SSAC) algorithm,\nwhich confines the policy update using safety-oriented energy functions, or the\nsafety indexes. The safety index is designed to increase rapidly for\npotentially dangerous actions, which allows us to locate the safe set on the\naction space, or the control safe set. Therefore, we can identify the dangerous\nactions prior to taking them, and further obtain a zero constraint-violation\npolicy after convergence.We claim that we can learn the energy function in a\nmodel-free manner similar to learning a value function. By using the energy\nfunction transition as the constraint objective, we formulate a constrained RL\nproblem.

An\ninevitable challenge with the use of IPW is that the IPW estimator can be\nremarkably unstable if some probabilities are very close to zero. To overcome\nthis problem, at least three remedies have been developed in the literature:\nstabilizing, thresholding, and trimming. However the final estimators are still\nIPW type estimators, and inevitably inherit certain weaknesses of the naive IPW\nestimator: they may still be unstable or biased. We propose a biased-sample\nempirical likelihood weighting (ELW) method to serve the same general purpose\nas IPW, while completely overcoming the instability of IPW-type estimators by\ncircumventing the use of inverse probabilities. The ELW weights are always well\ndefined and easy to implement.

Its asymptotic normality is also established under unequal\nprobability sampling with replacement.

This method relies on\nsubjecting the target system to a set of external fields, each of which\nconsists of two parts, i.e., a weak spatiotemporally slowly-varying component\non top of a constant offset. The fields are chosen in such a way, so that they\nrespectively induce slow variations in the wave vector describing the bulk band\nstructure, as well as a parameter which allows tuning the bulk gap. Such a\nprocess maps the Berry singularities of the base space to a synthetic space\nspanned by the parameters related to the external fields. By measuring the\nresponse of the system to the weak part of the perturbations, when these are\nadditionally chosen to form spacetime textures, one can construct a quantity\nthat is here-termed Berry singularity marker (BSM). The BSM enables the Berry\nsingularity detection as it becomes nonzero only in the close vicinity of a\nBerry singularity and is equal to its charge. The calculation of the BSM\nrequires the measurement of the susceptibility tensor for the applied external\nfields. Near the Berry singularities, the BSM is dominated by a universal\nvalue, which is determined by the quantum metric tensor of the system. While in\nthis work I restrict to 1D AIII insulators, the proposed approach is general.\nNotably, a key feature of the present method is that it can be implemented in a\nlock-in fashion, that is, one can \"filter out\" from the BSM any possible\ncontribution from disorder by performing more measurements. Hence, the present\nconstruction paves the way for a disorder resilient diagnosis of topological\nphase transitions, that appears particularly relevant for disordered\ntopological insulator and hybrid Majorana platforms, while it can be readily\nimplemented using topo-electric circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 07:46:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 20:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

Deep\nlearning's phenomenal success has been hoped to be interpreted via fundamental\nresearch on the theory of deep learning. Accordingly, applied research on deep\nlearning has spurred the theory of deep learning-oriented depth and breadth of\ndevelopments. Inspired by such developments, we pose these fundamental\nquestions: can we accurately approximate an arbitrary matrix-vector product\nusing deep rectified linear unit (ReLU) feedforward neural networks (FNNs)?

To this\nend, data poisoning based backdoor attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) in\nthe production stage (or training stage) and corresponding defenses are\nextensively explored in recent years. Ironically, backdoor attacks in the\ndeployment stage, which can often happen in unprofessional users' devices and\nare thus arguably far more threatening in real-world scenarios, draw much less\nattention of the community. We attribute this imbalance of vigilance to the\nweak practicality of existing deployment-stage backdoor attack algorithms and\nthe insufficiency of real-world attack demonstrations. To fill the blank, in\nthis work, we study the realistic threat of deployment-stage backdoor attacks\non DNNs. We base our study on a commonly used deployment-stage attack paradigm\n-- adversarial weight attack, where adversaries selectively modify model\nweights to embed backdoor into deployed DNNs. To approach realistic\npracticality, we propose the first gray-box and physically realizable weights\nattack algorithm for backdoor injection, namely subnet replacement attack\n(SRA), which only requires architecture information of the victim model and can\nsupport physical triggers in the real world. Extensive experimental simulations\nand system-level real-world attack demonstrations are conducted.

For a fair and lawful\nredistribution of surplus the insurer needs to decompose the total portfolio\nsurplus with respect to the contributions of individual policies and with\nrespect to different risk sources. For this task, actuaries have a number of\nheuristic decomposition formulas, but an overarching decomposition principle is\nstill missing. This paper fills that gap by introducing a so-called ISU\ndecomposition principle that bases on infinitesimal sequential updates of the\ninsurer's valuation basis. It is shown that the existing heuristic\ndecomposition formulas can be replicated as ISU decompositions. Furthermore,\nalternative decomposition principles and their relation to the ISU\ndecomposition principle are discussed.

First-principles methods such as density functional theory (DFT)\nare often used to compute the enthalpies of TiO$_2$ phases at 0~K, but they are\nexpensive and thus impractical for long time-scale and large system-size\nsimulations at finite temperatures. On the other hand, cheap empirical\npotentials fail to capture the relative stablities of the various polymorphs.\nTo model the thermodynamic behaviors of ambient and high-pressure phases of\nTiO$_2$, we design an empirical model as a baseline, and then train a machine\nlearning potential based on the difference between the DFT data and the\nempirical model. This so-called $\\Delta$-learning potential contains long-range\nelectrostatic interactions, and predicts the 0~K enthalpies of stable TiO$_2$\nphases that are in good agreement with DFT. We construct a pressure-temperature\nphase diagram of TiO$_2$ in the range $0<P<70$~GPa and $100<T<1500$~K. We then\nsimulate dynamic phase transition processes, by compressing anatase at\ndifferent temperatures. At 300~K, we observe predominantly\nanatase-to-baddeleyite transformation at about 20~GPa, via a martensitic\ntwo-step mechanism with highly ordered and collective atomic motion. At 2000~K,\nanatase can transform into cotunnite around 45-55~GPa in a thermally-activated\nand probabilistic manner, accompanied by diffusive movement of oxygen atoms.\nThe pressures computed for these transitions show good agreement with\nexperiments. Our results shed light on how to synthesize and stabilize\nhigh-pressure TiO$_2$ phases, and our method is generally applicable to other\nfunctional materials with multiple polymorphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 08:41:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

In recent years, a series of works have\nproposed automatic and realistic bokeh rendering methods for artistic and\naesthetic purposes. They usually employ cutting-edge data-driven deep\ngenerative networks with complex training strategies and network architectures.\nHowever, these works neglect that the bokeh effect, as a real phenomenon, can\ninevitably affect the subsequent visual intelligent tasks like recognition, and\ntheir data-driven nature prevents them from studying the influence of\nbokeh-related physical parameters (i.e., depth-of-the-field) on the intelligent\ntasks. To fill this gap, we study a totally new problem, i.e., natural &\nadversarial bokeh rendering, which consists of two objectives: rendering\nrealistic and natural bokeh and fooling the visual perception models (i.e.,\nbokeh-based adversarial attack). To this end, beyond the pure data-driven\nsolution, we propose a hybrid alternative by taking the respective advantages\nof data-driven and physical-aware methods. Specifically, we propose the\ncircle-of-confusion predictive network (CoCNet) by taking the all-in-focus\nimage and depth image as inputs to estimate circle-of-confusion parameters for\neach pixel, which are employed to render the final image through a well-known\nphysical model of bokeh. With the hybrid solution, our method could achieve\nmore realistic rendering results with the naive training strategy and a much\nlighter network.

The induced operator is later executed to predict the\nanswer's representation, and the choice most similar to the prediction is\nselected as the solution.

In particular, regarding the methodology, we\nprovide two techniques: the former is an adaptation of the transport PDE to the\ncase, while the latter is an extension of Guerra's interpolation breakthrough.\nBeyond coherence among the results, either in replica symmetric and in the\none-step replica symmetry breaking level of description, we prove the Gardner's\npicture and we identify the maximal storage capacity by a ground-state analysis\nin the Baldi-Venkatesh high-storage regime.\n  In the second part of the paper we investigate the glassy structure of these\nnetworks: in contrast with the replica symmetric scenario (RS), RSB actually\nstabilizes the spin-glass phase. We report huge differences w.r.t. the standard\npairwise Hopfield limit: in particular, it is known that it is possible to\nexpress the free energy of the Hopfield neural network as a linear combination\nof the free energies of an hard spin glass (i.e. the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick\nmodel) and a soft spin glass (the Gaussian or \"spherical\" model). This is no\nlonger true when interactions are more than pairwise (whatever the level of\ndescription, RS or RSB): for dense networks solely the free energy of the hard\nspin glass survives, proving a huge diversity in the underlying glassiness of\nassociative neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 10:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Then, we\ntrain a bandwidth allocation network using reinforcement learning (RL) that\noptimizes the allocation of limited available channel bandwidth among video\nframes to maximize overall visual quality. Our results show that DeepWiVe can\novercome the cliff-effect, which is prevalent in conventional separation-based\ndigital communication schemes, and achieve graceful degradation with the\nmismatch between the estimated and actual channel qualities. DeepWiVe\noutperforms H.264 video compression followed by low-density parity check (LDPC)\ncodes in all channel conditions by up to 0.0462 on average in terms of the\nmulti-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), while beating H.265\n+ LDPC by up to 0.0058 on average. We also illustrate the importance of\noptimizing bandwidth allocation in JSCC video transmission by showing that our\noptimal bandwidth allocation policy is superior to the na\\\"ive uniform\nallocation. We believe this is an important step towards fulfilling the\npotential of an end-to-end optimized JSCC wireless video transmission system\nthat is superior to the current separation-based designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 11:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

Functional array programming languages with patterns like map\nand reduce have been successfully combined with term rewriting to define and\nexplore optimization spaces. However, deciding what sequence of rewrites to\napply is hard and has a huge impact on the performance of the rewritten\nprogram. Equality saturation avoids the issue by exploring many possible ways\nto apply rewrites, efficiently representing many equivalent programs in an\ne-graph data structure.\n  Equality saturation has some limitations when rewriting functional language\nterms, as currently naive encodings of the lambda calculus are used. We present\nnew techniques for encoding polymorphically typed lambda calculi, and show that\nthe efficient encoding reduces the runtime and memory consumption of equality\nsaturation by orders of magnitude.\n  Moreover, equality saturation does not yet scale to complex compiler\noptimizations.

The mean flow is obtained as the solution of the Reynolds-Averaged\nNavier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The equations governing the coherent\nperturbations are linearised and solved in the frequency domain. To account for\nthe effect of turbulence on the coherent perturbations, a frozen eddy viscosity\nmodel is employed.

This paper focuses on the vehicle routing problem\nwith drones and drone speed selection (VRPD-DSS), which considers\nspeed-dependent energy consumption and drone-charging in detail. For this\npurpose, we formulate a comprehensive mixed-integer problem that aims to\nminimize the operational costs consisting of fuel consumption costs of the\ntrucks, labor costs for the drivers, and energy costs of the drones. The speed\nat which a drone performs a flight must be selected from a discrete set. We\nintroduce preprocessing steps to eliminate dominated speeds for a flight to\nreduce the problem size and use valid inequalities to accelerate the solution\nprocess. The consideration of speed-dependent energy consumption leads to the\nfact that it is advisable to perform different flights at different speeds and\nnot to consistently operate a drone at maximum speed. Instead, drone speed\nshould be selected to balance drone range and speed of delivery. Our extensive\ncomputational study of a rural real-world setting shows that, by modeling\nenergy consumption realistically, the savings in operational costs compared to\ntruck-only delivery are significant but smaller than those identified in\npreviously published work. Our analysis further reveals that the greatest\nsavings stem from the fact that overall delivery time decreases compared to\ntruck-only delivery, allowing costly truck-driver time to be reduced. The\nadditional energy costs of the drone, however, are largely negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 12:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

Shared-nothing (SN) parallelism is the\nde-facto standard to scale stream processing applications. Given an\napplication, SN parallelism instantiates several copies of each analysis task,\nmaking each instance responsible for a dedicated portion of the overall\nanalysis, and relies on dedicated queues to exchange data among connected\ninstances. On the one hand, SN parallelism can scale the execution of\napplications both up and out since threads can run task instances within and\nacross processes/nodes. On the other hand, its lack of sharing can cause\nunnecessary overheads and hinder the scaling up when threads operate on data\nthat could be jointly accessed in shared memory. This trade-off motivated us in\nstudying a way for stream processing applications to leverage shared memory and\nboost the scale up (before the scale out) while adhering to the widely-adopted\nand SN-based APIs for stream processing applications.\n  We introduce STRETCH, a framework that maximizes the scale up and offers\ninstantaneous elastic reconfigurations (without state transfer) for stream\nprocessing applications.

The effects of reaction time, temperature\nand excess ligands is studied. The neck filling process follows an\nintraparticle ripening mechanism at relatively mild reaction conditions while\navoiding inter-particle ripening. The degree of surface ligand passivation\nplays a key role in activating the surface atom diffusion to the neck region.\nThe degree of neck filling strongly depends also on the initial relative\norientation of the two CQDs, where homonymous plane attachment allows for\nfacile neck growth, unlike the case of heteronymous plane attachment. Upon\nneck-filling, the observed red-shift of the absorption and fluorescence\nmeasured both for ensemble and single dimers, is assigned to enhanced\nhybridization of the confined wavefunction in CQD dimer molecules, as supported\nby quantum calculations. The fine tuning of the particle interface introduced\nherein provides therefore a powerful tool to further control the extent of\nhybridization and coupling in CQD molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 12:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

The principle of the MRP can be described on the basis of an\nidealized geometry that is particularly suited for theoretical investigations.\nIn a pressure regime of a few Pa or lower, kinetic effects become important,\nwhich can not be predicted by the Drude model.

Similar to particle-in-cell, the spectral kinetic method iteratively\ndetermines the electric field at each particle position, however, without\nemploying any numerical grids.

Specifically, we present BoxeR, short for Box\nTransformer, which attends to a set of boxes by predicting their transformation\nfrom a reference window on an input feature map. The BoxeR computes attention\nweights on these boxes by considering its grid structure. Notably, BoxeR-2D\nnaturally reasons about box information within its attention module, making it\nsuitable for end-to-end instance detection and segmentation tasks. By learning\ninvariance to rotation in the box-attention module, BoxeR-3D is capable of\ngenerating discriminative information from a bird's-eye view plane for 3D\nend-to-end object detection.

Using the same framework, we approximate BSDFs as\npre-trained $n$D mixtures, where $n$ is the number of BSDF parameters. Such an\napproach addresses two major challenges in path-guiding models. First, the $5$D\nradiance representation naturally captures correlation between the spatial and\ndirectional dimensions. Such correlations are present in e.g. parallax and\ncaustics. Second, by using a tangent-space parameterization of Gaussians, our\nspatio-directional mixtures can perform approximate product sampling with\narbitrarily oriented BSDFs. Existing models are only able to do this by either\nforegoing anisotropy of the mixture components or by representing the radiance\nfield in local (normal aligned) coordinates, which both make the radiance field\nmore difficult to learn. An additional benefit of the tangent-space\nparameterization is that each individual Gaussian is mapped to the solid sphere\nwith low distortion near its center of mass.

In this article, we advance the theoretical debate on social networks\nas a source of social support by moving beyond the distinction between positive\nand negative ties. We do so by proposing the concepts of relational ambivalence\nand consistency, which describe the interactive processes by which people,\nintentionally or inadvertently, disregard or align with each other role\nrelational expectations, therefore undermining or reinforcing individual\nchoices of action. We analyse the qualitative accounts of nineteen female\nvictims of domestic violence in Sweden, who described the responses of their\npersonal networks during and after the abuse. We observe how the relationships\nembedded in these networks were described in ambivalent and consistent terms,\nand how they played a role in supporting or undermining women in reframing\ntheir loving relationships as abusive; in accounting or dismissing perpetrators\nresponsibilities for the abuse; in relieving women from role expectations and\nobligations or in burdening them with further responsibilities; and in\nsupporting or challenging their pathways out of domestic abuse. Our analysis\nsuggests that social isolation cannot be considered a simple result of a lack\nof support but of the complex dynamics in which support is offered and accepted\nor withdrawn and refused.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 14:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

In particular, image-to-image (I2I) translation\nis a generic and widely used approach to image processing problems, such as\nimage synthesis, style transfer, and image restoration. At the same time,\nneural image compression has emerged as a data-driven alternative to\ntraditional coding approaches in visual communications. In this paper, we study\nthe combination of these two paradigms into a joint I2I compression and\ntranslation framework, focusing on multi-domain image synthesis. We first\npropose distributed I2I translation by integrating quantization and entropy\ncoding into an I2I translation framework (i.e. I2Icodec). In practice, the\nimage compression functionality (i.e. autoencoding) is also desirable,\nrequiring to deploy alongside I2Icodec a regular image codec. Thus, we further\npropose a unified framework that allows both translation and autoencoding\ncapabilities in a single codec. Adaptive residual blocks conditioned on the\ntranslation/compression mode provide flexible adaptation to the desired\nfunctionality. The experiments show promising results in both I2I translation\nand image compression using a single model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 14:44:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 09:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Given its simplicity and high quality rendering, many NeRF\napplications are being developed. However, NeRF's big limitation is its slow\nspeed. Many attempts are made to speeding up NeRF training and inference,\nincluding intricate code-level optimization and caching, use of sophisticated\ndata structures, and amortization through multi-task and meta learning. In this\nwork, we revisit the basic building blocks of NeRF through the lens of classic\ntechniques before NeRF. We propose Voxel-Accelearated NeRF (VaxNeRF),\nintegrating NeRF with visual hull, a classic 3D reconstruction technique only\nrequiring binary foreground-background pixel labels per image. Visual hull,\nwhich can be optimized in about 10 seconds, can provide coarse in-out field\nseparation to omit substantial amounts of network evaluations in NeRF. We\nprovide a clean fully-pythonic, JAX-based implementation on the popular JaxNeRF\ncodebase, consisting of only about 30 lines of code changes and a modular\nvisual hull subroutine, and achieve about 2-8x faster learning on top of the\nhighly-performative JaxNeRF baseline with zero degradation in rendering\nquality. With sufficient compute, this effectively brings down full NeRF\ntraining from hours to 30 minutes. We hope VaxNeRF -- a careful combination of\na classic technique with a deep method (that arguably replaced it) -- can\nempower and accelerate new NeRF extensions and applications, with its\nsimplicity, portability, and reliable performance gains.

However, in\nthe real world, agents learn in many environments and always come with prior\nexperiences as they explore new ones. Exploration is a lifelong process. In\nthis paper, we propose a paradigm change in the formulation and evaluation of\ntask-agnostic exploration. In this setup, the agent first learns to explore\nacross many environments without any extrinsic goal in a task-agnostic manner.\nLater on, the agent effectively transfers the learned exploration policy to\nbetter explore new environments when solving tasks. In this context, we\nevaluate several baseline exploration strategies and present a simple yet\neffective approach to learning task-agnostic exploration policies. Our key idea\nis that there are two components of exploration: (1) an agent-centric component\nencouraging exploration of unseen parts of the environment based on an agent's\nbelief; (2) an environment-centric component encouraging exploration of\ninherently interesting objects. We show that our formulation is effective and\nprovides the most consistent exploration across several training-testing\nenvironment pairs.

A direct\napplication of back-propagation to spiking neural networks contains\nbiologically implausible components, like the weight transport problem or\nseparate inference and learning phases. Various methods address different\ncomponents individually, but a complete solution remains intangible. Here, we\ntake an alternate approach that avoids back-propagation and its associated\nissues entirely. Recent work in deep learning proposed independently training\neach layer of a network via the information bottleneck (IB). Subsequent studies\nnoted that this layer-wise approach circumvents error propagation across\nlayers, leading to a biologically plausible paradigm. Unfortunately, the IB is\ncomputed using a batch of samples. The prior work addresses this with a weight\nupdate that only uses two samples (the current and previous sample). Our work\ntakes a different approach by decomposing the weight update into a local and\nglobal component. The local component is Hebbian and only depends on the\ncurrent sample. The global component computes a layer-wise modulatory signal\nthat depends on a batch of samples. We show that this modulatory signal can be\nlearned by an auxiliary circuit with working memory (WM) like a reservoir.\nThus, we can use batch sizes greater than two, and the batch size determines\nthe required capacity of the WM. To the best of our knowledge, our rule is the\nfirst biologically plausible mechanism to directly couple synaptic updates with\na WM of the task.

They typically construct a static\nspatial graph at each time step and then connect each node with itself between\nadjacent time steps to construct the spatio-temporal graph. In such a graph,\nthe correlations between different nodes at different time steps are not\nexplicitly reflected, which may restrict the learning ability of graph neural\nnetworks. Meanwhile, those models ignore the dynamic spatio-temporal\ncorrelations among nodes as they use the same adjacency matrix at different\ntime steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Joint\nGraph Convolutional Networks (STJGCN) for traffic forecasting over several time\nsteps ahead on a road network. Specifically, we construct both pre-defined and\nadaptive spatio-temporal joint graphs (STJGs) between any two time steps, which\nrepresent comprehensive and dynamic spatio-temporal correlations. We further\ndesign dilated causal spatio-temporal joint graph convolution layers on STJG to\ncapture the spatio-temporal dependencies from distinct perspectives with\nmultiple ranges. A multi-range attention mechanism is proposed to aggregate the\ninformation of different ranges. Experiments on four public traffic datasets\ndemonstrate that STJGCN is computationally efficient and outperforms 11\nstate-of-the-art baseline methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 08:45:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 15:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

The advent\nof PLATO will further strengthen such multi-disciplinary studies. Testing\nasteroseismic modelling and its importance for our understanding of planetary\nsystems is crucial. We carried out a detailed modelling of Kepler-93, an\nexoplanet host star observed by Kepler. This star is particularly interesting\nas it is very similar to the PLATO benchmark target (G spectral type, ~ 6000K,\n~ 1 Msun and ~ 1 Rsun) and provides a real-life testbed for potential\nprocedures to be used for PLATO. We use global and local minimization\ntechniques for the seismic modelling of Kepler-93, varying the ingredients of\nour stellar models. We compute seismic inversions of the mean density. We use\nthese revised stellar parameters to provide new planetary parameters and\nsimulate the orbital evolution of the system under the effects of tides and\natmospheric evaporation. Our fundamental parameters for Kepler-93: mean density\n= 1.654 +/- 0.004 g/cm3, M = 0.907 +/- 0.023 Msun , R = 0.918 +/- 0.008 Rsun\nand Age = 6.78 +/- 0.32 Gyr.

According to our simulations, it seems unlikely that\nKepler-93b formed with a mass large enough to be impacted by stellar tides. For\nthe benchmark of PLATO, detailed asteroseismic modelling procedures will be\nable to provide fundamental stellar parameters within the requirements. We\nillustrate what synergies can be achieved regarding the orbital evolution and\natmospheric evaporation of exoplanets.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show how the synthetic\ncontrol method (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003, Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller,\n2010) can be used to assess such (for policy-makers) important price reduction\neffects in urban public transport. Furthermore, we propose an aggregate metric\nthat inherits changes in public transport supply (e.g., frequency increases) to\nassess these demand effects, namely passenger trips per vehicle kilometre. This\nmetric helps us to isolate the impact of price reductions by ensuring that\ncompanies' frequency increases do not affect estimators of interest. In\naddition, we show how to investigate the robustness of results in similar\nsettings. Using a recent statistical method and a different study design, i.e.,\nnot blocking off supply changes as an alternate explanation of the effect,\nleads us to a lower bound of the effect, amounting to an increase of 3.7%.\nFinally, as far as we know, it is the first causal estimate of price reduction\non urban public transport initiated by direct democracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 07:43:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 13:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

Online learning now takes more than one form,\nincluding the use of technology to enhance a face-to-face class, a hybrid class\nthat combines both face-to-face meetings and online work, and fully online\ncourses. Further, online classrooms are usually composed of an online education\nforum (OEF) where students and instructor discuss open-ended questions for\ngaining better understanding of the subject. However, empirical studies have\nrepeatedly shown that the dropout rates in these online courses are very high\npartly due to the lack of motivation among the enrolled students. We undertake\nan empirical comparison of student behavior in OEFs associated with a\ngraduate-level course during two terms. We identify key parameters dictating\nthe dynamics of OEFs like effective incentive design, student heterogeneity,\nand super-posters phenomenon. Motivated by empirical observations, we propose\nan analytical model based on continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) to capture\ninstructor-student interactions in an OEF. Using concepts from lumpability of\nCTMCs, we compute steady state and transient probabilities along with expected\nnet-rewards for the instructor and the students. We formulate a mixed-integer\nlinear program which views an OEF as a single-leader-multiple-followers\nStackelberg game. Through simulations, we observe that students exhibit varied\ndegree of non-monotonicity in their participation (with increasing instructor\ninvolvement). We also study the effect of instructor bias and budget on the\nstudent participation levels. Our model exhibits the empirically observed\nsuper-poster phenomenon under certain parameter configurations and recommends\nan optimal plan to the instructor for maximizing student participation in OEFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 09:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

Such systems are increasingly\nubiquitous, creating benefits - but also undesirable situations where moral\nresponsibility for their actions cannot be properly attributed to any\nparticular person or group. The concept of meaningful human control has been\nproposed to address responsibility gaps and mitigate them by establishing\nconditions that enable a proper attribution of responsibility for humans;\nhowever, clear requirements for researchers, designers, and engineers are yet\ninexistent, making the development of AI-based systems that remain under\nmeaningful human control challenging. In this paper, we address the gap between\nphilosophical theory and engineering practice by identifying, through an\niterative process of abductive thinking, four actionable properties for\nAI-based systems under meaningful human control, which we discuss making use of\ntwo applications scenarios: automated vehicles and AI-based hiring. First, a\nsystem in which humans and AI algorithms interact should have an explicitly\ndefined domain of morally loaded situations within which the system ought to\noperate. Second, humans and AI agents within the system should have appropriate\nand mutually compatible representations. Third, responsibility attributed to a\nhuman should be commensurate with that human's ability and authority to control\nthe system. Fourth, there should be explicit links between the actions of the\nAI agents and actions of humans who are aware of their moral responsibility. We\nargue that these four properties will support practically-minded professionals\nto take concrete steps toward designing and engineering for AI systems that\nfacilitate meaningful human control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 11:05:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 15:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

Advanced controllers such as model predictive\ncontrol and reinforcement learning (RL) control have both advantages and\ndisadvantages that prevent them from being implemented in real world problems.\nComparisons between the two are rare, and often biased.

RL agents that\nlearn from a simplified RBC risk poorer performance as the offline learning\nperiod increases. We also observe no impact on performance from information\nsharing amongst agents.

SNNs usually need tens or even hundreds of time steps during\nthe training and inference process which causes not only the increase of\nlatency but also the waste of energy consumption. To overcome this problem, we\nproposed a novel training method based on backpropagation (BP) for ultra-low\nlatency(1-2 time steps) SNN with multi-threshold.
