If recoils from dark matter are\ndetected by such sensors, their inherent directional sensitivity would allow an\nunambiguous identification of a dark matter signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 16:33:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2022 18:41:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 17:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

We\nwill first recall the fundamentals of machine learning and quantum computing\nand then describe more precisely how to link them through linear algebra: we\nintroduce quantum algorithms to efficiently solve tasks such as matrix product\nor distance estimation. These results are then used to develop new quantum\nalgorithms for unsupervised machine learning, such as k-means and spectral\nclustering. This allows us to define many fundamental procedures, in particular\nin vector and graph analysis. We will also present new quantum algorithms for\nneural networks, or deep learning. For this, we introduce an algorithm to\nperform a quantum convolution product on images, as well as a new way to\nperform a fast tomography on quantum states. We prove that these quantum\nalgorithms are faster versions of equivalent classical algorithms, but exhibit\nrandom effects due to the quantum nature of the computation. Many simulations\nhave been carried out to study these effects and measure their learning\naccuracy on real data. Finally, we will present a quantum orthogonal neural\nnetwork circuit adapted to the currently available small and imperfect quantum\ncomputers. This allows us to perform real experiments to test our theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 16:36:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

Sports and games are common examples of ranked\nsystems: players and teams are constantly ranked using different methods. The\nstatistical properties of rankings have been studied for almost a century in a\nvariety of fields. More recently, data availability has allowed us to study\nrank dynamics: how elements of a ranking change in time. Here, we study the\nrank distributions and rank dynamics of twelve datasets from different sports\nand games. To study rank dynamics, we consider measures we have defined\npreviously: rank diversity, change probability, rank entropy, and rank\ncomplexity. We also introduce a new measure that we call ``system closure''\nthat reflects how many elements enter or leave the rankings in time. We use a\nrandom walk model to reproduce the observed rank dynamics, showing that a\nsimple mechanism can generate similar statistical properties as the ones\nobserved in the datasets. Our results show that, while rank distributions vary\nconsiderably for different rankings, rank dynamics have similar behaviors,\nindependently of the nature and competitiveness of the sport or game and its\nranking method. Our results also suggest that our measures of rank dynamics are\ngeneral and applicable for complex systems of different natures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 16:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

Each\ngravitational-wave (GW) signal provides the luminosity distance to the source\nand we estimate the corresponding redshift using two methods: the redshifted\nmasses and a galaxy catalog. Using the binary black hole (BBH) redshifted\nmasses, we simultaneously infer the source mass distribution and $H(z)$. The\nsource mass distribution displays a peak around $34\\, {\\rm M_\\odot}$, followed\nby a drop-off. Assuming this mass scale does not evolve with redshift results\nin a $H(z)$ measurement, yielding $H_0=68^{+12}_{-7} {\\rm\nkm\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$ ($68\\%$ credible interval) when combined with the $H_0$\nmeasurement from GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart. This represents\nan improvement of 17% with respect to the $H_0$ estimate from GWTC-1. The\nsecond method associates each GW event with its probable host galaxy in the\ncatalog GLADE+, statistically marginalizing over the redshifts of each event's\npotential hosts. Assuming a fixed BBH population, we estimate a value of\n$H_0=68^{+8}_{-6} {\\rm km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$ with the galaxy catalog method,\nan improvement of 42% with respect to our GWTC-1 result and 20% with respect to\nrecent $H_0$ studies using GWTC-2 events. However, we show that this result is\nstrongly impacted by assumptions about the BBH source mass distribution; the\nonly event which is not strongly impacted by such assumptions (and is thus\ninformative about $H_0$) is the well-localized event GW190814.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 16:43:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 17:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}

Our edge-based segmentation algorithm models an edge of interest\nusing Gaussian process regression and iteratively searches the image for edge\npixels in a recursive Bayesian scheme. This procedure combines local edge\ninformation from the image gradient and global structural information from\nposterior curves, sampled from the model's posterior predictive distribution,\nto sequentially build and refine an observation set of edge pixels. This\naccumulation of pixels converges the distribution to the edge of interest.\nHyperparameters can be tuned by the user at initialisation and optimised given\nthe refined observation set. This tunable approach does not require any prior\ntraining and is not restricted to any particular type of imaging domain. Due to\nthe model's uncertainty quantification, the algorithm is robust to artefacts\nand occlusions which degrade the quality and continuity of edges in images. Our\napproach also has the ability to efficiently trace edges in image sequences by\nusing previous-image edge traces as a priori information for consecutive\nimages. Various applications to medical imaging and satellite imaging are used\nto validate the technique and comparisons are made with two commonly used edge\ntracing algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 16:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Updating the previous GWTC-2.1, we present candidate\ngravitational waves from compact binary coalescences during the second half of\nthe third observing run (O3b) between 1 November 2019, 15:00 UTC and 27 March\n2020, 17:00 UTC. There are 35 compact binary coalescence candidates identified\nby at least one of our search algorithms with a probability of astrophysical\norigin $p_\\mathrm{astro} > 0.5$. Of these, 18 were previously reported as\nlow-latency public alerts, and 17 are reported here for the first time. Based\nupon estimates for the component masses, our O3b candidates with\n$p_\\mathrm{astro} > 0.5$ are consistent with gravitational-wave signals from\nbinary black holes or neutron star-black hole binaries, and we identify none\nfrom binary neutron stars. However, from the gravitational-wave data alone, we\nare not able to measure matter effects that distinguish whether the binary\ncomponents are neutron stars or black holes. The range of inferred component\nmasses is similar to that found with previous catalogs, but the O3b candidates\ninclude the first confident observations of neutron star-black hole binaries.\nIncluding the 35 candidates from O3b in addition to those from GWTC-2.1, GWTC-3\ncontains 90 candidates found by our analysis with $p_\\mathrm{astro} > 0.5$\nacross the first three observing runs. These observations of compact binary\ncoalescences present an unprecedented view of the properties of black holes and\nneutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 16:43:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

However, recent large-scale surveys of giant molecular\nclouds (GMCs) have detected extended HCN line emission. Such observations often\nresolve the HCN J=1-0 hyperfine structure (HFS). A precise determination of the\nphysical conditions of the gas requires treating the HFS line overlap effects.\nHere, we study the HCN HFS excitation and line emission using nonlocal\nradiative transfer models that include line overlaps and new HFS-resolved\ncollisional rate coefficients for inelastic collisions of HCN with both para-H2\nand ortho-H2 (computed via the scaled-IOS approximation up to Tk=500 K). In\naddition, we account for the role of electron collisions in the HFS level\nexcitation. We find that line overlap and opacity effects frequently produce\nanomalous HCN J=1-0 HFS line intensity ratios (inconsistent with the common\nassumption of the same Tex for all HFS lines) as well as anomalous HFS line\nwidth ratios. Line overlap and electron collisions also enhance the excitation\nof the higher J rotational lines. Electron excitation becomes important for\nmolecular gas with H2 densities below a few 10^5 cm-3 and electron abundances\nabove ~10^-5. In particular, electron excitation can produce\nlow-surface-brightness HCN emission from very extended but low-density gas in\nGMCs. The existence of such a widespread HCN emission component may affect the\ninterpretation of the extragalactic relationship HCN luminosity versus\nstar-formation rate. Alternatively, extended HCN emission may arise from dense\nstar-forming cores and become resonantly scattered by large envelopes of lower\ndensity gas. There are two scenarios - namely, electron-assisted (weakly)\ncollisionally excited versus scattering - that lead to different HCN J=1-0 HFS\nintensity ratios, which can be tested on the basis of observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 16:44:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 12:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

For this purpose, an encoder-decoder\nnetwork draws wide attention, where the encoder is required to encode a\nhigh-quality rain embedding which determines the performance of the subsequent\ndecoding stage to reconstruct the rain layer. However, most of existing studies\nignore the significance of rain embedding quality, thus leading to limited\nperformance with over/under-deraining. In this paper, with our observation of\nthe high rain layer reconstruction performance by an rain-to-rain autoencoder,\nwe introduce the idea of \"Rain Embedding Consistency\" by regarding the encoded\nembedding by the autoencoder as an ideal rain embedding and aim at enhancing\nthe deraining performance by improving the consistency between the ideal rain\nembedding and the rain embedding derived by the encoder of the deraining\nnetwork. To achieve this, a Rain Embedding Loss is applied to directly\nsupervise the encoding process, with a Rectified Local Contrast Normalization\n(RLCN) as the guide that effectively extracts the candidate rain pixels. We\nalso propose Layered LSTM for recurrent deraining and fine-grained encoder\nfeature refinement considering different scales.

To reduce noise, low-pass filters are commonly employed in order to\nattenuate high frequency components in the incoming signal, regardless if they\ncome from noise or the actual signal. Therefore, low-pass filters must be\ncarefully tuned in order to avoid significant deterioration of the signal. This\ntuning requires prior knowledge about the signal, which is often not available\nin applications such as reinforcement learning or learning-based control. In\norder to overcome this limitation, we propose an adaptive low-pass filter based\non Gaussian process regression.

These\nhubs are believed to be preferentially associated to massive star formation. As\nof today, there are no metrics that allow the systematic quantification of a\nfilament network convergence. Here, we used the IRAM 30m NIKA2 observations of\nthe Galactic plane from the GASTON large programme to systematically identify\nfilaments and produce a filament convergence parameter map. We use such a map\nto show that: i. hub filaments represent a small fraction of the global\nfilament population; ii. hubs host, in proportion, more massive and more\nluminous compact sources that non-hubs; iii. hub-hosting clumps are more\nevolved that non-hubs; iv. no discontinuities are observed in the properties of\ncompact sources as a function of convergence parameter. We propose that the\nrapid global collapse of clumps is responsible for (re)organising filament\nnetworks into hubs and, in parallel, enhancing the mass growth of compact\nsources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 17:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Specifically,\nconstant-cost communication problems correspond to hereditary graph families\nthat admit constant-size adjacency sketches, or equivalently constant-size\nprobabilistic universal graphs (PUGs), and these graph families are a subset of\nfamilies that admit adjacency labeling schemes of size O(log n), which are the\nsubject of the well-studied implicit graph question (IGQ).\n  We initiate the study of the hereditary graph families that admit\nconstant-size PUGs, with the two (equivalent) goals of (1) understanding\nrandomized constant-cost communication problems, and (2) understanding a\nprobabilistic version of the IGQ. For each family $\\mathcal F$ studied in this\npaper (including the monogenic bipartite families, product graphs, interval and\npermutation graphs, families of bounded twin-width, and others), it holds that\nthe subfamilies $\\mathcal H \\subseteq \\mathcal F$ are either stable (in a sense\nrelating to model theory), in which case they admit constant-size PUGs, or they\nare not stable, in which case they do not.\n  The correspondence between communication problems and hereditary graph\nfamilies allows for a new method of constructing adjacency labeling schemes. By\nthis method, we show that the induced subgraphs of any Cartesian products are\npositive examples to the IGQ. We prove that this probabilistic construction\ncannot be derandomized by using an Equality oracle, i.e. the Equality oracle\ncannot simulate the k-Hamming Distance communication protocol. We also obtain\nconstant-size sketches for deciding $\\mathsf{dist}(x, y) \\le k$ for vertices\n$x$, $y$ in any stable graph family with bounded twin-width.

Furthermore, modal analysis is done on schlieren\nimages to understand the flow dynamics parallel with the unsteady pressure\nmeasurements.

The torus instability of magnetic flux\nropes is believed to be one of the main driving mechanisms of solar CMEs.\nSuppression of the torus instability, due to a confining background coronal\nmagnetic field that decreases sufficiently slowly with height, may contribute\nto the lack of stellar CME detection. Here we use the solar magnetic field as a\ntemplate to estimate the vertical extent of this 'torus-stable zone' (TSZ)\nabove a stellar active region. For an idealised potential field model\ncomprising the fields of a local bipole (mimicking a pair of starspots) and a\nglobal dipole, we show that the upper bound of the TSZ increases with the\nbipole size, the dipole strength, and the source surface radius where the\ncoronal field becomes radial. The boundaries of the TSZ depend on the interplay\nbetween the spots' and the dipole's magnetic fields, which provide the local-\nand global-scale confinement, respectively. They range from about half the\nbipole size to a significant fraction of the stellar radius. For smaller spots\nand an intermediate dipole field, a secondary TSZ arises at a higher altitude,\nwhich may increase the likelihood of 'failed eruptions'. Our results suggest\nthat the low apparent CME occurrence rate on cool stars is, at least partially,\ndue to the presence of extended TSZs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 17:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

It goes without saying that although scenario-specific driving\npolicies for autonomous driving are promising and can improve transportation\nsafety and efficiency, they are clearly not a universal scalable solution.\nInstead, we seek decision-making schemes and driving policies that can\ngeneralize to novel and unseen environments. In this work, we capitalize on the\nkey idea that human drivers learn abstract representations of their\nsurroundings that are fairly similar among various driving scenarios and\nenvironments.

Suppose we have a set of $n$\nvoters and $m$ candidates that lie in a metric space. The goal is to design a\nmechanism to choose a candidate whose average distance to the voters is as\nsmall as possible. However, the mechanism does not get direct access to the\nmetric space. Instead, it gets each voter's ordinal ranking of the candidates\nby distance. Given only this partial information, what is the smallest\nworst-case approximation ratio (known as the distortion) that a mechanism can\nguarantee?\n  A simple example shows that no deterministic mechanism can guarantee\ndistortion better than $3$, and no randomized mechanism can guarantee\ndistortion better than $2$. It has been conjectured that both of these lower\nbounds are optimal, and recently, Gkatzelis, Halpern, and Shah proved this\nconjecture for deterministic mechanisms. We disprove the conjecture for\nrandomized mechanisms for $m \\geq 3$ by constructing elections for which no\nrandomized mechanism can guarantee distortion better than $2.0261$ for $m = 3$,\n$2.0496$ for $m = 4$, up to $2.1126$ as $m \\to \\infty$.

We provide a nearly matching\nupper bound for this restricted class of metrics as well.

Theories of choreographic programming\ntypically come with strong theoretical guarantees about the compilation\nprocess, most notably: the generated implementations operationally correspond\nto their source choreographies and are deadlock-free.\n  Currently, the most advanced incarnation of the paradigm is Choral, an\nobject-oriented choreographic programming language that targets Java. Choral\ndeviated significantly from known theories of choreographies, and introduced\nthe possibility of expressing higher-order choreographies (choreographies\nparameterised over choreographies) that are fully distributed. As a\nconsequence, it is unclear if the usual guarantees of choreographies can still\nhold in the more general setting of higher-order ones.\n  We introduce Chor{\\lambda}, the first functional choreographic programming\nlanguage: it introduces a new formulation of the standard communication\nprimitive found in choreographies as a function, and it is based upon the\n{\\lambda}-calculus. Chor{\\lambda} is the first theory that explains the core\nideas of higher-order choreographic programming (as in Choral). Bridging the\ngap between practice and theory requires developing a new evaluation strategy\nand typing discipline for {\\lambda} terms that accounts for the distributed\nnature of computation in choreographies. We illustrate the expressivity of\nChor{\\lambda} with a series of examples, which include reconstructions of the\nkey examples from the original presentation of Choral.

In the absence of limiters, the high-order scheme does not guarantee\nthat solutions remain in the convex set over which HyQMOM is moment-realizable.\nTo overcome this, we introduce novel limiters that rigorously guarantee that\nthe computed solution does not leave the convex set of realizable solutions,\nthus guaranteeing the hyperbolicity of the system. We develop\npositivity-preserving limiters in both the prediction and correction steps and\nan oscillation limiter that damps unphysical oscillations near shocks. We also\ndevelop a novel extension of this scheme to include a BGK collision operator;\nthe proposed method is shown to be asymptotic-preserving in the high-collision\nlimit. The HyQMOM and the HyQMOM-BGK solvers are verified on several test\ncases, demonstrating high-order accuracy on smooth problems and shock-capturing\ncapability on problems with shocks. The asymptotic-preserving property of the\nHyQMOM-BGK solver is also numerically verified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 19:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 14:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

When plasmon resonance is swept through molecular\ntransition frequency an avoided crossing may be observed, which is often\nregarded as a signature of strong coupling between plasmons and molecules. Such\nstrong coupling is expected to be realized when $2|U|/{\\hbar\\Gamma}>1$, where\n$U$ and ${\\Gamma}$ are the molecule-plasmon coupling and the spectral width of\nthe optical transition respectively. Because both $U$ and ${\\Gamma}$ strongly\nincrease with decreasing distance between a molecule and a plasmonic structure\nit is not obvious that this condition can be satisfied for any molecule-metal\nsurface distance. In this work we investigate the behavior of $U$ and\n${\\Gamma}$ for several geometries.

This\nimplies that the Rabi splitting can be observed in such structures if other\nsources of broadening are suppressed. Additionally, when the molecule-metal\nsurface distance is varied keeping all other molecular and metal parameters\nconstant, this behavior is mitigated due to the spectral shift associated with\nthe same molecule-plasmon interaction, making the observation of Rabi splitting\nmore challenging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 21:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

We call our proposed agent the Metacognitive Actor Critic (MAC).\nWe conclude with showing how to create metacognition in machines by\nimplementing a deep MAC and showing that it can detect (some of) its own\nsuboptimal actions without external information or delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 22:31:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

Instead of depending on GPS, RAIL leverages ultrasonic acoustic\nsignals to achieve precise localization using a novel hybrid Frequency Hopping\nCode Division Multiple Access (FH-CDMA) technique.

To meet the ever-increasing demands on\nbetter wireless communications for IIoT, we propose an orthogonal\ntime-frequency space (OTFS) waveform-based joint communication and radio\nsensing (JCAS) scheme -- an energy-efficient solution for not only reliable\ncommunications but also high-accuracy sensing. OTFS has been demonstrated to\nhave higher reliability and energy efficiency than the currently popular IIoT\ncommunication waveforms. JCAS has also been highly recommended for IIoT, since\nit saves cost, power and spectrum compared to having two separate radio\nfrequency systems. Performing JCAS based on OTFS, however, can be hindered by a\nlack of effective OTFS sensing. This paper is dedicated to filling this\ntechnology gap. We first design a series of echo pre-processing methods that\nsuccessfully remove the impact of communication data symbols in the\ntime-frequency domain, where major challenges, like inter-carrier and\ninter-symbol interference and noise amplification, are addressed. Then, we\nprovide a comprehensive analysis of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio\n(SINR) for sensing and optimize a key parameter of the proposed method to\nmaximize the SINR.

This hybrid approach\nallows PINO to overcome the limitations of purely data-driven and physics-based\nmethods. For instance, data-driven methods fail to learn when data is of\nlimited quantity and/or quality, and physics-based approaches fail to optimize\non challenging PDE constraints. By combining both data and PDE constraints,\nPINO overcomes all these challenges. Additionally, a unique property that PINO\nenjoys over other hybrid learning methods is its ability to incorporate data\nand PDE constraints at different resolutions. This allows us to combine\ncoarse-resolution data, which is inexpensive to obtain from numerical solvers,\nwith higher resolution PDE constraints, and the resulting PINO has no\ndegradation in accuracy even on high-resolution test instances. This\ndiscretization-invariance property in PINO is due to neural-operator framework\nwhich learns mappings between function spaces and allows evaluation at\ndifferent resolutions without the need for re-training. Moreover, PINO succeeds\nin the purely physics setting, where no data is available, while other\napproaches such as the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) fail due to\noptimization challenges, e.g. in multi-scale dynamic systems such as Kolmogorov\nflows. This is because PINO learns the solution operator by optimizing PDE\nconstraints on multiple instances while PINN optimizes PDE constraints of a\nsingle PDE instance. Further, in PINO, we incorporate the Fourier neural\noperator (FNO) architecture which achieves orders-of-magnitude speedup over\nnumerical solvers and also allows us to compute explicit gradients on function\nspaces efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2021 03:41:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 01:18:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 07:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

To date,\nhowever, the developmental and mechanistic foundations of collective behavior\nhave not been formally established. What learning mechanisms drive the\ndevelopment of collective behavior in newborn animals? Here, we used deep\nreinforcement learning and curiosity-driven learning -- two learning mechanisms\ndeeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific research -- to build newborn\nartificial agents that develop collective behavior. Like newborn animals, our\nagents learn collective behavior from raw sensory inputs in naturalistic\nenvironments. Our agents also learn collective behavior without external\nrewards, using only intrinsic motivation (curiosity) to drive learning.\nSpecifically, when we raise our artificial agents in natural visual\nenvironments with groupmates, the agents spontaneously develop ego-motion,\nobject recognition, and a preference for groupmates, rapidly learning all of\nthe core skills required for collective behavior. This work bridges the divide\nbetween high-dimensional sensory inputs and collective action, resulting in a\npixels-to-actions model of collective animal behavior.

In the case of a high mass\naccretion rate, the hyperaccretion disk is in a state of neutrino-dominated\naccretion flow (NDAF) and emits numerous anisotropic MeV neutrinos. Only a\nsmall fraction of these neutrinos annihilates in the space outside of the disk\nand then launch ultrarelativistic jets that break away from the merger ejecta\nto power gamma-ray bursts. Mergers and their remnants are generally considered\nsources of gravitational waves (GWs), neutrinos, and kilonovae. Anisotropic\nneutrino emission and anisotropic high-velocity material outflows from central\nBH-NDAF systems can also trigger strong GWs and luminous disk-outflow-driven\n(DOD) kilonovae, respectively. In this paper, the anisotropic multimessenger\nsignals from NDAFs with outflows, including DOD kilonovae, MeV neutrinos, and\nGWs, are presented. As the results, the typical AB magnitude of the DOD\nkilonovae is lower than that of AT 2017gfo at the same distance, and it\ndecreases with increasing viewing angles and its anisotropy is not sensitive to\nthe outflow mass distribution but mainly determined by the velocity\ndistribution. Since neutrinos with $\\gtrsim 10~\\rm MeV$ are mainly produced in\nthe inner region of the disk, they will be dramatically deflected to a large\nviewing angle by relativity effects. Moreover, the strains of GWs induced by\nanisotropic neutrinos increase with increasing viewing angles. The accumulation\nof multimessenger detection of the BH-NS/BNS mergers with different viewing\nangles might further verify the existence of NDAFs with outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2021 06:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

Firstly, vehicle-perspective pedestrian data are collected.\nSince the data contains information regarding the movement of both the ego\nvehicle and pedestrian, it can simplify the prediction of spatiotemporal\nfeatures in an interaction-aware fashion. Using the long short-term memory\nmodel, the pedestrian trajectory prediction module predicts their\nspatiotemporal features in the subsequent five frames. As the predicted\ntrajectory follows certain interaction and risk patterns, a hybrid clustering\nand classification method is adopted to explore the risk patterns in the\nspatiotemporal features and train a risk level classifier using the learned\npatterns. Upon predicting the spatiotemporal features of pedestrians and\nidentifying the corresponding risk level, the risk patterns between the ego\nvehicle and pedestrians are determined. Experimental results verified the\ncapability of the PRLP system to predict the risk level of pedestrians, thus\nsupporting the collision risk assessment of intelligent vehicles and providing\nsafety warnings to both vehicles and pedestrians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2021 07:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

We introduce a covariant\nformulation in the new framework and show that it leads to a curved field space\nwhich can produce conspicuous departure from the purely metric gravity. In the\ncase where the fields are canonical, the field manifold gains a conformally\nflat shape. Interestingly, while the manifold is generally curved, it is\npossible to be flattened by allowing specific non-canonical field kinetic\nterms. This in turn simplifies the inflationary dynamics significantly while\nallowing for new predictions due to the effects of the nonminimal coupling\nfunction on the potential solely.

Herein, we adopted input resources as a\nbifurcation parameter. A drift bifurcation from SPO to TPO was observed by\nintroducing another parameter at which these two solution sheets merged. In\ncontrast to the monotone tail case, a nonlocal interaction appeared in the\nheterogeneous problem between the TPO and heterogeneity, which created\ninfinitely many saddle solutions and finitely many stable stationary solutions\ndistributed across the entire line. TPO displayed a variety of dynamics\nincluding pinning and depinning processes along with penetration (PEN) and\nrebound (REB). The stable/unstable manifolds of these saddles interacted with\nthe TPO in a complex manner, which created a subtle dependence on the initial\ncondition, and a difficulty to predict the behavior after collision.

During training, DNS methods are typically\ntrained with mean squared error (MSE) type loss functions, which do not\nguarantee good perceptual quality. Perceptual evaluation of speech quality\n(PESQ) is a widely used metric for evaluating speech quality. However, the\noriginal PESQ algorithm is non-differentiable, and therefore cannot directly be\nused as optimization criterion for gradient-based learning. In this work, we\npropose an end-to-end non-intrusive PESQNet DNN to estimate the PESQ scores of\nthe enhanced speech signal. Thus, by providing a reference-free perceptual\nloss, it serves as a mediator towards the DNS training, allowing to maximize\nthe PESQ score of the enhanced speech signal. We illustrate the potential of\nour proposed PESQNet-mediated training on the basis of an already strong\nbaseline DNS. As further novelty, we propose to train the DNS and the PESQNet\nalternatingly to keep the PESQNet up-to-date and perform well specifically for\nthe DNS under training.

Machine\nlearning (ML) has been demonstrated as an effective approach to locust\ndistribution modelling which could assist in early warning. ML requires a\nsignificant amount of labelled data to train. Most publicly available labelled\ndata on locusts are presence-only data, where only the sightings of locusts\nbeing present at a location are recorded. Therefore, prior work using ML have\nresorted to pseudo-absence generation methods as a way to circumvent this\nissue. The most commonly used approach is to randomly sample points in a region\nof interest while ensuring that these sampled pseudo-absence points are at\nleast a specific distance away from true presence points. In this paper, we\ncompare this random sampling approach to more advanced pseudo-absence\ngeneration methods, such as environmental profiling and optimal background\nextent limitation, specifically for predicting desert locust breeding grounds\nin Africa. Interestingly, we find that for the algorithms we tested, namely\nlogistic regression, gradient boosting, random forests and maximum entropy, all\npopular in prior work, the logistic model performed significantly better than\nthe more sophisticated ensemble methods, both in terms of prediction accuracy\nand F1 score. Although background extent limitation combined with random\nsampling boosted performance for ensemble methods, for LR this was not the\ncase, and instead, a significant improvement was obtained when using\nenvironmental profiling. In light of this, we conclude that a simpler ML\napproach such as logistic regression combined with more advanced pseudo-absence\ngeneration, specifically environmental profiling, can be a sensible and\neffective approach to predicting locust breeding grounds across Africa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2021 15:29:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 16:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

We characterize dangerous speech\nusers by assigning Danger Amplification Belief scores and show that dangerous\nusers are more active on Twitter as compared to other users as well as most\ninfluential in the network, in terms of a larger following as well as volume of\nverified accounts. We find that dangerous users have a more polarized\nviewership, suggesting that their audience is more susceptible to incitement.\nUsing a mix of network centrality measures and qualitative analysis, we find\nthat most dangerous accounts tend to either be in mass media related\noccupations or allied with low-ranking, right-leaning politicians, and act as\n\"broadcasters\" in the network, where they are best positioned to spearhead the\nrapid dissemination of dangerous speech across the platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2021 15:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

However, with\ndiverse source domains, aligning pairwise feature distributions is challenging\nand could even be counter-productive for MSDA. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel approach: transferable attribute learning. The motivation is simple:\nalthough different domains can have drastically different visual appearances,\nthey contain the same set of classes characterized by the same set of\nattributes; an MSDA model thus should focus on learning the most transferable\nattributes for the target domain. Adopting this approach, we propose a domain\nattention consistency network, dubbed DAC-Net. The key design is a feature\nchannel attention module, which aims to identify transferable features\n(attributes). Importantly, the attention module is supervised by a consistency\nloss, which is imposed on the distributions of channel attention weights\nbetween source and target domains. Moreover, to facilitate discriminative\nfeature learning on the target data, we combine pseudo-labeling with a class\ncompactness loss to minimize the distance between the target features and the\nclassifier's weight vectors. Extensive experiments on three MSDA benchmarks\nshow that our DAC-Net achieves new state of the art performance on all of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2021 15:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

Ap\\'ery's proof\nused a specific linear recursion containing integer polynomials forming a\ncontinued fraction; called polynomial continued fractions (PCFs). Similar\npolynomial recursions prove the irrationality of other mathematical constants\nsuch as $\\pi$ and $e$. More generally, the sequences generated by PCFs form\nDiophantine approximations (DAs), which are ubiquitous in areas of math such as\nnumber theory. It is not known which polynomial recursions create useful DAs\nand whether they prove irrationality. Here, we present general conclusions and\nconjectures about DAs created from PCFs. Specifically, we generalize Ap\\'ery's\nwork, going beyond his particular choice of PCF, finding the conditions under\nwhich a PCF proves irrationality or provides an efficient DA.

Text annotation helps the patent practitioners\nsuch as examiners and patent attorneys to quickly identify the key arguments of\nany invention, successively providing a timely marking of a patent text. In the\nprocess of manual patent analysis, to attain better readability, recognising\nthe semantic information by marking paragraphs is in practice. This semantic\nannotation process is laborious and time-consuming. To alleviate such a\nproblem, we proposed a novel dataset to train Machine Learning algorithms to\nautomate the highlighting process. The contributions of this work are: i) we\ndeveloped a multi-class, novel dataset of size 150k samples by traversing USPTO\npatents over a decade, ii) articulated statistics and distributions of data\nusing imperative exploratory data analysis, iii) baseline Machine Learning\nmodels are developed to utilize the dataset to address patent paragraph\nhighlighting task, iv) dataset and codes relating to this task are open-sourced\nthrough a dedicated GIT web page:\nhttps://github.com/Renuk9390/Patent_Sentiment_Analysis and v) future path to\nextend this work using Deep Learning and domain specific pre-trained language\nmodels to develop a tool to highlight is provided.

Even though many algorithms are proposed using\nsuch methods, it is still necessary for further improvement. In this paper, we\npropose a recommender system method using a graph-based model associated with\nthe similarity of users' ratings, in combination with users' demographic and\nlocation information. By utilizing the advantages of Autoencoder feature\nextraction, we extract new features based on all combined attributes.

However, these fluidic actuators\ntypically exhibit unimodal deformation upon inflation. Here, we present a new\ndesign concept for modular, fluidic actuators that can switch between\ndeformation modes as a response to an input threshold. Our system comprises\nbistable origami modules in which snapping breaks rotational symmetry, giving\naccess to a bending deformation. By tuning geometry, the modules can be\ndesigned to snap at different pressure thresholds, rotate clockwise or\ncounterclockwise when actuated, and bend in different planes. Due to their\nability to assume multiple deformation modes as response to a single pressure\ninput we call our system MuA-Ori, or Multimodal Actuated Origami. MuA-Ori\nprovides an ideal platform to design actuators that can switch between\ndifferent configurations, reach multiple, pre-defined targets in space, and\nmove along complex trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 19:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

In the case of robots, we can not afford to spend that much\ntime on making it to learn how to grasp objects effectively. Therefore, in the\npresent research we propose an efficient learning architecture based on VQVAE\nso that robots can be taught with sufficient data corresponding to correct\ngrasping. However, getting sufficient labelled data is extremely difficult in\nthe robot grasping domain. To help solve this problem, a semi-supervised\nlearning based model which has much more generalization capability even with\nlimited labelled data set, has been investigated. Its performance shows 6\\%\nimprovement when compared with existing state-of-the-art models including our\nearlier model. During experimentation, It has been observed that our proposed\nmodel, RGGCNN2, performs significantly better, both in grasping isolated\nobjects as well as objects in a cluttered environment, compared to the existing\napproaches which do not use unlabelled data for generating grasping rectangles.\nTo the best of our knowledge, developing an intelligent robot grasping model\n(based on semi-supervised learning) trained through representation learning and\nexploiting the high-quality learning ability of GGCNN2 architecture with the\nlimited number of labelled dataset together with the learned latent embeddings,\ncan be used as a de-facto training method which has been established and also\nvalidated in this paper through rigorous hardware experimentations using Baxter\n(Anukul) research robot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2021 11:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}
