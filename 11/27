Two of the QSO2s are red early-type galaxies with no CO(2-1) detected.\nIn the interacting galaxies, the central kpc contains 18-25% of the total cold\nmolecular gas, whereas in the spirals it is only 5-12%.

The CO kinematics of the\nQSO2s are dominated by rotation but also reveal noncircular motions.

The so called \"rate-and-state\" models, which specify the\nfriction response in terms of the relative sliding velocity and the \"age\" of\nthe contact interface, fail to uncover the nano-scale mechanisms governing the\nmacro-scale response, while models of friction at the atomic scale often\noverlook how roughness can alter the friction behavior. Here we bridge this gap\nbetween nano and macro descriptions of friction by correlating the physical\norigin of macroscopic friction to the existence, due to nanometric roughness,\nof contact junctions between adsorbed monolayers. Their dynamics, as we show,\nemerges from molecular motion. Through coupled experimental and atomic\nsimulations, we highlight that transient friction overshoots its steady-state\nvalue after the system is allowed to rest, with the friction force decaying to\na steady-state value over a distance of a few nanometers, much smaller than the\njunction size, even with a root-mean-square roughness of 0.6 nm. We demonstrate\nhow this transient decay is intrinsically related to the evolution of the\nnumber of cross-surface attractive physical links between adsorbed molecules on\nrough surfaces. We also show that roughness is a sufficient condition for the\nappearance of frictional aging. In systems that show structural aging, this\npaints contact junctions as a key component in the observation of the transient\nfriction overshoot, and shows how infrajunction molecular motion can control\nthe macroscopic response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 16:33:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 12:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

Reported experimental responses of a\ndetailed test database consisting of 384 reinforced concrete shear walls under\ncyclic loading were utilized to predict seven critical points to define the\nbackbone curves, namely: shear at cracking point; shear and displacement at\nyielding point; and peak shear force and corresponding displacement; and\nultimate displacement and corresponding shear.

Through\ntheir short trading horizon and continuous nature, the intraday markets offer\nthe ability to adjust trading decisions from the day-ahead market or reduce\ntrading risk in a short-term notice. Producers of renewable energies utilize\nthe intraday market to lower their forecast risk, by modifying their provided\ncapacities based on current forecasts. However, the market dynamics are complex\ndue to the fact that the power grids have to remain stable and electricity is\nonly partly storable. Consequently, robust and intelligent trading strategies\nare required that are capable to operate in the intraday market.

Here,\nwe show that all-optical, mode-selective manipulation of the crystal lattice\ncan be used to enhance and stabilize high-temperature ferromagnetism in\nYTiO$_3$, a material that exhibits only partial orbital polarization, an\nunsaturated low-temperature magnetic moment, and a suppressed Curie\ntemperature, $T_c$ = 27 K. The enhancement is largest when exciting a 9 THz\noxygen rotation mode, for which complete magnetic saturation is achieved at low\ntemperatures and transient ferromagnetism is realized up to $T_{neq} >$ 80 K,\nnearly three times the thermodynamic transition temperature. First-principles\nand model calculations of the nonlinear phonon-orbital-spin coupling reveal\nthat these effects originate from dynamical changes to the orbital polarization\nand the makeup of the lowest quasi-degenerate Ti $t_{2g}$ levels.

The field of modern pathology has\nbeen systematized around the findings and observations obtained from light\nmicroscopy.

Therefore, only vague information can be collected. Various\nimaging methodologies and tissue staining techniques have been created to\nfurther understand the complexity of biological tissues. Using such approaches,\nit has been realized that cellular morphology data that comprehensively acquire\nbiological tissue information can be treated as new omics information, termed\nthe 'Totalities of body tissue morphology (morphome)'.

While the gas\ninfall history of the Milky Way in the inner disc has long been assumed to be\ncharacterised by a short accretion time scale, this has not been directly\nconstrained using observations. Using the unprecedented amount and quality of\ndata of the inner regions of the Milky Way that has recently been produced by\nAPOGEE and Gaia, we aim to derive strong constraints on the infall history of\nthe inner (less than 6 kpc) Galaxy (with a focus on stars between 4-6 kpc,\nwhich we show is an appropriate proxy for the entire inner disc). We have\nimplemented gas infall into a chemical evolution model of the Galaxy disc, and\nused a Schmidt-Kennicutt law to connect the infall to the star formation. We\nexplore a number of models, and two different formulations of the infall law.\nIn one formulation, the infall is non-parametric, and in the other the infall\nhas an explicitly exponential form. We fit the model parameters to the\ntime-[Si/Fe] distribution of solar vicinity stars, and the metallicity and\n[Si/Fe] distribution function of stars with a galactocentric radius between 4-6\nkpc from APOGEE. Our results point to a fast early gas accretion, with an upper\nlimit of accretion timescale of around 2 Gyr in the inner disc of the Milky\nWay. This suggests that at least half the baryons were in place within 2-3 Gyr\nof the Big Bang, and that half the stars of the inner disc formed within the\nfirst 5 Gyr, during the thick disc formation phase. This implies that the\nstellar mass of the inner disc is dominated by the thick disc, supporting our\nprevious work, and that the gas accretion onto the inner disc was rapid and\nearly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 17:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

We attribute our observations to an emergent Pauli blocking of\ntransverse excitations, caused by the rapidities assuming fermionic statistics,\ndespite the gas being purely bosonic.

Current approaches revolve around solving an image discrimination\ntask: given an anchor image, an augmented counterpart of that image, and some\nother images, the model must produce representations such that the distance\nbetween the anchor and its counterpart is small, and the distances between the\nanchor and the other images are large. There are two significant problems with\nthis approach: (i) by contrasting representations at the image-level, it is\nhard to generate detailed object-sensitive features that are beneficial to\ndownstream object-level tasks such as instance segmentation; (ii) the\naugmentation strategy of producing an augmented counterpart is fixed, making\nlearning less effective at the later stages of pre-training.

Due to the expensive frame-level annotations required for\ndetection, the scale of detection datasets is limited. Thus, commonly, previous\nwork on temporal activity detection resorts to fine-tuning a classification\nmodel pretrained on large-scale classification datasets (e.g., Kinetics-400).\nHowever, such pretrained models are not ideal for downstream detection, due to\nthe disparity between the pretraining and the downstream fine-tuning tasks. In\nthis work, we propose a novel 'weakly-guided self-supervised' pretraining\nmethod for detection. We leverage weak labels (classification) to introduce a\nself-supervised pretext task (detection) by generating frame-level pseudo\nlabels, multi-action frames, and action segments.

Such methods usually have a common pipeline: a tokenization\nmethod, followed by a set of layers/blocks for information mixing, both within\nand among tokens. When image patches are converted into tokens, they are often\nflattened, discarding the spatial structure within each patch. As a result, any\nprocessing that follows (eg: multi-head self-attention) may fail to recover\nand/or benefit from such information. In this paper, we argue that models can\nhave significant gains when spatial structure is preserved during tokenization,\nand is explicitly used during the mixing stage. We propose two key\ncontributions: (1) Structure-aware Tokenization and, (2) Structure-aware\nMixing, both of which can be combined with existing models with minimal effort.\nWe introduce a family of models (SWAT), showing improvements over the likes of\nDeiT, MLP-Mixer and Swin Transformer, across multiple benchmarks including\nImageNet classification and ADE20K segmentation.

We investigate how Galactic globular clusters with\nobserved tails are affected by satellite dwarf galaxies by simulating tails in\ngalaxy models with and without dwarf galaxies. The simulations indicate that\ntidal tails can be subdivided into into three categories based on how they are\naffected by dwarf galaxies: 1) dwarf galaxies perturb the progenitor cluster's\norbit (NGC 4590, Pal 1, Pal 5), 2) dwarf galaxies perturb the progenitor\ncluster's orbit and individual tail stars (NGC 362, NGC 1851, NGC 4147, NGC\n5466, NGC 7492, Pal 14, Pal 15), and 3) dwarf galaxies negligibly affect tidal\ntails (NGC 288, NGC 5139, NGC 5904, Eridanus). Perturbations to a cluster's\norbit occur when dwarf galaxies pass within its orbit, altering the size and\nshape of the orbital and tail path.

Three shortcomings of previous works on light\nspanners are: (1) The techniques are ad hoc per graph class, and thus can't be\napplied broadly. (2) The runtimes of these constructions are almost always\nsub-optimal, and usually far from optimal. (3) These constructions are optimal\nin the standard and crude sense, but not in a refined sense that takes into\naccount a wider range of involved parameters.\n  This work aims at addressing these shortcomings by presenting a unified\nframework of light spanners in a variety of graph classes. Informally, the\nframework boils down to a transformation from sparse spanners to light\nspanners; since the state-of-the-art for sparse spanners is much more advanced\nthan that for light spanners, such a transformation is powerful. Our framework\nis developed in two papers.

We complement our upper bound with a lower\nbound construction, for which any $(1+\\epsilon)$-spanner must have lightness\n$\\Omega(\\frac{r}{\\epsilon} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2})$. We note that the quadratic\ndependency on $1/\\epsilon$ we proved here is surprising, as the prior work\nsuggested that the dependency on $\\epsilon$ should be $1/\\epsilon$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 21:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

How relevant\nthis description might be for understanding low-dimensional glass-forming\nliquids, however, remains unclear. These liquids indeed exhibit a complex\ninterplay between structure and dynamics, and the importance of this interplay\nmight only slowly diminish as dimension $d$ increases. A careful numerical\nassessment of the matter has long been hindered by the exponential increase of\ncomputational costs with $d$. By revisiting a once common simulation technique\ninvolving the use of periodic boundary conditions modeled on $D_d$ lattices, we\nhere partly sidestep this difficulty, thus allowing the study of hard sphere\nliquids up to $d=13$. Parallel efforts by Mangeat and Zamponi [Phys. Rev. E 93,\n012609 (2016)] have expanded the mean-field description of glasses to finite\n$d$ by leveraging standard liquid-state theory, and thus help bridge the gap\nfrom the other direction. The relatively smooth evolution of both structure and\ndynamics across the $d$ gap allows us to relate the two approaches, and to\nidentify some of the missing features that a finite-$d$ theory of glasses might\nhope to include to achieve near quantitative agreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 21:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

The synthetic eddy method, previously introduced in the context of\ninflow conditions for large eddy simulations, is based on the assumption that\nturbulence can be regarded as a superposition of coherent structures. In this\npaper, a new type of synthetic eddy method is proposed, where the fundamental\neddy is constructed by superposing three Hill's vortices, with their axes\northogonal to each other. A distribution of Hill's vortices is used to\nsynthesize an anisotropic turbulent velocity field that satisfies the\nincompressibility condition and match a given Reynolds stress tensor. The\namplitudes of the three vortices that form the fundamental eddy are calculated\nfrom known Reynolds stress profiles through a transformation from the physical\nreference frame to the principal-axis reference frame. In this way,\ndivergence-free anisotropic turbulent velocity fields are obtained that can\nreproduce a given Reynolds stress tensor. The model was tested on both\nisotropic and anisotropic turbulent velocity fields, in the framework of grid\nturbulence decay and turbulent channel flow, respectively. The transition from\nartificial to realistic turbulence in the proximity to the inflow boundary was\nfound to be small in all test cases that were considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 22:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

In this work, aiming at a better\nunderstanding of these phenomena, we experimentally investigate an unusual\neffect of enhanced conductive filament stability in memristors with copper\nfilaments under the applied voltage and present a simplified theoretical model\nof the effect of a quantum current through a filament on its shape. Our\nsemi-quantitative, continuous model predicts, indeed, that for a thin filament,\nthe \"quantum pressure\" exerted on its walls by the recoil of charge carriers\ncan well compete with the surface tension and crucially affect the evolution of\nthe filament profile at the voltages around 1V. At lower voltages, the quantum\npressure is expected to provide extra stability to the filaments supporting\nquantized conductance, which we also reveal experimentally using a novel\nmethodology focusing on retention statistics.

The main difficulty in\nlearning energy-based models with the \"contrastive approaches\" is the\ngeneration of samples from the current energy function at each iteration. Many\nadvances have been made to accomplish this subroutine cheaply. Nevertheless,\nall such sampling paradigms run MCMC targeting the current model, which\nrequires infinitely long chains to generate samples from the true energy\ndistribution and is problematic in practice. This paper proposes an alternative\napproach to getting these samples and avoiding crude MCMC sampling from the\ncurrent model. We accomplish this by viewing the evolution of the modeling\ndistribution as (i) the evolution of the energy function, and (ii) the\nevolution of the samples from this distribution along some vector field. We\nsubsequently derive this time-dependent vector field such that the particles\nfollowing this field are approximately distributed as the current density\nmodel. Thereby we match the evolution of the particles with the evolution of\nthe energy function prescribed by the learning procedure. Importantly, unlike\nMonte Carlo sampling, our method targets to match the current distribution in a\nfinite time.

However, as data grow rapidly in volume\nand velocity, storing and combing data become increasingly challenging. The\namount of time and effort spent to update analyses can grow exponentially,\nwhich defeats the purpose of instantaneous surveillance. Data sharing barriers\nin multi-center studies bring additional challenges to rapid signal detection\nand update. It is thus time to turn static causal inference to online causal\nlearning that can incorporate new information as it becomes available without\nrevisiting prior observations. In this paper, we present a framework for online\nestimation and inference of treatment effects leveraging a series of datasets\nthat arrive sequentially without storing or re-accessing individual-level raw\ndata. We establish estimation consistency and asymptotic normality of the\nproposed framework for online causal inference. In particular, our framework is\nrobust to biased data batches in the sense that the proposed online estimator\nis asymptotically unbiased as long as the pooled data is a random sample of the\ntarget population regardless of whether each data batch is. We also provide an\nR package for analyzing streaming observational data that enjoys great\ncomputation efficiency compared to existing software packages for offline\nanalyses.

The microscopic mechanism\nunderlying this phenomenon is the nonlinear coupling of the pumped\ninfrared-active mode to other phonon modes present in a material. Nonlinear\nphonon couplings can cause finite time-averaged atomic displacements with or\nwithout broken crystal symmetries depending on the order, magnitude and sign of\nthe nonlinearities. Such coherent lattice displacements along phonon\ncoordinates can be used to control the physical properties of materials and\neven induce transient phases with lower symmetries.

At best, this leads to sub-optimal outcomes and, at worst,\nit can cause conflicts that lead to teams not wanting to continue working\ntogether. Prior work has attempted to facilitate constructive communication by\nhighlighting problematic communication patterns and nudging teams to alter\ninteraction norms. However, these approaches achieve limited success because\nthey fail to acknowledge two social barriers: (1) it is hard to reset team\nnorms mid-interaction, and (2) corrective nudges have limited utility unless\nteam members believe it is safe to voice their opinion and that their opinion\nwill be heard. This paper introduces Empathosphere, a chat-embedded\nintervention to mitigate these barriers and foster constructive communication\nin teams. To mitigate the first barrier, Empathosphere leverages the benefits\nof \"experimental spaces\" in dampening existing norms and creating a climate\nconducive to change. To mitigate the second barrier, Empathosphere harnesses\nthe benefits of perspective-taking to cultivate a group climate that promotes a\nnorm of members speaking up and engaging with each other. Empathosphere\nachieves this by orchestrating authentic socio-emotional exchanges designed to\ninduce perspective-taking. A controlled study (N=110) compared Empathosphere to\nan alternate intervention strategy of prompting teams to reflect on their team\nexperience. We found that Empathosphere led to higher work satisfaction,\nencouraged more open communication and feedback within teams, and boosted\nteams' desire to continue working together. This work demonstrates that\n``experimental spaces,'' particularly those that integrate methods of\nencouraging perspective-taking, can be a powerful means of improving\ncommunication in virtual teams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

In OWC, a high number of\noptical access points (APs) is usually deployed on the ceiling of an indoor\nenvironment to serve multiple users with different demands. Despite the high\ndata rates of OWC networks, due to the use of the optical band for data\ntransmission, they cannot replace current radio frequency (RF) wireless\nnetworks where OWC has several issues including the small converge area of an\noptical AP, the lack of uplink transmission and high blockage probabilities.\nHowever, OWC has the potential to support the requirements in the next\ngeneration (6G) of wireless communications. In this context, heterogeneous\noptical/RF networks can be considered to overcome the limitations of OWC and RF\nsystems, while providing a high quality of service in terms of achievable data\nrates and coverage. In this work, infrared lasers, vertical-cavity\nsurface-emitting(VCSEL) lasers, are used as the key elements of optical APs for\nserving multiple users.

While many advanced\nshadow removal methods have been proposed to recover the image quality in\nrecent years, their effects to facial landmark detection are not well studied.\nFor example, it remains unclear whether shadow removal could enhance the\nrobustness of facial landmark detection to diverse shadow patterns or not. In\nthis work, for the first attempt, we construct a novel benchmark to link two\nindependent but related tasks (i.e., shadow removal and facial landmark\ndetection).

In this paper, we propose the first work to train text-to-image\ngeneration models without any text data. Our method leverages the well-aligned\nmulti-modal semantic space of the powerful pre-trained CLIP model: the\nrequirement of text-conditioning is seamlessly alleviated via generating text\nfeatures from image features. Extensive experiments are conducted to illustrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method. We obtain state-of-the-art results in\nthe standard text-to-image generation tasks. Importantly, the proposed\nlanguage-free model outperforms most existing models trained with full\nimage-text pairs. Furthermore, our method can be applied in fine-tuning\npre-trained models, which saves both training time and cost in training\ntext-to-image generation models.

In this work, we synthesize the multi-color\nfluorescent by using a fast and effective microwave method where the CNDs are\nnitrogen-doped.

To this end, we construct a nonlinear\nGaussian approximation to the squeezing dynamics, defining a \"Gaussian\ninteraction frame\" (GIF) in which non-Gaussian quantum dynamics can be isolated\nand concisely described using a few dominant (i.e., principal) supermodes.\nNumerical simulations of our model reveal non-Gaussian distortions of squeezing\nin the mesoscopic regime, largely associated with signal-pump entanglement.

While\nboth describe transport processes that arise from the multifluid equations and\nare therefore of hyperbolic nature, they are often incorporated in models as a\ndiffusive, i.e. parabolic process. While the formulation as such is easy to\ninclude in standard MHD models, the resulting diffusive time-step constraints\ndo require often a computationally more expensive implicit treatment or\nsuper-time-stepping approaches. In this paper we discuss an implementation that\nretains the hyperbolic nature and allows for an explicit integration with small\ncomputational overhead. In the case of ambipolar drift, this formulation arises\nnaturally by simply retaining a time derivative of the drift velocity that is\ntypically omitted. This alone leads to time-step constraints that are\ncomparable to the native MHD time-step constraint for a solar setup including\nthe region from photosphere to lower solar corona. We discuss an accelerated\ntreatment that can further reduce time-step constraints if necessary. In the\ncase of Hall drift we propose a hyperbolic formulation that is numerically\nsimilar to that for the ambipolar drift and we show that the combination of\nboth can be applied to simulations of the solar chromosphere at minimal\ncomputational expense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2021 04:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

The presented approach is any time algorithm that has\nthe advantage that it allows for the active creation of topological maps from\nlaser scan data, as it is being acquired. We also propose a navigation strategy\nbased on a heuristic where the robot is directed towards nodes in the\ntopological map that open to empty space. We then extend the work in [1] by\npresenting a topology matching algorithm that leverages the strengths of a\nparticular spectral correspondence method [2], to match the mapped environments\ngenerated from our topology-making algorithm. Here, we concentrated on\nimplementing a system that could be used to match the topologies of the mapped\nenvironment by using AOF Skeletons. In topology matching between two given maps\nand their AOF skeletons, we first find correspondences between points on the\nAOF skeletons of two different environments. We then align the (2D) points of\nthe environments themselves. We also compute a distance measure between two\ngiven environments, based on their extracted AOF skeletons and their topology,\nas the sum of the matching errors between corresponding points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2021 06:29:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

In the positive region, the structure\ncombining exponential function and quadratic function is used to alleviate the\nproblem of deviation and standard deviation, and the linear function is added\nto modify it, which makes the whole activation function smoother and overcomes\nthe problem of gradient vanishing. In the negative region, the cubic function\nstructure is used to solve the negative region problem and accelerate the\nconvergence of the model. Based on the deep learning model of BERT-BiLSTM-CRF,\nthe performance of AIS is evaluated. The results show that, compared with other\nactivation functions, AIS overcomes the problems of gradient vanishing and\nnegative region, reduces the deviation of the model, speeds up the model\nfitting, and improves the extraction ability of the model for industrial\nentities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2021 10:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

It is believed that the afterglow property is\ndetermined by the density of the material in the surrounding interstellar\nmedium. Therefore, the circumburst density can be used to distinguish between\nan interstellar wind $n(R) \\propto R^{\\rm -k}$, and a constant density medium\n(ISM), $n(R) = const$. Previous studies with different afterglow samples, show\nthat the circumburst medium of GRBs is neither simply supported by an\ninterstellar wind, nor completely favored by an ISM. In this work, our new\nsample is consisted of 39 GRBs with smoothly onset bump-like features in early\nX-ray afterglows, in which 20 GRBs have the redshift measurements. By using a\nsmooth broken power law function to fit the bumps of X-ray light curves, we\nderive the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) as the feature width ($\\omega$),\nas well as the rise and decay time scales of the bumps ($T_{\\rm r}$ and $T_{\\rm\nd}$). The correlations between the timescales of X-ray bumps are similar to\nthose found previously in the optical afterglows. Based on the fireball forward\nshock (FS) model of the thin shell case, we obtain the distribution of the\nelectron spectral index $p$, and further constrain the medium density\ndistribution index $k$. The new inferred $k$ is found to be concentrated at\n1.0, with a range from 0.2 to 1.8. This finding is consistent with previous\nstudies. The conclusion of our detailed investigation for X-ray afterglows\nsuggests that the ambient medium of the selected GRBs is not homogeneous, i.e.,\nneither ISM nor the typical interstellar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2021 12:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

It is well known that for any regression model,\nthe presence of multicollinearity leads to poor performance of the maximum\nlikelihood estimators. The ridge type estimators have been proposed to\nalleviate the adverse effects of the multicollinearity. Furthermore, when some\nof the predictors have insignificant or weak effects on the outcomes, it is\ndesired to recover as much information as possible from these predictors\ninstead of discarding them all together. In this paper we proposed ridge type\nshrinkage estimators for the low and high dimensional beta regression model,\nwhich address the above two issues simultaneously. We compute the biases and\nvariances of the proposed estimators in closed forms and use Monte Carlo\nsimulations to evaluate their performances.

This task is\ncommon but overlooked by previous person search works which focus on\nsurveillance scenes. The media scenarios have some different challenges from\nsurveillance scenes. For example, a person may change his clothes frequently.\nTo alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a Unified Detector and Graph\nNetwork (UDGNet) for person search in media. UDGNet is the first person search\nframework to detect and re-identify the human body and head simultaneously.\nSpecifically, it first builds two branches based on a unified network to detect\nthe human body and head, then the detected body and head are used for\nre-identification. This dual-task approach can significantly enhance\ndiscriminative learning. To tackle the cloth-changing issue, UDGNet builds two\ngraphs to explore reliable links among cloth-changing samples and utilizes a\ngraph network to learn better embeddings. This design effectively enhances the\nrobustness of person search to cloth-changing challenges. Besides, we\ndemonstrate that UDGNet can be implemented with both anchor-based and\nanchor-free person search frameworks and further achieve performance\nimprovement. This paper also contributes a large-scale dataset for Person\nSearch in Media (PSM), which provides both body and head annotations. It is by\nfar the largest dataset for person search in media. Experiments show that\nUDGNet improves the anchor-free model AlignPS by 12.1% in mAP. Meanwhile, it\nshows good generalization across surveillance and longterm scenarios.

It is shown that, while both well-resolved and under-resolved\nsimulations of linear problems correlate well with the eigenanalysis prediction\nof time integration errors, the correlation can be much worse for\nunder-resolved nonlinear problems. The effect of mesh regularity is also\nconsidered, where time integration errors are found to be, in the case of\nirregular grids, less pronounced than those of the spatial discretisation.

However, in fidelity image\nSuper-Resolution (SR), it is believed that normalization layers get rid of\nrange flexibility by normalizing the features and they are simply removed from\nmodern SR networks. In this paper, we study this phenomenon quantitatively and\nqualitatively. We found that the standard deviation of the residual feature\nshrinks a lot after normalization layers, which causes the performance\ndegradation in SR networks. Standard deviation reflects the amount of variation\nof pixel values. When the variation becomes smaller, the edges will become less\ndiscriminative for the network to resolve. To address this problem, we propose\nan Adaptive Deviation Modulator (AdaDM), in which a modulation factor is\nadaptively predicted to amplify the pixel deviation. For better generalization\nperformance, we apply BN in state-of-the-art SR networks with the proposed\nAdaDM. Meanwhile, the deviation amplification strategy in AdaDM makes the edge\ninformation in the feature more distinguishable. As a consequence, SR networks\nwith BN and our AdaDM can get substantial performance improvements on benchmark\ndatasets. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show the effectiveness\nof our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2021 14:16:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

We demonstrate that our representation overcomes common motion\nartifacts, and assess its performance compared to other popular\nrepresentations.

In this paper, we propose a novel\ncontrastive learning framework for single image super-resolution (SISR). We\ninvestigate the contrastive learning-based SISR from two perspectives: sample\nconstruction and feature embedding. The existing methods propose some naive\nsample construction approaches (e.g., considering the low-quality input as a\nnegative sample and the ground truth as a positive sample) and they adopt a\nprior model (e.g., pre-trained VGG model) to obtain the feature embedding\ninstead of exploring a task-friendly one.

The McKean-Vlasov-Ito process that transforms\nparticles is defined via an optimal drift that depends on the selected\ndiffusion term.

Distinct contribution is made by every variable to\nthe post-acceptance of e-learning platforms. A hybrid model was used in the\ncurrent study in which technology acceptance model (TAM) determinants were\nemployed along with other external factors such as fear of vaccination,\nperceived routine use, perceived enjoyment, perceived critical mass, and\nself-efficiency which are directly linked to post-acceptance of e-learning\nplatforms.
