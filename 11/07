With the help of ubiquitous wireless connections and\npowerful edge computing technologies, VR users in wireless edge-empowered\nMetaverse can immerse in the virtual through the access of VR services offered\nby different providers. However, VR applications are computation- and\ncommunication-intensive. The VR service providers (SPs) have to optimize the VR\nservice delivery efficiently and economically given their limited communication\nand computation resources. An incentive mechanism can be thus applied as an\neffective tool for managing VR services between providers and users. Therefore,\nin this paper, we propose a learning-based Incentive Mechanism framework for VR\nservices in the Metaverse. First, we propose the quality of perception as the\nmetric for VR users immersing in the virtual world. Second, for quick trading\nof VR services between VR users (i.e., buyers) and VR SPs (i.e., sellers), we\ndesign a double Dutch auction mechanism to determine optimal pricing and\nallocation rules in this market. Third, for auction communication reduction, we\ndesign a deep reinforcement learning-based auctioneer to accelerate this\nauction process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework\ncan achieve near-optimal social welfare while reducing at least half of the\nauction information exchange cost than baseline methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 13:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

Several quantum network\nsimulators have been recently developed with these goals in mind. However, as\nthe size of the simulated networks increases, sequential execution becomes time\nconsuming. Parallel execution presents a suitable method for scalable\nsimulations of large-scale quantum networks, but the unique attributes of\nquantum information create some unexpected challenges. In this work we identify\nrequirements for parallel simulation of quantum networks and develop the first\nparallel discrete event quantum network simulator by modifying the existing\nserial SeQUeNCe simulator. Our contributions include the design and development\nof a quantum state manager (QSM) that maintains shared quantum information\ndistributed across multiple processes.

SiC dust could be a\nsignificant constituent of interstellar dust since it is generally believed\nthat carbon stars inject a considerable amount of dust into the interstellar\nmedium (ISM). The presence of SiC dust in the ISM is also supported by the\nidentification of presolar SiC grains of stellar origin in primitive\nmeteorites. However, the 11.3-micron absorption feature of SiC has never been\nseen in the ISM and oxidative destruction of SiC is often invoked. In this work\nwe quantitatively explore the destruction of interstellar SiC dust through\noxidation based on molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory\ncalculations. We find that the reaction of an oxygen atom with SiC molecules\nand clusters is exothermic and could cause CO-loss. Nevertheless, even if this\nis extrapolable to bulk SiC dust, the destruction rate of SiC dust through\noxidation could still be considerably smaller than the (currently believed)\ninjection rate from carbon stars. Therefore, the lack of the 11.3-micron\nabsorption feature of SiC dust in the ISM remains a mystery. A possible\nsolution may lie in the currently believed stellar injection rate of SiC (which\nmay have been overestimated) and/or the size of SiC dust (which may actually be\nconsiderably smaller than submicron in size).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2021 17:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

We propose a new algorithm for thermal state preparation that tackles\nthose three challenges by exploiting the noise of quantum circuits.

Given a stream $S$ of elements from some universe $U=\\{1 \\ldots\nn\\}$, the goal is to compute, in a single pass, a short sketch of $S$ so that\nfor any element $i \\in U$, one can estimate the number $x_i$ of times $i$\noccurs in $S$ based on the sketch alone. Two state of the art solutions to this\nproblems are the Count-Min and Count-Sketch algorithms. The frequency estimator\n$\\tilde{x}$ produced by Count-Min, using $O(1/\\varepsilon \\cdot \\log n)$\ndimensions, guarantees that $\\|\\tilde{x}-x\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\varepsilon \\|x\\|_1$\nwith high probability, and $\\tilde{x} \\ge x$ holds deterministically.

From the K band spectra, we\nmeasured stellar temperatures and magnetic field strengths using a magnetic\nradiative transfer code.

One type of hardware Trojans leverages the don't care transitions in\nFinite State Machines (FSMs) of hardware designs. In this paper, we present a\nsymbolic approach to detecting don't care transitions and the hidden Trojans.\nOur detection approach works at both RTL and gate-level, does not require a\ngolden design, and works in three stages. In the first stage, it explores the\nreachable states. In the second stage, it performs an approximate analysis to\nfind the don't care transitions. In the third stage, it performs a state-space\nexploration from reachable states that have incoming don't care transitions to\nfind behavioral discrepancies with respect to what has been observed in the\nfirst stage. We also present a pruning technique based on the reachability of\nFSM states. We present a methodology that leverages both RTL and gate-level for\nsoundness and efficiency. Specifically, we show that don't care transitions\nmust be detected at the gate-level, i.e., after synthesis has been performed,\nfor soundness. However, under specific conditions, Trojan detection can be\nperformed more efficiently at RTL. Evaluation of our approach on a set of\nbenchmarks from OpenCores and TrustHub and using gate-level representation\ngenerated by two synthesis tools, Yosys and Synopsis Design Compiler (SDC),\nshows that our approach is both efficient (up to 10X speedup w.r.t. no pruning)\nand precise (0% false positives) in detecting don't care transitions and the\nTrojans that leverage them.

Method: We trained a deep\nlearning network to automatically segment the CRVT&B from the B-scans of the\noptical coherence tomography (OCT) volume of the optic nerve head (ONH).\nSubsequently, two different approaches were used for glaucoma diagnosis using\nthe structural configuration of the CRVT&B as extracted from the OCT volumes.\nIn the first approach, we aimed to provide a diagnosis using only 3D CNN and\nthe 3D structure of the CRVT&B. For the second approach, we projected the 3D\nstructure of the CRVT&B orthographically onto three planes to obtain 2D images,\nand then a 2D CNN was used for diagnosis.

Second,\nnon-stationary data distribution makes it difficult to strike a balance between\nfitting regular frames and hard samples with severe occlusions or dramatic\nchanges. To this end, we propose the Dynamic Bilevel Online Adaptation\nalgorithm (DynaBOA).

Finite-state dimension is a robust\nconcept that now has equivalent formulations in terms of finite-state gambling,\nlossless finite-state data compression, finite-state prediction, entropy rates,\nand automatic Kolmogorov complexity. The Schnorr-Stimm dichotomy theorem gave\nthe first automata-theoretic characterization of normal sequences, which had\nbeen studied in analytic number theory since Borel defined them. This theorem\nimplies that a sequence (or a real number having this sequence as its base-b\nexpansion) is normal if and only if it has finite-state dimension 1. One of the\nmost powerful classical tools for investigating normal numbers is the Weyl\ncriterion, which characterizes normality in terms of exponential sums. Such\nsums are well studied objects with many connections to other aspects of\nanalytic number theory, and this has made use of Weyl criterion especially\nfruitful. This raises the question whether Weyl criterion can be generalized\nfrom finite-state dimension 1 to arbitrary finite-state dimensions, thereby\nmaking it a quantitative tool for studying data compression, prediction, etc.\n  This paper does exactly this. We extend the Weyl criterion from a\ncharacterization of sequences with finite-state dimension 1 to a criterion that\ncharacterizes every finite-state dimension. This turns out not to be a routine\ngeneralization of the original Weyl criterion.

There are two main approaches to build such a system in recent\nworks: speaker adaptation and speaker encoding. On the one hand, speaker\nadaptation methods fine-tune a trained multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) model\nwith few enrolled samples. However, they require at least thousands of\nfine-tuning steps for high-quality adaptation, making it hard to apply on\ndevices. On the other hand, speaker encoding methods encode enrollment\nutterances into a speaker embedding. The trained TTS model can synthesize the\nuser's speech conditioned on the corresponding speaker embedding. Nevertheless,\nthe speaker encoder suffers from the generalization gap between the seen and\nunseen speakers.\n  In this paper, we propose applying a meta-learning algorithm to the speaker\nadaptation method. More specifically, we use Model Agnostic Meta-Learning\n(MAML) as the training algorithm of a multi-speaker TTS model, which aims to\nfind a great meta-initialization to adapt the model to any few-shot speaker\nadaptation tasks quickly. Therefore, we can also adapt the meta-trained TTS\nmodel to unseen speakers efficiently. Our experiments compare the proposed\nmethod (Meta-TTS) with two baselines: a speaker adaptation method baseline and\na speaker encoding method baseline. The evaluation results show that Meta-TTS\ncan synthesize high speaker-similarity speech from few enrollment samples with\nfewer adaptation steps than the speaker adaptation baseline and outperforms the\nspeaker encoding baseline under the same training scheme. When the speaker\nencoder of the baseline is pre-trained with extra 8371 speakers of data,\nMeta-TTS can still outperform the baseline on LibriTTS dataset and achieve\ncomparable results on VCTK dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 09:53:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 04:13:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 13:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

In this context, for systems\ncomprised of different parts, it is common to describe the dynamics of a\nsubsystem of interest by making an adiabatic elimination of the remaining\ncomponents of the system. This procedure often leads to an effective master\nequation for the subsystem that is not in the well-known\nGorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan form (here called standard Lindblad\nform). Instead, it has a more general structure (here called generalized\nLindblad form), which explicitly reveals the dissipative coupling between the\nvarious components of the subsystem. Moreover, for systems weakly coupled to a\nreservoir, the presence of counter-rotating terms in the interaction\nHamiltonian or the nonstationarity of the reservoir state guarantees that the\nmaster equation describing the system of interest will be of the generalized\nLindblad form. In this work, we present a set of dynamical equations for the\nfirst and second moments of the canonical variables for linear systems, bosonic\nand fermionic, described by generalized Lindblad master equations.

Subsequently,\nmeta-workers are asked to annotate the remaining crowdsourced tasks. The\nJensen-Shannon divergence is used to measure the disagreement among the\nannotations provided by the meta-workers, which determines whether or not crowd\nworkers should be invited for further annotation of the same task. Finally, we\nmodel meta-workers' preferences and compute the consensus annotation by\nweighted majority voting.

Some of these applications demand entity\nquery matching against large-scale reference databases within a short time. We\ndefine this as the query matching problem in ER in this work. Indexing or\nblocking techniques reduce the search space and execution time in the ER\nprocess. However, approximate indexing techniques that scale to very\nlarge-scale datasets remain open to research. In this paper, we investigate the\nquery matching problem in ER to propose an indexing method suitable for\napproximate and efficient query matching.\n  We first use spatial mappings to embed records in a multidimensional\nEuclidean space that preserves the domain-specific similarity. Among the\nvarious mapping techniques, we choose multidimensional scaling. Then using a\nKd-tree and the nearest neighbour search, the method returns a block of records\nthat includes potential matches for a query. Our method can process queries\nagainst a large-scale dataset using only a fraction of the data $L$ (given the\ndataset size is $N$), with a $O(L^2)$ complexity where $L \\ll N$. The\nexperiments conducted on several datasets showed the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 12:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

Improving its multifrequency detection\nwould allow to take into account valuable information otherwise neglected when\nextracting PS using a channel-by-channel approach. We develop a method based on\nNeural Networks (NNs) to detect PS in multifrequency realistic simulations and\ncompare its performance against one of the most popular methods, the matrix\nfilters. The frequencies used are 143, 217 and 353 GHz and we impose a Galactic\ncut of 30 degrees. We produce simulations by adding contaminating signals to\nthe PS maps as the CMB, the Cosmic Infrared Background, the Galactic thermal\nemission, the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and the instrumental noise.\nThese simulations are used to train two NNs called Flat and Spectral\nMultiPoSeIDoN. The first one considers PS with a flat spectrum and the second\none is more realistic because it takes into account the spectral behavior of\nthe PS. Using a detection limit of 60 mJy, Flat MultiPoSeIDoN reachs the 90% of\ncompleteness level at 58 mJy and at 79, 71 and 60 for the spectral case at 143,\n217 and 353 GHz respectively, while the matrix filters reach it at 84, 79 and\n123 mJy. Using safer 4{\\sigma} detection limit does not help to improve these\nresults. In all cases, MultiPoSeIDoN obtain a much lower number of spurious\nsources than the filter. The NNs recover the flux density of the detections\nwith a relative error of 10% above 100 mJy, while the filter above 150 mJy.\nBased on the results, NNs are the perfect candidates to substitute filters to\ndetect multifrequency PS in future CMB experiments. Moreover, we have shown\nthat a multifrequency approach can detect sources with higher accuracy than\nsingle-frequency approaches also based on NNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 13:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 09:45:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Empirically, we show that existing\nbias-only models fall short in producing accurate uncertainty estimations.\nMotivated by these findings, we propose to conduct calibration on the bias-only\nmodel, thus achieving a three-stage ensemble-based debiasing framework,\nincluding bias modeling, model calibrating, and debiasing. Experimental results\non NLI and fact verification tasks show that our proposed three-stage debiasing\nframework consistently outperforms the traditional two-stage one in\nout-of-distribution accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 15:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

In many applications,\nlearning participant communication rounds benefit from collecting their own\nprivate data sets, teaching detailed machine learning models on the real data,\nand sharing the benefits of using these models. Due to existing privacy and\nsecurity concerns, most people avoid sensitive data sharing for training.\nWithout each user demonstrating their local data to a central server, Federated\nLearning allows various parties to train a machine learning algorithm on their\nshared data jointly. This method of collective privacy learning results in the\nexpense of important communication during training. Most large-scale\nmachine-learning applications require decentralized learning based on data sets\ngenerated on various devices and places. Such datasets represent an essential\nobstacle to decentralized learning, as their diverse contexts contribute to\nsignificant differences in the delivery of data across devices and locations.\nResearchers have proposed several ways to achieve data privacy in Federated\nLearning systems. However, there are still challenges with homogeneous local\ndata. This research approach is to select nodes (users) to share their data in\nFederated Learning for independent data-based equilibrium to improve accuracy,\nreduce training time, and increase convergence. Therefore, this research\npresents a combined Deep-QReinforcement Learning Ensemble based on Spectral\nClustering called DQRE-SCnet to choose a subset of devices in each\ncommunication round.

However, there is a steep development curve for\nquantitative traders to obtain an agent that automatically positions to win in\nthe market, namely \\textit{to decide where to trade, at what price} and\n\\textit{what quantity}, due to the error-prone programming and arduous\ndebugging. In this paper, we present the first open-source framework\n\\textit{FinRL} as a full pipeline to help quantitative traders overcome the\nsteep learning curve. FinRL is featured with simplicity, applicability and\nextensibility under the key principles, \\textit{full-stack framework,\ncustomization, reproducibility} and \\textit{hands-on tutoring}.\n  Embodied as a three-layer architecture with modular structures, FinRL\nimplements fine-tuned state-of-the-art DRL algorithms and common reward\nfunctions, while alleviating the debugging workloads. Thus, we help users\npipeline the strategy design at a high turnover rate. At multiple levels of\ntime granularity, FinRL simulates various markets as training environments\nusing historical data and live trading APIs. Being highly extensible, FinRL\nreserves a set of user-import interfaces and incorporates trading constraints\nsuch as market friction, market liquidity and investor's risk-aversion.\nMoreover, serving as practitioners' stepping stones, typical trading tasks are\nprovided as step-by-step tutorials, e.g., stock trading, portfolio allocation,\ncryptocurrency trading, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 00:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

Although attention is known to modulate neural representations,\nit is unknown how imagery changes neural representations when imagined and\nperceived images semantically conflict. We hypothesized that imagining an image\nwould activate a neural representation during its perception even while\nwatching a conflicting image. To test this hypothesis, we developed a\nclosed-loop system to show images inferred from electrocorticograms using a\nvisual semantic space. The successful control of the feedback images\ndemonstrated that the semantic vector inferred from electrocorticograms became\ncloser to the vector of the imagined category, even while watching images from\ndifferent categories. Moreover, modulation of the inferred vectors by mental\nimagery depended on both the image category and time from the initiation of\nimagery. The closed-loop control of the semantic vectors revealed an\nasymmetrical interaction between visual perception and imagery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 14:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

As a core technology of AI, it plays a vital role\nin developing intelligent systems, such as games and game engines, neural-based\nsystems including a variety of deep network models, evolutionary-based\noptimization methods, and advanced cognitive techniques. The 2021 IEEE CIS\nSummer School on CI for High-School Student Learning was held physically at the\nJanFuSun Resort Hotel, Taiwan, and virtually on Zoom, on August 10-12, 2021.\nThe main contents of the Summer School were lectures focused on the basics of\nFL, NN, and EC and the workshop on AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things).\nInvited speakers gave nine courses covering topics like CI real-world\napplications, fundamentals of FL, and the introduction to NN and EC. The 2021\nSummer School was supported by the 2021 IEEE CIS High School Outreach\nSubcommittee. We also invited students and teachers of high and elementary\nschools from Taiwan, Japan, and Indonesia. They attended the school and\nparticipated in AIoT workshop, gaining experience in applications of AIoT-FML\nlearning tools. According to the short report and feedback from the involved\nstudents and teachers, we find out that most participants have quickly\nunderstood the principles of CI, FL, NN, and EC. In addition, one of the\nteachers sent the following remark to the organizers: \"This is a great event to\nintroduce students to computational intelligence at a young age, stimulate them\nto be involved in rapidly evolving fields, and foster participation in future\nresearch adventures.\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 03:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}
