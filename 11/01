However, it is well known that the DSC loss is poorly calibrated,\nresulting in overconfident predictions that cannot be usefully interpreted in\nbiomedical and clinical practice. Performance is often the only metric used to\nevaluate segmentations produced by deep neural networks, and calibration is\noften neglected. However, calibration is important for translation into\nbiomedical and clinical practice, providing crucial contextual information to\nmodel predictions for interpretation by scientists and clinicians. In this\nstudy, we provide a simple yet effective extension of the DSC loss, named the\nDSC++ loss, that selectively modulates the penalty associated with\noverconfident, incorrect predictions. As a standalone loss function, the DSC++\nloss achieves significantly improved calibration over the conventional DSC loss\nacross six well-validated open-source biomedical imaging datasets, including\nboth 2D binary and 3D multi-class segmentation tasks. Similarly, we observe\nsignificantly improved calibration when integrating the DSC++ loss into four\nDSC-based loss functions. Finally, we use softmax thresholding to illustrate\nthat well calibrated outputs enable tailoring of recall-precision bias, which\nis an important post-processing technique to adapt the model predictions to\nsuit the biomedical or clinical task. The DSC++ loss overcomes the major\nlimitation of the DSC loss, providing a suitable loss function for training\ndeep learning segmentation models for use in biomedical and clinical practice.\nSource code is available at: https://github.com/mlyg/DicePlusPlus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 16:02:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 09:26:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

The finite-size effect must play a key role in\nthis system and needs a detailed description. However, the previous theoretical\nanalysis of finite-size effect is often not accurate enough and only gives the\nleading-order contribution due to a divergence difficulty.

We quantify the effect of\naccretion and viewing angle on metallicity estimates derived from absorption\nlines. Model parameters are chosen to provide strong lower limits on cloud\ncontamination by ambient gas. Consistent with previous results, a cloud\ntraveling through a stratified halo is contaminated by ambient material to the\npoint that <10% of its mass in neutral hydrogen consists of original cloud\nmaterial. Contamination progresses nearly linearly with time, and it increases\nfrom head to tail. Therefore, metallicity estimates will depend on the\nevolutionary state of the cloud, and on position. While metallicities change\nwith time by more than a factor of 10, well beyond observational uncertainties,\nmost lines-of-sight range only within those uncertainties at any given time\nover all positions. Metallicity estimates vary with the cloud's inclination\nangle within observational uncertainties. The cloud survives the infall through\nthe halo because ambient gas continuously condenses and cools in the cloud's\nwake and thus appears in the neutral phase. Therefore, the cloud observed at\nany fixed time is not a well-defined structure across time, since material gets\nconstantly replaced. The thermal phases of the cloud are largely determined by\nthe ambient pressure.

In particular, the\nubiquitous nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) equation with the cubic self-focusing,\ncreates only unstable 2D and 3D solitons, because the same equation gives rise\nto the critical and supercritical collapse in the 2D and 3D cases,\nrespectively. This article offers, first, a review of relevant settings which,\nnevertheless, make it possible to create stable 2D and 3D solitons, including\nones with embedded vorticity. The main stabilization schemes considered here\nare: (i) competing (e.g., cubic-quintic) and saturable nonlinearities; (2)\nlinear and nonlinear trapping potentials; (3) the Lee-Huang-Yang correction to\nthe BEC dynamics, leading to the formation of robust quantum droplets; (4)\nspin-orbit-coupling (SOC) effects in binary BEC; (5) emulation of SOC in\nnonlinear optical waveguides, including PT-symmetric ones. Further, a detailed\nsummary is presented for results which demonstrate the creation of stable 2D\nand 3D solitons by schemes based on the usual linear trapping potentials or\neffective nonlinear ones, which may be induced by means of spatial modulation\nof the local nonlinearity strength. The latter setting is especially promising,\nmaking it possible to use self-defocusing media, with the local nonlinearity\nstrength growing fast enough from the center to periphery, for the creation of\na great variety of stable multidimensional modes. In addition to fundamental\nones and vortex rings, the 3D modes may be hopfions, i.e., twisted vortex rings\nwith two independent topological charges. Many results for the multidimensional\nsolitons are obtained, in such settings, not only in a numerical form, but also\nby means of analytical methods, such as the variational and Thomas-Fermi\napproximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 17:08:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

In particular, both Keck and VLT\n(GRAVITY) teams declared that the gravitational redshift near its pericenter\npassage for the S2 star orbit corresponds to theoretical estimates found with\nthe first pN approximation.

It has growing applications for data-driven decisions in\nmajor smart city solutions, including transportation, education, healthcare,\npublic governance, and power systems. At the same time, it is gaining\npopularity in protecting critical cyber infrastructure from cyber threats,\nattacks, damages, or unauthorized access. However, one of the significant\nissues of those traditional AI technologies (e.g., deep learning) is that the\nrapid progress in complexity and sophistication propelled and turned out to be\nuninterpretable black boxes. On many occasions, it is very challenging to\nunderstand the decision and bias to control and trust systems' unexpected or\nseemingly unpredictable outputs. It is acknowledged that the loss of control\nover interpretability of decision-making becomes a critical issue for many\ndata-driven automated applications. But how may it affect the system's security\nand trustworthiness? This chapter conducts a comprehensive study of machine\nlearning applications in cybersecurity to indicate the need for explainability\nto address this question. While doing that, this chapter first discusses the\nblack-box problems of AI technologies for Cybersecurity applications in smart\ncity-based solutions. Later, considering the new technological paradigm,\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), this chapter discusses the\ntransition from black-box to white-box. This chapter also discusses the\ntransition requirements concerning the interpretability, transparency,\nunderstandability, and Explainability of AI-based technologies in applying\ndifferent autonomous systems in smart cities. Finally, it has presented some\ncommercial XAI platforms that offer explainability over traditional AI\ntechnologies before presenting future challenges and opportunities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 21:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

State-of-the-art hash tables offer the following guarantee: If\nkeys/values are Theta(log n) bits each, then it is possible to achieve\nconstant-time insertions/deletions/queries while wasting only O(loglog n) bits\nof space per key when compared to the information-theoretic optimum. Even prior\nto this bound being achieved, the target of O(loglog n) wasted bits per key was\nknown to be a natural end goal, and was proven to be optimal for a number of\nclosely related problems (e.g., stable hashing, dynamic retrieval, and\ndynamically-resized filters).\n  This paper shows that O(loglog n) wasted bits per key is not the end of the\nline for hashing. In fact, for any k \\in [log* n], it is possible to achieve\nO(k)-time insertions/deletions, O(1)-time queries, and O(\\log^{(k)} n) wasted\nbits per key (all with high probability in n). This means that, each time we\nincrease insertion/deletion time by an \\emph{additive constant}, we reduce the\nwasted bits per key \\emph{exponentially}.

The UAVs are assumed to\nbe randomly deployed at a fixed height according to a two-dimensional point\nprocess. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies are used to avail of large\navailable bandwidths and spatial isolation due to beamforming. In urban\nenvironments, mmWave signals are prone to blocking of the line-of-sight (LoS)\nby buildings. While reflections are possible, the desire for consistent\nconnectivity places a strong preference on the existence of an unblocked LoS\npath. As such, the key performance metric considered in this paper is the\nconnectivity probability, which is the probability of an unblocked LoS path to\nat least one UAV within some maximum transmission distance. By leveraging tools\nfrom stochastic geometry, the connectivity probability is characterized as a\nfunction of the city type (e.g., urban, dense urban, suburban), density of UAVs\n(average number of UAVs per square km), and height of the UAVs. The city\nstreets are modeled as a Manhattan Poisson Line Process (MPLP) and the building\nheights are randomly distributed. The analysis first finds the connectivity\nprobability conditioned on a particular network realization (location of the\nUAVs) and then removes the conditioning to uncover the distribution of the\nconnectivity; i.e., the fraction of network realizations that will fail to meet\nan outage threshold. While related work has applied an MPLP to networks with a\nsingle UAV, the contributions of this paper are that it (1) considers networks\nof multiple UAVs, (2) characterizes the performance by a connectivity\ndistribution, and (3) identifies the optimal altitude for the UAVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 21:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

A\nremarkable property of graph is that a latent hierarchical grouping of nodes\nexists in a global perspective, where each node manifests its membership to a\nspecific group based on the context composed by its neighboring nodes. Most\nprior works ignore such latent groups and nodes' membership to different\ngroups, not to mention the hierarchy, when modeling the neighborhood structure.\nThus, they fall short of delivering a comprehensive understanding of the nodes\nunder different contexts in a graph. In this paper, we propose a novel\nhierarchical attentive membership model for graph embedding, where the latent\nmemberships for each node are dynamically discovered based on its neighboring\ncontext. Both group-level and individual-level attentions are performed when\naggregating neighboring states to generate node embeddings. We introduce\nstructural constraints to explicitly regularize the inferred memberships of\neach node, such that a well-defined hierarchical grouping structure is\ncaptured. The proposed model outperformed a set of state-of-the-art graph\nembedding solutions on node classification and link prediction tasks in a\nvariety of graphs including citation networks and social networks.

Besides, we\nhave shown that the 5-colorability problem is NP-complete on visibility graphs\nof simple polygons, and 4-colorability is NP-complete on visibility graphs of\npolygons with holes.\n  Then, we move further with the notion of visibility, and define a graph class\nwhich considers the real-world limitations for the applications of visibility\ngraphs. That is, no physical object has infinite range, and two objects might\nnot be mutually visible from a certain distance although there are no obstacles\nin-between. To model this property, we introduce unit disk visibility graphs,\nand show that the 3-colorability problem is NP-complete for unit disk\nvisibility graphs of a set of line segments, and a polygon with holes.\n  After bridging the gap between the visibility and the unit disk graphs, we\nthen present our results on the recognition of unit disk graphs in a restricted\nsetting -- axes-parallel unit disk graphs.

Readers interested in seeing extensions to continuous symmetries,\nnon-ideal environments or more realistic particle-physics contexts are provided\nwith links to separate papers which delve into such details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 23:06:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 01:26:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 13:01:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 08:46:07 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 23:53:09 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 13:05:54 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2022 13:40:26 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 01:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

Prior research has explored supporting such assessments by explaining\nDST data inputs and algorithmic mechanisms. This paper explores a different\napproach: Providing precisely relevant, scientific evidence from biomedical\nliterature. We present a proof-of-concept system, Clinical Evidence Engine, to\ndemonstrate the technical and design feasibility of this approach across three\ndomains (cardiovascular diseases, autism, cancer). Leveraging Clinical BioBERT,\nthe system can effectively identify clinical trial reports based on lengthy\nclinical questions (e.g., \"risks of catheter infection among adult patients in\nintensive care unit who require arterial catheters, if treated with povidone\niodine-alcohol\"). This capability enables the system to identify clinical\ntrials relevant to diagnostic/treatment hypotheses -- a clinician's or a\nCDSS's. Further, Clinical Evidence Engine can identify key parts of a clinical\ntrial abstract, including patient population (e.g., adult patients in intensive\ncare unit who require arterial catheters), intervention (povidone\niodine-alcohol), and outcome (risks of catheter infection). This capability\nopens up the possibility of enabling clinicians to 1) rapidly determine the\nmatch between a clinical trial and a clinical question, and 2) understand the\nresult and contexts of the trial without extensive reading. We demonstrate this\npotential by illustrating two example use scenarios of the system.

In FL, since mobile devices collaborate to train a model\nbased on their own data under the coordination of a central server by sharing\njust the model updates, training data is maintained private. However, without\nthe central availability of data, computing nodes need to communicate the model\nupdates often to attain convergence. Hence, the local computation time to\ncreate local model updates along with the time taken for transmitting them to\nand from the server result in a delay in the overall time. Furthermore,\nunreliable network connections may obstruct an efficient communication of these\nupdates. To address these, in this paper, we propose a delay-efficient FL\nmechanism that reduces the overall time (consisting of both the computation and\ncommunication latencies) and communication rounds required for the model to\nconverge. Exploring the impact of various parameters contributing to delay, we\nseek to balance the trade-off between wireless communication (to talk) and\nlocal computation (to work).

That being said, with\nrecent developments in machine learning, face-detection systems have achieved\nextraordinary accuracy, largely built on data-driven deep-learning models [70].\nThough encouraging, a critical aspect that limits face-detection performance\nand social responsibility of deployed systems is the inherent diversity of\nhuman appearance.

However, most of the existing distillation-based detection methods\nmainly imitating features near bounding boxes, which suffer from two\nlimitations. First, they ignore the beneficial features outside the bounding\nboxes. Second, these methods imitate some features which are mistakenly\nregarded as the background by the teacher detector. To address the above\nissues, we propose a novel Feature-Richness Score (FRS) method to choose\nimportant features that improve generalized detectability during distilling.\nThe proposed method effectively retrieves the important features outside the\nbounding boxes and removes the detrimental features within the bounding boxes.\nExtensive experiments show that our methods achieve excellent performance on\nboth anchor-based and anchor-free detectors.

Previous studies focus on modeling user-item interactions with\nmultimodal features included as side information. However, this scheme is not\nwell-designed for multimedia recommendation. Firstly, only collaborative\nitem-item relationships are implicitly modeled through high-order\nitem-user-item co-occurrences. We argue that the latent semantic item-item\nstructures underlying these multimodal contents could be beneficial for\nlearning better item representations and assist the recommender models to\ncomprehensively discover candidate items.

Although having access to multiple\nmodalities might allow us to capture rich information, we argue that the simple\ncoarse-grained fusion by linear combination or concatenation in previous work\nis insufficient to fully understand content information and item\nrelationships.To this end, we propose a latent structure MIning with\nContRastive mOdality fusion method (MICRO for brevity). To be specific, we\ndevise a novel modality-aware structure learning module, which learns item-item\nrelationships for each modality. Based on the learned modality-aware latent\nitem relationships, we perform graph convolutions that explicitly inject item\naffinities to modality-aware item representations.

This\nencourages many researchers to work on designing DNNs without residual\nconnections at inference. For example, RepVGG re-parameterizes multi-branch\ntopology to a VGG-like (single-branch) model when deploying, showing great\nperformance when the network is relatively shallow. However, RepVGG can not\ntransform ResNet to VGG equivalently because re-parameterizing methods can only\nbe applied to linear blocks and the non-linear layers (ReLU) have to be put\noutside of the residual connection which results in limited representation\nability, especially for deeper networks. In this paper, we aim to remedy this\nproblem and propose to remove the residual connection in a vanilla ResNet\nequivalently by a reserving and merging (RM) operation on ResBlock.\nSpecifically, the RM operation allows input feature maps to pass through the\nblock while reserving their information and merges all the information at the\nend of each block, which can remove residual connections without changing the\noriginal output. As a plug-in method, RM Operation basically has three\nadvantages: 1) its implementation makes it naturally friendly for high ratio\nnetwork pruning. 2) it helps break the depth limitation of RepVGG. 3) it leads\nto better accuracy-speed trade-off network (RMNet) compared to ResNet and\nRepVGG. We believe the ideology of RM Operation can inspire many insights on\nmodel design for the community in the future.

Mitigating such unavoidable\nerrors is crucial to explore the power of quantum hardware better. In this\npaper, we propose a unified framework that can mitigate quantum gate and\nmeasurement errors in computing quantum expectation values utilizing the\ntruncated Neumann series. The essential idea is to cancel the effect of quantum\nerror by approximating its inverse via linearly combining quantum errors of\ndifferent orders produced by sequential applications of the quantum devices\nwith carefully chosen coefficients. Remarkably, the estimation error decays\nexponentially in the truncated order, and the incurred error mitigation\noverhead is independent of the system size, as long as the noise resistance of\nthe quantum device is moderate. We numerically test this framework for\ndifferent quantum errors and find that the computation accuracy is\nsubstantially improved. Our framework possesses several vital advantages: it\nmitigates quantum gate and measurement errors in a unified manner, it neither\nassumes any error structure nor requires the tomography procedure to completely\ncharacterize the quantum errors, and most importantly, it is scalable.

On an evaluation set that we annotated\non questions from Ko et al. (2020), we show that DCQA provides valuable\nsupervision for answering open-ended questions. We additionally design\npre-training methods utilizing existing question-answering resources, and use\nsynthetic data to accommodate unanswerable questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 04:50:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 18:18:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 01:09:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 04:44:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Thus it has become a necessity to organize and\nmaintain these documents in an optimum manner. Text classification algorithms\nstudy the complex relationships between words in a text and try to interpret\nthe semantics of the document. These algorithms have evolved significantly in\nthe past few years. There has been a lot of progress from simple machine\nlearning algorithms to transformer-based architectures. However, existing\nliterature has analyzed different approaches on different data sets thus making\nit difficult to compare the performance of machine learning algorithms. In this\nwork, we revisit long document classification using standard machine learning\napproaches. We benchmark approaches ranging from simple Naive Bayes to complex\nBERT on six standard text classification datasets. We present an exhaustive\ncomparison of different algorithms on a range of long document datasets. We\nre-iterate that long document classification is a simpler task and even basic\nalgorithms perform competitively with BERT-based approaches on most of the\ndatasets. The BERT-based models perform consistently well on all the datasets\nand can be blindly used for the document classification task when the\ncomputations cost is not a concern. In the shallow model's category, we suggest\nthe usage of raw BiLSTM + Max architecture which performs decently across all\nthe datasets. Even simpler Glove + Attention bag of words model can be utilized\nfor simpler use cases. The importance of using sophisticated models is clearly\nvisible in the IMDB sentiment dataset which is a comparatively harder task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 04:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

We find a fragmented web ecosystem: while most websites\nhave secure configurations, this is largely due to major cloud providers that\noffer secure defaults.

This may be in part because common resources available to individual\noperators -- server software defaults and online configuration guides -- are\nfrequently insecure.

This paper proposes a new\nstate space and a semi-Markov model for music time structure analysis. The\nproposed approach turns the commonly used 2D state spaces into a 1D model\nthrough a jump-back reward strategy. It reduces the state spaces size\ndrastically. We then utilize the proposed method for causal, joint beat,\ndownbeat, tempo, and meter tracking, and compare it against several previous\nmethods.

Even though it brings\nseveral benefits, SDN is vulnerable to a diversity of attacks. Abusing the\nsingle point of failure in the SDN controller component, hackers can shut down\nall network operations. More specifics, a malicious OpenFlow application can\naccess to SDN controller to carry out harmful actions without any limitation\nowing to the lack of the access control mechanism as a standard in the\nNorthbound. The sensitive information about the whole network such as network\ntopology, flow information, and statistics can be gathered and leaked out. Even\nworse, the entire network can be taken over by the compromised controller.\nHence, it is vital to build a scheme of access control for SDN's Northbound.\nFurthermore, it must also protect the data integrity and availability during\ndata exchange between application and controller. To address such limitations,\nwe introduce B-DAC, a blockchain-based framework for decentralized\nauthentication and fine-grained access control for the Northbound interface to\nassist administrators in managing and protecting critical resources. With\nstrict policy enforcement, B-DAC can perform decentralized access control for\neach request to keep network applications under surveillance for preventing\nover-privileged activities or security policy conflicts. To demonstrate the\nfeasibility of our approach, we also implement a prototype of this framework to\nevaluate the security impact, effectiveness, and performance through typical\nuse cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 04:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

In this Letter, we\nreport the compound eruptions of twin close flux ropes (FR1 and FR2) within a\nfew minutes that resulted in a flare with a single soft X-ray peak and a CME\nwith two cores. The successive groups of expanding loops and double peaks of\nintensity flux in AIA cool wavelengths indicate two episodes of internal\nmagnetic reconnections during the compound eruptions. Following the eruption of\nFR2, the erupting FR1 was accelerated, and then the expanding loops overlying\nFR2 were deflected. Moreover, the eruption of FR2 likely involved the external\nmagnetic reconnection between the bottom of the overlying stretching field\nlines and the rebounding loops that were previously pushed by the eruption of\nFR1, which was evidenced by a pair of groups of newly-formed loops. All results\nsuggest that the compound eruptions involved both internal and external\nmagnetic reconnections, and two erupting structures of twin FRs interacted at\nthe initial stage.

In this work, we avoid handcrafting robust\nloss functions, and propose to use graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn\ntransformation synchronization. Unlike previous works which use complicated\nmulti-stage pipelines, we use an iterative approach where each step consists of\na single weight-shared message passing layer that refines the absolute poses\nfrom the previous iteration by predicting an incremental update in the tangent\nspace.

Whether these vibrational properties\nare advantageous or detrimental to their optoelectronic properties remains,\nhowever, an important open question. Here, this issue is addressed by\ninvestigation of the {finite-temperature optoelectronic properties} in the\nprototypical cubic CsPbBr$_3$, using first-principles molecular dynamics based\non density-functional theory. It is shown that the dynamic flexibility\nassociated with halide perovskites enables the so-called transversality, which\nmanifests as a preference for large halide displacements perpendicular to the\nPb-Br-Pb bonding axis. We find that transversality is concurrent with\nvibrational anharmonicity and leads to a rapid rise in the joint density of\nstates, which is favorable for photovoltaics since this implies sharp optical\nabsorption profiles. These findings are contrasted to the case of PbTe, a\nmaterial that shares several key properties with CsPbBr$_3$ but cannot exhibit\nany transversality and, hence, is found to exhibit much wider band-edge\ndistributions. We conclude that the dynamic structural flexibility in halide\nperovskites and their unusual vibrational characteristics might not just be a\nmere coincidence, but play active roles in establishing their favorable\noptoelectronic properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 07:04:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 13:54:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

Due\nto the large number of hyper-parameters in both the policy learning and DR\nalgorithms, one often ends up with a large number of trained policies, where\nchoosing the best policy among them demands costly evaluation on the real\nrobot. In this work we ask - can we rank the policies without running them in\nthe real world? Our main idea is that a predefined set of real world data can\nbe used to evaluate all policies, using out-of-distribution detection (OOD)\ntechniques. In a sense, this approach can be seen as a `unit test' to evaluate\npolicies before any real world execution. However, we find that by itself, the\nOOD score can be inaccurate and very sensitive to the particular OOD method.\nOur main contribution is a simple-yet-effective policy score that combines OOD\nwith an evaluation in simulation. We show that our score - VSDR - can\nsignificantly improve the accuracy of policy ranking without requiring\nadditional real world data. We evaluate the effectiveness of VSDR on sim2real\ntransfer in a robotic grasping task with image inputs. We extensively evaluate\ndifferent DR parameters and OOD methods, and show that VSDR improves policy\nselection across the board. More importantly, our method achieves significantly\nbetter ranking, and uses significantly less data compared to baselines.

For the MDP\nsetting, we obtain $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{H^7S^2ABT})$ regret, where\n$H$ is the number of steps per episode, $S$ is the number of states, $T$ is the\nnumber of episodes. This matches the existing lower bound in terms of $A, B$,\nand $T$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 09:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

Improving the efficiency of a payment system is\nimportant since it has a substantial impact on revenues for businesses. A\ngateway is an integral component of a payment system through which every\ntransaction is routed. In an online payment system, payment processors\nintegrate with these gateways by means of various configurations such as\npricing, methods, risk checks, etc. These configurations are called terminals.\nEach gateway can have multiple terminals associated with it. Routing a payment\ntransaction through the best terminal is crucial to increase the probability of\na payment transaction being successful. Machine learning (ML) and artificial\nintelligence (AI) techniques can be used to accurately predict the best\nterminals based on their previous performance and various payment-related\nattributes. We have devised a pipeline consisting of static and dynamic\nmodules. The static module does the initial filtering of the terminals using\nstatic rules and a logistic regression model that predicts gateway downtimes.\nSubsequently, the dynamic module computes a lot of novel features based on\nsuccess rate, payment attributes, time lag, etc. to model the terminal\nbehaviour accurately. These features are updated using an adaptive time decay\nrate algorithm in real-time using a feedback loop and passed to a random forest\nclassifier to predict the success probabilities for every terminal. This\npipeline is currently in production at Razorpay routing millions of\ntransactions through it in real-time and has given a 4-6\\% improvement in\nsuccess rate across all payment methods (credit card, debit card, UPI, net\nbanking). This has made our payment system more resilient to performance drops,\nwhich has improved the user experience, instilled more trust in the merchants,\nand boosted the revenue of the business.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 09:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

Dividing the globe into\nhomogeneous sub-regions should improve the modelling of heavy precipitation by\ninferring common regional distributional parameters. In addition, in the\ndetection and attribution (D&A) field, biases due to model errors in global\nclimate models (GCMs) should be considered to attribute the anthropogenic\nforcing effect. Within this D&A context, we propose an efficient clustering\nalgorithm that, compared to classical regional frequency analysis (RFA)\ntechniques, is covariate-free and accounts for dependence. It is based on a new\nnon-parametric dissimilarity that combines both the RFA constraint and the\npairwise dependence. We derive asymptotic properties of our dissimilarity\nestimator, and we interpret it for generalised extreme value distributed pairs.\n  As a D&A application, we cluster annual daily precipitation maxima of 16 GCMs\nfrom the coupled model intercomparison project. We combine the climatologically\nconsistent subregions identified for all GCMs. This improves the spatial\nclusters coherence and outperforms methods either based on margins or on\ndependence. Finally, by comparing the natural forcings partition with the one\nwith all forcings, we assess the impact of anthropogenic forcing on\nprecipitation extreme patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 09:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

Using non-equilibrium Keldysh Green's function\nformalism, initially, various model parameter dependence of thermoelectric\ntransport properties are analysed within the linear response regime. It is\nobserved that the single-particle tunnelling close to the superconducting gap\nedge can generate a relatively large thermopower and figure of merit. Moreover,\nthe Andreev tunnelling plays a significant role in the suppression of\nthermopower and figure of merit within the gap region. Further, within the\nnon-linear regime, we discuss two different situations, i.e., the finite\nvoltage biasing between isothermal reservoirs and the finite thermal gradient\nin the context of thermoelectric heat engine. In the former case, it is shown\nthat the sub-gap Andreev heat current can become finite beyond the linear\nresponse regime and play a vital role in asymmetric heat dissipation and\nthermal rectification effect for low voltage biasing. The rectification of heat\ncurrent is enhanced for strong on-dot Coulomb interaction and at low background\nthermal energy. In the latter case, we study the variation of thermovoltage,\nthermopower, maximum power output, and corresponding efficiency with the\napplied thermal gradient. These results illustrate that hybrid\nsuperconductor-quantum dot nanostructures are promising candidatess for\nlow-temperature thermal applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 10:42:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 05:54:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 10:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Most existing methods excessively relied\non the design of traversal rules or graph topologies to draw the dependencies\nof the dynamic joints, which is inadequate to reflect the relationships of the\ndistant yet important joints. Furthermore, due to the locally adopted\noperations, the important long-range temporal information is therefore not well\nexplored in existing works. To address this issue, in this work we propose\nLSTA-Net: a novel Long short-term Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network, which\ncan effectively capture the long/short-range dependencies in a spatio-temporal\nmanner. We devise our model into a pure factorised architecture which can\nalternately perform spatial feature aggregation and temporal feature\naggregation. To improve the feature aggregation effect, a channel-wise\nattention mechanism is also designed and employed.

The existence and uniqueness of the solution to the\ndiscretized nonlinear system are established by showing that it is a unique\nminimizer of a constructed convex energy. Thanks to the boundness of ionic\nconcentrations, truncation bounds for the potential are obtained by using the\nextremum principle. The truncation step in iterations is shown to be energy and\nerror decreasing. To further speed-up computations, we propose a novel\nprecomputing-interpolation strategy, which is applicable to other local steric\nPB theories and makes the proposed methods for solving steric PB theories as\nefficient as for solving the classical PB theory. Analysis on the Newton\niteration method with truncation shows local quadratic convergence for the\nproposed numerical methods. Applications to realistic biomolecular solvation\nsystems reveal that counterions with steric hindrance stratify in an order\nprescribed by the parameter of ionic valence-to-volume ratio. Finally, we\nremark that the proposed iterative methods for local steric PB theories can be\nreadily incorporated in well-known classical PB solvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 11:09:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 02:17:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 12:14:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

We reformulate and solve the DICE\nmodel as an optimal control dynamic programming problem with six state\nvariables (related to the carbon concentration, temperature, and economic\ncapital) evolving over time deterministically and affected by two controls\n(carbon emission mitigation rate and consumption). We then extend the model by\nadding a discrete stochastic shock variable to model the economy in the\nstressed and normal regimes as a jump process caused by events such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. These shocks reduce the world gross output leading to a\nreduction in both the world net output and carbon emission. The extended model\nis solved under several scenarios as an optimal stochastic control problem,\nassuming that the shock events occur randomly on average once every 100 years\nand last for 5 years. The results show that, if the world gross output recovers\nin full after each event, the impact of the COVID-19 events on the temperature\nand carbon concentration will be immaterial even in the case of a conservative\n10\\% drop in the annual gross output over a 5-year period. The impact becomes\nnoticeable, although still extremely small (long-term temperature drops by\n$0.1^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$), in a presence of persistent shocks of a 5\\% output\ndrop propagating to the subsequent time periods through the recursively reduced\nproductivity. If the deterministic DICE model policy is applied in a presence\nof stochastic shocks (i.e. when this policy is suboptimal), then the drop in\ntemperature is larger (approximately $0.25^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$), that is, the\nlower economic activities owing to shocks imply that more ambitious mitigation\ntargets are now feasible at lower costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 11:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

Here, platinum@cobalt (Pt@Co) core-shell\nnanoparticles were synthesized, and their structural changes after annealing at\n600{\\deg}C, 700{\\deg}C, and 800{\\deg}C for 3 hours were observed by a scanning\ntransmission electron microscope. We discovered an L10-PtCo structure near the\nsurface at 700{\\deg}C, which was unexpected given the initial Pt:Co ratio of\nabout 4:1. The L10-PtCo structure was considered to form due to surface\nsegregation of Pt atoms and diffusion insufficient to mix Pt and Co atoms in\nthe particle overall because the structure did not form at 600{\\deg}C and\n800{\\deg}C.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 12:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

In existing UDA image dataset, classes are usually organized in a\nflattened way, where a plain classifier can be trained. Yet in some scenarios,\nthe flat categories originate from some base classes. For example, buggies\nbelong to the class bird. We define the classification task where classes have\ncharacteristics above and the flat classes and the base classes are organized\nhierarchically as hierarchical image classification. Intuitively, leveraging\nsuch hierarchical structure will benefit hierarchical image classification,\ne.g., two easily confusing classes may belong to entirely different base\nclasses. In this paper, we improve the performance of classification by fusing\nfeatures learned from a hierarchy of labels. Specifically, we train feature\nextractors supervised by hierarchical labels and with UDA technology, which\nwill output multiple features for an input image. The features are subsequently\nconcatenated to predict the finest-grained class. This study is conducted with\na new dataset named Lego-15.

In this\nwork we use first-principles calculations to study an important class of\nferroelectric materials - LiNbO$_3$-type ferroelectrics (LiNbO$_3$ as the\nprototype), and find that in oxygen-deficient LiNbO$_{3-\\delta}$, hydrostatic\npressure induces an unexpected metal-insulator transition between 8 and 9 GPa.\nOur calculations also find that strong polar displacements persist in both\nmetallic and insulating oxygen-deficient LiNbO$_{3-\\delta}$ and the size of\npolar displacements is comparable to pristine LiNbO$_3$ under the same\npressure. These properties are distinct from widely used perovskite\nferroelectric oxide BaTiO$_3$, whose polarization is quickly suppressed by\nhydrostatic pressure and/or oxygen vacancies. The anomalous pressure-driven\nmetal-insulator transition in oxygen-deficient LiNbO$_{3-\\delta}$ arises from\nthe change of an oxygen vacancy defect state. Hydrostatic pressure increases\nthe polar displacements of oxygen-deficient LiNbO$_{3-\\delta}$, which reduces\nthe band width of the defect state and eventually turns it into an in-gap\nstate. In the insulating phase, the in-gap state is further pushed away from\nthe conduction band edge under hydrostatic pressure, which increases the\nfundamental gap. Our work shows that for LiNbO$_3$-type strong ferroelectrics,\noxygen vacancies and hydrostatic pressure combined can lead to new phenomena\nand potential functions, in contrast to the harmful effects occurring to\nperovskite ferroelectric oxides such as BaTiO$_3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 13:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Globular-cluster stars afford a unique view of the\nphysical processes that shape the surface abundances of stars on and beyond the\nSpite plateau, as one can study stars in different evolutionary phases with the\nsame composition at birth. The main result is the finding of observational\ntrends in surface abundances of heavy elements (Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ba) that\nrange from ~0.1 dex (M4 at [Fe/H]=-1.1) to ~0.3 dex (M30 at [Fe/H]=-2.3) with\nturn-off and subgiant stars generally showing lower abundances than giant\nstars.

However, the\nexisting IPAD algorithms do not generalize well to unseen and cross-domain\nscenarios because of capture in unconstrained environments and high visual\ncorrelation amongst bonafide and attack samples. These similarities in\nintricate textural and morphological patterns of iris ocular images contribute\nfurther to performance degradation. To alleviate these shortcomings, this paper\nproposes DFCANet: Dense Feature Calibration and Attention Guided Network which\ncalibrates the locally spread iris patterns with the globally located ones.\nUplifting advantages from feature calibration convolution and residual\nlearning, DFCANet generates domain-specific iris feature representations. Since\nsome channels in the calibrated feature maps contain more prominent\ninformation, we capitalize discriminative feature learning across the channels\nthrough the channel attention mechanism. In order to intensify the challenge\nfor our proposed model, we make DFCANet operate over nonsegmented and\nnon-normalized ocular iris images. Extensive experimentation conducted over\nchallenging cross-domain and intra-domain scenarios highlights consistent\noutperforming results. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, DFCANet achieves\nsignificant gains in performance for the benchmark IIITD CLI, IIIT CSD and\nNDCLD13 databases respectively. Further, a novel incremental learning-based\nmethodology has been introduced so as to overcome disentangled iris-data\ncharacteristics and data scarcity. This paper also pursues the challenging\nscenario that considers soft-lens under the attack category with evaluation\nperformed under various cross-domain protocols.

However, in many real-world cases, each individual has distinct\nepidemic characteristics such as contagion, recovery, fatality rate, efficacy,\nand probability of severe reaction to a vaccine. Moreover, the relative\neffectiveness of vaccination strategies depends on the number of available\nvaccine shots. Centrality-based strategies cannot take the variability of\nepidemic characteristics or the availability of vaccines into account. Here, we\npropose a framework for vaccination strategy based on graph neural network\nansatz (GNNA) and microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA). In this framework,\nwe can formulate an effective vaccination strategy that considers the\nproperties of each node, and tailor the vaccination strategy according to the\navailability of vaccines. Our approach is highly scalable to large networks. We\nvalidate the method in many real-world networks for network dismantling, the\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model with homogeneous and heterogeneous\ncontagion/recovery rates, and the susceptible-infected-recovered-dead (SIRD)\nmodel.

While in recent years a lot of attention has been drawn to\nthe consumer side including canonical problems like ctr/cvr prediction, the\nadvertiser side, which directly serves advertisers by providing them with\nmarketing tools, is now playing a more and more important role. When speaking\nof sponsored search, bid keyword recommendation is the fundamental service.\nThis paper addresses the problem of keyword matching, the primary step of\nkeyword recommendation. Existing methods for keyword matching merely consider\nmodeling relevance based on a single type of relation among ads and keywords,\nsuch as query clicks or text similarity, which neglects rich heterogeneous\ninteractions hidden behind them. To fill this gap, the keyword matching problem\nfaces several challenges including: 1) how to learn enriched and robust\nembeddings from complex interactions among various types of objects; 2) how to\nconduct high-quality matching for new ads that usually lack sufficient data.\n  To address these challenges, we develop a\nheterogeneous-graph-neural-network-based model for keyword matching named\nHetMatch, which has been deployed both online and offline at the core sponsored\nsearch platform of Alibaba Group. To extract enriched and robust embeddings\namong rich relations, we design a hierarchical structure to fuse and enhance\nthe relevant neighborhood patterns both on the micro and the macro level.\nMoreover, by proposing a multi-view framework, the model is able to involve\nmore positive samples for cold-start ads.

The cumulative rendering process in\nradiance fields makes training these generative models much easier since\ngradients are distributed over the entire volume, but leads to diffused object\nsurfaces. In the meantime, compared to radiance fields occupancy\nrepresentations could inherently ensure deterministic surfaces. However, if we\ndirectly apply occupancy representations to generative models, during training\nthey will only receive sparse gradients located on object surfaces and\neventually suffer from the convergence problem. In this paper, we propose\nGenerative Occupancy Fields (GOF), a novel model based on generative radiance\nfields that can learn compact object surfaces without impeding its training\nconvergence. The key insight of GOF is a dedicated transition from the\ncumulative rendering in radiance fields to rendering with only the surface\npoints as the learned surface gets more and more accurate. In this way, GOF\ncombines the merits of two representations in a unified framework.

We show that a linear\ntemperature profile imposed at the conductive sidewall leads to a premature\ncollapse of the single-roll state, whereas a sidewall maintained at a constant\ntemperature enhances its stability. The collapse is caused by accelerated\ngrowth of the corner rolls with two distinct growth rate regimes determined by\ndiffusion or convection for small or large $Ra$, respectively. Above the\ncollapse of the single-roll state, we find the emergence of a double-roll state\nin two-dimensional RBC and a double-toroidal state in three-dimensional\ncylindrical RBC.

The different states are reflected in the global heat transport, so\nthat the different thermal conditions at the sidewall lead to significant\ndifferences in the Nusselt number for small to moderate $Ra$. However, for\nlarger $Ra$, heat transport and flow dynamics become increasingly alike for\ndifferent sidewalls and are almost indistinguishable for $Ra>10^9$.

It has been\nshown that the utility functions of many real-world applications, including\npooled-based active learning and adaptive influence maximization, satisfy the\nproperty of adaptive submodularity. However, most of existing studies on\nadaptive submodular maximization focus on the fully adaptive setting, i.e., one\nmust wait for the feedback from \\emph{all} past selections before making the\nnext selection. Although this approach can take full advantage of feedback from\nthe past to make informed decisions, it may take a longer time to complete the\nselection process as compared with the non-adaptive solution where all\nselections are made in advance before any observations take place. In this\npaper, we explore the problem of partial-adaptive submodular maximization where\none is allowed to make multiple selections in a batch simultaneously and\nobserve their realizations together.

Both\nweakly relativistic theory (gamma factors close to unity) and strongly\nrelativistic theory are investigated, using assumptions that allow for a\nseparation of electron and positron states. Finally, we study the\nDirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism, which is a fully quantum relativistic\ntheory, allowing for field strengths of the order of the Schwinger critical\nfield or even larger. As a result, the quantum kinetic theory is extended to\ncover phenomena such as Zitterbewegung and electron-positron pair creation.\nWhile the focus of this review is on the quantum kinetic models, we illustrate\nthe theories with various applications throughout the manuscript.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 14:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

That implies a\ntantalizing possibility of scaling them up beyond a curated \"seed\" benchmark,\nto incorporating more unlabeled images from the internet-scale external sources\nto enhance its performance. However, in practice, larger amount of unlabeled\ndata will require more computing resources due to the bigger model size and\nlonger training needed. Moreover, open-world unlabeled data usually follows an\nimplicit long-tail class or attribute distribution, many of which also do not\nbelong to the target classes. Blindly leveraging all unlabeled data hence can\nlead to the data imbalance as well as distraction issues. This motivates us to\nseek a principled approach to strategically select unlabeled data from an\nexternal source, in order to learn generalizable, balanced and diverse\nrepresentations for relevant classes. In this work, we present an open-world\nunlabeled data sampling framework called Model-Aware K-center (MAK), which\nfollows three simple principles: (1) tailness, which encourages sampling of\nexamples from tail classes, by sorting the empirical contrastive loss\nexpectation (ECLE) of samples over random data augmentations; (2) proximity,\nwhich rejects the out-of-distribution outliers that may distract training; and\n(3) diversity, which ensures diversity in the set of sampled examples.\nEmpirically, using ImageNet-100-LT (without labels) as the seed dataset and two\n\"noisy\" external data sources, we demonstrate that MAK can consistently improve\nboth the overall representation quality and the class balancedness of the\nlearned features, as evaluated via linear classifier evaluation on full-shot\nand few-shot settings.

Existing\ncGANs are based on a wide range of different discriminator designs and training\nobjectives. One popular design in earlier works is to include a classifier\nduring training with the assumption that good classifiers can help eliminate\nsamples generated with wrong classes. Nevertheless, including classifiers in\ncGANs often comes with a side effect of only generating easy-to-classify\nsamples. Recently, some representative cGANs avoid the shortcoming and reach\nstate-of-the-art performance without having classifiers. Somehow it remains\nunanswered whether the classifiers can be resurrected to design better cGANs.\nIn this work, we demonstrate that classifiers can be properly leveraged to\nimprove cGANs. We start by using the decomposition of the joint probability\ndistribution to connect the goals of cGANs and classification as a unified\nframework. The framework, along with a classic energy model to parameterize\ndistributions, justifies the use of classifiers for cGANs in a principled\nmanner. It explains several popular cGAN variants, such as ACGAN, ProjGAN, and\nContraGAN, as special cases with different levels of approximations, which\nprovides a unified view and brings new insights to understanding cGANs.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the design inspired by the proposed\nframework outperforms state-of-the-art cGANs on multiple benchmark datasets,\nespecially on the most challenging ImageNet.

Using Bayesian models and their\nassociated uncertainty, one can potentially automate the process of detecting\ninaccurate predictions. We investigate two Bayesian models for auto-contouring,\nDropOut and FlipOut, using a quantitative measure - expected calibration error\n(ECE) and a qualitative measure - region-based accuracy-vs-uncertainty (R-AvU)\ngraphs. It is well understood that a model should have low ECE to be considered\ntrustworthy. However, in a QA context, a model should also have high\nuncertainty in inaccurate regions and low uncertainty in accurate regions. Such\nbehaviour could direct visual attention of expert users to potentially\ninaccurate regions, leading to a speed up in the QA process. Using R-AvU\ngraphs, we qualitatively compare the behaviour of different models in accurate\nand inaccurate regions. Experiments are conducted on the MICCAI2015 Head and\nNeck Segmentation Challenge and on the DeepMindTCIA CT dataset using three\nmodels: DropOut-DICE, Dropout-CE (Cross Entropy) and FlipOut-CE.

However, ambiguities\nin geometric definitions in the discrete context have led to a lack of\nconsensus on which discrete mesh model is theoretically and numerically\noptimal; a bijective relationship between the terms contributing to both the\nenergy and forces from the discrete and smooth geometric theories remains to be\nestablished. We address this and present an extensible framework,\n$\\texttt{Mem3DG}$, for modeling 3D mechanochemical dynamics of membranes based\non Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) on triangulated meshes. The formalism\nof DDG resolves the inconsistency and provides a unifying perspective on how to\nrelate the smooth and discrete energy and forces. To demonstrate,\n$\\texttt{Mem3DG}$ is used to model a sequence of examples with increasing\nmechanochemical complexity: recovering classical shape transformations such as\n1) biconcave disk, dumbbell, and unduloid and 2) spherical bud on spherical,\nflat-patch membrane; investigating how the coupling of membrane mechanics with\nprotein mobility jointly affects phase and shape transformation. As\nhigh-resolution 3D imaging of membrane ultrastructure becomes more readily\navailable, we envision Mem3DG to be applied as an end-to-end tool to simulate\nrealistic cell geometry under user-specified mechanochemical conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 02:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

Thanks to an automated crawler,\naerial images from before and after a natural disaster of 50 epicenters\nworldwide were obtained from Google Earth, generating a 10,000 aerial image\ndatabase with a spatial resolution of 2 m per pixel. The study utilizes the\nalgorithm Seg-Net to perform semantic segmentation of the built environment\nfrom the satellite images in both instances (prior and post-natural disasters).\nFor image segmentation, Seg-Net is one of the most popular and general CNN\narchitectures. The Seg-Net algorithm used reached an accuracy of 92% in the\nsegmentation. After the segmentation, we compared the disparity between both\ncases represented as a percentage of change. Such coefficient of change\nrepresents the damage numerically an urban environment had to quantify the\noverall damage in the built environment. Such an index can give the government\nan estimate of the number of affected households and perhaps the extent of\nhousing damage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 20:46:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 20:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

Finite element method (FEM) is a standard approach of performing\nstress analysis of complex material systems. A way to accelerate stress\nanalysis is to replace FEM with a data-driven machine learning based stress\nanalysis approach. In this study, we consider a fiber-reinforced matrix\ncomposite material system and we use deep learning tools to find an alternative\nto the FEM approach for stress field prediction. We first try to predict stress\nfield maps for composite material systems of fixed number of fibers with\nvarying spatial configurations. Specifically, we try to find a mapping between\nthe spatial arrangement of the fibers in the composite material and the\ncorresponding von Mises stress field. This is achieved by using a convolutional\nneural network (CNN), specifically a U-Net architecture, using true stress maps\nof systems with same number of fibers as training data. U-Net is a\nencoder-decoder network which in this study takes in the composite material\nimage as an input and outputs the stress field image which is of the same size\nas the input image. We perform a robustness analysis by taking different\ninitializations of the training samples to find the sensitivity of the\nprediction accuracy to the small number of training samples. When the number of\nfibers in the composite material system is increased for the same volume\nfraction, a finer finite element mesh discretization is required to represent\nthe geometry accurately. This leads to an increase in the computational cost.\nThus, the secondary goal here is to predict the stress field for systems with\nlarger number of fibers with varying spatial configurations using information\nfrom the true stress maps of relatively cheaper systems of smaller fiber\nnumber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 01:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

This will be achieved in any\norientation of the robot. Previous pipe climbers use three-wheel/track modules,\neach with an individual driving mechanism to achieve stable traversing.\nSlipping of tracks is prevalent in such robots when it encounters the pipe\nturns. Thus, active control of each module's speed is employed to mitigate the\nslip, thereby requiring substantial control effort. The proposed pipe climber\nimplements the 3-OOD to address this issue by allowing the robot to\nmechanically modulate the track speeds as it encounters a turn. The proposed\n3-OOD is the first three-output differential to realize the functional\nabilities of a traditional two-output differential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 05:53:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 13:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}
