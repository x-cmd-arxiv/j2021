In this paper we use the excess two-body entropy $S_2$ and\ntetrahedrality $\\n_{tet}$ as the per-particle local structural order parameters\nto explore such correlations in a three-dimensional model glass subjected to\ncyclic shear deformation. We first show that for both liquid configurations and\nthe corresponding inherent structures, local ordering increases upon lowering\ntemperature, signaled by a decrease in the two-body entropy and an increase in\ntetrahedrality. When the inherent structures, or glasses, are periodically\nsheared athermally, they eventually reach absorbing states for small shear\namplitudes, which do not change from one cycle to the next. Large strain\namplitudes result in the formation of shear bands, within which particle motion\nis diffusive. We show that in the steady state, there is a clear difference in\nthe local structural environment of particles that will be part of plastic\nrearrangements during the next shear cycle and that of particles that are\nimmobile. In particular, particles with higher $S_2$ and lower $n_{tet}$ are\nmore likely to go through rearrangements irrespective of the average energies\nof the configurations and strain amplitude. For high shear, we find very\ndistinctive local order outside the mobile shear band region, where almost\n$30\\%$ of the particles are involved in icosahedral clusters, contrasting\nstrongly with the fraction of $<5\\%$ found inside the shear band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 16:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

The observed stars exhibit an\n$\\alpha$-enrichment ([Mg/Fe]$\\lesssim+0.20$, and [Si/Fe]$\\lesssim +0.30$) that\nfollows the typical trend of metal-poor GCs. The aluminum abundance ratios for\nthe present two member stars are enhanced in [Al/Fe]$\\gtrsim +0.58$, which is a\ntypical enrichment characteristic of the so-called `second-generation' of stars\nin GCs at similar metallicity. This supports the possible presence of the\nmultiple-population phenomenon in Patchick~125, as well as its genuine GC\nnature. Further, Patchick~125 shows a low-energy, low-eccentric ($<0.4$) and\nretrograde orbit captured by the inner Galaxy, near the edge of the bulge. We\nconfirm that Patchick~125 is a genuine metal-poor GC, which is currently\ntrapped in the vicinity of the Milky Way bulge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 19:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

It is often assumed that a test for spatial orientability\nrequires a global journey across the whole $3-$space. Since such a global\nexpedition is not feasible, theoretical arguments are usually offered to\nsupport the choice of time orientation for the spacetime manifold $M_4$, and\nspace orientation for $M_3$. Theoretical arguments can certainly be used, but\none would expect that the ultimate answer to the orientability question should\nrely on observations or local experiments, or can come from a topological\nfundamental theory in physics. In a recent paper we have argued that it is\npotentially possible to locally access the $3-$space orientability of Minkowski\nspacetime through effects involving 'point-like charged particles' under\nquantum electromagnetic fluctuations. Specifically, we studied the stochastic\nmotions of a charged particle and an electric dipole subjected to these\nfluctuations in Minkowski spacetime, with either an orientable or a\nnon-orientable $3-$space topology, and derived expressions for a statistical\norientability indicator in these two flat topologically inequivalent manifolds.\nFor the dipole we found that a characteristic inversion pattern exhibited by\nthe curves of the orientability indicator is a signature of non-orientability,\nmaking it possible to locally probe the orientability of the $3-$space. Here,\nto shed some additional light on the spatial orientability, we briefly review\nthese results, and also discuss some of its features and consequences.

The main difficulty has been\novercoming product inhibition, or the tendency of products to adhere strongly\nto their templates - an effect that gets exponentially stronger with template\nlength. We develop coarse-grained models of copolymerisation on a finite-length\ntemplate and analyse them through stochastic simulation. We use these models\nfirst to demonstrate that product inhibition prevents reliable template\ncopying, and then ask how this problem can be overcome to achieve cyclic\nproduction of polymer copies of the right length and sequence in an autonomous\nand chemically-driven context. We find that a simple addition to the model is\nsufficient to generate far longer polymer products that initially form on, and\nthen separate from, the template. In this approach, some of the free energy of\npolymerisation is diverted into disrupting copy-template bonds behind the\nleading edge of the growing copy copolymer.

It is widely believed that simulations running on quantum computers\nwill allow for higher accuracy, but there has not yet been a convincing\ndemonstration that quantum methods are competitive with existing classical\nmethods at scale. Here we apply the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC)\nmethod on classical hardware to the calculation of the $T_1 \\to S_0$ transition\nenergies in nine phosphorescent iridium complexes, to determine if quantum\nsimulations have any advantage over traditional computing methods.\nPhosphorescent iridium complexes are integral to the widespread\ncommercialization of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology, yet\naccurate computational prediction of their emission energies remains a\nchallenge. Our simulations would require a gate-based quantum computer with a\nminimum of 72 fully-connected and error-corrected logical qubits.

The iQCC quantum method is found to match the accuracy of the fine-tuned\nDFT functionals, has a better Pearson correlation coefficient, and still has\nconsiderable potential for systematic improvement.

As computing\nenergy-constrained squashed entanglement of the channel is challenging due to a\ndouble optimization (over the set of density matrices and the isometric\nextensions of a squashing channel), we first derive an upper bound for it, and\nthen we discuss how tight that bound is for energy-constrained LOCC-assisted\nquantum capacity of bosonic dephasing channel.

Furthermore, we prove that for a generic\nchannel, the optimal squashing channel belongs to the set of symmetric quantum\nMarkov chain inducer (SQMCI) channels of the channel system-environment output,\nprovided that such a set is non-empty. With supporting arguments, we conjecture\nthat this is instead the case for the bosonic dephasing channel.

By considering an\nansatz of $f(Q,T)=f_1(Q)+f_2(T)$, which has been broadly studied in the\nliterature and the coincident gauge where the connection vanishes, we got\nequations consistent with $f(Q)$ gravity when $f_{T}=0$. In the case of the\ntensor perturbations, the propagation of gravitational waves was found to be\nidentical to $f(Q)$, as expected. For scalar perturbations, outside the limit\n$f_T = 0$, we got that the coupling between $Q$ and $T$ in the Lagrangian\nproduces a coupling between the perturbation of the density and the pressure.\nThe presence of $T$ in the Lagrangian breaks the equation of the conservation\nof energy, which in turn breaks the standard $\\rho' + 3\\mathcal{H} (\\rho+p) =\n0$ relation.

We then\ncompare the quasihole's anisotropy with the intrinsic geometric metric of the\nsystem that is extracted from the maximal overlap between the numerically\nobtained quasihole ground state and a set of model wave functions of\nanisotropic quasiholes. For a static system, we find that the quasihole's\nanisotropy, similar to the intrinsic metric, grows with the anisotropy of the\nband mass tensor. When the quasihole develops well, we observe a correspondence\nbetween the anisotropy of the quasihole and the intrinsic metric of the\nunderlying anisotropic FQH state.

The JSC nodes are able to perform sensing their surrounding\nenvironments, e.g., weather conditions or available spectrum. Furthermore, they\ncan cooperatively detect and track a common target. The information, i.e., of\nthe environment and target, collected by the JSC nodes is transmitted to a base\nstation (BS) for further processing. As such, different aspects of the target\nto be viewed simultaneously, which significantly improves the performance of\nthe target detection and tracking. However, both the sensing function and\ncommunication function require a certain amount of bandwidth for their\noperations, and deploying multiple JSC nodes may consume a large amount of\nbandwidth.

Regarding this difficulty, the combination of self-consistent\nsimulation, theory analysis and experimental diagnostic of this system is\nneeded. In the scope of present article, the fluid simulation and analytic\ntheory are utilized to investigate the Ar/Cl2 inductive plasma, via a cyclic\ntuning of discharge pressure and feedstock gas content parameters when fixing\nthe power. Classic discharge structure (e.g., delta, parabola, flat-top, and\nhollow) and specific discharge mechanisms (e.g., self-coagulation, physics\ncoagulation, de-coagulation, grouping behavior and the ambi-polar diffusion of\ntriple species) are revealed. Besides, the two types of discharge\nstratification, i.e., space and species, are presented. Many non-neutralities\nare generated during the transport process of electronegative plasma when it\ngives rise to the discharge structure, which are summed and analyzed for better\nunderstanding the plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 01:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

One method of adjusting for the residual biases in\nthe estimation of a treatment effect is through negative control outcomes,\nwhere the treatment does not affect the outcome. The empirical calibration\nprocedure is a technique that uses negative controls to calibrate p-values. An\nextension of empirical calibration calibrates the coverage of the 95%\nconfidence interval of a treatment effect estimate by using negative control\noutcomes as well as positive control outcomes (where treatment affects the\noutcome).\n  Methods: The effect of empirical calibration of confidence intervals was\nanalyzed using simulated datasets with known treatment effects.

Unlike the existing\napproximated weighting function of directly generating weight values from\nlosses, our meta-network is learned to estimate a rectifying vector from the\ninput of the logits and labels, which has the capability of leveraging\nsufficient information lying in them. This provides an effective way to rectify\nthe learning procedure for the classification network, demonstrating a\nsignificant improvement of the generalization ability. Besides, modeling the\nrectifying vector as a latent variable and learning the meta-network can be\nseamlessly integrated into the SGD optimization of the classification network.\nWe evaluate WarPI on four benchmarks of robust learning with noisy labels and\nachieve the new state-of-the-art under variant noise types.

The physics objective of LUXE are processes of\nquantum electrodynamics (QED) at the strong-field frontier, where the\nelectromagnetic field of the laser is above the Schwinger limit. In this\nregime, QED is non-perturbative. This manifests itself in the creation of\nphysical electron-positron pairs from the QED vacuum, similar to Hawking\nradiation from black holes. LUXE intends to measure the positron production\nrate in an unprecedented laser intensity regime.

Specifically, the data-selection procedure\nbiases the inferred mean count rate to be too low, biases the inferred\npulsation amplitude to be too high, and that the size of these biases scales\nstrongly with the amount of data that is rejected and the true signal\namplitude. The procedure also alters the null-distribution of the H-test\nrendering nominal detection significance estimates overly optimistic.

Spherical harmonics, a set of basis\nfunctions defined on the unit sphere, are widely used for anatomical shape\ndescription. However, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the\nobject surface and the entire unit sphere may induce a large geometric\ndistortion in case the shape of the surface is too different from a perfect\nsphere. In this work, we propose adaptive area-preserving parameterization\nmethods for simply-connected open and closed surfaces with the target of the\nparameterization being a spherical cap. Our methods optimize the shape of the\nparameter domain along with the mapping from the object surface to the\nparameter domain. The object surface will be globally mapped to an optimal\nspherical cap region of the unit sphere in an area-preserving manner while also\nexhibiting low conformal distortion. We further develop a set of spherical\nharmonics-like basis functions defined over the adaptive spherical cap domain,\nwhich we call the adaptive harmonics. Experimental results show that the\nproposed parameterization methods outperform the existing methods for both open\nand closed anatomical surfaces in terms of area and angle distortion. Surface\ndescription of the object surfaces can be effectively achieved using a novel\ncombination of the adaptive parameterization and the adaptive harmonics. Our\nwork provides a novel way of mapping anatomical surfaces with improved accuracy\nand greater flexibility.

It marries the merits of implicit and explicit 3D representations by\nleveraging a novel hybrid 3D representation. Compared to the current implicit\napproaches, which are trained to regress the signed distance values, DMTet\ndirectly optimizes for the reconstructed surface, which enables us to\nsynthesize finer geometric details with fewer artifacts. Unlike deep 3D\ngenerative models that directly generate explicit representations such as\nmeshes, our model can synthesize shapes with arbitrary topology. The core of\nDMTet includes a deformable tetrahedral grid that encodes a discretized signed\ndistance function and a differentiable marching tetrahedra layer that converts\nthe implicit signed distance representation to the explicit surface mesh\nrepresentation. This combination allows joint optimization of the surface\ngeometry and topology as well as generation of the hierarchy of subdivisions\nusing reconstruction and adversarial losses defined explicitly on the surface\nmesh. Our approach significantly outperforms existing work on conditional shape\nsynthesis from coarse voxel inputs, trained on a dataset of complex 3D animal\nshapes.

Existing\nsettings for lack of reward, such as behavioral cloning, rely on optimal\ndemonstrations collected from humans. Unfortunately, extensive expertise is\nrequired for ensuring optimality, which hinder the acquisition of large-scale\ndata for complex tasks. This paper addresses the lack of reward in a batch\nreinforcement learning setting by learning a reward function from preferences.\nGenerating preferences only requires a basic understanding of a task. Being a\nmental process, generating preferences is faster than performing\ndemonstrations. So preferences can be collected at scale from non-expert humans\nusing crowdsourcing. This paper tackles a critical challenge that emerged when\ncollecting data from non-expert humans: the noise in preferences. A novel\nprobabilistic model is proposed for modelling the reliability of labels, which\nutilizes labels collaboratively.

It\nwas introduced in the 1930s but has not been theoretically proven until recent\nyears. All of its analysis in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB)\nsetting requires an exact oracle to provide optimal solutions with any input.\nHowever, such an oracle is usually not feasible since many combinatorial\noptimization problems are NP-hard and only approximation oracles are available.\nAn example (Wang and Chen, 2018) has shown the failure of TS to learn with an\napproximation oracle. However, this oracle is uncommon and is designed only for\na specific problem instance. It is still an open question whether the\nconvergence analysis of TS can be extended beyond the exact oracle in CMAB. In\nthis paper, we study this question under the greedy oracle, which is a common\n(approximation) oracle with theoretical guarantees to solve many (offline)\ncombinatorial optimization problems. We provide a problem-dependent regret\nlower bound of order $\\Omega(\\log T/\\Delta^2)$ to quantify the hardness of TS\nto solve CMAB problems with greedy oracle, where $T$ is the time horizon and\n$\\Delta$ is some reward gap. We also provide an almost matching regret upper\nbound.

Furthermore, to solve the string\nconstraints, we show that PSSTs enjoy nice closure and algorithmic properties,\nin particular, the regularity-preserving property (i.e., pre-images of regular\nconstraints under PSSTs are regular), and introduce a sound sequent calculus\nthat exploits these properties and performs propagation of regular constraints\nby means of taking post-images or pre-images.

Moreover, deep\nneural networks (DNNs) have been recently advanced in this field; however,\nstudies on the efficient multichannel network structure fully exploiting\nspatial information and inter-channel relationships is still in its early\nstages. In this study, we propose an end-to-end time-domain speech enhancement\nnetwork that can facilitate the use of inter-channel relationships at\nindividual layers of a DNN. The proposed technique is based on a fully\nconvolutional time-domain audio separation network (Conv-TasNet), originally\ndeveloped for speech separation tasks. We extend Conv-TasNet into several forms\nthat can handle multichannel input signals and learn inter-channel\nrelationships. To this end, we modify the encoder-mask-decoder structures of\nthe network to be compatible with 3-D tensors defined over spatial channels,\nfeatures, and time dimensions. In particular, we conduct extensive parameter\nanalyses on the convolution structure and propose independent assignment of the\ndepthwise and 1$\\times$1 convolution layers to the feature and spatial\ndimensions, respectively. We demonstrate that the enriched inter-channel\ninformation from the proposed network plays a significant role in suppressing\nnoisy signals impinging from various directions. The proposed inter-channel\nConv-TasNet outperforms the state-of-the-art multichannel variants of neural\nnetworks, even with one-tenth of their parameter size. The performance of the\nproposed model is evaluated using the CHiME-3 dataset, which exhibits a\nremarkable improvement in SDR, PESQ, and STOI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 07:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

Existing approaches mainly adopt a supervised manner and heavily\nrely on coupled image-report pairs. However, in the medical domain, building a\nlarge-scale image-report paired dataset is both time-consuming and expensive.\nTo relax the dependency on paired data, we propose an unsupervised model\nKnowledge Graph Auto-Encoder (KGAE) which accepts independent sets of images\nand reports in training. KGAE consists of a pre-constructed knowledge graph, a\nknowledge-driven encoder and a knowledge-driven decoder. The knowledge graph\nworks as the shared latent space to bridge the visual and textual domains; The\nknowledge-driven encoder projects medical images and reports to the\ncorresponding coordinates in this latent space and the knowledge-driven decoder\ngenerates a medical report given a coordinate in this space. Since the\nknowledge-driven encoder and decoder can be trained with independent sets of\nimages and reports, KGAE is unsupervised. The experiments show that the\nunsupervised KGAE generates desirable medical reports without using any\nimage-report training pairs. Moreover, KGAE can also work in both\nsemi-supervised and supervised settings, and accept paired images and reports\nin training. By further fine-tuning with image-report pairs, KGAE consistently\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art models on two datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 08:10:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 09:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

In this work, we investigate\nthe dynamics of the shock front and downstream flow with a special emphasis on\nthe reconnecting equatorial current sheet. We examine whether giant plasmoids\nproduced in the reconnection process could be good candidates for the knots. To\nthis end, we perform large semi-global three-dimensional particle-in-cell\nsimulations in a spherical geometry. The hierarchical merging plasmoid model is\nused to extrapolate numerical results to pulsar wind nebula scales.

The sheet breaks up into a dynamical chain of\nmerging plasmoids reminiscent of three-dimensional reconnection. Plasmoids grow\nto a macroscopic size. The final number of plasmoids predicted is solely\ngoverned by the inverse of the dimensionless reconnection rate. The formation\nof giant plasmoids is a robust feature of pulsar wind termination shocks.

It is shown that the ear is a temporal\nimaging system that comprises three transformations of the envelope functions:\ncochlear group-delay dispersion, cochlear time lensing, and neural group-delay\ndispersion. These elements are analogous to the optical transformations in\nvision of diffraction between the object and the eye, spatial lensing by the\nlens, and second diffraction between the lens and the retina. Unlike the eye,\nit is established that the human auditory system is naturally defocused, so\nthat coherent stimuli do not react to the defocus, whereas completely\nincoherent stimuli are impacted by it and may be blurred by design. It is\nargued that the auditory system can use this differential focusing to enhance\nor degrade the images of real-world acoustical objects that are partially\ncoherent. The theory is founded on coherence and temporal imaging theories that\nwere adopted from optics. In addition to the imaging transformations, the\ncorresponding inverse-domain modulation transfer functions are derived and\ninterpreted with consideration to the nonuniform neural sampling operation of\nthe auditory nerve. These ideas are used to rigorously initiate the concepts of\nsharpness and blur in auditory imaging, auditory aberrations, and auditory\ndepth of field. In parallel, ideas from communication theory are used to show\nthat the organ of Corti functions as a multichannel phase-locked loop (PLL)\nthat constitutes the point of entry for auditory phase locking and hence\nconserves the signal coherence. It provides an anchor for a dual coherent and\nnoncoherent auditory detection in the auditory brain that culminates in\nauditory accommodation.

Interdisciplinary research can provide an\neffective solution to complex issues in the related field of coronavirus.\nHowever, whether coronavirus related research becomes more interdisciplinary\nstill needs corroboration. In this study, we investigate interdisciplinary\nstatus of the coronavirus-related fields via the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset\n(CORD-19). To this end, we calculate bibliometric indicators of\ninterdisciplinarity and a co-occurrence analysis method. The results show that\nco-occurrence relationships between cited disciplines have evolved dynamically\nover time. The two types of co-occurrence relationships, Immunology and\nMicrobiology & Medicine and Chemical Engineering & Chemistry, last for a long\ntime in this field during 1990-2020. Moreover, the number of disciplines cited\nby coronavirus-related research increases, whereas the distribution of\ndisciplines is uneven, and this field tends to focus on several dominant\ndisciplines such as Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology, Biochemistry,\nGenetics and Molecular Biology. We also gauge the disciplinary diversity of\nCOVID-19 related papers published from January to December 2020; the\ndisciplinary variety shows an upward trend, while the degree of disciplinary\nbalance shows a downward trend. Meanwhile, the comprehensive index 2Ds\ndemonstrates that the degree of interdisciplinarity in coronavirus field\ndecreases between 1990 and 2019, but it increases in 2020. The results help to\nmap the interdisciplinarity of coronavirus-related research, gaining insight\ninto the degree and history of interdisciplinary cooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 09:05:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

However, another IL setting -- IL\nfrom visual inputs (ILfVI), which has a greater promise to be applied in\nreality by utilizing online visual resources, suffers from low data-efficiency\nand poor performance resulted from an on-policy learning manner and\nhigh-dimensional visual inputs. We propose OPIfVI (Off-Policy Imitation from\nVisual Inputs), which is composed of an off-policy learning manner, data\naugmentation, and encoder techniques, to tackle the mentioned challenges,\nrespectively. More specifically, to improve data-efficiency, OPIfVI conducts IL\nin an off-policy manner, with which sampled data can be used multiple times. In\naddition, we enhance the stability of OPIfVI with spectral normalization to\nmitigate the side-effect of off-policy training. The core factor, contributing\nto the poor performance of ILfVI, that we think is the agent could not extract\nmeaningful features from visual inputs. Hence, OPIfVI employs data augmentation\nfrom computer vision to help train encoders that can better extract features\nfrom visual inputs. In addition, a specific structure of gradient\nbackpropagation for the encoder is designed to stabilize the encoder training.\nAt last, we demonstrate that OPIfVI is able to achieve expert-level performance\nand outperform existing baselines no matter visual demonstrations or visual\nobservations are provided via extensive experiments using DeepMind Control\nSuite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 09:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

At each sampling instant, an\nSTC mechanism determines not only the control inputs but also the next sampling\ninstant. In this article, an STC framework for perturbed nonlinear systems is\nproposed. In the framework, a dynamic variable is used in addition to current\nstate information to determine the next sampling instant, rendering the STC\nmechanism dynamic. Using dynamic variables has proven to be powerful for\nincreasing sampling intervals for the closely related concept of\nevent-triggered control, but has so far not been exploited for STC. Two\nvariants of the dynamic STC framework are presented. The first variant can be\nused without further knowledge on the disturbance and leads to guarantees on\ninput-to-state stability. The second variant exploits a known disturbance bound\nto determine sampling instants and guarantees asymptotic stability of a set\ncontaining the origin. In both cases, hybrid Lyapunov function techniques are\nused to derive the respective stability guarantees. Different choices for the\ndynamics of the dynamic variable, that lead to different particular STC\nmechanisms, are presented for both variants of the framework. The resulting\ndynamic STC mechanisms are illustrated with two numerical examples to emphasize\ntheir benefits in comparison to existing static STC approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 09:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

We investigate the Cauchy\nproblem for initial data which are small perturbations in the non-congested\nzone of travelling wave profiles. We prove two different results.

Recent\nstudies have shown that adversaries can fool the models even if they can only\naccess the models' hard-label output. However, since many queries are needed to\nfind imperceptible adversarial noise, reducing the number of queries is crucial\nfor these attacks. In this paper, we point out two limitations of existing\ndecision-based black-box attacks. We observe that they waste queries for\nbackground noise optimization, and they do not take advantage of adversarial\nperturbations generated for other images. We exploit 3D face alignment to\novercome these limitations and propose a general strategy for query-efficient\nblack-box attacks on face recognition named Geometrically Adaptive Dictionary\nAttack (GADA). Our core idea is to create an adversarial perturbation in the UV\ntexture map and project it onto the face in the image. It greatly improves\nquery efficiency by limiting the perturbation search space to the facial area\nand effectively recycling previous perturbations. We apply the GADA strategy to\ntwo existing attack methods and show overwhelming performance improvement in\nthe experiments on the LFW and CPLFW datasets. Furthermore, we also present a\nnovel attack strategy that can circumvent query similarity-based stateful\ndetection that identifies the process of query-based black-box attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 10:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

While the use of\nADMS can improve the accuracy and efficiency of decision-making processes, it\nis also coupled with ethical challenges. Unfortunately, the governance\nmechanisms currently used to oversee human decision-making often fail when\napplied to ADMS. In previous work, we proposed that ethics-based auditing\n(EBA), i.e. a structured process by which ADMS are assessed for consistency\nwith relevant principles or norms, can (a) help organisations verify claims\nabout their ADMS and (b) provide decision-subjects with justifications for the\noutputs produced by ADMS. In this article, we outline the conditions under\nwhich EBA procedures can be feasible and effective in practice. First, we argue\nthat EBA is best understood as a 'soft' yet 'formal' governance mechanism. This\nimplies that the main responsibility of auditors should be to spark ethical\ndeliberation at key intervention points throughout the software development\nprocess and ensure that there is sufficient documentation to respond to\npotential inquiries.

Remarkably, RFs\nseem to be impervious to overfitting even though their basic building blocks\nare well-known to overfit. Recently, a broadly received study argued that a RF\nexhibits a so-called double-descent curve: First, the model overfits the data\nin a u-shaped curve and then, once a certain model complexity is reached, it\nsuddenly improves its performance again. In this paper, we challenge the notion\nthat model capacity is the correct tool to explain the success of RF and argue\nthat the algorithm which trains the model plays a more important role than\npreviously thought. We show that a RF does not exhibit a double-descent curve\nbut rather has a single descent. Hence, it does not overfit in the classic\nsense. We further present a RF variation that also does not overfit although\nits decision boundary approximates that of an overfitted DT. Similar, we show\nthat a DT which approximates the decision boundary of a RF will still overfit.\nLast, we study the diversity of an ensemble as a tool the estimate its\nperformance. To do so, we introduce Negative Correlation Forest (NCForest)\nwhich allows for precise control over the diversity in the ensemble. We show,\nthat the diversity and the bias indeed have a crucial impact on the performance\nof the RF. Having too low diversity collapses the performance of the RF into a\na single tree, whereas having too much diversity means that most trees do not\nproduce correct outputs anymore. However, in-between these two extremes we find\na large range of different trade-offs with all roughly equal performance.\nHence, the specific trade-off between bias and diversity does not matter as\nlong as the algorithm reaches this good trade-off regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 12:25:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

We introduced a magneto-morphological classification\n(MMC) of ARs, which allowed us to estimate possible contribution of the\nturbulent component of the dynamo into the structure of an AR. We found that in\n72\\% of cases, flaring ARs do not comply with the empirical laws of the global\ndynamo (frequently they are not bipolar ARs, or, if they are, they violate\neither Hale polarity law, or the Joy's law, or the leading sunspot prevalence\nrule), which may be attributed to the influence of the turbulent dynamo action\ninside the convective zone on spatial scales of typical ARs. Thus it appears\nthat the flaring is governed by the turbulent component of solar dynamo. A\ncontribution into the flaring from these ARs-``violators'' is enhanced during\nthe second maximum and the descending phase of a solar cycle, when the toroidal\nfield weakens and the influence of the turbulent component becomes more\npronounced.

In this work, we propose a\nSiamese voxel-to-BEV tracker, which can significantly improve the tracking\nperformance in sparse 3D point clouds. Specifically, it consists of a Siamese\nshape-aware feature learning network and a voxel-to-BEV target localization\nnetwork. The Siamese shape-aware feature learning network can capture 3D shape\ninformation of the object to learn the discriminative features of the object so\nthat the potential target from the background in sparse point clouds can be\nidentified. To this end, we first perform template feature embedding to embed\nthe template's feature into the potential target and then generate a dense 3D\nshape to characterize the shape information of the potential target. For\nlocalizing the tracked target, the voxel-to-BEV target localization network\nregresses the target's 2D center and the $z$-axis center from the dense bird's\neye view (BEV) feature map in an anchor-free manner. Concretely, we compress\nthe voxelized point cloud along $z$-axis through max pooling to obtain a dense\nBEV feature map, where the regression of the 2D center and the $z$-axis center\ncan be performed more effectively.

The framework\nexploits the concept of acyclic matching, a combinatorial tool at the core of\ndiscrete Morse theory. We introduce the new concept of complete acyclic\nmatchings and we show that they give the same end result of Gaussian\nelimination. Basically, instead of doing costly row and column operations on a\nsparse matrix, we compute equivalent cheap combinatorial operations that\npreserve the underlying sparsity structure. Currently, the most efficient\nalgorithms proposed in literature to find discrete vector potentials make use\nof tree-cotree techniques. We show that they compute a special type of complete\nacyclic matchings. Moreover, we show that the problem of computing them is\nequivalent to the problem of deciding whether a given mesh has a topological\nproperty called collapsibility. This fact gives a topological characterization\nof well-known termination problems of tree-cotree techniques. We propose a new\nrecursive algorithm to compute discrete vector potentials. It works directly on\nbasis elements of $1$- and $2$-chains by performing elementary Gaussian\noperations on them associated with acyclic matchings.

So far, seven progenitors of such\nsupernovae have been identified in pre-explosion imaging (five for Type IIb\nevents and two for Type Ib events).

In this paper, a novel sign-exponent-only\nfloating-point network (SEOFP-NET) technique is proposed to compress the model\nsize and accelerate the inference time for speech enhancement, a regression\ntask of speech signal processing. The proposed method compressed the sizes of\ndeep neural network (DNN)-based speech enhancement models by quantizing the\nfraction bits of single-precision floating-point parameters during training.\nBefore inference implementation, all parameters in the trained SEOFP-NET model\nare slightly adjusted to accelerate the inference time by replacing the\nfloating-point multiplier with an integer-adder. For generalization, the\nSEOFP-NET technique is introduced to different speech enhancement tasks in\nspeech signal processing with different model architectures under various\ncorpora. The experimental results indicate that the size of SEOFP-NET models\ncan be significantly compressed by up to 81.249% without noticeably downgrading\ntheir speech enhancement performance, and the inference time can be accelerated\nto 1.212x compared with the baseline models. The results also verify that the\nproposed SEOFP-NET can cooperate with other efficiency strategies to achieve a\nsynergy effect for model compression. In addition, the just noticeable\ndifference (JND) was applied to the user study experiment to statistically\nanalyze the effect of speech enhancement on listening.

Although 3400 of the 4500 exoplanets were\ndiscovered with the transit method and although there are well over 25 times as\nmany moons than planets known in the Solar System (two of which are larger than\nMercury), no exomoon has been discovered. In the search for exoplanet transits,\nstellar light curves are usually phase-folded over a range of trial epochs and\nperiods. This approach, however, is not applicable in a straightforward manner\nto exomoons. Planet-moon transits either have to be modeled in great detail\n(including their orbital dynamics, mutual eclipses etc.), which is\ncomputationally expensive, or key simplifications have to be assumed. One such\nsimplification is to search for moon transits outside of the planetary\ntransits. The question we address in this report is how much in-transit data of\nan exomoon remains uncontaminated by the near-simultaneous transits of its host\nplanet. We develop an analytical framework and test our results with a\nnumerical planet-moon transit simulator. For exomoons similar to the Galilean\nmoons, only a small fraction of their in-transit data is uncontaminated by\nplanetary transits: 14% for Io, 20% for Europa, 42% for Ganymede, and 73% for\nCallisto. The S/N of an out-of-planetary-transit folding technique is reduced\ncompared to a full transit model to about 38% (Io), 45% (Europa), 65%\n(Ganymede), and 85% (Callisto), respectively. For the Earth's Moon, we find an\nuncontaminated data fraction of typically just 18% and a resulting S/N\nreduction to 42%. These values are astonishingly small. The gain in speed for\nany exomoon transit search algorithm that ignores the planetary in-transit data\ncomes at the heavy price of losing a substantial fraction of what is supposedly\na tiny signal in the first place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 13:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

In this paper, we develop a model-guided triple-level\noptimization framework to deduce network architecture with cooperating\noptimization and auto-searching mechanism, named Triple-level Model Inferred\nCooperating Searching (TMICS), for dealing with various video rain\ncircumstances. In particular, to mitigate the problem that existing methods\ncannot cover various rain streaks distribution, we first design a\nhyper-parameter optimization model about task variable and hyper-parameter.\nBased on the proposed optimization model, we design a collaborative structure\nfor video deraining.

To better explore\ninter-frame information from videos, we introduce a macroscopic structure\nsearching scheme that searches from Optical Flow Module (OFM) and Temporal\nGrouping Module (TGM) to help restore latent frame. In addition, we apply the\ndifferentiable neural architecture searching from a compact candidate set of\ntask-specific operations to discover desirable rain streaks removal\narchitectures automatically.

Our goal is to understand if it is possible to constrain the sizes and\nshapes of nano-diamonds in circumstellar media using the observed ratio,\n[CH]/[CH$_2$], of their surface CH$_2$ and CH infrared bands at $\\simeq\n3.43\\,\\mu$m and $\\simeq 3.53\\,\\mu$m, respectively. We calculated the CH and\nCH$_2$ abundances on nano-diamonds using two approaches. The first assumes\nregular and semi-regular polyhedra (tetrahedra, octahedra, and cubes and their\ntruncated forms). The second uses a diamond bonding network to derive the\nstructures of tetrahedral and octahedral particles, and their truncated\nvariants, and also of spherical nano-diamonds. As a function of the particle\nsize and shape, and for the two different calculation methods, we derived the\nrelative abundance ratio [CH]/[CH$_2$], which can then be weighted by their\nlaboratory-measured infrared band intensities. The two methods give good\nagreement and indicate that the spread in values, over the different particle\nforms, is more that an order of magnitude for any size. We conclude that the\nratio [CH]/[CH$_2$], and their infrared band ratio, strongly depend upon\nparticle size and shape. For a given shape or size, the ratio can vary by more\nthan an order of magnitude. It may therefore be difficult to constrain\nnano-diamond sizes using the observed $3-4\\,\\mu$m spectra alone.

In laser-plasma\ninteractions, such a mirror travels with relativistic velocities and typically\nhas a parabolic form, which is advantageous for light intensification. Thus, a\nrelativistic-flying parabolic mirror reflects the counter-propagating radiation\nin a form of focused and flying electromagnetic wave with a high frequency. The\nrelativistic-flying motion of the laser focus makes the electric and magnetic\nfield distributions of the focus complicated, and the mathematical expressions\ndescribing the field distributions of the focus is important. We present\nanalytical expressions describing the field distribution formed by an ideal\nflying mirror having a perfect reflectance over the entire surface and\nwavelength range. The peak field strength of an incident laser pulse with a\ncenter wavelength of lambda_0 and an effective beam radius of w_e is enhanced\nby a factor proportional to gamma^3 (w_e/lambda_0) in the relativistic limit.\nElectron-positron pair production is investigated in the context of invariant\nfields based on the enhanced electromagnetic field. The pair production rate\nunder the relativistic-flying laser focus is modified by the Lorentz\ngamma-factor and the beam radius-wavelength ratio (w_e/lambda_0).

In this work we focus on the evolution\nof magnetized WD + He star binaries with detailed stellar evolution and binary\npopulation synthesis (BPS) calculations. In the case of magnetized WDs, the\nmagnetic fields may disrupt the inner regions of the accretion disk, funnel the\naccretion flow onto the polar caps, and even confine helium burning within the\ncaps.We find that, for WDs with sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the\nparameter space of the potential SN Ia progenitor systems shrinks toward\nshorter orbital periods and lower donor masses compared with that in the\nnon-magnetized WD case. The reason is that the magnetic confinement usually\nworks with relatively high mass transfer rates, which can trigger strong wind\nmass loss from the WD, thus limiting the He-rich mass accumulation efficiency.\nThe surviving companion stars are likely of low-mass at the moment of the SN\nexplosions, which can be regarded as a possible explanation for the\nnon-detection of surviving companions after the SNe or inside the SN remnants.\nHowever, the corresponding birthrate of Galactic SNe Ia in our high-magnetic\nmodels is estimated to be ~(0.08-0.13) * 10^{-3} yr^{-1}( ~0.17-0.28 *\n10^{-3}yr^{-1} for the non-magnetic models), significantly lower than the\nobserved Galactic SN Ia birthrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 13:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

For the\nexoplanet HD189733b, multiple observations in the Ly-$\\alpha$ line have shown\nthat atmospheric evaporation is variable, going from undetected to enhanced\nevaporation in a $1.5$-year interval. Coincidentally or not, when HD189733b was\nobserved to be evaporating, a stellar flare had just occurred 8h prior to the\nobservation. This led to the question of whether this temporal variation in\nevaporation occurred due to the flare, an unseen associated coronal mass\nejection (CME), or even the effect of both simultaneously. In this work, we\ninvestigate the impact of flares (radiation), winds, and CMEs (particles) on\nthe atmosphere of HD189733b using 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of\natmospheric evaporation that self-consistently include stellar photon heating.\nWe study four cases: first- the quiescent phase of the star including stellar\nwind, second- a flare, third- a CME, and fourth- a flare that is followed by a\nCME. Compared to the quiescent case, we find that the flare alone increases the\nevaporation rate by only 25%, while the CME leads to a factor of 4 increase in\nescape rate. We calculate Ly-$\\alpha$ synthetic transits and find that the\nflare alone cannot explain the observed high blueshifted velocities seen in the\nLy-$\\alpha$ observation. The CME, however, leads to an increase in the velocity\nof the escaping atmosphere, enhancing the transit depth at high blueshifted\nvelocities. While the effects of CMEs show a promising potential to explain the\nblueshifted line feature, our models are not able to fully explain the\nblueshifted transit depths, indicating that they might require additional\nphysical mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 14:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

However, different from $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$,\n$\\alpha$-RuI$_3$ was reported to be a paramagnetic metal without long-range\nmagnetic order down to $0.35$ K. Here, the structural and electronic properties\nof the quasi-two-dimensional $\\alpha$-RuI$_3$ are theoretically studied. First,\nbased on first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the ABC\nstacking honeycomb-layer $R\\overline{3}$ (No. 148) structure is found to be the\nmost likely stacking order for $\\alpha$-RuI$_3$ along the $c$-axis.\nFurthermore, both $R\\overline{3}$ and $P\\overline{3}1c$ are dynamically stable\nbecause no imaginary frequency modes were obtained in the phononic dispersion\nspectrum. Moreover, the different physical behavior of $\\alpha$-RuI$_3$\ncompared to $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ can be understood naturally. The strong\nhybridization between Ru $4d$ and I $5p$ orbitals decreases the effective\natomic Hubbard repulsion $U$, leading the electrons of RuI$_3$ to be less\nlocalized than in RuCl$_3$. As a consequence, the effective repulsion $U$ is\nreduced from Cl to I, leading to the metallic nature of $\\alpha$-RuI$_3$. Based\non the DFT+$U$ ($U_{\\rm eff} = 2$ eV), plus spin-orbital coupling (SOC), we\nobtained a spin-orbit Mott insulating behavior for $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and, by\nthe same procedure, a metallic behavior for $\\alpha$-RuI$_3$, in good agreement\nwith experimental results.

When the capacity of the pre-trained model is much larger than the size\nof the target data set, fine-tuning is prone to overfitting and \"memorizing\"\nthe training labels. Hence, an important question is to regularize fine-tuning\nand ensure its robustness to noise. To address this question, we begin by\nanalyzing the generalization properties of fine-tuning. We present a PAC-Bayes\ngeneralization bound that depends on the distance traveled in each layer during\nfine-tuning and the noise stability of the fine-tuned model. We empirically\nmeasure these quantities.

The proportionality between migration speed and the disc's viscosity\nis broken by the presence of vortices that appear at the edges of the\nplanet-induced gap. Our goal is to investigate vortex-driven migration in\nlow-viscosity discs in the presence of radial advection of gas, as expected\nfrom angular momentum removal by magnetised disc winds. We performed three\ndimensional simulations using the grid-based code FARGOCA. We mimicked the\neffects of a disc wind by applying a synthetic torque on a surface layer of the\ndisc characterised by a prescribed column density Sigma_A so that it results in\na disc accretion rate of 10^-8 Solar masses per year. Discs with this structure\nare called 'layered' and the layer where the torque is applied is denoted as\n'active'. We also consider the case of accretion focussed near the disc\nmidplane to mimic transport properties induced by a large Hall effect or by\nweak Ohmic diffusion. We observe two migration phases: in the first phase, the\nmigration of the planet is driven by the vortex and is directed inwards. This\nphase ends when the vortex disappear. Migration depends on the ability of the\ntorque from the planet to block the accretion flow. When the flow is fast and\nunimpeded (small Sigma_A) migration is very slow. When the accretion flow is\ncompletely blocked, migration is faster and the speed is controlled by the rate\nat which the accretion flow refills the gap behind the migrating planet. The\nmigration speed of a giant planet in a layered protoplanetary disc depends on\nthe thickness of the accreting layer. The lack of large-scale migration\napparently experienced by the majority of giant exoplanets can be explained if\nthe accreting layer is sufficiently thin to allow unimpeded accretion through\nthe disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 15:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

This can\nhelp in identifying faulty devices and wasted energy by devices when left On\nunused. The main challenge is to identity and estimate the energy consumption\nof individual devices without intrusive sensors on each device. Non-intrusive\nload monitoring (NILM) or energy disaggregation, is a blind source separation\nproblem which requires a system to estimate the electricity usage of individual\nappliances from the aggregated household energy consumption. In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep neural network-based approach for performing load\ndisaggregation on low frequency power data obtained from residential\nhouseholds. We combine a series of one-dimensional Convolutional Neural\nNetworks and Long Short Term Memory (1D CNN-LSTM) to extract features that can\nidentify active appliances and retrieve their power consumption given the\naggregated household power value. We used CNNs to extract features from main\nreadings in a given time frame and then used those features to classify if a\ngiven appliance is active at that time period or not. Following that, the\nextracted features are used to model a generation problem using LSTM. We train\nthe LSTM to generate the disaggregated energy consumption of a particular\nappliance. Our neural network is capable of generating detailed feedback of\ndemand-side, providing vital insights to the end-user about their electricity\nconsumption. The algorithm was designed for low power offline devices such as\nESP32. Empirical calculations show that our model outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art on the Reference Energy Disaggregation Dataset (REDD).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 23:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

In this paper the sampling method, as well as the\ninference of the underlying distribution, are both handled with a data-driven\nmethod known as generative adversarial networks (GAN), which trains two\ncompeting neural networks to produce a network that can effectively generate\nsamples from the training set distribution.

The difficulty cannot be solved only by the horizontal force,\nbecause a horizontal force opposite the translational direction increases the\nangular velocity of rotation around the center. Therefore other mechanisms need\nto be examined. There are two main reasons for this result. 1) Both a cylinder\nand a floor are not perfect circle and perfect plane, but have uneven surfaces.\nThe micro bumps on the surface yield small collisions in the direction\nperpendicular to the floor. The collisions generate a rolling friction torque\naround the center. 2) A strong force acts on the contact part which is\ndeformed. The high-speed deformation produces a history effect on the\nrelationship between stress and strain, because the compressed wave in the\ncontact part diffuses to the outside at the speed of sound. Therefore a rolling\nfriction torque is also generated. Both torques are caused by forces\nperpendicular to the floor.

Education, environment, medical care, military, tourism,\neconomy, politics, etc. are having a very large impact on society as a whole.\nFor example, in the field of education, there is an artificial intelligence\ntutoring system that automatically assigns tutors based on student's level. In\nthe field of economics, there are quantitative investment methods that\nautomatically analyze large amounts of data to find investment laws to create\ninvestment models or predict changes in financial markets. As such, artificial\nintelligence technology is being used in various fields. So, it is very\nimportant to know exactly what factors have an important influence on each\nfield of artificial intelligence technology and how the relationship between\neach field is connected. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze artificial\nintelligence technology in each field. In this paper, we analyze patent\ndocuments related to artificial intelligence technology. We propose a method\nfor keyword analysis within factors using artificial intelligence patent data\nsets for artificial intelligence technology analysis. This is a model that\nrelies on feature engineering based on deep learning model named KeyBERT, and\nusing vector space model. A case study of collecting and analyzing artificial\nintelligence patent data was conducted to show how the proposed model can be\napplied to real world problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 00:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}
