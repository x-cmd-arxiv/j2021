Existing 3D pose estimation suffers from 1) the inherent ambiguity\nbetween the 2D and 3D data, and 2) the lack of well labeled 2D-3D pose pairs in\nthe wild. Human beings are able to imagine the human 3D pose from a 2D image or\na set of 2D body key-points with the least ambiguity, which should be\nattributed to the prior knowledge of the human body that we have acquired in\nour mind. Inspired by this, we propose a new framework that leverages the\nlabeled 3D human poses to learn a 3D concept of the human body to reduce the\nambiguity. To have consensus on the body concept from 2D pose, our key insight\nis to treat the 2D human pose and the 3D human pose as two different domains.\nBy adapting the two domains, the body knowledge learned from 3D poses is\napplied to 2D poses and guides the 2D pose encoder to generate informative 3D\n\"imagination\" as embedding in pose lifting. Benefiting from the domain\nadaptation perspective, the proposed framework unifies the supervised and\nsemi-supervised 3D pose estimation in a principled framework. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on standard benchmarks. More importantly, it is validated that the\nexplicitly learned 3D body concept effectively alleviates the 2D-3D ambiguity\nin 2D pose lifting, improves the generalization, and enables the network to\nexploit the abundant unlabeled 2D data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 16:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

The Poisson\nbrackets of the charges on the subregion phase space are shown to reproduce the\nbracket of Barnich and Troessaert for open subsystems, thereby giving a novel\nderivation of this bracket from first principles.

Considering greater spatial horizon and\nlevel of detail, during the design, exacerbates this challenge. This paper\ninvestigates spatial and technology aggregation of energy system model, as a\ncomplexity-reduction technique. To that end, a novel two-step aggregation\nscheme based on model parameters such as Variable Renewable Energy Sources\n(VRES) time series and capacities, transmission capacities and distances, etc,\nis introduced. First, model regions are aggregated to obtain reduced region\nset. The aggregation is based on a holistic approach that considers all model\nparameters and spatial contiguity of regions. Next, technology aggregation is\nperformed on each VRES, present in each newly-defined region. Each VRES is\naggregated based on the temporal profiles to obtain a representative set. The\nimpact of these aggregations on accuracy and computational complexity of a\ncost-optimal energy system design is analyzed for a European energy system\nscenario.The aggregations are performed to obtain different combinations of\nnumber of regions and VRES types, and the results are benchmarked against\ninitial spatial resolution of 96 regions and 68 VRES types in each region. The\nresults show that the system costs deviate significantly when lower number of\nregions and/or VRES types are considered. As the spatial resolution is\nincreased in terms of both number of regions and VRES types, the system cost\nfluctuates at first and stabilizes at some point, approaching the benchmark\nvalue. Optimal combination can be determined based on an acceptable cost\ndeviation and the point of stabilization. For instance, if <5% deviation is\nacceptable, 33 regions and 38 VRES types in each region is optimal. With this\nsetting, the system cost is under-estimated by 4.42% but the run time is\nreduced by 92.95%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 16:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

Synchronization takes place when the simulation recovers the\nfull true state of the flow, or in other words when the missing region is\naccurately re-established, spontaneously. Successful synchronization depends on\nthe orientation, location and size of the missing layer. For friction Reynolds\nnumbers up to one thousand, wall-attached horizontal layers can synchronize as\nlong as their thickness is less than approximately thirty wall units. When the\nhorizontal layer is detached from the wall, the critical thickness increases\nwith height and is proportional to the local wall-normal Taylor microscale. A\nflow-parallel, vertical layer that spans the height of the channel synchronizes\nwhen its spanwise width is on the order of the near-wall Taylor microscale,\nwhile the criterion for a crossflow vertical layer is set by the advection\ndistance within a Lyapunov timescale.

This\nresults in the unique existence and stability of global solutions in a periodic\ndomain. To be precise, given an initial velocity $u_0$ and initial conformation\ntensor $\\sigma_0$, both with components in $H^2$, we obtain a velocity $u$ and\nconformation tensor $\\sigma$ both with components in $C([0, T]; H^2)$ for all\n$T>0$. Assuming better regularity for the initial data allows us to obtain\nbetter regularity for the solutions. We treat both the diffusive and\nnon-diffusive cases of the model. Notably, the regularization in the equation\nfor the conformation tensor in our new model has been applied only to the\nvelocity, rather than to the conformation tensor, unlike other available\nregularization techniques \\cite{barrett;suli2009}. This is desired since the\nstress, and thus the conformation tensor, is typically less regular than the\nvelocity for the creeping flow of non-Newtonian fluids. In\n\\cite{constantinnote} the existence and regularity of solutions to the\nnon-regularized two dimensional diffusive Oldroyd-B model was established.\nHowever, the proof cannot be generalized to three dimensions nor to the\nnon-diffusive case. The proposed regularization overcomes these obstacles.\nMoreover, we show that the solutions in the diffusive case are stable in the\n$H^2$ norm. In the non-diffusive case, we are able to establish that the\nsolutions are stable in the $L^2$ norm. Furthermore, we show that as the\ndiffusivity parameter goes to zero, our solutions converge in the $L^2$ norm to\nthe non-diffusive solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 17:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

Here, we present a\nsemi-phenomenological approach which exploits mass-conservation in pattern\nformation, and enables to reconstruct information about patterns from the\nlarge-scale dynamics. The basic idea is to partition the domain into distinct\nregions (coarse-grain) and determine instantaneous dispersion relations in each\nregion, which ultimately inform about local pattern-forming instabilities. We\nillustrate our approach by studying the Min system, a paradigmatic model for\nprotein pattern formation. By performing simulations, we first show that the\nMin system produces multiscale patterns in a spatially heterogeneous geometry.\nThis prediction is confirmed experimentally by in vitro reconstitution of the\nMin system. Using a recently developed theoretical framework for\nmass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems, we show that the spatiotemporal\nevolution of the total protein densities on large-scales reliably predicts the\npattern-forming dynamics. Our approach provides an alternative and versatile\ntheoretical framework for complex systems where analytical coarse-graining\nmethods are not applicable, and can in principle be applied to a wide range of\nsystems with an underlying conservation law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 17:57:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 08:50:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 14:24:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

With\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)\\leq\\mathcal{O}(g(n))\\leq\\mathcal{O}(f(n))$ for all $n$, the\nquantum bits required to execute $A$ may therefore not exceed\n$\\mathcal{O}(f(n)^2)$ and may come down to $\\mathcal{O}(f(n))$ if memory\nconsumption by $A$ is bounded by a constant. Our construction works by encoding\nsymbolic execution of machine code in a finite state machine over the\nsatisfiability-modulo-theory (SMT) of bitvectors, for modeling CPU registers,\nand arrays of bitvectors, for modeling main memory. The FSM is linear in the\nsize of the code, independent of execution time and space, and represents the\nreachable machine states for any given input. The FSM may be explored by\nbounded model checkers using SMT and SAT solvers as backend. However, for the\npurpose of this paper, we focus on quantum computing by unrolling and\nbit-blasting the FSM into (1)~satisfiability-preserving quadratic unconstrained\nbinary optimization (QUBO) models targeting adiabatic forms of quantum\ncomputing such as quantum annealing, and (2)~semantics-preserving quantum\ncircuits (QCs) targeting gate-model quantum computers. With our compact QUBOs,\nreal quantum annealers can now execute simple but real code even symbolically,\nyet only with potential but no guarantee for exponential speedup, and with our\nQCs as oracles, Grover's algorithm applies to symbolic execution of arbitrary\ncode, guaranteeing at least in theory a quadratic speedup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:24:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2021 22:19:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 21:32:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 18:31:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 14:49:59 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 17:48:28 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 17:16:13 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 14:22:30 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2022 12:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

Theoretical studies to date have established that time-resolved\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy is an atom-specific probe of excited-state wave\npacket passage through a seam of conical intersections (CIs). However, in many\nmolecular systems, there are competing dynamical pathways involving CIs of\ndifferent electronic and nuclear character. Discerning these pathways remains\nan important challenge.

Using the example of 1,3-butadiene, we\nshow how TRXAS discerns the different electronic structures associated with\npassage through multiple conical intersections.

The differing electronic structures along these pathways give\nrise to different XAS signals, indicating the possibility of resolving them.\nFurthermore, this indicates that XAS, and other core-level spectroscopic\ntechniques, offer the appealing prospect of directly probing the effects of\nselective chemical substitution and its ability to affect chemical control over\nexcited-state molecular dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

Shedding light on the origin and\nfunctional significance of such a dynamical state is essential to understanding\nhow the brain transmits, processes, and stores information. An inspiring,\nalbeit controversial, conjecture proposes that some statistical characteristics\nof empirically observed neuronal activity can be understood by assuming that\nbrain networks operate in a dynamical regime near the edge of a phase\ntransition. Moreover, the resulting critical behavior, with its concomitant\nscale invariance, is assumed to carry crucial functional advantages. Here, we\npresent a data-driven analysis based on simultaneous high-throughput recordings\nof the activity of thousands of individual neurons in various regions of the\nmouse brain. To analyze these data, we synergistically combine cutting-edge\nmethods for the study of brain activity (such as a phenomenological\nrenormalization group approach and techniques that infer the general dynamical\nstate of a neural population), while designing complementary tools. This\nstrategy allows us to uncover strong signatures of scale invariance that is\n\"quasi-universal\" across brain regions and reveal that all these areas operate,\nto a greater or lesser extent, near the edge of instability. Furthermore, this\nframework allows us to distinguish between quasi-universal background activity\nand non-universal input-related activity. Taken together, this study provides\nstrong evidence that brain networks actually operate in a critical regime\nwhich, among other functional advantages, provides them with a scale-invariant\nsubstrate of activity covariances that can sustain optimal input\nrepresentations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:29:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 10:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

Internally, these stars\nhave relatively small convective cores, and convective overshoot can\nsignificantly affect the size. Recently, models of radial pulsation in delta\nScuti stars found a strong correlation between the pulsation constant (Q) as a\nfunction of effective temperature and the amount of convective overshoot within\nthe star. However, only models with metallicities of Z = 0.02 were examined,\nleaving the dependence of this relationship on chemical composition unknown.

By\nvarying the models' mass, rotation speed, convective overshoot, and\nmetallicity, we studied the behaviour of Q at low temperature. We found that\nthe updated convective boundary treatment in MESA changes the overshoot\ndependence found previously, and the value of the slope depends on both\nrotation and overshoot.

In order to maintain the computational viability of these\nmodels for large-scale application cases, temporal aggregation has emerged as a\ntechnique for reducing the number of considered time steps by reducing the\noriginal time horizon down to fewer, more representative ones. This study\npresents advanced but generally applicable clustering techniques that allow for\nad-hoc improvements of state-of-the-art approaches without requiring profound\nknowledge of the individual energy system model. These improvements comprise\nthe optimal tradeoff between the number of typical days and inner-daily\ntemporal resolutions, as well as constituting a representation method that can\nreproduce the value distribution of the original time series. We prove the\nsuperiority of these approaches by applying them to two fundamentally different\nmodel types, namely a single-node building energy system and a European\ncarbon-neutral energy scenario, and benchmark these against state-of-the-art\napproaches. This is performed for a variety of temporal resolutions, which\nleads to many hundreds of model runs. The results show that the proposed\nimprovements on current methods strictly dominate the status quo with respect\nto Pareto-optimality in terms of runtime and accuracy. Although a speeding up\nfactor of one magnitude could be achieved using traditional aggregation methods\nwithin a cost deviation range of two percent, the algorithms proposed herein\nachieve this accuracy with a runtime speedup by a factor of two orders of\nmagnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

This linear-nonlinear balance dictates a unique\npulse energy, which cannot be increased (say by elevated pumping), indicating\nthat excess energy is expected to be radiated in the form of dispersive or\ndiffractive waves. Here we show that Kerr-lens mode-locked lasers can overcome\nthis expectation.

Increasing the\npump power leads therefore to a different soliton solution, rather than to\ndispersive / diffractive loss. We predict this symmetry breaking by a complete\nnumerical simulation of the spatio-temporal dynamics in the cavity, and confirm\nit experimentally in a Kerr-lens mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser with\nquantitative agreement to the simulation. The simulation opens a window to\ndirectly observe the nonlinear space-time dynamics that molds the soliton\npulse, and possibly to optimize it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:51:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 20:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

Among all the compounds investigated so far, the\nsearch for magnetic vdW materials has intensified in recent years, fueled by\nthe realization of magnetism in two dimensions (2D). However, metallic magnetic\nvdW systems are still uncommon. In addition, they rarely host high-mobility\ncharge carriers, which is an essential requirement for high-speed electronic\napplications. Another shortcoming of 2D magnets is that they are highly air\nsensitive. Using chemical reasoning, we introduce TaCo2Te2 as an air-stable,\nhigh-mobility, magnetic vdW material. It has a layered structure, which\nconsists of Peierls distorted Co chains and a large vdW gap between the layers.\nWe find that the bulk crystals can be easily exfoliated and the obtained thin\nflakes are robust to ambient conditions after four months of monitoring using\nan optical microscope. We also observe signatures of canted antiferromagntic\nbehavior at low-temperature. TaCo2Te2 shows a metallic character and a large,\nnon-saturating, anisotropic magnetoresistance. Furthermore, our Hall data and\nquantum oscillation measurements reveal the presence of both electron- and\nhole-type carriers and their high mobility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

However, due to the domain gap between\nImageNet and ReID datasets, it usually needs a larger pre-training dataset\n(e.g. ImageNet-21K) to boost the performance because of the strong data fitting\nability of the transformer. To address this challenge, this work targets to\nmitigate the gap between the pre-training and ReID datasets from the\nperspective of data and model structure, respectively. We first investigate\nself-supervised learning (SSL) methods with Vision Transformer (ViT) pretrained\non unlabelled person images (the LUPerson dataset), and empirically find it\nsignificantly surpasses ImageNet supervised pre-training models on ReID tasks.\nTo further reduce the domain gap and accelerate the pre-training, the\nCatastrophic Forgetting Score (CFS) is proposed to evaluate the gap between\npre-training and fine-tuning data. Based on CFS, a subset is selected via\nsampling relevant data close to the down-stream ReID data and filtering\nirrelevant data from the pre-training dataset. For the model structure, a\nReID-specific module named IBN-based convolution stem (ICS) is proposed to\nbridge the domain gap by learning more invariant features. Extensive\nexperiments have been conducted to fine-tune the pre-training models under\nsupervised learning, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), and unsupervised\nlearning (USL) settings. We successfully downscale the LUPerson dataset to 50%\nwith no performance degradation. Finally, we achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on Market-1501 and MSMT17.

In contrast to existing solutions that use multiple separate modules for\ndifferent outputs, UniTAB represents both text and box outputs with a shared\ntoken sequence, and introduces a special <obj> token to naturally indicate\nword-box alignments in the sequence. UniTAB thus could provide a more\ncomprehensive and interpretable image description, by freely grounding\ngenerated words to object regions.

For planets, accretion tracers should come from the shock\nitself, exposing them to extinction by the accreting material. High-resolution\n(R>5e4) spectrographs at Ha should soon allow studying how the incoming\nmaterial shapes the line profile. We calculate how much the gas and dust\naccreting onto a planet reduce the Ha flux from the shock at the planetary\nsurface and how they affect line shapes. We also study the absorption-modified\nrelationship between Ha luminosity and Mdot. We compute the high-resolution\nradiative transfer of the Ha line using a 1D velocity-density-temperature\nstructure for the inflowing matter in three representative accretion\ngeometries: spherical symmetry, polar inflow, and magnetospheric accretion. For\neach, we explore wide ranges of Mdot and planet mass M. We use detailed gas\nopacities and estimate dust opacities. At Mdot<3e-6 MJ/yr, gas extinction is\nnegligible for spherical or polar inflow and at most A_Ha<0.5 mag for\nmagnetospheric accretion. Up to Mdot~3e-4 MJ/yr, the gas has A_Ha<4 mag. This\ndecreases with M. We estimate realistic dust opacities at Ha as ~0.01-10\ncm^2/g, i.e., 10-1e4 times lower than in the ISM. Extinction flattens the\nL_Ha-Mdot relationship, which becomes non-monotonic with a maximum L_Ha~1e-4\nLSun near Mdot~1e-4 MJ/yr for M~10 MJ. In magnetospheric accretion, the gas can\nintroduce features in line profiles, but the velocity gradient smears them out\nin other geometries. For most of parameter space, extinction by the accreting\nmatter should be negligible, simplifying interpretation of observations,\nespecially for planets in gaps. At high Mdot, strong absorption reduces the Ha\nflux, and some measurements can be interpreted as two Mdot values. Line\nprofiles at R~1e5 can provide complex constraints on the accretion flow's\nthermal-dynamical structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-29"}

An important\nquestion, though, is whether such a stripping scenario can explain DF2's large\nspecific frequency of globular clusters (GCs). After all, tidal stripping and\nshocking preferentially remove matter from the outskirts. We examine this using\nidealized, high-resolution simulations of a regular dark matter dominated\ngalaxy that is accreted onto a massive halo. As long as the initial\n(pre-infall) dark matter halo of the satellite is cored, which is consistent\nwith predictions of cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations, the tidal remnant\ncan be made to resemble DF2 in all its properties, including its GC population.\nThe required orbit has a peri-centre at the 8.3 percentile of the distribution\nfor subhaloes at infall, and thus is not particularly extreme. On this orbit\nthe satellite loses 98.5 (30) percent of its original dark matter (stellar)\nmass, and thus evolves into a DMDG. The fraction of GCs that is stripped off\ndepends on the initial radial distribution. If, at infall, the median projected\nradius of the GC population is roughly two times that of the stars, consistent\nwith observations of isolated galaxies, only $\\sim 20$ percent of the GCs are\nstripped off. This is less than for the stars, which is due to dynamical\nfriction counteracting the tidal stirring.

The SN appears as a fast and luminous\nblue transient at early times, reaching a peak absolute magnitude of -20 within\n3 days due to strong interaction between fast SN ejecta (v ~ 30000 km/s) and a\nmassive, dense, fast-moving C/O wind shed by the WC-like progenitor months\nbefore explosion. The narrow line features disappear from the spectrum 10-20\ndays after explosion and are replaced by a blue continuum dominated by broad Fe\nfeatures, reminiscent of Type Ibn and IIn supernovae and indicative of weaker\ninteraction with more extended H/He-poor material.

These two processes are critical for the final orbital\nconfiguration of double compact-object systems with neutron stars and black\nholes. Predictive one-dimensional models of common-envelope interaction are\nlacking and multidimensional simulations are challenged by the vast range of\nrelevant spatial and temporal scales. Here, we present three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations of the common-envelope interaction of an initially\n$10\\,M_{\\odot}$ red supergiant primary star with a black-hole and a\nneutron-star companion. We show that the high-mass regime is accessible to full\nab-initio simulations. Nearly complete envelope ejection is reached assuming\nthat all recombination energy still available at the end of our simulation\ncontinues to help unbinding the envelope. In contrast to previous assumptions,\nwe find that the dynamical plunge-in of both companions terminates at orbital\nseparations too wide for gravitational waves to merge the systems in a Hubble\ntime. We discuss the further evolution of the system based on analytical\nestimates. A subsequent mass-transfer episode from the remaining $3\\,M_{\\odot}$\ncore of the supergiant to the compact companion does not shrink the orbit\nsufficiently either. A neutron-star--neutron-star and neutron-star--black-hole\nmerger is still expected for a fraction of the systems if the supernova kick\naligns favorably with the orbital motion. For double neutron star\n(neutron-star--black-hole) systems we estimate mergers in about $9 \\%$ ($1 \\%$)\nof cases while about $77 \\%$ ($94 \\%$) of binaries are disrupted, i.e.,\nsupernova kicks actually enable gravitational-wave mergers in our cases;\nhowever, we expect a reduction in predicted gravitational-wave merger events.\n(abbr.)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 19:10:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 12:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

State-of-the-art TRSs in compilers use a greedy algorithm that\napplies a set of rewriting rules in a predefined order (where some of the rules\nare not axiomatic). This leads to a loss of the ability to simplify certain\nexpressions. E-graphs and equality saturation sidestep this issue by\nrepresenting the different equivalent expressions in a compact manner from\nwhich the optimal expression can be extracted. While an e-graph-based TRS can\nbe more powerful than a TRS that uses a greedy algorithm, it is slower because\nexpressions may have a large or sometimes infinite number of equivalent\nexpressions. Accelerating e-graph construction is crucial for making the use of\ne-graphs practical in compilers. In this paper, we present Caviar, an\ne-graph-based TRS for proving expressions within compilers. The main advantage\nof Caviar is its speed. It can prove expressions much faster than base e-graph\nTRSs. It relies on three techniques: 1) a technique that stops e-graphs from\ngrowing when the goal is reached, called Iteration Level Check; 2) a mechanism\nthat balances exploration and exploitation in the equality saturation\nalgorithm, called Pulsing Caviar; 3) a technique to stop e-graph construction\nbefore reaching saturation when a non-provable pattern is detected, called\nNon-Provable Patterns Detection (NPPD). We evaluate caviar on Halide, an\noptimizing compiler that relies on a greedy-algorithm-based TRS to simplify and\nprove its expressions. The proposed techniques allow Caviar to accelerate\ne-graph expansion for the task of proving expressions.

Thus, aiming to solve and increase the operability of\npanoptic segmentation in remote sensing, this study has five objectives: (1)\ncreate a novel data preparation pipeline for panoptic segmentation, (2) propose\nan annotation conversion software to generate panoptic annotations; (3) propose\na novel dataset on urban areas, (4) modify the Detectron2 for the task, and (5)\nevaluate difficulties of this task in the urban setting. We used an aerial\nimage with a 0,24-meter spatial resolution considering 14 classes. Our pipeline\nconsiders three image inputs, and the proposed software uses point shapefiles\nfor creating samples in the COCO format. Our study generated 3,400 samples with\n512x512 pixel dimensions. We used the Panoptic-FPN with two backbones\n(ResNet-50 and ResNet-101), and the model evaluation considered semantic\ninstance and panoptic metrics. We obtained 93.9, 47.7, and 64.9 for the mean\nIoU, box AP, and PQ. Our study presents the first effective pipeline for\npanoptic segmentation and an extensive database for other researchers to use\nand deal with other data or related problems requiring a thorough scene\nunderstanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 19:48:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 12:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

In this paper, we present a novel approach to\nsemi-automatic construction of AI-agents, that mimic and generalize given human\ngameplays by adapting and tuning of expert-created BT under a developed\nsimilarity metric between source and BT gameplays. To this end, we formulated\nmixed discrete-continuous optimization problem, in which topological and\nfunctional changes of the BT are reflected in numerical variables, and\nconstructed a dedicated hybrid-metaheuristic. The performance of presented\napproach was verified experimentally in a prototype real-time strategy game.\nCarried out experiments confirmed efficiency and perspectives of presented\napproach, which is going to be applied in a commercial game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 20:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-25"}

Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), based on\nconstrained optimization, was successfully applied in the Warburg Effect\nmodelling. Yet, the assumption that cell types have one invariant cellular\nobjective severely limits the applicability of the previous FBA models.\nMeanwhile, we note that cell types with different objectives show different\nextents of the Warburg Effect. To extend the applicability of the previous\nmodel and model the disparate cellular pathway preferences in different cell\ntypes, we built a Nonlinear Multi-Objective FBA (NLMOFBA) model by including\nthree key objective terms (ATP production rate, lactate generation rate and ATP\nyield) into one objective function through linear scalarization. By\nconstructing a cellular objective map and iteratively varying the objective\nweights, we showed disparate cellular pathway preferences manifested by\ndifferent cell types driven by their unique cellular objectives, and we gained\ninsights about the causal relationship between cellular objectives and the\nWarburg Effect. In addition, we obtained other biologically consistent results\nby using our NLMOFBA model. For example, augmented with the constraint\nassociated with inefficient mitochondria function or limited substrate, NLMOFBA\npredicts cellular pathways supported by the biology literature. Collectively,\nNLMOFBA can help build a complete understanding towards the Warburg Effect in\ndifferent cell types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 20:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-25"}

The observed\ntime evolution of the accretion rates of white dwarfs through their multi-Gyr\nlifetime is a crucial test for dynamical models of evolved planetary systems.\nRecent studies of cool white dwarfs samples have identified a significant\ndecrease of the mass accretion rates of cool, old white dwarfs over Gyr\ntimescales.

These alloys exhibit long-range structural\norder coupled with limited or no chemical order. As a result, extreme local\nenvironments exist with a large opposing magnetic energy term, which can\nmanifest large changes in the magnetic behavior. In the current work, the\nmagnetic properties of (Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni) alloys are presented. These materials\nwere prepared by room-temperature combinatorial sputtering, resulting in a\nrange of compositions with a single BCC structural phase and no chemical\nordering. The combinatorial growth technique allows CCMs to be prepared outside\nof their thermodynamically stable phase, enabling the exploration of otherwise\ninaccessible order. The mixed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions\nin these alloys causes frustrated magnetic behavior, which results in an\nextremely low coercivity (<1 mT), which increases rapidly at 50 K. At low\ntemperatures, the coercivity achieves values of nearly 500 mT, which is\ncomparable to some high-anisotropy magnetic materials. Commensurate with the\ndivergent coercivity is an atypical drop in the temperature dependent\nmagnetization.

The magnetic configuration and\nresponse to temperatures and magnetic fields in these heterostructures are\nconsidered to be highly dependent on the interfacial coupling. However, the\nintrinsic properties of each of the layers, such as the saturation\nmagnetization and layer thickness, also strongly influence the magnetic\nconfiguration. Changing these parameters provides an effective method to tailor\nmagnetic properties in composite magnets. Here, we use polarized neutron\nreflectometry (PNR) to experimentally probe the interfacial magnetic\nconfigurations in hard/soft bilayer thin films: L10-FePt/A1-FePt, [Co/Pd]\n/CoPd, [Co/Pt] /FeNi and L10-FePt/Fe, which all have a perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy in the hard layer. These films were designed with different soft and\nhard layer thicknesses (t_soft and t_hard) and saturation magnetization\n(M_s^soft and M_s^hard), respectively. The influences of an in-plane magnetic\nfield (H_ip) and temperature (T) are also studied using a L10 FePt/A1-FePt\nbilayer sample. Comparing the PNR results to micromagnetic simulations reveals\nthat the interfacial magnetic configuration is highly dependent on t_soft,\nM_s^soft and the external factors (H_ip and T), and has a relatively weak\ndependence on t_hard and M_s^hard. Key among these results, for thin t_soft,\nthe hard and soft layers are rigidly coupled in the out-of-plane direction,\nthen undergo a transition to relax in-plane. This transition can be delayed to\nlarger t_soft by decreasing M_s^soft. Understanding the influence of these\nparameters on the magnetic configuration is critical to designing functional\ncomposite magnets for applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 22:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-25"}

In this whitepaper, we hypothesise that increased automation on both\nsides will accelerate the coevolutionary cycle, thus begging the question of\nwhether there are any resultant fixed points, and how they are characterised.\nWorking within the threat model of Locked Shields, Europe's largest\ncyberdefense exercise, we study blackbox adversarial attacks on network\nclassifiers. Given already existing attack capabilities, we question the\nutility of optimal evasion attack frameworks based on minimal evasion\ndistances. Instead, we suggest a novel reinforcement learning setting that can\nbe used to efficiently generate arbitrary adversarial perturbations. We then\nargue that attacker-defender fixed points are themselves general-sum games with\ncomplex phase transitions, and introduce a temporally extended multi-agent\nreinforcement learning framework in which the resultant dynamics can be\nstudied.

One popular algorithms in CF is the\nK-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, in which the similarity measures are used\nto determine nearest neighbors of a user, and thus to quantify the dependency\ndegree between the relative user/item pair. Consequently, CF approach is not\njust sensitive to the similarity measure, yet it is completely contingent on\nselection of that measure. While Jaccard - as one of those commonly used\nsimilarity measures for CF tasks - concerns the existence of ratings, other\nnumerical measures such as cosine and Pearson concern the magnitude of ratings.\nParticularly speaking, Jaccard is not a dominant measure, but it is long proven\nto be an important factor to improve any measure.

We introduce the challenging new task of\nexplainable multiple abnormality classification in volumetric medical images,\nin which a model must indicate the regions used to predict each abnormality. To\nsolve this task, we propose a multiple instance learning convolutional neural\nnetwork, AxialNet, that allows identification of top slices for each\nabnormality. Next we incorporate HiResCAM, an attention mechanism, to identify\nsub-slice regions. We prove that for AxialNet, HiResCAM explanations are\nguaranteed to reflect the locations the model used, unlike Grad-CAM which\nsometimes highlights irrelevant locations. Armed with a model that produces\nfaithful explanations, we then aim to improve the model's learning through a\nnovel mask loss that leverages HiResCAM and 3D allowed regions to encourage the\nmodel to predict abnormalities based only on the organs in which those\nabnormalities appear. The 3D allowed regions are obtained automatically through\na new approach, PARTITION, that combines location information extracted from\nradiology reports with organ segmentation maps obtained through morphological\nimage processing.

Unlike high-utility\npattern mining (HUPM), which involves the enumeration of high-utility (e.g.,\nprofitable) patterns, HUOPM aims to find patterns representing a collection of\nexisting transactions. In practical applications, however, not all patterns are\nused or valuable. For example, a pattern might contain too many items, that is,\nthe pattern might be too specific and therefore lack value for users in real\nlife. To achieve qualified patterns with a flexible length, we constrain the\nminimum and maximum lengths during the mining process and introduce a novel\nalgorithm for the mining of flexible high utility-occupancy patterns. Our\nalgorithm is referred to as HUOPM+. To ensure the flexibility of the patterns\nand tighten the upper bound of the utility-occupancy, a strategy called the\nlength upper-bound (LUB) is presented to prune the search space.

It has been suggested that the\nplasma oscillation effect can significantly suppress coherent emission power by\nbunches. We examine this criticism in this paper. The suppression factor\nformalism was derived within the context of radio pulsars in which radio waves\nare in the low-amplitude, linear regime and cannot directly be applied to the\nlarge-amplitude, non-linear regime relevant for FRBs. Even if one applies this\nlinear treatment, plasma suppression is not important for two physical reasons.\nFirst, for an efficient radiation mechanism such as ICS, the required plasma\ndensity is not high so that a high-density plasma may not exist. Second, both\nbunched coherent mechanisms demand that a large global parallel electric field\n($E_\\parallel$) must exist in the emission region in order to continuously\ninject energy to the bunches to power an FRB. In order to produce typical FRB\nduration via coherent curvature or ICS radiation, a parallel electric field\nmust be present to balance the acceleration and radiation back-reaction. The\nplasma suppression factor should be modified with the existence of\n$E_\\parallel$. We show that the correction factor for curvature radiation,\n$f_{\\rm cur}$, increases with $E_\\parallel$ and becomes 1 when $E_\\parallel$\nreaches the radiation-reaction-limited regime.

However, the overall impact and long-term implications\nof this crisis to travel and mobility remain uncertain. To this end, this study\ndevelops an analytical framework that determines and analyzes the most dominant\nfactors impacting human mobility and travel in the U.S. during this pandemic.\nIn particular, the study uses Granger causality to determine the important\npredictors influencing daily vehicle miles traveled and utilize linear\nregularization algorithms, including Ridge and LASSO techniques, to model and\npredict mobility. State-level time-series data were obtained from various\nopen-access sources for the period starting from March 1, 2020 through June 13,\n2020 and the entire data set was divided into two parts for training and\ntesting purposes.

However,\nthe abrupt changes in quantized weights during training often lead to severe\nloss fluctuations and result in a sharp loss landscape, making the gradients\nunstable and thus degrading the performance. Recently, Sharpness-Aware\nMinimization (SAM) has been proposed to smooth the loss landscape and improve\nthe generalization performance of the models. Nevertheless, directly applying\nSAM to the quantized models can lead to perturbation mismatch or diminishment\nissues, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod, dubbed Sharpness-Aware Quantization (SAQ), to explore the effect of SAM\nin model compression, particularly quantization for the first time.\nSpecifically, we first provide a unified view of quantization and SAM by\ntreating them as introducing quantization noises and adversarial perturbations\nto the model weights, respectively. According to whether the noise and\nperturbation terms depend on each other, SAQ can be formulated into three\ncases, which are analyzed and compared comprehensively. Furthermore, by\nintroducing an efficient training strategy, SAQ only incurs a little additional\ntraining overhead compared with the default optimizer (e.g., SGD or AdamW).\nExtensive experiments on both convolutional neural networks and Transformers\nacross various datasets (i.e., ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100, Oxford Flowers-102,\nOxford-IIIT Pets) show that SAQ improves the generalization performance of the\nquantized models, yielding the SOTA results in uniform quantization.

This paper focuses on\nthe algorithmic improvement for the sparse reconstruction of CS-MRI, especially\nconsidering a non-smooth convex minimization problem which is composed of the\nsum of a total variation regularization term and a $\\ell_1$-norm term of the\nwavelet transformation. The partly motivation of targeting the dual problem is\nthat the dual variables are involved in relatively low-dimensional subspace.\nInstead of solving the primal model as usual, we turn our attention to its\nassociated dual model composed of three variable blocks and two separable\nnon-smooth function blocks.

In this\npaper, we make the first attempt to demonstrate the importance of both regions\nin cropping from a complete perspective and propose a simple yet effective\npretext task called Region Contrastive Learning (RegionCL). Specifically, given\ntwo different images, we randomly crop a region (called the paste view) from\neach image with the same size and swap them to compose two new images together\nwith the left regions (called the canvas view), respectively.

With\nminor modifications to popular SSL methods, RegionCL exploits those abundant\npairs and helps the model distinguish the regions features from both canvas and\npaste views, therefore learning better visual representations.

With the increasing penetration of\nrenewables, how to coordinate demand response and renewable generations is a\ncritical and challenging issue in the field of microgrid scheduling. To this\nend, a bi-level scheduling model is put forward for isolated microgrids with\nconsideration of multi-stakeholders in this paper, where the lower- and\nupper-level models respectively aim to the minimization of user cost and\nmicrogrid operational cost under real-time electricity pricing environments. In\norder to solve this model, this research combines Jaya algorithm and interior\npoint method (IPM) to develop a hybrid analysis-heuristic solution method\ncalled Jaya-IPM, where the lower- and upper- levels are respectively addressed\nby the IPM and the Jaya, and the scheduling scheme is obtained via iterations\nbetween the two levels. After that, the real-time prices updated by the\nupper-level model and the electricity plans determined by the lower-level model\nwill be alternately iterated between the upper- and lower- levels through the\nreal-time pricing mechanism to obtain an optimal scheduling plan. The test\nresults show that the proposed method can coordinate the uncertainty of\nrenewable generations with demand response strategies, thereby achieving a\nbalance between the interests of microgrid and users; and that by leveraging\ndemand response, the flexibility of the load side can be fully exploited to\nachieve peak load shaving while maintaining the balance of supply and demand.\nIn addition, the Jaya-IPM algorithm is proven to be superior to the traditional\nhybrid intelligent algorithm (HIA) and the CPLEX solver in terms of\noptimization results and calculation efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 08:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

An interesting research therefore is how to\nimprove modeling capacity of PLDA while retaining the simplicity. This paper\npresents a decoupling approach, which involves a global model that is simple\nand generalizable, and a local model that is complex and expressive. While the\nglobal model holds a bird view on the entire data, the local model represents\nthe details of individual classes. We conduct a preliminary study towards this\ndirection and investigate a simple decoupling model including both the global\nand local models.

A hurdle of training event-based models is the lack\nof large qualitative labeled data. Prior works learning end-tasks mostly rely\non labeled or pseudo-labeled datasets obtained from the active pixel sensor\n(APS) frames; however, such datasets' quality is far from rivaling those based\non the canonical images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called\n\\textbf{EvDistill}, to learn a student network on the unlabeled and unpaired\nevent data (target modality) via knowledge distillation (KD) from a teacher\nnetwork trained with large-scale, labeled image data (source modality). To\nenable KD across the unpaired modalities, we first propose a bidirectional\nmodality reconstruction (BMR) module to bridge both modalities and\nsimultaneously exploit them to distill knowledge via the crafted pairs, causing\nno extra computation in the inference. The BMR is improved by the end-tasks and\nKD losses in an end-to-end manner. Second, we leverage the structural\nsimilarities of both modalities and adapt the knowledge by matching their\ndistributions. Moreover, as most prior feature KD methods are uni-modality and\nless applicable to our problem, we propose to leverage an affinity graph KD\nloss to boost the distillation. Our extensive experiments on semantic\nsegmentation and object recognition demonstrate that EvDistill achieves\nsignificantly better results than the prior works and KD with only events and\nAPS frames.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 08:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-25"}

Domain adaptation can help in this regard by transferring\nknowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous\nmethods typically attempt to perform the adaptation on global features,\nhowever, the local semantic affiliations accounting for each pixel in the\nfeature space are often ignored, resulting in less discriminability. To solve\nthis issue, we propose a novel semantic prototype-based contrastive learning\nframework for fine-grained class alignment. Specifically, the semantic\nprototypes provide supervisory signals for per-pixel discriminative\nrepresentation learning and each pixel of source and target domains in the\nfeature space is required to reflect the content of the corresponding semantic\nprototype. In this way, our framework is able to explicitly make intra-class\npixel representations closer and inter-class pixel representations further\napart to improve the robustness of the segmentation model as well as alleviate\nthe domain shift problem.

Effects of\ntemperature on the A and B exciton peak energies and linewidths in the optical\ntransmission spectra were compared between the alloy and pure MoS2 and WS2. On\nincreasing the temperature from 25 K to 293 K the energy of the A and B exciton\npeaks decreases, while their linewidth increases due to exciton-phonon\ninteractions. The exciton-phonon interactions in the alloy are closer to those\nfor MoS2 than WS2. This suggests that the exciton wave functions in the alloy\nhave a larger amplitude on Mo atoms than on W atoms. The experimental\nabsorption spectra could be reproduced by TDDFT calculations. Interestingly,\nfor the alloy the Mo and W atoms had to be distributed over all layers.\nConversely, we could not reproduce the experimental alloy spectrum by\ncalculations on a structure with alternating layers, in which every other layer\ncontains only Mo atoms and the layers in between also W atoms. For the latter\natomic arrangement, the TDDFT calculations yielded an additional optical\nabsorption peak that could be due to excitons with some charge transfer\ncharacter.

The ab initio\ndetermination of the ground state of the BN polymorphs, such as hexagonal and\nzinc-blende, is difficult because of the elusive Van der Waals interaction,\nwhich plays a decisive role in some of the polymorphs, making quantitative\nprediction highly challenging. Hence, despite multiple theoretical studies,\nthere has been no consensus on the ground state yet, primarily due to\ncontradicting reports. In this study, we apply a state-of-the-art ab initio\nframework - fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FNDMC), to four well known BN\npolymorphs, namely hexagonal, rhombohedral, wurtzite, and zinc-blende BNs.

Despite these discoveries, the\nway in which non-ergodicity manifests itself in models of economic interactions\nremains an open issue. Here, we shed valuable insight on these properties by\nstudying the non-ergodicity of the population average wealth in a simple model\nfor wealth dynamics in a growing and reallocating economy called Reallocating\ngeometric Brownian motion (RGBM). When the effective wealth reallocation in the\neconomy is from the poor to the rich, the model allows for the existence of\nnegative wealth within the population. We show that then, in RGBM ergodicity\nbreaks as the difference between the time-average and the ensemble growth rate\nof the average wealth in the population. In particular, the ensemble average\nwealth grows exponentially whereas the time-average growth rate is\nnon-existent. Moreover, we find that the system is characterized with a\ncritical self-averaging time period. Before this time period, the ensemble\naverage is a fair approximation for the population average wealth. Afterwards,\nthe non-ergodicity forces the population average to oscillate between positive\nand negative values since then the magnitude of this observable is determined\nby the most extreme wealth values in the population. This implies that the\ndynamics of the population average is an unstable phenomenon in a non-ergodic\neconomy. We use this result to argue that one should be cautious when\ninterpreting economic well-being measures that are based on the population\naverage wealth in non-ergodic economies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 10:30:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2022 13:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

This paper\nproposes auto robust relative radiometric normalization methods via latent\nchange noise modeling. They utilize the prior knowledge that no change points\npossess small-scale noise under relative radiometric normalization and that\nchange points possess large-scale radiometric noise after radiometric\nnormalization, combining the stochastic expectation maximization method to\nquickly and robustly extract the no-change set to learn the relative\nradiometric normalization mapping functions.

A fraction of this population is also helium\ndepleted, with spectra dominated by highly-ionized emission lines of carbon and\noxygen (Types WC/WO). Evidence indicates that the most commonly-observed\nsupernova (SN) explosions that lack hydrogen and helium (Types Ib/Ic) cannot\nresult from massive WC/WO stars, leading some to suggest that most such stars\ncollapse directly into black holes without a visible supernova explosions.\nHere, we present observations of supernova SN 2019hgp, discovered about a day\nafter explosion.

To overcome this challenge, one recent\nwork builds an action-click supervision framework. It requires similar\nannotation costs but can steadily improve the localization performance when\ncompared to the conventional weakly supervised methods. In this paper, by\nrevealing that the performance bottleneck of the existing approaches mainly\ncomes from the background errors, we find that a stronger action localizer can\nbe trained with labels on the background video frames rather than those on the\naction frames. To this end, we convert the action-click supervision to the\nbackground-click supervision and develop a novel method, called BackTAL.\nSpecifically, BackTAL implements two-fold modeling on the background video\nframes, i.e. the position modeling and the feature modeling. In position\nmodeling, we not only conduct supervised learning on the annotated video frames\nbut also design a score separation module to enlarge the score differences\nbetween the potential action frames and backgrounds. In feature modeling, we\npropose an affinity module to measure frame-specific similarities among\nneighboring frames and dynamically attend to informative neighbors when\ncalculating temporal convolution. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks are\nconducted, which demonstrate the high performance of the established BackTAL\nand the rationality of the proposed background-click supervision.

The Ti$_2$Ni structure with the cubic\nspace group $Fd\\bar{3}m$ is surprisingly complex, consisting of a unit cell\nwith 96 metal atoms. The related $\\eta$-carbide compounds correspond to a\nfilled version of the Ti$_2$Ni structure. Here, we report on the structure and\nsuperconductivity in the $\\eta$-carbide type suboxides Ti$_4$M$_2$O with M =\nCo, Rh, Ir. We have successfully synthesized all three compounds in single\nphase form. We find all three compounds to be type-II bulk superconductors with\ntransition temperatures of $T_{\\rm c}$ = 2.7, 2.8, and 5.4 K, and with\nnormalized specific heat jumps of $\\Delta C/\\gamma T_{\\rm c}$ = 1.65, 1.28, and\n1.80 for Ti$_4$Co$_2$O, Ti$_4$Rh$_2$O, and Ti$_4$Ir$_2$O, respectively. We find\nthat all three superconductors, exhibit high upper-critical fields.\nParticularly noteworthy is Ti$_4$Ir$_2$O with an upper critical field of $\\mu_0\nH_{\\rm c2}{\\rm (0)}$ =~16.06~T, which exceeds by far the weak-coupling Pauli\nlimit of 9.86~T. The role of the void filling light atom X has so far been\nuncertain for the overall physical properties of these materials. Herein, we\nhave successfully grown single crystals of Ti$_2$Co. In contrast to the\nmetallic $\\eta$-carbide type suboxides Ti$_4$M$_2$O, we find that Ti$_2$Co\ndisplays a semimetallic behavior. Hence, the octahedral void-filling oxygen\nplays a crucial role for the overall physical properties, even though its\neffect on the crystal structure is small. Our results indicate that the design\nof new superconductors by incorporation of electron-acceptor atoms may in the\nTi$_2$Ni-type structures and other materials with crystallographic void\nposition be a promising future approach. The remarkably high upper critical\nfields, in this family of compounds, may furthermore spark significant future\ninterest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 12:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-25"}

Deviant executions of a\nbusiness process include those that violate compliance rules, or executions\nthat undershoot or exceed performance targets. Deviance mining is concerned\nwith uncovering the reasons for deviant executions by analyzing event logs\nstored by the systems supporting the execution of a business process. In this\npaper, the problem of explaining deviations in business processes is first\ninvestigated by using features based on sequential and declarative patterns,\nand a combination of them. Then, the explanations are further improved by\nleveraging the data attributes of events and traces in event logs through\nfeatures based on pure data attribute values and data-aware declarative rules.\nThe explanations characterizing the deviances are then extracted by direct and\nindirect methods for rule induction. Using real-life logs from multiple\ndomains, a range of feature types and different forms of decision rules are\nevaluated in terms of their ability to accurately discriminate between\nnon-deviant and deviant executions of a process as well as in terms of\nunderstandability of the final outcome returned to the users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 12:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-25"}

The evolutionary stage of FS CMa is still\ndebated. Perpendicular to the circumstellar disk, a bipolar outflow was\ndetected. Infrared aperture-synthesis imaging provides us with a unique\nopportunity to study the disk structure. Aims: Our aim is to study the\nintensity distribution of the disk of FS CMa in the mid-infrared L and N bands.\nMethods: We performed aperture-synthesis imaging of FS CMa with the MATISSE\ninstrument (Multi AperTure mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment) in the low\nspectral resolution mode to obtain images in the L and N bands. We computed\nradiative transfer models that reproduce the L- and N-band intensity\ndistributions of the resolved disks. Results: We present L- and N-band\naperture-synthesis images of FS CMa reconstructed in the wavelength bands of\n3.4-3.8 and 8.6-9.0 micrometer. In the L-band image, the inner rim region of an\ninclined circumstellar disk and the central object can be seen with a spatial\nresolution of 2.7 milliarcsec (mas). An inner disk cavity with an angular\ndiameter of 6x12mas is resolved. The L-band disk consists of a bright\nnorthwestern (NW) disk region and a much fainter southeastern (SE) region. The\nimages suggest that we are looking at the bright inner wall of the NW disk rim,\nwhich is on the far side of the disk. In the N band, only the bright NW disk\nregion is seen. In addition to deriving the inclination and the inner disk\nradius, fitting the reconstructed brightness distributions via radiative\ntransfer modeling allows one to constrain the innermost disk structure, in\nparticular the shape of the inner disk rim.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 12:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

One of the main queries on such models is to identify\nthe extremum of this joint function. This is known as the Weighted Constraint\nSatisfaction Problem (WCSP) on deterministic Cost Function Networks and as\nMaximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference on stochastic Markov Random Fields.\nAlgorithms for approximate WCSP inference typically rely on local consistency\nalgorithms or belief propagation. These methods are intimately related to\nlinear programming (LP) relaxations and often coupled with reparametrizations\ndefined by the dual solution of the associated LP. Since the seminal work of\nGoemans and Williamson, it is well understood that convex SDP relaxations can\nprovide superior guarantees to LP. But the inherent computational cost of\ninterior point methods has limited their application. The situation has\nimproved with the introduction of non-convex Burer-Monteiro style methods which\nare well suited to handle the SDP relaxation of combinatorial problems with\nbinary variables (such as MAXCUT, MaxSAT or MAP/Ising). We compute low rank SDP\nupper and lower bounds for discrete pairwise graphical models with arbitrary\nnumber of values and arbitrary binary cost functions by extending a\nBurer-Monteiro style method based on row-by-row updates.

A major challenge with this course\nis that there is a large spread in the students' incoming physics preparation,\nand this level of preparation is strongly predictive of a students'\nperformance. The level of incoming preparation is also largely determined by a\nstudent's educational privilege, and so this course can amplify inequities in\nK-12 education and provide a barrier to a STEM career for students from\nmarginalized groups. Here, we present a novel introductory course design to\naddress such equity challenges in physics 1. We designed the course based on\nthe concept of deliberate practice to give students targeted, scaffolded, and\nrepeated opportunities to engage in research-identified practices and decisions\nrequired for effective problem-solving. We used real-world problems, as they\ncarry less resemblance to physics high school problems, and so even the\nstudents with the best high school physics instruction have little experience\nor skill in solving them. The students learned the physics content knowledge\nthey needed in future courses, particularly in engineering, and their\nproblem-solving skills improved substantially. Furthermore, the success in the\ncourse was not correlated with incoming physics preparation, in stark contrast\nto the outcomes from traditional physics 1 courses. These findings suggest that\nwe made physics 1 more equitable by employing a deliberate practice approach in\nthe context of real-world problem-solving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 14:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-25"}

The network\nis trained with data from three different numerical simulations of turbulent\nconvection, and we introduced a coherence spectrum to assess the horizontal\nvelocity fields that were derived at each spatial scale. The multi-scale deep\nlearning method successfully predicts the horizontal velocities for each\nconvection simulation in terms of the global-correlation-coefficient, which is\noften used for evaluating the prediction accuracy of the methods.

We tackle this problem in the context of\ncross-domain medical image segmentation. Under this scenario, domain shifts are\nmainly caused by different acquisition processes. We propose a simple\ncausality-inspired data augmentation approach to expose a segmentation model to\nsynthesized domain-shifted training examples. Specifically, 1) to make the deep\nmodel robust to discrepancies in image intensities and textures, we employ a\nfamily of randomly-weighted shallow networks. They augment training images\nusing diverse appearance transformations. 2) Further we show that spurious\ncorrelations among objects in an image are detrimental to domain robustness.\nThese correlations might be taken by the network as domain-specific clues for\nmaking predictions, and they may break on unseen domains. We remove these\nspurious correlations via causal intervention. This is achieved by resampling\nthe appearances of potentially correlated objects independently. The proposed\napproach is validated on three cross-domain segmentation tasks: cross-modality\n(CT-MRI) abdominal image segmentation, cross-sequence (bSSFP-LGE) cardiac MRI\nsegmentation, and cross-center prostate MRI segmentation.

However,\nwhether it is possible to build a generic MLP-Like architecture on video domain\nhas not been explored, due to complex spatial-temporal modeling with large\ncomputation burden. To fill this gap, we present an efficient self-attention\nfree backbone, namely MorphMLP, which flexibly leverages the concise\nFully-Connected (FC) layer for video representation learning. Specifically, a\nMorphMLP block consists of two key layers in sequence, i.e., MorphFC_s and\nMorphFC_t, for spatial and temporal modeling respectively. MorphFC_s can\neffectively capture core semantics in each frame, by progressive token\ninteraction along both height and width dimensions. Alternatively, MorphFC_t\ncan adaptively learn long-term dependency over frames, by temporal token\naggregation on each spatial location. With such multi-dimension and multi-scale\nfactorization, our MorphMLP block can achieve a great accuracy-computation\nbalance. Finally, we evaluate our MorphMLP on a number of popular video\nbenchmarks. Compared with the recent state-of-the-art models, MorphMLP\nsignificantly reduces computation but with better accuracy, e.g., MorphMLP-S\nonly uses 50% GFLOPs of VideoSwin-T but achieves 0.9% top-1 improvement on\nKinetics400, under ImageNet1K pretraining. MorphMLP-B only uses 43% GFLOPs of\nMViT-B but achieves 2.4% top-1 improvement on SSV2, even though MorphMLP-B is\npretrained on ImageNet1K while MViT-B is pretrained on Kinetics400.

Measures specifically\ndesigned to take into account the binaural properties of the signal are often\nintrusive - characterised by requiring access to a clean speech signal - and\ntypically rely on combining both channels into a single-channel signal before\nmaking predictions. This paper proposes a non-intrusive SI measure that\ncomputes features from a binaural input signal using a combination of vector\nquantization (VQ) and contrastive predictive coding (CPC) methods. VQ-CPC\nfeature extraction does not rely on any model of the auditory system and is\ninstead trained to maximise the mutual information between the input signal and\noutput features. The computed VQ-CPC features are input to a predicting\nfunction parameterized by a neural network. Two predicting functions are\nconsidered in this paper. Both feature extractor and predicting functions are\ntrained on simulated binaural signals with isotropic noise. They are tested on\nsimulated signals with isotropic and real noise. For all signals, the ground\ntruth scores are the (intrusive) deterministic binaural STOI.

In this paper, we will extend the projective robustness to\nany convex resource theories of quantum channels and measurements. First, We\nintroduce the projective robustness of quantum channels and prove that it\nsatisfies some good properties, especially sub- or supermultiplicativity under\nany free quantum process. Moreover, we use the projective robustness of\nchannels to give lower bounds on the errors and overheads in any channel\nresource distillation. Meanwhile, we show that the projective robustness of\nchannels quantifies the maximal advantage that a given channel outperforms all\nfree channels in simultaneous discrimination and exclusion of a fixed state\nensemble. Second, we define the projective robustness of quantum measurements\nand prove that it exactly quantifies the maximal advantage that a given\nmeasurement provides over all free measurements in simultaneous discrimination\nand exclusion of two fixed state ensembles. Finally, within a specific channel\nresource setting based on measurement incompatibility, we show that the\nprojective robustness of quantum channels coincides with the projective\nrobustness of measurement incompatibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 13:52:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

Although system models are typically used for\nsimulation over a finite time, most of the metrics (and pseudo-metrics) used\nfor model accuracy assessment consider asymptotic behavior e.g., Hankel\nsingular values and Kullback-Leibler(KL) rate metric. These metrics could\nfurther be used for model order reduction. Hence, in this paper, we propose a\ngeneralization of KL divergence-based metric called n-step KL rate metric,\nwhich could be used to compare models over a finite time horizon. We then\ndemonstrate that the asymptotic metrics for comparing dynamical systems may not\naccurately assess the model prediction uncertainties over a finite time\nhorizon. Motivated by this finite time analysis, we propose a new pragmatic\napproach to compute the influence of a subset of states on a combination of\nstates called information transfer (IT). Model reduction typically involves the\nremoval or truncation of states. IT combines the concepts from the n-step KL\nrate metric and model reduction. Finally, we demonstrate the application of\ninformation transfer for model reduction.

In this work, we\ndemonstrate several objective tests of images output by two popular GAN\narchitectures. We designed several stochastic context models (SCMs) of distinct\nimage features that can be recovered after generation by a trained GAN. Several\nof these features are high-order, algorithmic pixel-arrangement rules which are\nnot readily expressed in covariance matrices. We designed and validated\nstatistical classifiers to detect specific effects of the known arrangement\nrules. We then tested the rates at which two different GANs correctly\nreproduced the feature context under a variety of training scenarios, and\ndegrees of feature-class similarity. We found that ensembles of generated\nimages can appear largely accurate visually, and show high accuracy in ensemble\nmeasures, while not exhibiting the known spatial arrangements. Furthermore,\nGANs trained on a spectrum of distinct spatial orders did not respect the given\nprevalence of those orders in the training data.

This is primarily due to effective token mixing through self\nattention. However, this scales quadratically with the number of pixels, which\nbecomes infeasible for high-resolution inputs. To cope with this challenge, we\npropose Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (AFNO) as an efficient token mixer\nthat learns to mix in the Fourier domain. AFNO is based on a principled\nfoundation of operator learning which allows us to frame token mixing as a\ncontinuous global convolution without any dependence on the input resolution.\nThis principle was previously used to design FNO, which solves global\nconvolution efficiently in the Fourier domain and has shown promise in learning\nchallenging PDEs. To handle challenges in visual representation learning such\nas discontinuities in images and high resolution inputs, we propose principled\narchitectural modifications to FNO which results in memory and computational\nefficiency. This includes imposing a block-diagonal structure on the channel\nmixing weights, adaptively sharing weights across tokens, and sparsifying the\nfrequency modes via soft-thresholding and shrinkage. The resulting model is\nhighly parallel with a quasi-linear complexity and has linear memory in the\nsequence size.

Currently, customer service robots tend to be digital and\nemulate social interactions through on-screen text, but state-of-the-art\nresearch points towards physical robots soon providing customer service in\nperson. This article explores two possibilities. Firstly, whether transfer\nlearning can aid in the improvement of customer service chatbots between\nbusiness domains. Second, the implementation of a framework for physical robots\nfor in-person interaction. Modelled on social interaction with Twitter customer\nsupport accounts, transformer-based chatbot models are initially assigned to\nlearn one domain from an initial random weight distribution. Given shared\nvocabulary, each model is then tasked with learning another domain by\ntransferring knowledge from the previous. Following studies on 19 different\nbusinesses, results show that the majority of models are improved when\ntransferring weights from at least one other domain, in particular those that\nare more data-scarce than others. General language transfer learning occurs, as\nwell as higher-level transfer of similar domain knowledge, in several cases.\nThe chatbots are finally implemented on Temi and Pepper robots, with\nfeasibility issues encountered and solutions are proposed to overcome them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:26:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 20:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

The calibration results reveal\na strong indication for stochastic volatility, low jump frequency and evidence\nof infinite activity. Short-dated options are less sensitive to volatility or\nGamma hedges. For longer-dated options, tail risk is consistently reduced by\nmultiple-instrument hedges, in particular by employing complete market models\nwith stochastic volatility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 22:46:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 11:56:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 11:17:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

For the near,\nmiddle and far zones the corresponding expressions are found for the scalar and\nvector potentials, as well as for the electric and magnetic fields. Then these\nexpressions are assessed for correspondence to the Laplace equations for\npotentials and fields. One of the purposes is to test the truth of the\nassumption that the scalar potential and the electric field depend neither on\nthe value of the angular velocity of rotation of the sphere nor on the\ndirection to the point where the field is measured. However, calculations show\nthat potentials and fields increase as the observation point gets closer to the\nsphere's equator and to the sphere's surface, compared with the case for a\nstationary sphere. In this case, additions are proportional to the square of\nthe angular velocity of rotation, the square of the sphere's radius and\ninversely proportional to the square of the speed of light. The largest found\nrelative increase in potentials and fields could reach the value of 4% for the\nrapidly rotating neutron star PSR J1614-2230, if the star were charged. For a\nproton, a similar increase in fields on its surface near the equator reaches\n54%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}
