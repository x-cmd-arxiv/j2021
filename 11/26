In\nthis work, we investigate local and global information modelling in\ntransformers by presenting a novel isotropic architecture that adopts local\nwindows and special tokens, called Super tokens, for self-attention.\nSpecifically, a single Super token is assigned to each image window which\ncaptures the rich local details for that window.

Significant progress\nwas recently made to understand the onset of self-propulsion and non-linear\ndynamics. Yet, most models ignore a fundamental experimental feature, namely\nthe spatial confinement of the colloid, and its effect on propulsion. In this\nwork, the self-propulsion of an isotropic colloid inside a capillary tube is\ninvestigated numerically. A flexible computational framework is proposed based\non a finite-volume approach on adaptative octree-grids and embedded boundary\nmethods. This method is able to account for complex geometric confinement, the\nnonlinear coupling of chemical transport and flow fields, and the precise\nresolution of the surface boundary conditions, that drive the system's\ndynamics. Somewhat counter-intuitively, spatial confinement promotes the\ncolloid's spontaneous motion by reducing the minimum advection-to-diffusion\nratio or P\\'clet number, Pe, required to self-propel; furthermore,\nself-propulsion velocities are significantly modified as the\ncolloid-to-capillary size ratio $\\kappa$ is increased, reaching a maximum at\nfixed Pe for an optimal confinement $0<\\kappa<1$. These properties stem from a\nfundamental change in the dominant chemical transport mechanism with respect to\nthe unbounded problem : with diffusion now restricted in most directions by the\nconfining walls, the excess solute is predominantly convected away downstream\nfrom the colloid, enhancing front-back concentration contrasts.

Recently, it has been shown that the trajectories of iterative\noptimization algorithms can possess fractal structures, and their\ngeneralization error can be formally linked to the complexity of such fractals.\nThis complexity is measured by the fractal's intrinsic dimension, a quantity\nusually much smaller than the number of parameters in the network. Even though\nthis perspective provides an explanation for why overparametrized networks\nwould not overfit, computing the intrinsic dimension (e.g., for monitoring\ngeneralization during training) is a notoriously difficult task, where existing\nmethods typically fail even in moderate ambient dimensions. In this study, we\nconsider this problem from the lens of topological data analysis (TDA) and\ndevelop a generic computational tool that is built on rigorous mathematical\nfoundations. By making a novel connection between learning theory and TDA, we\nfirst illustrate that the generalization error can be equivalently bounded in\nterms of a notion called the 'persistent homology dimension' (PHD), where,\ncompared with prior work, our approach does not require any additional\ngeometrical or statistical assumptions on the training dynamics.

Our experiments show that the proposed approach can efficiently\ncompute a network's intrinsic dimension in a variety of settings, which is\npredictive of the generalization error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 17:06:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

The models are controlled by free\nparameters that are typically estimated from data by maximum-likelihood\nestimation or approximations thereof. However, when faced with real-world\ndatasets many of the models run into a critical issue: they are formulated in\nterms of fully-observed data, whereas in practice the datasets are plagued with\nmissing data. The theory of statistical model estimation from incomplete data\nis conceptually similar to the estimation of latent-variable models, where\npowerful tools such as variational inference (VI) exist. However, in contrast\nto standard latent-variable models, parameter estimation with incomplete data\noften requires estimating exponentially-many conditional distributions of the\nmissing variables, hence making standard VI methods intractable. We address\nthis gap by introducing variational Gibbs inference (VGI), a new\ngeneral-purpose method to estimate the parameters of statistical models from\nincomplete data. We validate VGI on a set of synthetic and real-world\nestimation tasks, estimating important machine learning models such as VAEs and\nnormalising flows from incomplete data.

We present two\nnovel computational methods for analyzing striped patterns in pedestrian data:\n(i) an edge-cutting algorithm, which detects the dynamic formation of stripes\nand allows us to measure local properties of individual stripes; and (ii) a\npattern-matching technique, based on the Gabor function, which allows us to\nestimate global properties (orientation and wavelength) of the striped pattern\nat a time T. We find an invariant property: stripes in the two groups are\nparallel and perpendicular to the bisector at all crossing angles. In contrast,\nother properties depend on the crossing angle: stripe spacing (wavelength),\nstripe size (number of pedestrians per stripe), and crossing time all decrease\nas the crossing angle increases from 30{\\deg} to 180{\\deg}, whereas the number\nof stripes increases with crossing angle. We also observe that the width of\nindividual stripes is dynamically squeezed as the two groups cross each other.\nThe findings thus support the bisector hypothesis at a wide range of crossing\nangles, although the theoretical reasons for this invariant remain unclear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 17:53:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 15:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

These feature\nextractors usually operate on video frames sampled at a fixed frame rate and\nare often trained on image/video understanding tasks, without adaption to video\ncaptioning data. In this work, we present SwinBERT, an end-to-end\ntransformer-based model for video captioning, which takes video frame patches\ndirectly as inputs, and outputs a natural language description. Instead of\nleveraging multiple 2D/3D feature extractors, our method adopts a video\ntransformer to encode spatial-temporal representations that can adapt to\nvariable lengths of video input without dedicated design for different frame\nrates. Based on this model architecture, we show that video captioning can\nbenefit significantly from more densely sampled video frames as opposed to\nprevious successes with sparsely sampled video frames for video-and-language\nunderstanding tasks (e.g., video question answering). Moreover, to avoid the\ninherent redundancy in consecutive video frames, we propose adaptively learning\na sparse attention mask and optimizing it for task-specific performance\nimprovement through better long-range video sequence modeling. Through\nextensive experiments on 5 video captioning datasets, we show that SwinBERT\nachieves across-the-board performance improvements over previous methods, often\nby a large margin.

In terms of privacy, SEP is\nmore tractable than EP because at each refining step of a factor, the remaining\nfactors are fixed and do not depend on other datapoints as in EP, which makes\nthe sensitivity analysis straightforward. We provide a theoretical analysis of\nthe privacy-accuracy trade-off in the posterior estimates under our method,\ncalled differentially private stochastic expectation propagation (DP-SEP).\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the performance of our DP-SEP algorithm evaluated\non both synthetic and real-world datasets in terms of the quality of posterior\nestimates at different levels of guaranteed privacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 18:59:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 17:25:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 04:33:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 22:36:20 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 18:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

Performing\nsuch optimization, however, is traditionally quite costly, as it involves a\ncomplete forward and backward pass through the network for each gradient step.\nIn a separate line of work, a recent thread of research has developed the deep\nequilibrium (DEQ) model, a class of models that foregoes traditional network\ndepth and instead computes the output of a network by finding the fixed point\nof a single nonlinear layer. In this paper, we show that there is a natural\nsynergy between these two settings.

Due to the random nature of the interaction with the hot\nreservoir, fluctuations in ergotropy, heat, and work are present, shrinking\nwith the size of the qudits in the hot reservoir. While the mean, \"macroscopic\"\nefficiency of the Otto engine is the same as in the case in which the hot\nreservoir is a thermal one, the distribution of efficiencies does not support\nfinite moments, so that the mean of efficiencies does not coincide with the\nmacroscopic efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 20:02:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

Model reduction offers a variety of\ncomputational tools that seek to reduce this computational burden. In\nparticular, balanced truncation is a system-theoretic approach to model\nreduction which obtains an efficient reduced-dimension dynamical system by\nprojecting the system operators onto state directions which trade off the\nreachability and observability of state directions as expressed through the\nassociated Gramians.

The simulation of contaminant transport\ncan however prove to be computationally expensive especially if the porous\nmedium is discretized into high-resolution grid blocks. We propose an interwell\nsimulation model for advection dispersion equations (ISADE) to predict the\nconcentration of contaminant observed at the pumping well. This method\ncomprises of two main steps. Initially, the model divides the aquifer or\nreservoir into a series of 1D injector-producer pairs and uses the historical\ncontaminant observation data to estimate five major unknowns in each of these\ncontrol volumes: the interwell connectivity, the pore volume, the volumetric\nflowrate at the grid face, the dispersion coefficient, and the number of grids\nin each control volume. Finally, once the history matching process is complete,\nthe estimated variables are used to predict the concentration of contaminant\nobserved at the wells. Five example cases were studied and the results show\nthat the ISADE model was able to predict with reasonable accuracy the\nconcentration of contaminant observed. Furthermore, the model can easily handle\nchanges in input parameters such as the concentration of contaminants released\nin the aquifer, and the injection and production rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 21:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

We demonstrate, both theoretically and\nexperimentally, that this nonlinear interaction can be harnessed for useful\nexpansion of the soliton frequency comb via the formation of a secondary idler\ncomb. We explore the physics of the process, showing that the phase detuning of\nthe injected probe from a cavity resonance plays a key role in setting the\ncentral frequency of the idler comb, thus providing a convenient parameter\nthrough which to control the spectral envelope of that comb. Our results\nelucidate the dynamics that govern the interactions between dissipative Kerr\ncavity solitons and externally injected probe waves, and could prove useful in\nthe design of future Kerr frequency comb systems by enabling the possibility to\nprovide high-power comb lines in a specified spectral region simply through the\ninjection of a suitably chosen probe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 23:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

The noise generated by the subenvironment is spatially\nnon-local and non-Gaussian and cannot be characterized by the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem. We describe this model by simulating the\ndynamics of a two-level system (TLS) that interacts with a subenvironment\nconsisting of a one-dimensional $XXZ$ spin chain. The hierarchical\nSchr\\\"odinger equations of motion are employed to describe the quantum\nthermostat, allowing time-irreversible simulations of the dynamics at arbitrary\ntemperature.

In this work, the respective\nroles of high oxygen pressure and heterogeneous interface in triggering ReNiO3\nthin films growth at metastable state are revealed. The ReNiO3 (Re:Nd, Sm, Eu,\nGd, and Dy) heterogeneous thin films growth on LaAlO3 single crystal substrate\nhave an effective crystallization at atmosphere without the necessity to apply\nhigh oxygen pressures, suggesting the interfacial bonding between the ReNiO3\nand substrates can sufficiently reduce the positive Gibbs formation energy of\nReNiO3, which is further verified by the first principles calculations.\nNevertheless, the abrupt electronic transitions only appear in ReNiO3 thin\nfilms grown at high oxygen pressures, in which cases the oxygen vacancies are\neffectively eliminated via high oxygen pressure reactions as indicated by near\nedge X ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS).

However, CDTW\nuses a crude step function, allowing unconstrained flexibility within the\nwindow, and none beyond it. WDTW's multiplicative weight is relative to the\ndistances between aligned points along a warped path, rather than being a\ndirect function of the amount of warping that is introduced. In this paper, we\nintroduce Amerced Dynamic Time Warping (ADTW), a new, intuitive, DTW variant\nthat penalizes the act of warping by a fixed additive cost.

When the number of evacuees decreases, the operation costs can be\nreduced by moving the remaining evacuees to other shelters and closing shelters\nas quickly as possible. On the other hand, relocation between shelters imposes\na huge emotional burden on evacuees. In this study, we formulate the\n\"Evacuation Shelter Scheduling Problem,\" which allocates evacuees to shelters\nin such a way to minimize the movement costs of the evacuees and the operation\ncosts of the shelters. Since it is difficult to solve this quadratic\nprogramming problem directly, we show its transformation into a 0-1 integer\nprogramming problem. In addition, such a formulation struggles to calculate the\nburden of relocating them from historical data because no payments are actually\nmade.

To address these\nchallenges, many recent attempts have been made to repair DNNs for version\nupdates under practical operational contexts by updating weights (i.e., network\nparameters) through retraining, fine-tuning, or direct weight fixing at a\nneural level. In this work, as the first attempt, we initiate to repair DNNs by\njointly optimizing the architecture and weights at a higher (i.e., block)\nlevel.\n  We first perform empirical studies to investigate the limitation of whole\nnetwork-level and layer-level repairing, which motivates us to explore a novel\nrepairing direction for DNN repair at the block level. To this end, we first\npropose adversarial-aware spectrum analysis for vulnerable block localization\nthat considers the neurons' status and weights' gradients in blocks during the\nforward and backward processes, which enables more accurate candidate block\nlocalization for repairing even under a few examples. Then, we further propose\nthe architecture-oriented search-based repairing that relaxes the targeted\nblock to a continuous repairing search space at higher deep feature levels. By\njointly optimizing the architecture and weights in that space, we can identify\na much better block architecture.

Random Matrix Theory (RMT) provides an emerging way to this end:\nspectral analysis of large random matrices involved in a trained deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) such as weight matrices or Hessian matrices with respect to the\nstochastic gradient descent algorithm. To have more comprehensive understanding\nof weight matrices spectra, we conduct extensive experiments on weight matrices\nin different modules, e.g., layers, networks and data sets. Following the\nprevious work of \\cite{martin2018implicit}, we classify the spectra in the\nterminal stage into three main types: Light Tail (LT), Bulk Transition period\n(BT) and Heavy Tail(HT). These different types, especially HT, implicitly\nindicate some regularization in the DNNs. A main contribution from the paper is\nthat we identify the difficulty of the classification problem as a driving\nfactor for the appearance of heavy tail in weight matrices spectra. Higher the\nclassification difficulty, higher the chance for HT to appear. Moreover, the\nclassification difficulty can be affected by the signal-to-noise ratio of the\ndataset, or by the complexity of the classification problem (complex features,\nlarge number of classes) as well. Leveraging on this finding, we further\npropose a spectral criterion to detect the appearance of heavy tails and use it\nto early stop the training process without testing data. Such early stopped\nDNNs have the merit of avoiding overfitting and unnecessary extra training\nwhile preserving a much comparable generalization ability.

Most of them exploit single visual cues of\ntabular elements or simply combine visual cues with other modalities via early\nfusion to reason their graph relationships. However, neither early fusion nor\nindividually reasoning in terms of multiple modalities can be appropriate for\nall varieties of table structures with great diversity. Instead, different\nmodalities are expected to collaborate with each other in different patterns\nfor different table cases. In the community, the importance of intra-inter\nmodality interactions for table structure reasoning is still unexplored. In\nthis paper, we define it as heterogeneous table structure recognition\n(Hetero-TSR) problem. With the aim of filling this gap, we present a novel\nNeural Collaborative Graph Machines (NCGM) equipped with stacked collaborative\nblocks, which alternatively extracts intra-modality context and models\ninter-modality interactions in a hierarchical way.

We explore the interaction scenario of such Type Ibn SNe by performing\nradiation-hydrodynamics and radiative-transfer calculations. We find that\nstandard-energy helium-star explosions within dense wind-like circumstellar\nmaterial (CSM) can reach on day timescales a peak luminosity of a few 10^44\nerg/s, reminiscent of exceptional events like AT2018cow. Similar interactions\nbut with weaker winds can lead to Type Ibc SNe with double-peak light curves\nand peak luminosities in the range ~10^42.2 to ~10^43 erg/s. In contrast, the\nnarrow spectral lines and modest peak luminosities of most Type Ibn SNe are\nsuggestive of a low-energy explosion in an initially <~5 Msun helium star, most\nlikely arising from interacting binaries, and colliding with a massive\nhelium-rich, probably ejecta-like, CSM at ~10^15 cm. Nonlocal thermodynamic\nequilibrium radiative-transfer simulations of a slow-moving dense shell born\nout and powered by the interaction compare favorably to Type Ibn SNe like\n2006jc, 2011hw, or 2018bcc at late times and suggest a composition made of\nabout 50% helium, a solar metallicity, and a total ejecta/CSM mass of 1-2Msun.\nA lower fractional helium abundance leads to weak or absent HeI lines and thus\nexcludes more massive configurations for observed Type Ibn SNe. Further, the\ndominance of FeII emission below 5500A seen in Type Ibn SNe at late times is\nnot predicted at low metallicity. Hence, despite their promising properties,\nType Ibn SNe from pulsational-pair instability in very massive stars, which\nrequires low metallicity, have probably not yet been observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 08:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Capturing the intra-modality and cross-modality information of\nmultimodal data is the essential capability of multimodal learning methods. The\ngeometry-aware data analysis approaches provide these capabilities by\nimplicitly representing data in various modalities based on their geometric\nunderlying structures. Also, in many applications, data are explicitly defined\non an intrinsic geometric structure. Generalizing deep learning methods to the\nnon-Euclidean domains is an emerging research field, which has recently been\ninvestigated in many studies. Most of those popular methods are developed for\nunimodal data. In this paper, a multimodal multi-scaled graph wavelet\nconvolutional network (M-GWCN) is proposed as an end-to-end network. M-GWCN\nsimultaneously finds intra-modality representation by applying the multiscale\ngraph wavelet transform to provide helpful localization properties in the graph\ndomain of each modality, and cross-modality representation by learning\npermutations that encode correlations among various modalities. M-GWCN is not\nlimited to either the homogeneous modalities with the same number of data, or\nany prior knowledge indicating correspondences between modalities. Several\nsemi-supervised node classification experiments have been conducted on three\npopular unimodal explicit graph-based datasets and five multimodal implicit\nones. The experimental results indicate the superiority and effectiveness of\nthe proposed methods compared with both spectral graph domain convolutional\nneural networks and state-of-the-art multimodal methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 08:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

The ductility\nindex of both Ni-Fe-Mn-Al and Ni-Fe-Mn-In ribbons are within the range of\nintermetallic materials. The substitution of In by Al allows to increase very\nslightly the ductility index, which can reach 0.75. The fine equiaxed grains\nshow better tensile resistance than the elongated grains in 3-points bending\ntest. The substitution of In by Al improves the maximum bending strain by a\nfactor of 3. The maximum strain for Ni-Fe-Mn-Al as-spun ribbons can reach 3 %\nbefore fracture. Fractography shows that the intergranular fracture is the main\ndamage mechanism in these as-spun ribbons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 10:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

Rival preferences refer to the adversarial ranking\nprocess: (1) the ranker thinks no difference between the desired image and the\ninput image in terms of the desired attributes; (2) the generator fools the\nranker to believe that the desired image changes the attributes over the input\nimage as desired. RAs over pairs of real images are introduced to guide the\nranker to rank image pairs regarding the interested attributes only.

A simulation model was developed to assess ASF spread over the\ncommercial swine network in France. The model was designed from raw movement\ndata and actual farm characteristics. A metapopulation approach was used, with\ntransmission processes at the herd level potentially leading, through a\nreaction-diffusion process, to external spread to epidemiologically connected\nherds. Three transmission routes were considered: local transmission (e.g.\nfomites, material exchange), movement of animals from infected to susceptible\nsites, and transit of trucks without physical animal exchange. Surveillance was\nbased on prevalence and mortality detection thresholds, which triggered control\nmeasures based on movement ban for detected herds and epidemiologically related\nherds. The time from infection to detection varied between 8 and 21 days,\ndepending on the detection criteria, but was also dependent on the types of\nherds in which the infection was introduced. Movement restrictions effectively\nreduced the transmission between herds, but local transmission was nevertheless\nobserved in higher proportions highlighting the need of global awareness of all\nactors of the swine industry to mitigate the risk of local spread.

However, in real scenarios,\nconfounders are typically diverse and difficult to be identified. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Confounder Identification-free Causal Visual Feature\nLearning (CICF) method, which obviates the need for identifying confounders.\nCICF models the interventions among different samples based on front-door\ncriterion, and then approximates the global-scope intervening effect upon the\ninstance-level interventions from the perspective of optimization. In this way,\nwe aim to find a reliable optimization direction, which avoids the intervening\neffects of confounders, to learn causal features. Furthermore, we uncover the\nrelation between CICF and the popular meta-learning strategy MAML, and provide\nan interpretation of why MAML works from the theoretical perspective of causal\nlearning for the first time.

Their dynamics are known to be affected by target\nwaves and external gradients. When the core of two spirals come very close to\neach other, they could either repel or attract, depending on their relative\nchirality and the distance separating them. Multiple pairs of spiral waves, in\nclose vicinity, could alter the paths of the individual rotors. A single spiral\ncore, will be influenced most by the rotor closest to it, or linked to it by a\ncommon wave. If within a limiting distance, they would attract each other, and\nannihilate. Else, they will push each other away, until they reach a critical\ndistance, beyond which, all interactions seem to cease.

The rotation of the plane of wave propagation away from the\nvertical plane of the magnetic field pushes the plasma displacement vector away\nfrom horizontal, thereby coupling it to stratification.

These algorithms aim to find approximate solutions to quantum\nproblems by optimizing a parametrized quantum circuit using a classical\noptimization algorithm. A successful VQA requires fast and reliable classical\noptimization algorithms. Understanding and optimizing how off-the-shelf\noptimization methods perform in this context is important for the future of the\nfield. In this work, we study the performance of four commonly used\ngradient-free optimization methods: SLSQP, COBYLA, CMA-ES, and SPSA, at finding\nground-state energies of a range of small chemistry and material science\nproblems. We test a telescoping sampling scheme (where the accuracy of the\ncost-function estimate provided to the optimizer is increased as the\noptimization converges) on all methods, demonstrating mixed results across our\nrange of optimizers and problems chosen. We further hyperparameter tune two of\nthe four optimizers (CMA-ES and SPSA) across a large range of models and\ndemonstrate that with appropriate hyperparameter tuning, CMA-ES is competitive\nwith and sometimes outperforms SPSA (which is not observed in the absence of\nhyperparameter tuning). Finally, we investigate the ability of an optimizer to\nbeat the `sampling noise floor' given by the sampling noise on each\ncost-function estimate provided to the optimizer. Our results demonstrate the\nnecessity for tailoring and hyperparameter-tuning known optimization techniques\nfor inherently-noisy variational quantum algorithms and that the variational\nlandscape that one finds in a VQA is highly problem- and system-dependent.

Consequently, the\nattention mechanism strongly depends on the local information of a single input\nfeature map and does not incorporate relatively semantically-richer contextual\ninformation available at higher layers that can specify \"what and where to\nlook\" in lower-level feature maps through top-down information flow.\n  Accordingly, in this work, we propose a lightweight top-down attention module\n(TDAM) that iteratively generates a \"visual searchlight\" to perform channel and\nspatial modulation of its inputs and outputs more contextually-relevant feature\nmaps at each computation step. Our experiments indicate that TDAM enhances the\nperformance of CNNs across multiple object-recognition benchmarks and\noutperforms prominent attention modules while being more parameter and memory\nefficient. Further, TDAM-based models learn to \"shift attention\" by localizing\nindividual objects or features at each computation step without any explicit\nsupervision resulting in a 5% improvement for ResNet50 on weakly-supervised\nobject localization.

If we neglect\nthe displacement of waves, the $q$- and $p$-space wave phases are opposite each\nother. Since the intensity of the wave in each space is relatively large\nwhenever the wave forms a belly, such a phase difference indicates that\nperiodical intensity exchange between the $q$- and $p$-component waves takes\nplace through their nonstatic evolutions.

Previous\nworks on face recognition either do not employ this valuable information or\nmake use of non-inherently fit quality estimates. In this work, we propose a\nsimple and effective face recognition solution (QMagFace) that combines a\nquality-aware comparison score with a recognition model based on a\nmagnitude-aware angular margin loss. The proposed approach includes\nmodel-specific face image qualities in the comparison process to enhance the\nrecognition performance under unconstrained circumstances. Exploiting the\nlinearity between the qualities and their comparison scores induced by the\nutilized loss, our quality-aware comparison function is simple and highly\ngeneralizable. The experiments conducted on several face recognition databases\nand benchmarks demonstrate that the introduced quality-awareness leads to\nconsistent improvements in the recognition performance. Moreover, the proposed\nQMagFace approach performs especially well under challenging circumstances,\nsuch as cross-pose, cross-age, or cross-quality.

We consider the binary\nsystem which consists of an IMBH with DM minispike and a small black hole\ninspiralling around the IMBH in eccentric orbits. The factors which affect the\nevolution of the orbit include the gravity of the system, the dynamical\nfriction and accretion of the small black hole caused by the DM minispike, and\nthe radiation reaction of gravitational waves (GWs). Using the method of\nosculating orbit, we find that when the semilatus rectum p<<10^5 Rs (Rs is the\nSchwarzschild radius of the IMBH) the dominated factors are the dynamical\nfriction and accretion from the DM minispike, and the radiation reaction.

CoinPrune bootstraps joining nodes via snapshots that are periodically\ncreated from Bitcoin's set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXO set).

This paper considers an edge\ncomputing system where the server and workers have possibly different computing\nand communication capabilities and employ quantization before transmitting\nmessages. To explore the full potential of FL in such an edge computing system,\nwe first present a general FL algorithm, namely GenQSGD, parameterized by the\nnumbers of global and local iterations, mini-batch size, and step size\nsequence. Then, we analyze its convergence for an arbitrary step size sequence\nand specify the convergence results under three commonly adopted step size\nrules, namely the constant, exponential, and diminishing step size rules.

At recall the missing parts are\nfilled in by a PixelCNN, modeling semantic completion, and the completed index\nmatrix is then decoded into a full image by the VQ-VAE.\n  The model is able to complete missing parts of a memory trace in a\nsemantically plausible way up to the point where it can generate plausible\nimages from scratch. Due to the combinatorics in the index matrix, the model\ngeneralizes well to images not trained on. Compression as well as semantic\ncompletion contribute to a strong reduction in memory requirements and\nrobustness to noise. Finally we also model an episodic memory experiment and\ncan reproduce that semantically congruent contexts are always recalled better\nthan incongruent ones, high attention levels improve memory accuracy in both\ncases, and contexts that are not remembered correctly are more often remembered\nsemantically congruently than completely wrong.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 15:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

Then, using a Transformer-based attention mechanism and the cascaded cost\nvolumes, the renderer infers geometry and appearance, and renders detailed\nimages via classical volume rendering techniques. This architecture, in\nparticular, allows sophisticated occlusion reasoning, gathering information\nfrom consistent source views.

As a result, it is found that 1) the arrangement of Ta atoms in\namorphous Ta2O5 strongly resembles that characterizing the high-pressure\nZ-Ta2O5 polymorph, whereas the topological properties of O atoms resembles that\nobserved in delta-Ta2O5; 2) structural correlations in amorphous Ta2O5 start to\nvanish above ~ 5 Angstrom and are completely suppressed for r > 10 Angstrom on\naccount of disorder; 3) Ti substitution retains the short-range topological\nordering characterizing the as prepared Ta2O5 amorphous film even after thermal\ntreatment; conversely, pure Ta2O5 films undergoes a significant rearrangement\nof the local structure after thermal treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 15:49:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

We interpret each point in $P$ as a\nhyperedge that contains each of the covering $\\ell$-subspaces as a vertex.

Several spam\nemail detection methods exist, each of which employs a different algorithm to\ndetect undesired spam emails. But these models are vulnerable to attacks.

To assess the benefits of unlearning over retraining, three\nspam detection models are polluted and exploited by taking attackers' positions\nand proving models' vulnerability. Reduction in accuracy and true positive\nrates are shown in each case showing the effect of pollution on models.

The\nrationale is that the signal fluctuations caused by humans carry the\ninformation of human behavior which can be extracted from the channel state\ninformation of WiFi. Still, the prior studies mainly focus on single-task\nsensing (STS), e.g., gesture recognition, indoor localization, user\nidentification. Since the fluctuations caused by gestures are highly coupling\nwith body features and the user's location, we propose a WiFi-based multi-task\nsensing model (Wimuse) to perform gesture recognition, indoor localization, and\nuser identification tasks simultaneously. However, these tasks have different\ndifficulty levels (i.e., imbalance issue) and need task-specific information\n(i.e., discrepancy issue). To address these issues, the knowledge distillation\ntechnique and task-specific residual adaptor are adopted in Wimuse. We first\ntrain the STS model for each task. Then, for solving the imbalance issue, the\nextracted common feature in Wimuse is encouraged to get close to the\ncounterpart features of the STS models. Further, for each task, a task-specific\nresidual adaptor is applied to extract the task-specific compensation feature\nwhich is fused with the common feature to address the discrepancy issue. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments on three public datasets and evaluation\nsuggests that Wimuse achieves state-of-the-art performance with the average\naccuracy of 85.20%, 98.39%, and 98.725% on the joint task of gesture\nrecognition, indoor localization, and user identification, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 09:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

Most of\nthe detectors extract target addresses' transaction behavior features by random\nwalking or constructing static subgraphs. The random walking\nmethods,unfortunately, usually miss structural information due to limited\nsampling sequence length, while the static subgraph methods tend to ignore\ntemporal features lying in the evolving transaction behaviors. More\nimportantly, their performance undergoes severe degradation when the malicious\nusers intentionally hide phishing behaviors. To address these challenges, we\npropose TEGDetector, a dynamic graph classifier that learns the evolving\nbehavior features from transaction evolution graphs (TEGs). First, we cast the\ntransaction series into multiple time slices, capturing the target address's\ntransaction behaviors in different periods. Then, we provide a fast\nnon-parametric phishing detector to narrow down the search space of suspicious\naddresses. Finally, TEGDetector considers both the spatial and temporal\nevolutions towards a complete characterization of the evolving transaction\nbehaviors. Moreover, TEGDetector utilizes adaptively learnt time coefficient to\npay distinct attention to different periods, which provides several novel\ninsights. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Ethereum transaction dataset\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art detection\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 02:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

Wi-Fi-enabled\nsensor networks (WSNs) are used to gather information from the environment in\nwhich the network operates. Many obstacles prevent wireless sensor networks\nfrom being used in a wide range of fields. This includes maintaining network\nstability and extending network life. In a wireless network, sensors are the\nmost essential component. Sensors are powered by a battery that has a finite\namount of power. The battery is prone to power loss, and the sensor is\ntherefore rendered inoperative as a result. In addition, the growing number of\nsensor nodes off-site affects the network's stability. The transmission and\nreception of information between the sensors and the base consumes the most\nenergy in the sensor. An Intelligent Vice Cluster Head Selection Protocol is\nproposed in this study (IVC LEACH). In order to achieve the best performance\nwith the least amount of energy consumption, the proposed hierarchical protocol\nrelies on a fuzzy logic algorithm using four parameters to calculate the value\nof each node in the network and divides them into three hierarchical levels\nbased on their value. This improves network efficiency and reliability while\nextending network life by 50 percent more than the original Low Energy Adaptive\nClustering Hierarchy protocol\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 10:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

While most previous works in topological\nphotonics have focused on band theory, recent theoretical advances extend the\ntopological concepts to the analysis of scattering matrices and suggest a\ntopological route to complete polarization conversion (CPC), a unique photonic\nphenomenon without an electronic counterpart. Here, we report on the\nexperimental observation of the topological effect in reflection matrices of a\nphotonic crystal slab, enabling CPC between two linear polarizations over a\nwide range of frequencies. Using angle-resolved reflection measurements, we\nobserve CPC occurring at vortex singularities of reflection coefficients in\nmomentum space, verifying the topological nature of CPC. In addition, the\ntopological effect also guarantees the spin-preserved reflection of a\ncircularly polarized wave. Remarkably, we experimentally establish a connection\nbetween two seemingly unrelated topological phenomena--CPC and bound states in\nthe continuum (BICs): BICs lie on the critical coupling curves that define the\ncondition for CPC. Our work paves the way to exploring the topological\nproperties in scattering matrices for controlling light polarization and spin\nand creating robust photonic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 07:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

The aim of this numerical study aims to understand the\noperation of this combustion concept better and present a robust framework for\ndistributed combustion modeling in a parameter range where such operation was\nnot predicted before by any existing theory. Further, liquid fuel combustion\nwas evaluated that brings additional complexity. Four operating conditions were\npresented at which distributed combustion was observed. The reacting flow was\nmodeled by Flamelet-Generated Manifold, based on a detailed n-dodecane\nmechanism. The Zimont turbulent flame speed model was used with significantly\nreduced coefficients to achieve distributed combustion. The droplets of\nairblast atomization were tracked in a Lagrangian frame. The numerical results\nwere validated by Schlieren images and acoustic spectra. It was concluded that\nthe reactant dilution ratio remained below 0.25 through the combustion chamber,\nrevealing that the homogeneous fuel-air mixture is the principal reason for\nexcellent flame stability and ultra-low NOX emission without significant\ninternal recirculation.

But the existing AL methods have two main problems, which make them\nnot well used for event extraction. Firstly, the existing pool-based selection\nstrategies have limitations in terms of computational cost and sample validity.\nSecondly, the existing evaluation of sample importance lacks the use of local\nsample information. In this paper, we present a novel deep AL method for EE. We\npropose a batch-based selection strategy and a Memory-Based Loss Prediction\nmodel (MBLP) to select unlabeled samples efficiently.

In contrast to the principle of local realism, which is the basis of\nclassical reductionism, I have called the principle of non-locality at the\nbasis of a new method of scientific investigation \"synchronic principle\". The\nsynchronic principle introduces a new element in the approach to reality, which\nwith anthropomorphic terms we could call \"conscious choice\". In a synchronic\nparadigm, evolution does not occur in a deterministic way, but is characterized\nby a certain intrinsic freedom of choice that we associate with awareness.\nConsiderations based on the evolution of the universe towards the emergence of\nlife lead us to think that this \"awareness\" also exists in the vacuum state: in\nthe model I proposed a definition of the agents of consciousness in terms of\narrays of correlated qu-bit, from the simplest consisting of 6 qu-bits of the\nquantum vacuum (which result as a superposition of 64 base states), up to the\nmost complex organisms consisting of a very large number of correlated quantum\nbits. Some of the fundamental vacuum states of consciousness can be related to\nknown elementary particles (leptons and quarks) and to fundamental\ninteractions. The rest constitute purely non-local elements of consciousness\nwith no counterpart in terms of wave or particle within the local observation\nlimit. In this model, consciousness processes quantum information through logic\ngates and collapses as a result of observations, like a quantum computer does.\nSynchronicity does not in deny the conclusions reached by traditional science\ncan be used at the local level, but opens scientific knowledge to new\npossibilities, and invites us to look at the world through a different, not\nlocal awareness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 08:03:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 20:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}
