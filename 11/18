This energy\nband is of key importance for multi-messenger and multi-wavelength studies but\nit is nevertheless currently under-explored. AMEGO-X addresses this situation\nby proposing a design capable of detecting and imaging gamma rays via both\nCompton interactions and pair production processes. However, some of the\nobjects that AMEGO-X will study, such as gamma-ray bursts and magnetars, extend\nto energies below ~100 keV where the dominant interaction becomes photoelectric\nabsorption. These events deposit their energy in a single pixel of the\ndetector. In this work we show how the ~3500 cm^2 effective area of the AMEGO-X\ntracker to events between ~25 keV to ~100 keV will be utilized to significantly\nimprove its sensitivity and expand the energy range for transient phenomena.\nAlthough imaging is not possible for single-site events, we show how we will\nlocalize a transient source in the sky using their aggregate signal to within a\nfew degrees. This technique will more than double the number of cosmological\ngamma-ray bursts seen by AMEGO-X, allow us to detect and resolve the pulsating\ntails of extragalactic magnetar giant flares, and increase the number of\ndetected less-energetic magnetar bursts -- some possibly associated with fast\nradio bursts. Overall, single-site events will increase the sensitive energy\nrange, expand the science program, and promptly alert the community of fainter\ntransient events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 16:03:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 17:17:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 17:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

For GPU-accelerated computer vision and deep learning\ntasks, such as the training of image classification models, efficient JPEG\ndecoding is essential due to limitations in memory bandwidth. As many decoder\nimplementations are CPU-based, decoded image data has to be transferred to\naccelerators like GPUs via interconnects such as PCI-E, implying decreased\nthroughput rates. JPEG decoding therefore represents a considerable bottleneck\nin these pipelines. In contrast, efficiency could be vastly increased by\nutilizing a GPU-accelerated decoder. In this case, only compressed data needs\nto be transferred, as decoding will be handled by the accelerators. In order to\ndesign such a GPU-based decoder, the respective algorithms must be parallelized\non a fine-grained level. However, parallel decoding of individual JPEG files\nrepresents a complex task.

Coarse grained accelerators can offer substantial\ndomain acceleration, but manual, ad-hoc identification of code to accelerate is\nprohibitively expensive. Because cycle-accurate simulators and high-level\nsynthesis flows are so time-consuming, manual creation of high-utilization\naccelerators that exploit control and data flow patterns at optimal\ngranularities is rarely successful. To address these challenges, we present\nAccelMerger, the first automated methodology to create coarse grained, control-\nand data-flow-rich, merged accelerators. AccelMerger uses sequence alignment\nmatching to recognize similar function call-graphs and loops, and neural\nnetworks to quickly evaluate their post-HLS characteristics.

Abell2108 was selected as a likely merger\nsystem through comparing the X-ray luminosity to the Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich\nsignal, where this cluster appeared highly X-ray underluminous. Follow up\nobservations confirmed it to be a merging low mass cluster featuring two\ndistinct subclusters, both with a highly disturbed X-ray morphology. Giant\nMetrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) data covering 120-750MHz show an extended\nradio feature resembling a radio relic, near the location of a temperature\ndiscontinuity in the X-rays. We measure a Mach number from the X-ray\ntemperature jump. Several characteristics of radio relics are found in\nAbell2108, making this cluster one of the few low mass mergers likely hosting a\nradio relic. The radio spectrum is exceptionally steep, and the radio power is\nvery weak (P1.4GHz=1E22W/Hz). To account for the shock/relic offset, we propose\na scenario in which the shock created the relic by re-accelerating a cloud of\npre-existing relativistic electrons and then moved away, leaving behind a\nfading relic. The electron aging timescale derived from the high-frequency\nsteepening in the relic spectrum is consistent with the shock travel time to\nthe observed X-ray discontinuity. However, the lower flux in GMRT band 4 data\ncausing the steepening could be due to instrumental limitations, and deeper\nradio data are needed to constrain the spectral slope of the relic at high\nfrequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 16:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

Here, we use fast current pulses to initialize phase\ncoherent spin packets, which are injected across an Fe/GaAs Schottky barrier\ninto $n$-GaAs. By means of time-resolved Faraday rotation, we demonstrate phase\ncoherence by the observation of multiple Larmor precession cycles for current\npulse widths down to 500 ps at 17 K. We show that the current pulses are\nbroadened by the charging and discharging time of the Schottky barrier. At high\nfrequencies, the observable spin coherence is limited only by the finite band\nwidth of the current pulses, which is on the order of 2 GHz. These results\ntherefore demonstrate that all-electrical injection and phase control of\nelectron spin packets at microwave frequencies is possible in\nmetallic-ferromagnet/semiconductor heterostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 17:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

In the average case setting, SoS lower bounds provide\nstrong evidence of algorithmic hardness or information-computation gaps. Prior\nto this work, SoS lower bounds have been obtained for problems in the \"dense\"\ninput regime, where the input is a collection of independent Rademacher or\nGaussian random variables, while the sparse regime has remained out of reach.\nWe make the first progress in this direction by obtaining strong SoS lower\nbounds for the problem of Independent Set on sparse random graphs. We prove\nthat with high probability over an Erdos-Renyi random graph $G\\sim\nG_{n,\\frac{d}{n}}$ with average degree $d>\\log^2 n$, degree-$D_{SoS}$ SoS fails\nto refute the existence of an independent set of size $k =\n\\Omega\\left(\\frac{n}{\\sqrt{d}(\\log n)(D_{SoS})^{c_0}} \\right)$ in $G$ (where\n$c_0$ is an absolute constant), whereas the true size of the largest\nindependent set in $G$ is $O\\left(\\frac{n\\log d}{d}\\right)$.\n  Our proof involves several significant extensions of the techniques used for\nproving SoS lower bounds in the dense setting. Previous lower bounds are based\non the pseudo-calibration heuristic of Barak et al [FOCS 2016] which produces a\ncandidate SoS solution using a planted distribution indistinguishable from the\ninput distribution via low-degree tests. In the sparse case the natural planted\ndistribution does admit low-degree distinguishers, and we show how to adapt the\npseudo-calibration heuristic to overcome this.\n  Another notorious technical challenge for the sparse regime is the quest for\nmatrix norm bounds. In this paper, we obtain new norm bounds for graph matrices\nin the sparse setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 17:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

When\nincluding noise, i.e. rotational diffusion, we find that swimmers are driven\ninto certain parts of phase space, leading to a nonuniform steady-state\ndistribution.

This motivates us to rethink the\nfundamental trade-off between accuracy and robustness in terms of calibrating\nconfidences of a smoothed classifier. In this paper, we propose a simple\ntraining scheme, coined SmoothMix, to control the robustness of smoothed\nclassifiers via self-mixup: it trains on convex combinations of samples along\nthe direction of adversarial perturbation for each input. The proposed\nprocedure effectively identifies over-confident, near off-class samples as a\ncause of limited robustness in case of smoothed classifiers, and offers an\nintuitive way to adaptively set a new decision boundary between these samples\nfor better robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod can significantly improve the certified $\\ell_2$-robustness of smoothed\nclassifiers compared to existing state-of-the-art robust training methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 18:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

However, realizing efficient,\ndelay-bounded, and reliable communications for a massive number of user\nequipments (UEs) in mURLLC, is extremely challenging as it needs to\nsimultaneously take into account the latency, reliability, and massive access\nrequirements. To support these requirements, the third generation partnership\nproject (3GPP) has introduced enhanced grant-free (GF) transmission in the\nuplink (UL), with multiple active configured-grants (CGs) for URLLC UEs. With\nmultiple CGs (MCG) for UL, UE can choose any of these grants as soon as the\ndata arrives. In addition, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been\nproposed to synergize with GF transmission to mitigate the serious transmission\ndelay and network congestion problems.

This perspective reveals fine structure of resonances which otherwise\nremains hidden in conventional approaches, including analytical,\nsemi-analytical and numerical-averaging approaches based on the critical\nresonant angle. At low eccentricity, first order resonances do not have\ndiverging widths but have two asymmetric branches leading away from the nominal\nresonance location.

While the algorithm for $V$ may\nbe inherently local, being computed within stars of vertices and so\nembarrassingly parallelizable, in practical use it is natural to want to\ndistribute the computation over patches $P_{i}$, apply the chosen algorithm to\ncompute the fields $V_{i}$ associated to each patch, and then assemble the\nambient field $V$ from these. Simply merging the fields from the patches, even\nwhen that makes sense, gives a wrong answer.

A channel-wise non-linear\nquantization scheme is determined based on the coding gain analysis. After\nthat, we propose a fine tuning scheme to clip the weights within a certain\nrange so that the quantization error can be reduced. 2) For the activation\nquantization, we first propose multiple non-linear quantization codebooks with\ndifferent maximum dynamic ranges. By selecting an optimal one through a\nmultiplexer, the quantization range can be saturated to the greatest extent. In\naddition, we also exploit the mean-removed quantization for the analysis\ntransform outputs in order to reduce the bit-width cost for the specific\nchannel with the large non-zero mean. By quantizing each weight and activation\nelement from 32-bit floating point to 8-bit fixed point, the memory cost for\nboth weight and activation can be reduced by 75% with negligible coding\nperformance loss.

Observations\nin both neuroscience and machine learning challenge this assumption. Animals\ncan approach a given task with a variety of strategies, and training machine\nlearning algorithms introduces the phenomenon of underspecification. These\nobservations imply that every task is associated with a space of solutions. To\ndate, the structure of this space is not understood, limiting the approach of\ncomparing RNNs with neural data. Here, we characterize the space of solutions\nassociated with various tasks. We first study a simple two-neuron network on a\ntask that leads to multiple solutions. We trace the nature of the final\nsolution back to the network's initial connectivity and identify discrete\ndynamical regimes that underlie this diversity. We then examine three\nneuroscience-inspired tasks: Delayed and interval discrimination, and Time\nreproduction. For each task, we find a rich set of solutions. Variability can\nbe found directly in the neural activity of the networks, and additionally by\ntesting the trained networks' ability to extrapolate, as a perturbation to a\nsystem often reveals hidden structure. Furthermore, we relate extrapolation\npatterns to specific dynamical objects and effective algorithms found by the\nnetworks. We introduce a tool to derive the reduced dynamics of networks by\ngenerating a compact directed graph describing the essence of the dynamics with\nregards to behavioral inputs and outputs. Using this representation, we can\npartition the solutions to each task into a handful of types and partially\npredict them from neural features. Our results shed light on the concept of the\nspace of solutions and its uses in Machine learning and in Neuroscience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 19:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

In this work,\ninertial flow rates are investigated for different channel lengths, operating\ntemperatures, and resistor pulse energies. Flow in closed channels is\nvisualized by adding fluorescent tracer beads to the test fluid (pure water). A\nrobust methodology of extracting flow rates from high-resolution video\nrecordings is developed. Flow rates are found to scale inversely with the\nchannel length. The observed dependence is explained based on a simple\nphenomenological \"kick\" model of inertial pumping. Flow rates are also fitted\nto the more fundamental one-dimensional model of inertial pumping from which\nthe intrinsic drive bubble strength is extracted. The measured flow rates vary\nstrongly with temperature. For well-developed drive bubbles, flow rates at T =\n70C are about 12x higher than at T = 30C. Three separate effects contribute to\nincreasing flow rates at high temperatures: (i) lower viscosity of the test\nfluid, (ii) a stronger drive bubble, and (iii) increasing mechanical efficiency\nof the pump, i.e., better conversion of the drive bubble strength to\nunidirectional post-collapse kick. Relative contributions of the three effects\nare quantified. The energy dependence of flow rates exhibits a clear saturation\nbehavior. The bubble strength is fitted to a phenomenological saturation model.\nIn the end, a complete predictive length-temperature-energy model of flow rates\nis constructed.

Methods: Free-running\n(free-breathing, retrospective cardiac gating) IR radial FLASH is used for data\nacquisition at 3T. First, to reduce the waiting time between inversions, an\nanalytical formula is derived that takes the incomplete T1 recovery into\naccount for an accurate T1 calculation. Second, the respiratory motion signal\nis estimated from the k-space center of the contrast varying acquisition using\nan adapted singular spectrum analysis (SSA-FARY) technique. Third, a\nmotion-resolved model-based reconstruction is used to estimate both parameter\nand coil sensitivity maps directly from the sorted k-space data. Thus,\nspatiotemporal total variation, in addition to the spatial sparsity\nconstraints, can be directly applied to the parameter maps. Validations are\nperformed on an experimental phantom, eleven human subjects, and a young\nlandrace pig with myocardial infarction. Results: In comparison to an IR\nspin-echo reference, phantom results confirm good T1 accuracy when reducing the\nwaiting time from five seconds to one second using the new correction.

The presence of these poles affects profoundly the\ninfrared properties of the interaction vertices, inducing crucial modifications\nto their fundamental Ward identities. Within this general framework, we present\na detailed derivation of the non-Abelian Ward identity obeyed by the pole-free\npart of the three-gluon vertex in the soft-gluon limit, and determine the\nsmoking-gun displacement that the onset of the Schwinger mechanism produces to\nthe standard result. Quite importantly, the quantity that describes this\ndistinctive feature coincides formally with the bound-state wave function that\ncontrols the massless pole formation. Consequently, this signal may be computed\nin two independent ways: by solving an approximate version of the pertinent\nBethe-Salpeter integral equation, or by appropriately combining the elements\nthat enter in the aforementioned Ward identity. For the implementation of both\nmethods we employ two- and three-point correlation functions obtained from\nrecent lattice simulations, and a partial derivative of the ghost-gluon kernel,\nwhich is computed from the corresponding Schwinger-Dyson equation.

The calculation of true gradients for\nbackpropagation in spiking neural networks is impeded by the non-differentiable\nfiring events of spiking neurons. On the other hand, using approximate\ngradients is effective, but computationally expensive over many time steps. One\ncommon technique, then, for training a spiking neural network is to train a\ntopologically-equivalent non-spiking network, and then convert it to an spiking\nnetwork, replacing real-valued inputs with proportionally rate-encoded Poisson\nspike trains. Converted SNNs function sufficiently well because the mean\npre-firing membrane potential of a spiking neuron is proportional to the dot\nproduct of the input rate vector and the neuron weight vector, similar to the\nfunctionality of a non-spiking network. However, this conversion only considers\nthe mean and not the temporal variance of the membrane potential.

Here we consider the temperature-dependent conductivity of a\ntwo-dimensional insulator on a substrate containing Coulomb impurities, with\nrandom potential amplitude $\\Gamma \\gg \\Delta$. We show that the conductivity\ngenerically exhibits three regimes of conductivity, and only the highest\ntemperature regime exhibits an activation energy that reflects the band gap. At\nlower temperatures, the conduction proceeds through activated hopping or\nEfros-Shklovskii variable-range hopping between electron and hole puddles\ncreated by the disorder. We show that the activation energy and characteristic\ntemperature associated with these processes steeply collapse near a critical\nimpurity concentration. Larger concentrations lead to an exponentially small\nactivation energy and exponentially long localization length, which in\nmesoscopic samples can appear as a disorder-induced insulator-to-metal\ntransition.

When assessing the quality of\n360{\\textdegree} video, human tends to perceive its quality degradation from\nthe viewport-based spatial distortion of each spherical frame to motion\nartifact across adjacent frames, ending with the video-level quality score,\ni.e., a progressive quality assessment paradigm. However, the existing BVQA\napproaches for 360{\\textdegree} video neglect this paradigm. In this paper, we\ntake into account the progressive paradigm of human perception towards\nspherical video quality, and thus propose a novel BVQA approach (namely ProVQA)\nfor 360{\\textdegree} video via progressively learning from pixels, frames and\nvideo. Corresponding to the progressive learning of pixels, frames and video,\nthree sub-nets are designed in our ProVQA approach, i.e., the spherical\nperception aware quality prediction (SPAQ), motion perception aware quality\nprediction (MPAQ) and multi-frame temporal non-local (MFTN) sub-nets. The SPAQ\nsub-net first models the spatial quality degradation based on spherical\nperception mechanism of human. Then, by exploiting motion cues across adjacent\nframes, the MPAQ sub-net properly incorporates motion contextual information\nfor quality assessment on 360{\\textdegree} video. Finally, the MFTN sub-net\naggregates multi-frame quality degradation to yield the final quality score,\nvia exploring long-term quality correlation from multiple frames.

The\napproach is illustrated by the folding/unfolding reaction for two proteins - a\nmodel beta-hairpin and a-helical protein a3D. For beta-hairpin, the free energy\nsurfaces (FESs) and free energy profiles (FEPs) are employed as the equilibrium\ndistributions of states, playing a role of the potentials of mean force to\ndetermine the acceptance probabilities of new states in the MC simulations.\nBased on the FESs and PESs for a set of temperatures that were simulated with\nthe molecular dynamics (MD) method, the MC simulations are performed to extract\nfolding/ unfolding rates. It has been found that the rate constants and\nfirst-passage time (FPT) distributions obtained in the MC simulations change\nwith temperature in good agreement with those from the MD simulations. For a3D\nprotein, whose equilibrium folding/unfoldingwas studied with the\nsingle-molecule FRET method (Chung et al., J. Phys. Chem.

The promising feature of the present approach is that it is based\nsolely on the equilibrium distributions of states, without introducing any\nadditional parameters to perform simulations, which suggests its applicability\nto other complex systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 04:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

We present stellar yields of AGB stars for $M=1-8$$M_\\odot$ and\n$Z=0.04-0.10$. We also weight these yields to represent the chemical\ncontribution of a metal-rich stellar population. We find that as metallicity\nincreases, the efficiency of the mixing episodes (known as the third dredge up)\non the thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB) decrease significantly. Consequently,\nmuch of the nucleosynthesis that occurs on the TP-AGB is not represented on the\nsurface of very metal-rich stars. It instead remains locked inside the white\ndwarf remnant. The temperatures at the base of the convective envelope also\ndecrease with increasing metallicity. For the intermediate mass models, this\nresults in the occurrence of only partial hydrogen burning at this location, if\nany burning at all. We also investigate heavy element production via the slow\nneutron capture process (s-process) for three 6$M_\\odot$ models: $Z=0.04, 0.05$\nand $0.06$. There is minor production at the first s-process peak at strontium,\nwhich decreases sharply with increasing metallicity.

We here\nexplore two test cases: U(1) lattice gauge theory in two dimensions, and SU(2)\nlattice gauge theory in four dimensions. Since the 2-d case has an exact\nsolution we may use it to assess the method, in particular to establish the\nequivalence of the open boundary results with the usual choice of periodic\nboundary conditions.

To generate $K$ hash\nvalues for each data vector, the standard theory of MinHash requires $K$\nindependent permutations. Interestingly, the recent work on \"circulant MinHash\"\n(C-MinHash) has shown that merely two permutations are needed. The first\npermutation breaks the structure of the data and the second permutation is\nre-used $K$ time in a circulant manner. Surprisingly, the estimation accuracy\nof C-MinHash is proved to be strictly smaller than that of the original\nMinHash. The more recent work further demonstrates that practically only one\npermutation is needed. Note that C-MinHash is different from the well-known\nwork on \"One Permutation Hashing (OPH)\" published in NIPS'12. OPH and its\nvariants using different \"densification\" schemes are popular alternatives to\nthe standard MinHash. The densification step is necessary in order to deal with\nempty bins which exist in One Permutation Hashing.\n  In this paper, we propose to incorporate the essential ideas of C-MinHash to\nimprove the accuracy of One Permutation Hashing. Basically, we develop a new\ndensification method for OPH, which achieves the smallest estimation variance\ncompared to all existing densification schemes for OPH. Our proposed method is\nnamed C-OPH (Circulant OPH). After the initial permutation (which breaks the\nexisting structure of the data), C-OPH only needs a \"shorter\" permutation of\nlength $D/K$ (instead of $D$), where $D$ is the original data dimension and $K$\nis the total number of bins in OPH. This short permutation is re-used in $K$\nbins in a circulant shifting manner. It can be shown that the estimation\nvariance of the Jaccard similarity is strictly smaller than that of the\nexisting (densified) OPH methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 06:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors hosting such sensors have\nrecently opened up new horizons for sensing in the subnanometer scales in 2D\nheterostructures. However, controlled creation of quantum sensor in a single\nlayer 2D materials with high sensitivity has been elusive so far.

The qubit is\ndecoupled from its dense spin environment at low magnetic fields that gives\nrise to the reduction of the spin resonance linewidth and elongation of the\ncoherence time. The VB2 centre is also equipped with a classical memory that\ncan be utilized in storing population information.

However, measurements are impossible when samples do\nnot scatterer light enough, i.e. when there are too few scattering events due\nto excessively small scattering cross-sections and/or low concentrations of\nscatterers. Here, we propose to amplify light scattering efficiency by placing\nweakly scattering samples inside a Lambertian cavity with high reflectance\nwalls. It produces a 3D isotropic and homogeneous light field that effectively\nelongates the scattering pathlength by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude, and leads to\na dramatic increase in sensitivity.

Instead of resorting to\nshallow-circuit quantum algorithms, recent theoretical research suggests that\ndigital quantum simulation (DQS) of closed quantum systems are robust against\nthe accumulation of Trotter errors, as long as local observables are concerned.\nIn this paper, we investigate digital quantum simulation of open quantum\nsystems. First, we prove that the deviation in the steady state obtained from\ndigital quantum simulation depends only on the error in a single Trotter step,\nwhich indicates that error accumulation may not be disastrous. By numerical\nsimulation of the quantum circuits for the DQS of the dissipative XYZ model, we\nthen show that the correct results can be recovered by quantum error mitigation\nas long as the error rate in the DQS is below a sharp threshold.

Taint analysis in particular is a very general and\npowerful technique, where security policies are expressed in terms of forbidden\nflows, either from untrusted input sources to sensitive sinks (in integrity\npolicies) or from sensitive sources to untrusted sinks (in confidentiality\npolicies). The appeal of this approach is that the taint-tracking mechanism has\nto be implemented only once, and can then be parameterized with different taint\nspecifications (that is, sets of sources and sinks, as well as any sanitizers\nthat render otherwise problematic flows innocuous) to detect many different\nkinds of vulnerabilities.\n  But while techniques for implementing scalable inter-procedural static taint\ntracking are fairly well established, crafting taint specifications is still\nmore of an art than a science, and in practice tends to involve a lot of manual\neffort.\n  Past work has focussed on automated techniques for inferring taint\nspecifications for libraries either from their implementation or from the way\nthey tend to be used in client code. Among the latter, machine learning-based\napproaches have shown great promise.\n  In this work we present our experience combining an existing machine-learning\napproach to mining sink specifications for JavaScript libraries with manual\ntaint modelling in the context of GitHub's CodeQL analysis framework. We show\nthat the machine-learning component can successfully infer many new taint sinks\nthat either are not part of the manual modelling or are not detected due to\nanalysis incompleteness.

Upon entering water, the fly entraps an air bubble\nin a superhydrophobic hairy structure on its abdomen for respiration. This\nbubble, however, can change its volume through regulated oxygen flow from the\nabdominal hemoglobin cells. In this way, it can reach neutral buoyancy without\nfurther energy consumption. In this study, we develop a small, centimeter\nscale, backswimmer inspired robot (BackBot) with auto-buoyancy regulation\nthrough controlled nucleation and release of microbubbles. The bubbles nucleate\nand grow directly on onboard electrodes through electrolysis, regulated by low\nvoltage. We use 3D printing to introduce a three-dimensional bubble-entrapping\ncellular structure, in order to create a stable external gas reservoir. To\nreduce buoyancy forces, the bubbles are released through linear mechanical\nvibrations, decoupled from the robot's body. Through pressure sensing and a\nProportional Integral Derivative control loop mechanism, the robot\nauto-regulates its buoyancy to reach neutral floatation underwater within\nseconds.

To achieve that, we need to perform\nmetagenomic binning, clustering the assembled contigs into draft genomes.\nDespite the existing computational tools, most of them neglect one important\nproperty of the metagenomic data, that is, the noise. To further improve the\nmetagenomic binning step and reconstruct better metagenomes, we propose a deep\nContrastive Learning framework for Metagenome Binning (CLMB), which can\nefficiently eliminate the disturbance of noise and produce more stable and\nrobust results. Essentially, instead of denoising the data explicitly, we add\nsimulated noise to the training data and force the deep learning model to\nproduce similar and stable representations for both the noise-free data and the\ndistorted data.

In some\ncases, data are collected from different subjects from multiple environments,\nwhich provides more information but might make the data non-identical or\nnon-independent distribution. Some previous efforts try to learn causal\nstructure from this type of data in two independent stages, i.e., first\ndiscovering i.i.d. groups from non-i.i.d. samples, then learning the causal\nstructures from different groups. This straightforward solution ignores the\nintrinsic connections between the two stages, that is both the clustering stage\nand the learning stage should be guided by the same causal mechanism. Towards\nthis end, we propose a unified Causal Cluster Structures Learning (named CCSL)\nmethod for causal discovery from non-i.i.d. data. This method simultaneously\nintegrates the following two tasks: 1) clustering samples of the subjects with\nthe same causal mechanism into different groups; 2) learning causal structures\nfrom the samples within the group. Specifically, for the former, we provide a\nCausality-related Chinese Restaurant Process to cluster samples based on the\nsimilarity of the causal structure; for the latter, we introduce a\nvariational-inference-based approach to learn the causal structures.\nTheoretical results provide identification of the causal model and the\nclustering model under the linear non-Gaussian assumption.

The first,\ncalled the PDE formulation, is rather standard. It employs a first order\npartial differential equation, with a non-local boundary condition, for the\nsize-density of the consumer, coupled to an ordinary differential equation for\nthe resource concentration. The second is called the DELAY formulation and\nemploys a renewal equation for the population level birth rate of the consumer,\ncoupled to a delay differential equation for the (history of the) resource\nconcentration. With each of the two formulations we associate a constructively\ndefined semigroup of nonlinear solution operators. The two semigroups are\nintertwined by a non-invertible operator. In this paper we delineate in what\nsense the two semigroups are equivalent. In particular, we (i) identify\nconditions on both the model ingredients and the choice of state space that\nguarantee that the intertwining operator is surjective, (ii) focus on large\ntime behaviour and (iii) consider full orbits, i.e., orbits defined for time\nrunning from $-\\infty $ to $+\\infty $. Conceptually, the PDE formulation is by\nfar the most natural one. It has, however, the technical drawback that the\nsolution operators are not differentiable, precluding rigorous linearisation.\nFor the delay formulation, one can (under certain conditions concerning the\nmodel ingredients) prove the differentiability of the solution operators and\nestablish the Principle of Linearised Stability. Next the equivalence of the\ntwo formulations yields a rather indirect proof of this principle for the PDE\nformulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 13:28:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 10:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

The proposed estimator comprises a framework of single-label\nclassifiers. Each classifier predicts if waves are present within certain\nrandomly selected segments of the array's field of view (FOV), resulting from\ndiscretising the FOV with a certain (FOV) resolution. The classifiers'\npredictions are combined into a probabilistic angle spectrum, whereupon the\nsource number and the AOAs are estimated jointly by applying a probability\nthreshold whose optimal level is learned from data.

This\nleads to an efficient sampling scheme to estimate self-attention which relies\non specific modifications of LSH (to enable deployment on GPU architectures).\nWe evaluate our algorithm on the GLUE benchmark with standard 512 sequence\nlength where we see favorable performance relative to a standard pretrained\nTransformer.

However, due to the paradox caused by the variation of real\ncaptured haze and the fixed degradation parameters of the current networks, the\ngeneralization ability of recent dehazing methods on real-world hazy images is\nnot ideal.To address the problem of modeling real-world haze degradation, we\npropose to solve this problem by perceiving and modeling density for uneven\nhaze distribution. We propose a novel Separable Hybrid Attention (SHA) module\nto encode haze density by capturing features in the orthogonal directions to\nachieve this goal. Moreover, a density map is proposed to model the uneven\ndistribution of the haze explicitly. The density map generates positional\nencoding in a semi-supervised way. Such a haze density perceiving and modeling\ncapture the unevenly distributed degeneration at the feature level effectively.\nThrough a suitable combination of SHA and density map, we design a novel\ndehazing network architecture, which achieves a good complexity-performance\ntrade-off.

We use CLIP\nencoding as a prefix to the caption, by employing a simple mapping network, and\nthen fine-tunes a language model to generate the image captions. The recently\nproposed CLIP model contains rich semantic features which were trained with\ntextual context, making it best for vision-language perception. Our key idea is\nthat together with a pre-trained language model (GPT2), we obtain a wide\nunderstanding of both visual and textual data. Hence, our approach only\nrequires rather quick training to produce a competent captioning model. Without\nadditional annotations or pre-training, it efficiently generates meaningful\ncaptions for large-scale and diverse datasets. Surprisingly, our method works\nwell even when only the mapping network is trained, while both CLIP and the\nlanguage model remain frozen, allowing a lighter architecture with less\ntrainable parameters.

Granular\nflows and their interactions with rigid bodies still pose several open\nquestions. A promising direction for accurate, yet efficient, modeling is using\ncontinuum methods. Also, a new direction for real-time physics modeling is the\nuse of deep learning. This research advances machine learning methods for\nmodeling rigid body-driven granular flows, for application to terrestrial\nindustrial machines as well as space robotics (where the effect of gravity is\nan important factor). In particular, this research considers the development of\na subspace machine learning simulation approach. To generate training datasets,\nwe utilize our high-fidelity continuum method, material point method (MPM).\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of\ndata. We show that the first few principal components of our high-dimensional\ndata keep almost the entire variance in data. A graph network simulator (GNS)\nis trained to learn the underlying subspace dynamics.

When updating them based on\nthe new class data, they suffer from catastrophic forgetting: the model cannot\ndiscern old class data clearly from the new. In this paper, we explore the\nperformance of Self-Supervised representation learning in Class Incremental\nLearning (SSCIL) for the first time, which discards data labels and the model's\nclassifiers. To comprehensively discuss the difference in performance between\nsupervised and self-supervised methods in CIL, we set up three different class\nincremental schemes: Random Class Scheme, Semantic Class Scheme, and Cluster\nScheme, to simulate various class incremental learning scenarios. Besides, we\npropose Linear Evaluation Protocol (LEP) and Generalization Evaluation Protocol\n(GEP) to metric the model's representation classification ability and\ngeneralization in CIL. Our experiments (on ImageNet-100 and ImageNet) show that\nSSCIL has better anti-forgetting ability and robustness than supervised\nstrategies in CIL. To understand what alleviates the catastrophic forgetting in\nSSCIL, we study the major components of SSCIL and conclude that (1) the\ncomposition of different data augmentation improves the quality of the model's\nrepresentation and the \\textit{Grayscale} operation reduces the system noise of\ndata augmentation in SSCIL. (2) the projector, like a buffer, reduces\nunnecessary parameter updates of the model in SSCIL and increases the\nrobustness of the model. Although the performance of SSCIL is significantly\nhigher than supervised methods in CIL, there is still an apparent gap with\njoint learning. Our exploration gives a baseline of self-supervised class\nincremental learning on large-scale datasets and contributes some forward\nstrategies for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting in CIL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 06:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

We show with the\nexperiment that our approach can be used to infer from a sequence of news\narticles if the articles were published by major or entertainment news outlets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 10:36:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 00:53:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

The 3D mesh recorded by the HoloLens is annotated\non-line, as the user moves, with semantic classes using a projective approach,\nwhich allows us to use a state-of-the-art 2D semantic segmentation method. The\nresults are fused onto the mesh; prominent object segments are identified and\ndisplayed in 3D to the user. Finally, the user can trigger actions by gesturing\nat the object. We both present qualitative results and analyze the accuracy and\nperformance of our method in detail on an indoor dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 14:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

For the\npurposes of evaluation of crowd experiments, it is paramount that we\ndistinguish between different dimensions of their validity. Here, we\ndifferentiate between four types of experimentation in crowd dynamics based on\ntheir underlying purpose of investigation. This includes experiments whose main\naim is (i) testing a behavioural theory/hypothesis, (ii) exploring empirical\nbehavioural regularities; (iii) assessing collective (system-level) performance\nrather than individual behaviour (iv) calibrating and/or validating\npre-existing models. While delineating various dimensions of external/internal\nvalidity as they relate to crowd experiments, we argue how the importance of\ndifferent validity dimensions varies depending on investigation purpose. This\ncould provide clarity about circumstances where artificiality of laboratory\nsettings is justified as opposed to experiments for which higher levels of\ncontextual fidelity should be given more weight. It is critical that\ninvestigators (a) be conscious of the trade-off between controllability and\nrealism in their experiment design and (b) identify potential factors that can\njeopardise validity of their experiments and mitigate them. Inferences made\nfrom field data do not invariably supersede those of experiments on the issue\nof validity. Depending on the purpose of investigation, maintaining internal\nvalidity sometimes necessitates laboratory settings and justifies\nartificiality. In the absence of adequate control over the causal relationship,\nthe question of external validity will be futile. Therefore, striking a\nreasonable balance between internal and external validity of crowd experiments\nshould be made a major design consideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 06:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

In particular, a continuous model\nof the hard sphere fluid is studied. There are two main proposals in this\ncontribution. First, the use of neural networks as a way to parametrize closure\nrelation when solving the Ornstein-Zernike equation. It is explicitly shown\nthat in the case of the hard sphere fluid, the neural network approach seems to\nreduce to the so-called Hypernetted Chain closure. For the second proposal, we\nexplore the fact that if more physical information is incorporated into the\ntheoretical formalism, a better estimate can be obtained with the use of\nevolutionary optimization techniques. When choosing the modified Verlet closure\nrelation, and leaving a couple of free parameters to be adjusted, the results\nare as good as those obtained from molecular simulations. The thesis is then\nclosed with a brief summary of the main findings and outlooks on different ways\nto improve the proposals presented here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 20:57:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 23:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}
