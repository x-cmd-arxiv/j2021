The limitations of these works are mainly due to the\nfollowing two reasons: firstly, previous works used negative sampling\ntechniques to treat unvalidated drug-disease associations as negative samples,\nwhich is invalid in real-world settings; secondly, the inner product cannot\nfully take into account the feature information contained in the latent factor\nof drug and disease. In this paper, we propose a novel PUON framework for\naddressing the above deficiencies, which models the risk estimator of\ncomputational drug repositioning only using validated (Positive) and\nunvalidated (Unlabelled) drug-disease associations without employing negative\nsampling techniques. The PUON also proposed an Outer Neighborhood-based\nclassifier for modeling the cross-feature information of the latent facotor.\nFor a comprehensive comparison, we considered 8 popular baselines. Extensive\nexperiments in four real-world datasets showed that PUON model achieved the\nbest performance based on 6 evaluation metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 16:57:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 08:54:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 07:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

In thimble\nregularization the domain of integration is deformed into an union of manifolds\ncalled Lefschetz thimbles. On each thimble the imaginary part of the action\nstays constant and the sign problem disappears. A long standing issue of this\napproach is how to determine the relative weight to assign to each thimble\ncontribution in the (multi)-thimble decomposition. Yet this is an issue one has\nto face, as previous work has shown that different theories exist for which the\ncontributions coming from thimbles other than the dominant one cannot be\nneglected. Historically, one of the first examples of such theories is the\none-dimensional Thirring model. Here we discuss how Taylor expansions can be\nused to by-pass the need for multi-thimble simulations. If multiple, disjoint\nregions can be found in the parameters space of the theory where only one\nthimble gives a relevant contribution, multiple Taylor expansions can be\ncarried out in those regions to reach other regions by single thimble\nsimulations. Better yet, these Taylor expansions can be bridged by Pad\\'e\ninterpolants. Not only does this improve the convergence properties of the\nseries, but it also gives access to information about the analytical structure\nof the observables. The true singularities of the observables can be recovered.\nWe show that this program can be applied to the one-dimensional Thirring model\nand to a (simple) version of HDQCD. But the general idea behind our strategy\ncan be helpful beyond thimble regularization itself, i.e. it could be valuable\nin studying the singularities of QCD in the complex $\\mu_B$ plane. Indeed this\nis a program that is currently being carried out by the Bielefeld-Parma\ncollaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 16:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

It follows that each\nelementary process, hence each measurement process at its core, is a spacetime,\npointlike, event. Another key idea is that, when a microsystem $\\psi$ gets into\ncontact with the experimental device, factorization of $\\psi$ rapidly fails and\nentangled mixed states appear. The wave functions for the microsystem-apparatus\ncoupled systems for different measurement outcomes then lack overlapping\nspacetime support. It means that the aftermath of each measurement is a single\nterm in the sum: a \"wave-function collapse\".\n  Our discussion leading to a diagonal density matrix, $\\rho= {\\rm diag} (\n|c_1|^2, \\ldots, |c_n|^2, \\ldots )$ shows how the information encoded in the\nwave function $|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_n c_n | n \\rangle$ gets transcribed, via\nentanglement with the experimental device and environment, into the relative\nfrequencies ${\\cal P}_n = |c_n|^2$ for various experimental results $F=f_n$.\n  These results represent new, significant steps towards filling in the logical\ngaps in the standard interpretation based on Born's rule, and replacing it with\na more natural one.

This phenomenon\nis known as the FIP effect (FIP stands for first ionization potential), and its\nstrength can be characterized by the FIP bias, the logarithmic abundance\ndifference between low- and high-FIP elements in the corona, compared to the\nphotosphere. The FIP bias was shown to depend on the surface temperature of the\nstar. We compiled FIP bias and other parameters for 59 stars for which coronal\ncomposition is available, now including evolved stars. Using principal\ncomponent analysis and linear discriminant analysis, we searched for\ncorrelations with other astrophysical parameters within the sample which may\ninfluence the stellar FIP bias. Adding stars to the $T_{\\rm eff}-$FIP bias\ndiagram unveiled new features in its structure. In addition to the previously\nknown relationship, there appears to be a second branch, a parallel sequence\nabout 0.5 dex above it. While the $T_{\\rm eff}$ remains the main determinant of\nthe FIP bias, other parameters such as stellar activity indicators also have\ninfluence. We find three clusters in the FIP bias determinant parameter space.\nOne distinct group is formed by the evolved stars. Two groups contain main\nsequence stars in continuation separated roughly by the sign change of the\nFIP-bias value. The new branch of the $T_{\\rm eff}-$FIP bias diagram contains\nstars with higher activity level, in terms of X-ray flux and rotational\nvelocity. The two main sequence clusters run from the earliest spectral types\nof A-F with shallow convection zones through G-K-early M stars with gradually\ndeeper convection zones, and end up with the fully convective M dwarf stars,\ndepicting the change of the dynamo type with the internal differences of the\nmain sequence stars in connection with the FIP-bias values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 17:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

CMWU achieves constant\nregret of $\\ln(m)/\\eta$ in all normal-form games with m actions and fixed\nstep-sizes $\\eta$. Although CMWU encodes in its definition a fixed point\ncomputation, which in principle could result in dynamics that are neither\ncomputationally efficient nor uncoupled, we show that both of these issues can\nbe largely circumvented. Specifically, as long as the step-size $\\eta$ is upper\nbounded by $\\frac{1}{(n-1)V}$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $[0,V]$ is\nthe payoff range, then the CMWU updates can be computed linearly fast via a\ncontraction map.

Existing\napproaches either perform class re-balancing strategies or directly improve\nnetwork modules to address the problem. However, they still train models with a\nfinite set of predefined labels, limiting their supervision information and\nrestricting their transferability to novel instances. Recent advances in\nlarge-scale contrastive visual-language pretraining shed light on a new pathway\nfor visual recognition. With open-vocabulary supervisions, pretrained\ncontrastive vision-language models learn powerful multimodal representations\nthat are promising to handle data deficiency and unseen concepts. By\ncalculating the semantic similarity between visual and text inputs, visual\nrecognition is converted to a vision-language matching problem. Inspired by\nthis, we propose BALLAD to leverage contrastive vision-language models for\nlong-tailed recognition. We first continue pretraining the vision-language\nbackbone through contrastive learning on a specific long-tailed target dataset.\nAfterward, we freeze the backbone and further employ an additional adapter\nlayer to enhance the representations of tail classes on balanced training\nsamples built with re-sampling strategies. Extensive experiments have been\nconducted on three popular long-tailed recognition benchmarks. As a result, our\nsimple and effective approach sets the new state-of-the-art performances and\noutperforms competitive baselines with a large margin.

In\nthis paper, we propose to utilize radar sensors to provide sensing information\nabout the surrounding environment and moving objects, and leverage this\ninformation to proactively predict future link blockages before they happen.\nThis is motivated by the low cost of the radar sensors, their ability to\nefficiently capture important features such as the range, angle, velocity of\nthe moving scatterers (candidate blockages), and their capability to capture\nradar frames at relatively high speed. We formulate the radar-aided proactive\nblockage prediction problem and develop two solutions for this problem based on\nclassical radar object tracking and deep neural networks.

To accurately evaluate the proposed solutions, we build a\nlarge-scale real-world dataset, based on the DeepSense framework, gathering\nco-existing radar and mmWave communication measurements of more than $10$\nthousand data points and various blockage objects (vehicles, bikes, humans,\netc.).

Despite its\nimportance, this process is still poorly explored in numerical simulations due\nto its complex physics and the tight dependence on the environment. Here we\nintroduce a novel implementation of grain charging in the cosmological\nradiative transfer code CRASH. We first benchmark the code predictions on a\nseries of idealized dusty HII regions created by a single star, in order to\nassess the impact of grain properties on the resulting spatial distribution of\ncharges. Second, we perform a realistic radiative transfer simulation of a star\nforming region extracted from a dusty galaxy evolving in the Epoch of\nReionization. We find that $\\sim 13$ % of the total dust mass gets negatively\ncharged, mainly silicate and graphite grains of radius micron. A complex\nspatial distribution of grain charges is also found, primarily depending on the\nexposure to stellar radiation and strongly varying along different lines of\nsight, as a result of radiative transfer effects. We finally assess the impact\nof grain properties (both chemical composition and size) on the resulting\ncharge distribution. The new implementation described here will open up a wide\nrange of possible studies investigating the physical evolution of the dusty\nISM, nowadays accessible to observations of high and low redshift galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

However, comet sublimation is insufficient to sustain the quantity of\ndust presently in the inner solar system, suggesting that spontaneous\ndisruptions of JFCs may supply the zodiacal cloud. We present a model for the\ndust produced in comet fragmentations and its evolution. Using results from\ndynamical simulations, the model follows individual comets drawn from a size\ndistribution as they evolve and undergo recurrent splitting events. The\nresulting dust is followed with a kinetic model which accounts for the effects\nof collisional evolution, Poynting-Robertson drag, and radiation pressure. This\nallows to model the evolution of both the size distribution and radial profile\nof dust, and we demonstrate the importance of including collisions (both as a\nsource and sink of dust) in zodiacal cloud models. With physically-motivated\nfree parameters this model provides a good fit to zodiacal cloud observables,\nsupporting comet fragmentation as the plausibly dominant dust source. The model\nimplies that dust in the present zodiacal cloud likely originated primarily\nfrom disruptions of $\\sim$ 50 km comets, since larger comets are ejected before\nlosing all their mass. Thus much of the dust seen today was likely deposited as\nlarger grains $\\sim$ 0.1 Myr in the past. The model also finds the dust level\nto vary stochastically; e.g., every $\\sim$ 50 Myr large (>100 km) comets with\nlong dynamical lifetimes inside Jupiter cause dust spikes with order of\nmagnitude increases in zodiacal light brightness lasting $\\sim$ 1 Myr. If\nexozodiacal dust is cometary in origin, our model suggests it should be\nsimilarly variable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

We study how these\nmodulations are modified at the critical point where the system exhibits\nintrinsic long-range correlations. To do so, we consider a pump in a diffusive\nfluid, which is known to generate a density profile in the form of an electric\ndipole potential and a current in the form of a dipolar field above the\ncritical point. We demonstrate that while the current retains its form at the\ncritical point, the density profile changes drastically.

This process is studied in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA).\nEven though a large number of methods propose new adaptation strategies, they\nare mostly based on outdated network architectures. As the influence of recent\nnetwork architectures has not been systematically studied, we first benchmark\ndifferent network architectures for UDA and newly reveal the potential of\nTransformers for UDA semantic segmentation. Based on the findings, we propose a\nnovel UDA method, DAFormer. The network architecture of DAFormer consists of a\nTransformer encoder and a multi-level context-aware feature fusion decoder. It\nis enabled by three simple but crucial training strategies to stabilize the\ntraining and to avoid overfitting to the source domain: While (1) Rare Class\nSampling on the source domain improves the quality of the pseudo-labels by\nmitigating the confirmation bias of self-training toward common classes, (2) a\nThing-Class ImageNet Feature Distance and (3) a learning rate warmup promote\nfeature transfer from ImageNet pretraining.

Our pipeline aims at improving the\npost-processing of the observations on two fronts: identifying the location of\nthe star behind the AGPM to better align the science frames and performing\nframe selection. Our method relies on finding the position of the AGPM in the\nsky frame observations, and correlate it with the circular aperture of the\ncoronagraphic mask. This relationship allows us to retrieve the location of the\nAGPM in the science frames, in turn allowing us to estimate the position of the\nstar.

However, Koopman operators can have continuous spectra\nand infinite-dimensional invariant subspaces, making computing their spectral\ninformation a considerable challenge. This paper describes data-driven\nalgorithms with rigorous convergence guarantees for computing spectral\ninformation of Koopman operators from trajectory data. We introduce residual\ndynamic mode decomposition (ResDMD), which provides the first scheme for\ncomputing the spectra and pseudospectra of general Koopman operators from\nsnapshot data without spectral pollution. Using the resolvent operator and\nResDMD, we compute smoothed approximations of spectral measures associated with\ngeneral measure-preserving dynamical systems. We prove explicit convergence\ntheorems for our algorithms, which can achieve high-order convergence even for\nchaotic systems when computing the density of the continuous spectrum and the\ndiscrete spectrum. Since our algorithms come with error control, ResDMD allows\naposteri verification of spectral quantities, Koopman mode decompositions, and\nlearned dictionaries. We demonstrate our algorithms on the tent map, circle\nrotations, Gauss iterated map, nonlinear pendulum, double pendulum, and Lorenz\nsystem.

Long term monitoring of the spin evolution of J2211+1136 and other\nfast spinning isolated white dwarfs opens a new discovery space for substellar\nand planetary mass companions around white dwarfs. In addition, the discovery\nof such fast rotators outside of the ZZ Ceti instability strip suggests that\nsome should also exist within the strip. Hence, some of the mono-periodic\nvariables found within the instability strip may be fast spinning white dwarfs\nimpersonating ZZ Ceti pulsators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 19:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

The initial\nmagnetic configuration depicts a triple arcade structure shifted southward, and\nembedded into a bimodal solar wind. We compared our simulated signatures with\nthose of a multiple CME event in Sept 2009 using data from spacecraft around\nMercury and Earth. We computed and analysed the Dst index for all the\nsimulations performed. Results: The observed event fits well at 1 AU with two\nof our simulations, one with a stealth CME and the other without. This\nhighlights the difficulty of attempting to use in situ observations to\ndistinguish whether or not the second eruption was stealthy, because of the\nprocesses the flux ropes undergo during their propagation in the interplanetary\nspace. We simulate the CMEs propagated in two different solar winds, one slow\nand another faster one. Only in the first case, plasma blobs arise in the trail\nof eruptions. Interestingly, the Dst computation results in a reduced\ngeoeffectiveness in the case of consecutive CMEs when the flux ropes arrive\nwith a leading positive Bz. When the Bz component is reversed, the\ngeoeffectiveness increases, meaning that the magnetic reconnections with the\ntrailing blobs and eruptions strongly affect the impact of the arriving\ninterplanetary CME.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 19:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Theory and\nMethods: Spiral TSE sequences with annulated spiral segmentation have been\nimplemented with different acquisition modes. In fixed mode the duration of\neach spiral segment is fixed to fill the available acquisition time tacq. In\ntangential mode, the beginning of each spiral segment is reached via a straight\ntangential trajectory. Tangential mode allows faster transition and thus longer\ntacq for a given echo spacing ESP, but less data points can be acquired per\nacquisition interval.

However, it becomes very hard for a survey with\na large number of sources. In addition, when the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is\nlow, there is a tendency to adopt an overly simplistic model, biasing the\nparameters and making their uncertainties unrealistic. We developed a Bayesian\nmethod for automatically fitting XMM-Newton AGN X-ray spectra with a consistent\nand physically motivated model including all spectral components, even when the\ndata quality is low. An empirical model is used for the non-X-ray background.\nNoninformative priors were applied on the photon index (Gamma) and the hydrogen\ncolumn density (N_H), while informative priors obtained from deep surveys were\nused to marginalize the remaining parameters. We tested this method using a\nrealistically simulated sample of 5000 spectra reproducing typical population\nproperties. Spectral parameters were randomly drawn from the priors, taking the\nluminosity function into account. Meaningful posterior probability density\ndistributions were obtained for, for instance, N_H, Gamma, and L_X, even at low\nS/N, but in this case, we were unable to constrain the parameters of secondary\ncomponents such as the reflection and soft excess. As a comparison, a\nmaximum-likelihood approach with model selection among six models of different\ncomplexities was also applied to this sample. We find clear failures in the\nmeasurement of Gamma in most cases, and of N_H when the source is unabsorbed\n(N_H < 10^22 cm-2). The results can hardly be used to reconstruct the parent\ndistributions of the spectral parameters, while our Bayesian method provides\nmeaningful multidimensional posteriors that will be used in a subsequent paper\nto infer the population.

As a by-product, the four skewed matrix-variate FMRs are also\nintroduced. Maximum likelihood parameter estimates are derived using an\nexpectation-conditional maximization algorithm. Parameter recovery,\nclassification assessment, and the capability of the Bayesian information\ncriterion to detect the underlying groups are investigated using simulated\ndata. Lastly, our matrix-variate CWMs, along with the matrix-variate normal CWM\nand matrix-variate FMRs, are applied to two real datasets for illustrative\npurposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 20:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

As $p$ increases from the sphere point ($p=1$), the superball attains\ncubic symmetry, and attains octahedral symmetry when $p<1$. Previous\ncharacterization of superball packings has shown that they have a maximally\nrandom jammed (MRJ) state, whose properties (e.g., packing fraction $\\phi$)\nvary nonanalytically as $p$ diverges from unity.

Numerous supervised detection algorithms have been\ndeveloped with parameters estimated from and optimized for a particular\ndataset, yet their generalizability from sensor to sensor or study to study is\nunknown. In this paper, we propose and validate an unsupervised algorithm --\nCircaCP -- to detect sleep-wake cycles from minute-by-minute actigraphy data.\nIt first uses a robust cosinor model to estimate circadian rhythm, then\nsearches for a single change point (CP) within each cycle. We used CircaCP to\nestimate sleep/wake onset times (S/WOTs) from 2125 indviduals' data in the MESA\nSleep study and compared the estimated S/WOTs against self-reported S/WOT event\nmarkers. Lastly, we quantified the biases between estimated and self-reported\nS/WOTs, as well as variation in S/WOTs contributed by the two methods, using\nlinear mixed-effects models and variance component analysis.\n  On average, SOTs estimated by CircaCP were five minutes behind those reported\nby event markers, and WOTs estimated by CircaCP were less than one minute\nbehind those reported by markers. These differences accounted for less than\n0.2% variability in SOTs and in WOTs, taking into account other sources of\nbetween-subject variations. By focusing on the commonality in human circadian\nrhythms captured by actigraphy, our algorithm transferred seamlessly from\nhip-worn ActiGraph data collected from children in our previous study to\nwrist-worn Actiwatch data collected from adults. The large between- and\nwithin-subject variability highlights the need for estimating individual-level\nS/WOTs when conducting actigraphy research. The generalizability of our\nalgorithm also suggests that it could be widely applied to actigraphy data\ncollected by other wearable sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 21:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

In this work, we specifically avoid the\nheel-strike and toe-off benefits to investigate whether the progression of the\ncenter of pressure from heel-to-toe during mid-stance, or some other approach,\nis beneficial in and of itself. We use an \"Ankle Actuated Spring Loaded\nInverted Pendulum\" model to simulate the shifting center of pressure dynamics,\nand trajectory optimization is applied to find limit cycles that minimize cost\nof transport. The results show that, for the vast majority of gaits, ankle\ntorques do not affect cost of transport. Ankles reduce the cost of transport\nduring a narrow band of gaits at the transition from grounded running to aerial\nrunning. This suggests that applying ankle torque during mid-stance of a steady\ngait is not a directly beneficial strategy, but is most likely a path between\nbeneficial heel-strikes and toe-offs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 22:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

We propose a memoryless traffic shaping mechanism\nsatisfying a first-come-first-served queuing discipline that outputs traffic\ndependent on the input using a DP mechanism. We show that in special cases the\nproposed mechanism recovers existing shapers which standardize the output\nindependently from the input. To find the optimal shapers for given levels of\nprivacy and transmission efficiency, we formulate the constrained problem of\nminimizing the expected delay per packet and propose using the expected queue\nsize across time as a proxy. We further show that the constrained minimization\nis a convex program. We demonstrate the effect of shapers on both synthetic\ndata and packet traces from actual IoT devices. The experimental results reveal\ninherent privacy-overhead tradeoffs: more shaping overhead provides better\nprivacy protection. Under the same privacy level, there naturally exists a\ntradeoff between dummy traffic and delay. When dealing with heavier or less\nbursty input traffic, all shapers become more overhead-efficient. We also show\nthat increased traffic from a larger number of IoT devices makes guaranteeing\nevent-level privacy easier. The DP shaper offers tunable privacy that is\ninvariant with the change in the input traffic distribution and has an\nadvantage in handling burstiness over traffic-independent shapers. This\napproach well accommodates heterogeneous network conditions and enables users\nto adapt to their privacy/overhead demands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 22:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

The\nrandomized data typically allows for reliable estimation of average treatment\neffects but may be limited in sample size and patient heterogeneity for\nestimating conditional average treatment effects for a broad range of patients.\nEstimates from the observational study can potentially compensate for these\nlimitations, but there may be concerns about whether confounding and treatment\neffect heterogeneity have been adequately addressed.

This allows the combination to be\nconsistent for a conditional causal effect, regardless of whether assumptions\nrequired for consistent estimation in the observational study are satisfied.\nWhen the bias is negligible, the estimators from each source are combined for\noptimal efficiency.

The inflaton field $\\boldsymbol\\phi$ has a corresponding potential\nfunction $V$, the details of which, such as the number of dimensions and shape,\nare free parameters of the theory. We consider a natural hypothesis that $V$\nought to be maximally random. We realize this idea by defining $V$ as a\nGaussian random field in some number $N$ of dimensions. Given a model set of\nparameters that statistically determine the shape of $V$, we repeatedly evolve\n$\\boldsymbol\\phi$ through the end of inflation from various initial conditions,\ncataloguing a representative sample of trajectories associated with that model.\nIn order to impose the anthropic constraint of a universe in which inflation\nends and normal expansion takes over, we impose a minimum with $V=0$ and only\nconsider trajectories that reach that minimum. We simulate each path evolution\nstepwise through $\\boldsymbol\\phi$-space while simultaneously computing $V$ and\nits derivatives along the path via a constrained Gaussian random process. When\n$N$ is large, this method significantly reduces computational load as compared\nto methods which generate the potential landscape all at once. Even so, the\ncovariance matrix $\\boldsymbol\\Gamma$ of constraints on $V$ can quickly become\nlarge and cumbersome. To solve this problem, we present data compression\nalgorithms to prioritize the necessary information already simulated, then keep\nan arbitrarily large portion.

Like t-SNE, it converts distances between data\npoints to joint probabilities and tries to minimize the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence between the joint probabilities of high-dimensional data $X$ and\nlow-dimensional embedding $Y$. However, unlike Euclidean space, hyperbolic\nspace is inhomogeneous: A volume could contain a lot more points at a location\nfar from the origin.

Automatic methods\nhave limited effectiveness due to the variety of features present in the\nspectra of stars. This complexity often leads to the necessity of manual\nnormalisation which is a time demanding task. The aim of this work is to\ndevelop a fully automated normalisation tool that works with order-merged\nspectra and offers flexible manual fine-tuning, if necessary. The core of the\nproposed method uses the novel fully convolutional deep neural network (SUPP\nNetwork) that was trained to predict a pseudo-continuum. The post-processing\nstep uses smoothing splines that gives access to regressed knots useful for\noptional manual corrections. The active learning technique was applied to deal\nwith possible biases that may arise from training with synthetic spectra and to\nextend the applicability of the proposed method to features absent in this kind\nof spectra. The developed normalisation method was tested with high-resolution\nspectra of stars having spectral types from O to G, and gave root mean squared\n(RMS) error over the set of test stars equal $0.0128$ in the spectral range\nfrom $3900\\,\\r{A}$ to $7000\\,\\r{A}$ and $0.0081$ in the range from\n$4200\\,\\r{A}$ to $7000\\,\\r{A}$.

The size of the overshoot depends on the applied\nshear rate and is related to relaxation mechanisms such as reptation, chain\nstretch and convective constraint release. Previous experimental work shows\nthat melts subjected to interrupted shear flows exhibit a smaller overshoot\nwhen sheared after partial relaxation. This has been shown to be consistent\nwith predictions by constitutive models. Here, we report molecular dynamics\nsimulations of interrupted shear of polymer melts where the shear flow after\nthe relaxation stage is orthogonal to the original applied flow. We observe\nthat, for a given relaxation time, the size of the stress overshoot under\northogonal interrupted shear is larger than observed during parallel\ninterrupted shear, which is not captured by constitutive models. Differences in\nmaxima are also observed for overshoots in the first normal stress and chain\nend-to-end distance. We also show that measurements of the average number of\nentanglements per chain and average orientation at different scales along the\nchain are affected by the change in shear direction, leading to non-monotonic\nrelaxation of the off-diagonal components of orientation and an appearance of a\n'double peak' in the average number of entanglements during the transient. We\npropose that such complex behavior of entanglements is responsible for the\nincrease in the overshoots of stress components, and that models of the\ndynamics of entanglements might be improved upon by considering a tensorial\nmeasurement of entanglements that can be coupled to orientation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 01:33:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 20:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

Unfortunately, practical transportation\nsystems have dynamic, multi-attribute costs and the state-of-the-art technical\napproaches proposed in the literature are infeasible for practical deployment.\nIn this paper, we offer a paradigm shift to selfish routing via characterizing\nidiosyncratic, multi-attribute costs at boundedly-rational travelers, as well\nas improving network efficiency using strategic information design.\nSpecifically, we model the interaction between the system and travelers as a\nStackelberg game, where travelers adopt multi-attribute logit responses. We\nmodel the strategic information design as an optimization problem, and develop\na novel approximate algorithm to steer Logit Response travelers towards social\nwelfare using strategic Information design (in short, LoRI). We demonstrate the\nperformance of LoRI on a Wheatstone network with multi-modal route choices at\nthe travelers. In our simulation experiments, we find that LoRI outperforms\nSSSP in terms of system utility, especially when there is a motive mismatch\nbetween the two systems and improves social welfare. For instance, we find that\nLoRI persuades a traveler towards a socially optimal route for 66.66% of the\ntime on average, when compared to SSSP, when the system has 0.3 weight on\ncarbon emissions. However, we also present a tradeoff between system\nperformance and runtime in our simulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 02:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

Our strategy for gradient\ncompression is to sequentially perform block sparsification, dimensional\nreduction, and quantization. Thanks to gradient sparsification and\nquantization, our strategy can achieve a higher compression ratio than one-bit\ngradient compression. For accurate aggregation of the local gradients from the\ncompressed signals at the PS, we put forth an approximate minimum mean square\nerror (MMSE) approach for gradient reconstruction using the\nexpectation-maximization generalized-approximate-message-passing (EM-GAMP)\nalgorithm. Assuming Bernoulli Gaussian-mixture prior, this algorithm\niteratively updates the posterior mean and variance of local gradients from the\ncompressed signals.

Existing methods typically\nformulate this task as a conditional inpainting problem, which requires users\nto draw an extra mask indicating the region to modify in addition to sketches.\nThe masked regions are regarded as holes and filled by an inpainting model\nconditioned on the sketch. With this formulation, paired training data can be\neasily obtained by randomly creating masks and extracting edges or contours.\nAlthough this setup simplifies data preparation and model design, it\ncomplicates user interaction and discards useful information in masked regions.\nTo this end, we investigate a new paradigm of sketch-based image manipulation:\nmask-free local image manipulation, which only requires sketch inputs from\nusers and utilizes the entire original image. Given an image and sketch, our\nmodel automatically predicts the target modification region and encodes it into\na structure agnostic style vector. A generator then synthesizes the new image\ncontent based on the style vector and sketch. The manipulated image is finally\nproduced by blending the generator output into the modification region of the\noriginal image. Our model can be trained in a self-supervised fashion by\nlearning the reconstruction of an image region from the style vector and\nsketch. The proposed method offers simpler and more intuitive user workflows\nfor sketch-based image manipulation and provides better results than previous\napproaches.

We show that CO$_2$\nhydrates can become buoyant to the upper ice-water interface under plausible\noceanic conditions, namely, if the temperature or salinity conditions of a\ndensity-stratified two-layer water column evolve to permit the onset of\nconvection that generates a single mixed layer.

As such, neural architecture\nsearch (NAS) algorithms take these two constraints into account when generating\na new architecture. However, efficiency metrics such as latency are typically\nhardware dependent requiring the NAS algorithm to either measure or predict the\narchitecture latency. Measuring the latency of every evaluated architecture\nadds a significant amount of time to the NAS process. Here we propose\nMicroprocessor A Priori for Latency Estimation MAPLE that does not rely on\ntransfer learning or domain adaptation but instead generalizes to new hardware\nby incorporating a prior hardware characteristics during training. MAPLE takes\nadvantage of a novel quantitative strategy to characterize the underlying\nmicroprocessor by measuring relevant hardware performance metrics, yielding a\nfine-grained and expressive hardware descriptor. Moreover, the proposed MAPLE\nbenefits from the tightly coupled I/O between the CPU and GPU and their\ndependency to predict DNN latency on GPUs while measuring microprocessor\nperformance hardware counters from the CPU feeding the GPU hardware. Through\nthis quantitative strategy as the hardware descriptor, MAPLE can generalize to\nnew hardware via a few shot adaptation strategy where with as few as 3 samples\nit exhibits a 6% improvement over state-of-the-art methods requiring as much as\n10 samples.

The new template is based on a\nspectrum of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 493 obtained with the Hubble\nSpace Telescope. In comparison with the canonical iron template object I Zw 1,\nMrk 493 has narrower broad-line widths, lower reddening, and a less extreme\nEddington ratio, making it a superior choice for template construction. We\ncarried out a multicomponent spectral decomposition to produce a template\nincorporating all permitted and forbidden lines of Fe II identified in the Mrk\n493 spectrum over this wavelength range, as well as lines from Ti II, Ni II,\nand Cr II. We tested the template by fitting it to AGN spectra spanning a broad\nrange of iron emission properties, and we present a detailed comparison with\nfits using other widely used monolithic and multi-component iron emission\ntemplates. The new template generally provides the best fit (lowest $\\chi^2$)\ncompared to other widely used monolithic empirical templates. In addition, the\nnew template yields more accurate spectral measurements including a\nsignificantly better match of the derived Balmer line profiles (H$\\beta$,\nH$\\gamma$, H$\\delta$), in contrast with results obtained using the other\ntemplates. Our comparison tests show that the choice of iron template can\nintroduce a systematic bias in measurements of the H$\\beta$ line width, which\nconsequently impacts single-epoch black hole mass estimates by $\\sim0.1$ dex on\naverage and possibly up to $\\sim0.3-0.5$ dex individually.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 04:23:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 03:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

In this\nwork, we focus on a challenging task of land analysis, i.e., automatic\nextraction of traffic roads from remote sensing data, which has widespread\napplications in urban development and expansion estimation. Nevertheless,\nconventional methods either only utilized the limited information of aerial\nimages, or simply fused multimodal information (e.g., vehicle trajectories),\nthus cannot well recognize unconstrained roads. To facilitate this problem, we\nintroduce a novel neural network framework termed Cross-Modal Message\nPropagation Network (CMMPNet), which fully benefits the complementary different\nmodal data (i.e., aerial images and crowdsourced trajectories). Specifically,\nCMMPNet is composed of two deep Auto-Encoders for modality-specific\nrepresentation learning and a tailor-designed Dual Enhancement Module for\ncross-modal representation refinement.

The bottleneck step\nin most CGM is maximum inner product search (MaxIP), which requires a linear\nscan over the parameters.

These disturbances are introduced upstream of the separation\nzone and they lead to the appearance of oblique waves further downstream.

First, we extract linguist features under five categories (fluency,\npronunciation, content, grammar and vocabulary, and acoustic) and train models\nto grade responses. In comparison, we find that the regression-based models\nperform equivalent to or better than the classification approach. Second, we\nperform ablation studies to understand the impact of each of the feature and\nfeature categories on the performance of proficiency grading. Further, to\nunderstand individual feature contributions, we present the importance of top\nfeatures on the best performing algorithm for the grading task.

In this paper, we provide a large-scale densely-labeled multi-camera\ntracking dataset in five different environments with the help of an\nauto-annotation system. The system uses overlapped and calibrated depth and RGB\ncameras to build a high-performance 3D tracker that automatically generates the\n3D tracking results. The 3D tracking results are projected to each RGB camera\nview using camera parameters to create 2D tracking results.

In this paper,\nwe consider the scenario where a model is distributed to multiple buyers, among\nwhich a malicious buyer attempts to attack another buyer. The malicious buyer\nprobes its copy of the model to search for adversarial samples and then\npresents the found samples to the victim's copy of the model in order to\nreplicate the attack. We point out that by distributing different copies of the\nmodel to different buyers, we can mitigate the attack such that adversarial\nsamples found on one copy would not work on another copy. We observed that\ntraining a model with different randomness indeed mitigates such replication to\na certain degree. However, there is no guarantee and retraining is\ncomputationally expensive. A number of works extended the retraining method to\nenhance the differences among models. However, a very limited number of models\ncan be produced using such methods and the computational cost becomes even\nhigher. Therefore, we propose a flexible parameter rewriting method that\ndirectly modifies the model's parameters. This method does not require\nadditional training and is able to generate a large number of copies in a more\ncontrollable manner, where each copy induces different adversarial regions.\nExperimentation studies show that rewriting can significantly mitigate the\nattacks while retaining high classification accuracy. For instance, on GTSRB\ndataset with respect to Hop Skip Jump attack, using attractor-based rewriter\ncan reduce the success rate of replicating the attack to 0.5% while\nindependently training copies with different randomness can reduce the success\nrate to 6.5%.

Quadruped robots primarily\nuse VIO because they require fast localization for control and path planning.\nHowever, since quadruped robots are mainly used outdoors, extraneous features\nextracted from the sky or ground cause tracking failures. In addition, the\nquadruped robots' walking motion cause wobbling, which lowers the localization\naccuracy due to the camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU). To overcome\nthese limitations, many researchers use VIO with leg kinematic constraints.\nHowever, since the quadruped robot's walking motion varies according to the\ncontroller, gait, quadruped robots' velocity, and so on, these factors should\nbe considered in the process of adding leg kinematic constraints.

In response, an\nalgorithm may change the allocation of the resource, paying movement cost as\ndetermined by the metric and service cost $c_t(x_{r_t})$, where $x_{r_t}$ is\nthe fraction of the resource at $r_t$ at the end of time $t$.

We used a semi-automatic way to\nconstruct the dataset: after camera calibration and image registration, high\naccuracy disparity images can be obtained from the depth images. In total,\nPlantStereo contains 812 image pairs covering a diverse set of plants: spinach,\ntomato, pepper and pumpkin.

Extensive experiments on different\nmodels and plants show that compared with ground truth in integer accuracy,\nhigh accuracy disparity images provided by PlantStereo can remarkably improve\nthe training effect of deep learning models.

These\nmodels, however, usually designate the similar receptive fields of each token\nfeature within each layer. Such a constraint inevitably limits the ability of\neach self-attention layer in capturing multi-scale features, thereby leading to\nperformance degradation in handling images with multiple objects of different\nscales. To address this issue, we propose a novel and generic strategy, termed\nshunted self-attention~(SSA), that allows ViTs to model the attentions at\nhybrid scales per attention layer. The key idea of SSA is to inject\nheterogeneous receptive field sizes into tokens: before computing the\nself-attention matrix, it selectively merges tokens to represent larger object\nfeatures while keeping certain tokens to preserve fine-grained features. This\nnovel merging scheme enables the self-attention to learn relationships between\nobjects with different sizes and simultaneously reduces the token numbers and\nthe computational cost. Extensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate\nthe superiority of SSA. Specifically, the SSA-based transformer achieves 84.0\\%\nTop-1 accuracy and outperforms the state-of-the-art Focal Transformer on\nImageNet with only half of the model size and computation cost, and surpasses\nFocal Transformer by 1.3 mAP on COCO and 2.9 mIOU on ADE20K under similar\nparameter and computation cost.

Substructures induced\nby young planets in protoplanetary disks can be used to infer the potential\nyoung planets' properties. Hydrodynamical simulations have been used to study\nthe relationships between the planet's properties and these disk features.\nHowever, these attempts either fine-tuned numerical simulations to fit one\nprotoplanetary disk at a time, which was time-consuming, or azimuthally\naveraged simulation results to derive some linear relationships between the gap\nwidth/depth and the planet mass, which lost information on asymmetric features\nin disks. To cope with these disadvantages, we developed Planet Gap neural\nNetworks (PGNets) to infer the planet mass from 2D images. We first fit the\ngridded data in Zhang et al.

Then, we\nquadrupled the data set by running additional simulations with near-randomly\nsampled parameters, and derived the planet mass and disk viscosity together as\na regression problem. The classification approach can reach an accuracy of\n92\\%, whereas the regression approach can reach 1$\\sigma$ as 0.16 dex for\nplanet mass and 0.23 dex for disk viscosity. We can reproduce the degeneracy\nscaling $\\alpha$ $\\propto$ $M_p^3$ found in the linear fitting method, which\nmeans that the CNN method can even be used to find degeneracy relationship. The\ngradient-weighted class activation mapping effectively confirms that PGNets use\nproper disk features to constrain the planet mass.

To reduce the acquisition time,\nvarious methods have been proposed. However, these methods failed to\nreconstruct images with a clear structure for two main reasons. Firstly,\nsimilar patches widely exist in MR images, while most previous deep\nlearning-based methods ignore this property and only adopt CNN to learn local\ninformation. Secondly, the existing methods only use clear images to constrain\nthe upper bound of the solution space, while the lower bound is not\nconstrained, so that a better parameter of the network cannot be obtained. To\naddress these problems, we propose a Contrastive Learning for Local and Global\nLearning MRI Reconstruction Network (CLGNet). Specifically, according to the\nFourier theory, each value in the Fourier domain is calculated from all the\nvalues in Spatial domain. Therefore, we propose a Spatial and Fourier Layer\n(SFL) to simultaneously learn the local and global information in Spatial and\nFourier domains. Moreover, compared with self-attention and transformer, the\nSFL has a stronger learning ability and can achieve better performance in less\ntime. Based on the SFL, we design a Spatial and Fourier Residual block as the\nmain component of our model. Meanwhile, to constrain the lower bound and upper\nbound of the solution space, we introduce contrastive learning, which can pull\nthe result closer to the clear image and push the result further away from the\nundersampled image. Extensive experimental results on different datasets and\nacceleration rates demonstrate that the proposed CLGNet achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 08:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

However, these methods are usually data-hungry with\nexpensive and time-consuming dense point cloud annotations. To alleviate the\nannotation cost, unlabeled or weakly labeled data is still less explored in the\ntask. In this paper, we introduce the first semi-supervised point cloud\ninstance segmentation framework (SPIB) using both labeled and unlabelled\nbounding boxes as supervision. To be specific, our SPIB architecture involves a\ntwo-stage learning procedure. For stage one, a bounding box proposal generation\nnetwork is trained under a semi-supervised setting with perturbation\nconsistency regularization (SPCR). The regularization works by enforcing an\ninvariance of the bounding box predictions over different perturbations applied\nto the input point clouds, to provide self-supervision for network learning.\nFor stage two, the bounding box proposals with SPCR are grouped into some\nsubsets, and the instance masks are mined inside each subset with a novel\nsemantic propagation module and a property consistency graph module. Moreover,\nwe introduce a novel occupancy ratio guided refinement module to refine the\ninstance masks. Extensive experiments on the challenging ScanNet v2 dataset\ndemonstrate our method can achieve competitive performance compared with the\nrecent fully-supervised methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 08:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 04:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

Stars in the AM overdensities that travel over many kpc in\nradius trace extended density ridges in RVphi space and overdensities in the UV\nplane of a SNd-like region, similar to those observed in the Gaia data.\nSimilarly, the AM space of the MW contains several overdensities which\ncorrelate with a wave-like radial velocity pattern; this pattern is also\nreproduced by stars well beyond the SNd. We find that the fraction of Gaia\nstars located near their guiding centers shows three large-scale structures\nthat approximately coincide with the MW spiral arms traced by distributions of\nmaser sources in the Sagittarius, Local, and Perseus arms. Similar to the\nmodel, the stars in the AM overdensities follow the main RVphi ridges. When\nthese ridges cross the SNd, they can be matched with the main UV features.

The growing planet may reach the\nso-called pebble isolation mass, at which it induces a pressure bump that\nblocks inward drifting pebbles exterior to its orbit, thereby stalling core\ngrowth by pebble accretion. In recent hydrodynamic simulations, pebble\nfiltration by the pressure bump depends on several parameters including core\nmass, disc structure, turbulent viscosity and pebble size. We investigated how\naccretion of multiple, instead of single, pebble species affects core growth\nrates, and how the dependence of pebble isolation mass on turbulent viscosity\nand pebble size sets the final core masses. We performed numerical simulations\nin viscous 1D disc, where maximal grain sizes were regulated by grain growth,\nfragmentation and drift limits. We confirm that core growth rates and final\ncore masses are sensitive to three key parameters: threshold velocity at which\npebbles fragment on collision, turbulent viscosity and distribution of pebble\nspecies, which yield a diversity of planetary cores.

Using the GENEC\nstellar evolution code, we study how these new rates impact the C-burning\nphases in two sets of stellar models for stars with 12 M$_{\\odot}$ and 25\nM$_{\\odot}$ initial masses chosen to be highly representative of the diversity\nof massive stars. The effective temperatures of C-burning in both sets of\nstellar models are entirely covered by the sensitivity of the present\nexperimental data, and no extrapolation of the rates is required. Although, the\nrates may differ by more than an order of magnitude for temperatures typical of\nC-burning, the impacts on the stellar structures during that phase remain\nmodest. This is a consequence of the readjustment of the stellar structure to a\nchange of nuclear reaction rate for reactions important for energy production.\nFor the hindrance case, the C-burning phase is found to occur at central\ntemperatures 10\\% higher than with the hindrance plus resonance rate. Its\nC-burning lifetime is reduced by a factor of two.

The solar\nradius increases as the observation at radio frequency decreases, indicating\nthat each emission originates higher in the atmosphere. Thus, different layers\nof the solar atmosphere can be probed by observing at multiple wavelengths. In\nthis work, we determined the average radius and limb brightening at 100, 212,\n230, and 405 GHz, using data from the Solar Submillimeter Telescope and ALMA's\nsingle-dish observations. For the first time, limb brightening values for\nfrequencies of 212 and 405 GHz were estimated. At sub-THz frequencies, the\nobserved limb brightening may affect the solar radius measurements. We use two\ndifferent and well known approaches to determine the radius: the half-power\nmethod and the inflection-point method. We investigate how the antenna beam\nsize and the limb brightening level, LB, can affect the radius measurements\nusing both methods. Our results showed that the inflection-point method is the\nleast affected by these parameters, and should thus be used for solar radius\nestimates at radio wavelengths.

In this paper, we aim at making a step towards a unified\napproach for image editing. To do so, we propose EdiBERT, a bi-directional\ntransformer trained in the discrete latent space built by a vector-quantized\nauto-encoder. We argue that such a bidirectional model is suited for image\nmanipulation since any patch can be re-sampled conditionally to the whole\nimage.

A wide range of\nplanetary climate systems involve understanding non-dilute condensable\nsubstances and their influence on climate dynamics. There has been progress on\nlarge-scale dynamical effects and on 1D convection parameterization, but\nresolved 3D moist convection remains unexplored in non-dilute conditions,\nthough it can have a profound impact on temperature/humidity profiles and cloud\nstructure. We tackle this problem for pure-steam atmospheres using\nthree-dimensional, high-resolution numerical simulations of convection in\npost-runaway atmospheres where the water reservoir at the surface has been\nexhausted. We show that the atmosphere is comprised of two characteristic\nregions, an upper condensing region dominated by gravity waves and a lower\nnoncondensing region characterized by convective overturning cells. Velocities\nin the condensing region are much smaller than those in the lower noncondensing\nregion, and the horizontal temperature variation is small overall. Condensation\nin the thermal photosphere is largely driven by radiative cooling and tends to\nbe statistically homogeneous. Some condensation also happens deeper, near the\nboundary of the condensing region, due to triggering by gravity waves and\nconvective penetrations and exhibit random patchiness. This qualitative\nstructure is insensitive to varying model parameters, but quantitative details\nmay differ. Our results confirm theoretical expectations that atmospheres close\nto the pure-steam limit do not have organized deep convective plumes in the\ncondensing region. The generalized convective parameterization scheme discussed\nin Ding & Pierrehumbert (2016) is appropriate to handle the basic structure of\natmospheres near the pure-steam limit but is difficult to capture gravity waves\nand their mixing that appear in 3D convection-resolving models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 10:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

While depression clues may be reflected by human facial behaviours of\nvarious temporal scales, most existing approaches either focused on modelling\ndepression from short-term or video-level facial behaviours. In this sense, we\npropose a two-stage framework that models depression severity from multi-scale\nshort-term and video-level facial behaviours. The short-term depressive\nbehaviour modelling stage first deep learns depression-related facial\nbehavioural features from multiple short temporal scales, where a Depression\nFeature Enhancement (DFE) module is proposed to enhance the depression-related\nclues for all temporal scales and remove non-depression noises. Then, the\nvideo-level depressive behaviour modelling stage proposes two novel graph\nencoding strategies, i.e., Sequential Graph Representation (SEG) and Spectral\nGraph Representation (SPG), to re-encode all short-term features of the target\nvideo into a video-level graph representation, summarizing depression-related\nmulti-scale video-level temporal information. As a result, the produced graph\nrepresentations predict depression severity using both short-term and long-term\nfacial beahviour patterns. The experimental results on AVEC 2013 and AVEC 2014\ndatasets show that the proposed DFE module constantly enhanced the depression\nseverity estimation performance for various CNN models while the SPG is\nsuperior than other video-level modelling methods. More importantly, the result\nachieved for the proposed two-stage framework shows its promising and solid\nperformance compared to widely-used one-stage modelling approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 10:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

In this paper, we conceptualize one-shot recognition of emotions\nin context -- a new problem aimed at recognizing human affect states in finer\nparticle level from a single support sample. To address this challenging task,\nwe follow the deep metric learning paradigm and introduce a multi-modal emotion\nembedding approach which minimizes the distance of the same-emotion embeddings\nby leveraging complementary information of human appearance and the semantic\nscene context obtained through a semantic segmentation network. All streams of\nour context-aware model are optimized jointly using weighted triplet loss and\nweighted cross entropy loss. We conduct thorough experiments on both,\ncategorical and numerical emotion recognition tasks of the Emotic dataset\nadapted to our one-shot recognition problem, revealing that categorizing human\naffect from a single example is a hard task. Still, all variants of our model\nclearly outperform the random baseline, while leveraging the semantic scene\ncontext consistently improves the learnt representations, setting\nstate-of-the-art results in one-shot emotion recognition.

A malicious attacker with jamming ability\ncan exploit the vulnerability of the k-core structure to attack the network and\ninvalidate the network analysis methods, e.g., reducing the k-shell values of\nnodes can deceive graph algorithms, leading to the wrong decisions. In this\npaper, we investigate the robustness of the k-core structure under adversarial\nattacks by deleting edges, for the first time. Firstly, we give the general\ndefinition of targeted k-core attack, map it to the set cover problem which is\nNP-hard, and further introduce a series of evaluation metrics to measure the\nperformance of attack methods. Then, we propose $Q$ index theoretically as the\nprobability that the terminal node of an edge does not belong to the innermost\ncore, which is further used to guide the design of our heuristic attack\nmethods, namely COREATTACK and GreedyCOREATTACK. The experiments on a variety\nof real-world networks demonstrate that our methods behave much better than a\nseries of baselines, in terms of much smaller Edge Change Rate (ECR) and False\nAttack Rate (FAR), achieving state-of-the-art attack performance. More\nimpressively, for certain real-world networks, only deleting one edge from the\nk-core may lead to the collapse of the innermost core, even if this core\ncontains dozens of nodes. Such a phenomenon indicates that the k-core structure\ncould be extremely vulnerable under adversarial attacks, and its robustness\nthus should be carefully addressed to ensure the security of many graph\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 10:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

A fundamental modeling assumption\nin several of these extensions is that the input corpora are in the form of\ndocument pairs whose constituent documents share a single topic distribution.\nHowever, this assumption is strong for comparable corpora that consist of\ndocuments thematically similar to an extent only, which are, in turn, the most\ncommonly available or easy to obtain. In this paper we relax this assumption by\nproposing for the paired documents to have separate, yet bound topic\ndistributions. % a binding mechanism between the distributions of the paired\ndocuments. We suggest that the strength of the bound should depend on each\npair's semantic similarity. To estimate the similarity of documents that are\nwritten in different languages we use cross-lingual word embeddings that are\nlearned with shallow neural networks. We evaluate the proposed binding\nmechanism by extending two topic models: a bilingual adaptation of LDA that\nassumes bag-of-words inputs and a model that incorporates part of the text\nstructure in the form of boundaries of semantically coherent segments. To\nassess the performance of the novel topic models we conduct intrinsic and\nextrinsic experiments on five bilingual, comparable corpora of English\ndocuments with French, German, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese documents.

In\nthis study, we propose an integrated framework called Deep Autoencoder with\nNeural Response (DAE-NR), which incorporates information from ANN and the\nvisual cortex to achieve better image reconstruction performance and higher\nneural representation similarity between biological and artificial neurons. The\nsame visual stimuli (i.e., natural images) are input to both the mice brain and\nDAE-NR.

For the neural spike encoding task, the\nfeatures derived from a specific hidden layer of the encoder are transformed by\na mapping function to predict the ground-truth neural response under the\nconstraint of image reconstruction.

In DAE-NR, the learning process of encoder, mapping\nfunction and decoder are all implicitly constrained by these two tasks.

In this paper we\ndevelop an algorithm that realizes the learning rate drop\n$\\textit{automatically}$. The proposed method, that we refer to as AutoDrop, is\nmotivated by the observation that the angular velocity of the model parameters,\ni.e., the velocity of the changes of the convergence direction, for a fixed\nlearning rate initially increases rapidly and then progresses towards soft\nsaturation. At saturation the optimizer slows down thus the angular velocity\nsaturation is a good indicator for dropping the learning rate. After the drop,\nthe angular velocity \"resets\" and follows the previously described pattern - it\nincreases again until saturation. We show that our method improves over SOTA\ntraining approaches: it accelerates the training of DL models and leads to a\nbetter generalization. We also show that our method does not require any extra\nhyperparameter tuning. AutoDrop is furthermore extremely simple to implement\nand computationally cheap.

In the analysis of stellar spectra, the\nnumerical model often needs to account for binary companions and 3D structures\nin the stellar envelopes. The enigmatic binary (or multiple) system LB-1\nconstitutes a perfect example of such a complex multi-D problem. Aims: To\nimprove our understanding of the LB-1 system, we directly modelled the\nphase-dependent H-alpha line profiles of this system. To this end, we developed\na multi-purpose binary-object spectral-synthesis code in 3D (BOSS-3D). Methods:\nBOSS-3D calculates synthetic line profiles for a given state of the\ncircumstellar material. The standard pz-geometry commonly used for single stars\nis extended by defining individual coordinate systems for each involved object\nand by accounting for the appropriate coordinate transformations. The code is\nthen applied to the LB-1 system, considering two main hypotheses, a binary\ncontaining a stripped star and Be star, or a B star and a black hole with a\ndisc. Results: Comparing these two scenarios, neither model can reproduce the\ndetailed phase-dependent shape of the H-alpha line profiles. A satisfactory\nmatch with the observations, however, is obtained by invoking a disc around the\nprimary object in addition to the Be-star disc or the black-hole accretion\ndisc. Conclusions: The developed code can be used to model synthetic line\nprofiles for a wide variety of binary systems, ranging from transit spectra of\nplanetary atmospheres, to post-asymptotic giant branch binaries including\ncircumstellar and circumbinary discs and massive-star binaries with stellar\nwinds and disc systems. For the LB-1 system, our modelling provides strong\nevidence that each object in the system contains a disc-like structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 12:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

In this paper, we address this challenge by utilizing a stochastic\none-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model. ODT aims to resolve all relevant scales\nof a turbulent flow for a one-dimensional domain. Here ODT is applied to\nturbulent channel flow as stand-alone tool. The ODT domain is a wall-normal\nline that is aligned with the mean shear. The free model parameters are\ncalibrated once for the turbulent velocity boundary layer at a fixed Reynolds\nnumber. After that, we use ODT to investigate the Schmidt ($Sc$), Reynolds\n($Re$), and Peclet ($Pe$) number dependence of the scalar boundary-layer\nstructure, turbulent fluctuations, transient surface fluxes, mixing, and\ntransfer to a wall. We demonstrate that the model is able to resolve relevant\nwall-normal transport processes across the turbulent boundary layer and that it\ncaptures state-space statistics of the surface scalar-flux fluctuations. In\naddition, we show that the predicted mean scalar transfer, which is quantified\nby the Sherwood ($Sh$) number, self-consistently reproduces established scaling\nregimes and asymptotic relations. For high asymptotic $Sc$ and $Re$, ODT\nresults fall between the Dittus--Boelter, $Sh\\sim Re^{4/5}\\,Sc^{2/5}$, and\nColburn, $Sh\\sim Re^{4/5}\\,Sc^{1/3}$, scalings but they are closer to the\nformer.

The\ndevelopment of CDMER is faced with two key problems: 1) the severe feature\ndistribution gap between the source and target databases; 2) the feature\nrepresentation bottleneck of ME such local and subtle facial expressions. To\nsolve these problems, this paper proposes a novel Transfer Group Sparse\nRegression method, namely TGSR, which aims to 1) optimize the measurement and\nbetter alleviate the difference between the source and target databases, and 2)\nhighlight the valid facial regions to enhance extracted features, by the\noperation of selecting the group features from the raw face feature, where each\nregion is associated with a group of raw face feature, i.e., the salient facial\nregion selection.

However, body shape parameters in widely-used\nbody models (e.g. SMPL) control global deformations over the whole body\nsurface. Distributions over these global shape parameters are unable to\nmeaningfully capture uncertainty in shape estimates associated with\nlocally-occluded body parts. In contrast, we present a method that (i) predicts\ndistributions over local body shape in the form of semantic body measurements\nand (ii) uses a linear mapping to transform a local distribution over body\nmeasurements to a global distribution over SMPL shape parameters.

We further examine the equation of states in the\nhigh pressure regime, and our RPA+rSE results, complemented with phonon\ncontributions, show excellent agreement with available experimental data.\nFinally, by computing the Gibbs free energies for both the FCC and HCP at\ndifferent temperatures, we are able to generate a $T$-$P$ phase diagram for the\nAr crystal, disclosing the pressure-temperature range for each phase. Our\ncalculations show that the FCC phase has a slightly larger entropy and volume\nthan HCP phase at the temperature and pressure condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 14:14:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Existing methods either ignore the rich topological information or\nsacrifice plasticity for stability. To this end, we present Hierarchical\nPrototype Networks (HPNs) which extract different levels of abstract knowledge\nin the form of prototypes to represent the continuously expanded graphs.\nSpecifically, we first leverage a set of Atomic Feature Extractors (AFEs) to\nencode both the elemental attribute information and the topological structure\nof the target node. Next, we develop HPNs to adaptively select relevant AFEs\nand represent each node with three levels of prototypes. In this way, whenever\na new category of nodes is given, only the relevant AFEs and prototypes at each\nlevel will be activated and refined, while others remain uninterrupted to\nmaintain the performance over existing nodes. Theoretically, we first\ndemonstrate that the memory consumption of HPNs is bounded regardless of how\nmany tasks are encountered. Then, we prove that under mild constraints,\nlearning new tasks will not alter the prototypes matched to previous data,\nthereby eliminating the forgetting problem.

For example, previous\nstudies do not necessarily agree on the chemical abundances of Sequoia stars,\nwhich are important for understanding its nature. Aim: We characterize the\nchemical properties of a sample of stars from Sequoia by determining\nhigh-precision abundances. Methods: We measure abundances of Na, Mg, Si, Ti,\nCr, Mn, Ni, Zn, Y, and Ba from a differential abundance analysis on high\nsignal-to-noise ratio, high-resolution spectra from new observations and from\narchival data. We compare precisely-measured chemical abundances of 12 Sequoia\ncandidates with those of typical halo stars from literature, which include also\nstars from Gaia-Enceladus. This allows us to characterize Sequoia and compare\nit to another Galactic building block. The comparison is made after putting all\nthe abundances onto the same scale using standard stars. Results: There are\nsignificant difference in [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and\n[Y/Fe] between Sequoia and Gaia-Enceladus stars at $-1.8\\lesssim\n[\\mathrm{Fe/H}]\\lesssim -1.4$ in the sense that these abundance ratios are\nlower in Sequoia.

It is often used in machine learning to identify important predictor\nvariables. This task, variable selection, typically amounts to fitting a\nlogistic regression model regularized by a convex combination of $\\ell_1$ and\n$\\ell_{2}^{2}$ penalties. Since modern big data sets can contain hundreds of\nthousands to billions of predictor variables, variable selection methods depend\non efficient and robust optimization algorithms to perform well.\nState-of-the-art algorithms for variable selection, however, were not\ntraditionally designed to handle big data sets; they either scale poorly in\nsize or are prone to produce unreliable numerical results. It therefore remains\nchallenging to perform variable selection on big data sets without access to\nadequate and costly computational resources.

This yields a\npre-softmax activation of the correct class that is significantly larger than\nthe remaining activations. Recent evidence from the literature suggests that\nloss functions that embed implicit or explicit maximization of the entropy of\npredictions yield state-of-the-art calibration performances.

We also observe better generalization and application to a\nreal-world setting from KARL on unseen entities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 14:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

We have developed the user-friendly framework\nSPINNAKER to model radio haloes with either pure advection or diffusion,\nallowing us to study both diffusion coefficients and advection speeds in nearby\ngalaxies. Using these models, we show that we can identify galaxies with winds\nusing both morphology and radio spectral indices of radio haloes. Advective\nradio haloes are ubiquitous, indicating that already fairly low values of the\nstar formation rate (SFR) surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$) can trigger\ngalactic winds. The advection speeds scale with SFR, $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$, and\nrotation speed as expected for stellar feedback-driven winds. Accelerating\nwinds are in agreement with our radio spectral index data, but this is\nsensitive to the magnetic field parametrisation, so that constant wind speeds\ncannot be ruled out either. The question to what extent cosmic rays can be a\ndriving force behind winds is still an open issue and we discuss only in\npassing how a simple iso-thermal wind model could fit our data.

We use\nexact diagonalizations on the spherical as well as toroidal geometry by taking\ninto account the effect of realistic anisotropies that break the spin/valley\nsymmetry of the pure Coulomb interaction. We also use a variational method\nbased on eigenstates of the fully $SU(4)$ symmetric limit. For all the\nfractions we study there are two-component states for which the competing\nphases are generalizations of those occurring at neutrality $\\nu_G=0$. They are\nferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, charge-density wave and K\\'ekul\\'e phases,\ndepending on the values of Ising or XY anisotropies in valley space. The\nvarying spin-valley content of the states leads to ground state quantum numbers\nthat are different from the $\\nu_G=0$ case.

The addition of anisotropies leads to the formation of\nnew states that have no counterpart at $\\nu_G=0$.

Accomplishing\nthese aims is important for critical systems in safety, security, and defence.\nIn parallel, OoD detection is challenging since deep neural network classifiers\nset high confidence to OoD samples away from the training data. To address such\nlimitations, we propose the Few-shot ROBust (FROB) model for classification and\nfew-shot OoD detection. We devise FROB for improved robustness and reliable\nconfidence prediction for few-shot OoD detection. We generate the support\nboundary of the normal class distribution and combine it with few-shot Outlier\nExposure (OE). We propose a self-supervised learning few-shot confidence\nboundary methodology based on generative and discriminative models. The\ncontribution of FROB is the combination of the generated boundary in a\nself-supervised learning manner and the imposition of low confidence at this\nlearned boundary. FROB implicitly generates strong adversarial samples on the\nboundary and forces samples from OoD, including our boundary, to be less\nconfident by the classifier. FROB achieves generalization to unseen OoD with\napplicability to unknown, in the wild, test sets that do not correlate to the\ntraining datasets. To improve robustness, FROB redesigns OE to work even for\nzero-shots. By including our boundary, FROB reduces the threshold linked to the\nmodel's few-shot robustness; it maintains the OoD performance approximately\nindependent of the number of few-shots. The few-shot robustness analysis\nevaluation of FROB on different sets and on One-Class Classification (OCC) data\nshows that FROB achieves competitive performance and outperforms benchmarks in\nterms of robustness to the outlier few-shot sample population and variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 15:20:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 15:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

Such instabilities appear as the input\nvaries at some critical rates and cannot, in general, be understood in terms of\nautonomous bifurcations in the frozen system with a fixed-in-time input.\n  This paper develops an accessible mathematical framework for R-tipping in\nmultidimensional nonautonomous dynamical systems with an autonomous future\nlimit. We focus on R-tipping via loss of tracking of base attractors that are\nequilibria in the frozen system, due to crossing what we call regular\nthresholds. These thresholds are associated with regular edge states: compact\nhyperbolic invariant sets with one unstable direction and orientable stable\nmanifold, that lie on a basin boundary in the frozen system. We define\nR-tipping and critical rates for the nonautonomous system in terms of special\nsolutions that limit to a compact invariant set of the future limit system that\nis not an attractor. We focus on the case when the limit set is a regular edge\nstate, which we call the regular R-tipping edge state that anchors the\nassociated regular R-tipping threshold at infinity. We introduce the concept of\nedge tails to rigorously classify R-tipping into reversible, irreversible, and\ndegenerate cases.\n  The main idea is to compactify the problem and use regular edge states of the\nfuture limit system to analyse R-tipping in the nonautonomous system. This\nallows us to give sufficient conditions for the occurrence of R-tipping in\nterms of easily testable properties of the frozen system and input variation,\nand necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of reversible and\nirreversible R-tipping in terms of computationally verifiable (heteroclinic)\nconnections to regular R-tipping edge states in the compactified system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 15:31:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 13:06:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 13:22:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 09:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

In the end, we discuss a\nband-touching condition derived within the averaged Green function method for a\nthermodynamic limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 15:35:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 00:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

Using integration-by-parts relations, associated\nmaster or scalar integrals have to be calculated. For this purpose it appears\nuseful to devise an automated method which recognizes the respective (partial)\ndifferential equations related to the corresponding higher transcendental\nfunctions. We solve these equations through associated recursions of the\nexpansion coefficient of the multivalued formal Taylor series. The expansion\ncoefficients can be determined using either the package {\\tt Sigma} in the case\nof linear difference equations or by applying heuristic methods in the case of\npartial linear difference equations. In the present context a new type of sums\noccurs, the Hurwitz harmonic sums, and generalized versions of them. The code\n{\\tt HypSeries} transforming classes of differential equations into analytic\nseries expansions is described. Also partial difference equations having\nrational solutions and rational function solutions of Pochhammer symbols are\nconsidered, for which the code {\\tt solvePartialLDE} is designed.

Most existing work optimizes power in servers and\nnetworks independently and does not address them together in a holistic fashion\nthat has the potential to achieve greater power savings. In this article, we\npresent PopcornsPro, a cooperative server network framework for energy\noptimization. We present a comprehensive power model for heterogeneous data\ncenter switches along with low power mode designs in combination with the\nserver power model. We design job scheduling algorithms that place tasks onto\nservers in a power-aware manner, such that servers and network switches can\ntake effective advantage of low power state and available network link\ncapacities. Our experimental results show that we are able to achieve\nsignificantly higher savings up to 80% compared to the previously well-known\nserver and network power optimization policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 15:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

The signals of the long-lived dark photons can\nbe significantly enhanced in a new dark photon model in which dark photons are\ncopiously produced in the hidden radiation process. We investigate the\ncapability of various lifetime frontier detectors in probing the parameter\nspace of this model, including the far forward detectors FACET and FASER, the\nfar transverse detector MATHUSLA, and the precision timing detector CMS-MTD. We\nfind that the accessible parameter space is significantly enlarged by the\nhidden radiation process so that FACET, MATHUSLA, and CMS-MTD can probe a much\nlarger parameter space than the so-called minimal model. The parameter space\nprobed by FACET is found to be much larger than FASER, which is largely due to\nthe fact that the former has a larger decay volume and is closer to the\ninteraction point. There also exists some parameter space that can be probed\nboth by the far detectors and by precision timing detectors, so that different\nexperiments can be complementary to each other. A brief overview of the\nlifetime frontier detectors is also given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 15:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

The accurate simulation of this transport can be attained using\nstandard dual-weighted-residual techniques to derive goal-oriented $a$\n$posteriori$ error bounds.

Basic requirements for unsupervised data exploration are\nsimplicity, flexibility and scalability. However, current methods show complex\nparameterizations and strong computational limitations when exploring large\ndata structures across scales. Here, we focus on the t-SNE algorithm and show\nthat a simplified parameter setup with a single control parameter, namely the\nperplexity, can effectively balance local and global data structure\nvisualization. We also designed a chunk\\&mix protocol to efficiently\nparallelize t-SNE and explore data structure across a much wide range of scales\nthan currently available. Our parallel version of the BH-tSNE, namely pt-SNE,\nconverges to good global embedding, comparable to state-of-the-art solutions,\nthough the chunk\\&mix protocol adds little noise and decreases the accuracy at\nthe local scale. Nonetheless, we show that simple post-processing can\nefficiently restore local scale visualization, without any loss of precision at\nthe global scales.

Our setup\nconsists of an event camera and a laser-point projector that uniformly\nilluminates the scene in a raster scanning pattern during 16 ms. Previous\nmethods match events independently of each other, and so they deliver noisy\ndepth estimates at high scanning speeds in the presence of signal latency and\njitter. In contrast, we optimize an energy function designed to exploit event\ncorrelations, called spatio-temporal consistency. The resulting method is\nrobust to event jitter and therefore performs better at higher scanning speeds.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method can deal with high-speed motion and\noutperform state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods based on event cameras,\nreducing the RMSE by 83% on average, for the same acquisition time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 15:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

Here we show that potentials\nconsisting of OPE, two pion exchange (TPE), and a single contact address these\nproblems and yield accurate and renormalization group (RG) invariant phase\nshifts in the $^1S_0$ partial wave. We demonstrate that a leading-order\npotential with TPE can be systematically improved by adding a contact quadratic\nin momenta. For momentum cutoffs below about 500 MeV, the removal of relevant\nphysics from TPE loops needs to be compensated by additional contacts to keep\nRG invariance. Inclusion of the $\\Delta$ isobar degree of freedom in the\npotential does not change the strong contributions of TPE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 15:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

Hence, as the data volume grows, this\nconstant data movement between the CPU and storage devices has emerged as a key\nperformance bottleneck. To improve the situation, researchers have advocated to\nleverage computational storage devices (CSDs), which offer a programmable\ninterface to run user-defined data processing operations close to the storage\nwithout excessive data movement, thus offering performance improvements.\nHowever, despite its potential, building CSD-aware applications remains a\nchallenging task due to the lack of exploration and experimentation with the\nright API and abstraction.

To do so, a robot needs to grasp within a pile,\nsense the number of objects in the grasp before lifting, and predict the number\nof objects that will remain in the grasp after lifting. It is a challenging\nproblem because when making the prediction, the robotic hand is still in the\npile and the objects in the grasp are not observable to vision systems.\nMoreover, some objects that are grasped by the hand before lifting from the\npile may fall out of the grasp when the hand is lifted. This occurs because\nthey were supported by other objects in the pile instead of the fingers of the\nhand. Therefore, a robotic hand should sense the number of objects in a grasp\nusing its tactile sensors before lifting. This paper presents novel\nmulti-object grasping analyzing methods for solving this problem. They include\na grasp volume calculation, tactile force analysis, and a data-driven deep\nlearning approach. The methods have been implemented on a Barrett hand and then\nevaluated in simulations and a real setup with a robotic system. The evaluation\nresults conclude that once the Barrett hand grasps multiple objects in the\npile, the data-driven model can predict, before lifting, the number of objects\nthat will remain in the hand after lifting.

This paper proposes a new approach for extracting\ndrug-related information from French clinical scanned documents while\npreserving patients' privacy. In addition, we deployed our method in a health\ndata management platform where it is used to structure drug medical data and\nhelp patients organize their drug schedules. It can be implemented on any web\nor mobile platform. This work closes the gap between theoretical and practical\nwork by creating an application adapted to real production problems.

Current work presents a proof-of-concept\napproach to multi-modal probabilistic inversion of logs using a single\nevaluation of an artificial deep neural network (DNN).

The proposed approach is verified on the\nreal-time stratigraphic inversion of gamma-ray logs. The multi-modal predictor\noutputs several likely inverse solutions/predictions, providing more accurate\nand realistic solutions than a deterministic regression using a DNN.

The integration between the drone and CR consolidates the drone's\ncapabilities at the heart of the remarkably promising Internet-of-Things (IoT)\ntechnology supported by CR. The highly dynamic network topologies, weakly\nnetworked communication links, reliable line-of-sight (LOS) communication\nlinks, and orbital or flight paths are characteristic features of UAV\ncommunication compared to terrestrial wireless networks. Nevertheless, the\nimplementation of this system is constrained by several severe challenges, such\nas energy efficiency, battery power limitation, spectrum handover, propagation\nchannel modeling, routing protocols, security policy, and delay setbacks. In\nthis paper, we consider the impact of energy scarcity faced by the UAV in\nvarious CR applications.
