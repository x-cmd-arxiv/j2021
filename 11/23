In this study, we\npropose a novel approach designed to take advantage of this angular dependency\nto perform a direct measurement of an external beam radiation angle of\nincidence. A Cerenkov probe composed of a 10-mm long filtered sensitive volume\nof clear PMMA optical fibre was built. Both filtered and raw Cerenkov signals\nfrom the transport fibre were collected through a single 1-mm diameter\ntransport fibre. An independent PSD composed of 10-mm BCF12 scintillating fibre\nwas also used for simultaneous dose measurements. A first series of\nmeasurements aimed at validating the ability to account for the Cerenkov\nelectron energy spectrum dependency by simultaneously measuring the deposited\ndose. A cylindrical phantom was then used to obtain an angular calibration\ncurve for fixed dose irradiations and perform incident angle measurements using\nelectron and photon beams. The beam nominal energy was found to have a\nsignificant impact on the shapes of the angular calibration curves obtained for\nirradiation angle measurements. This can be linked to the electron energy\nspectrum dependency of the Cerenkov emission cone. Irradiation angle\nmeasurements exhibit an absolute mean error of 1.86{\\deg} and 1.02{\\deg} at 6\nand 18 MV, respectively. Similar results were obtained with electron beams and\nthe absolute mean error reaches 1.97, 1.66, 1.45 and 0.95 degrees at 9, 12, 16\nand 20 MeV, respectively. Reducing the numerical aperture of the Cerenkov probe\nleads to an increased angular dependency for the lowest energy while no major\nchanges were observed at higher energy. This allowed irradiation angle\nmeasurements at 6 MeV with a mean absolute error of 4.82{\\deg}. The detector\noffers promising perspectives for external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 16:04:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 17:37:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 16:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

The exposure of two qubits is studied in two different\nqubit-noise configurations, namely, common qubit-noise and independent\nqubit-noise interactions.

We are readily able to\ncomplete contours, shapes, scenes, and even unseen objects when provided with\nimages that contain broken fragments of a connected appearance. In vision\nscience, this ability is largely explained by perceptual grouping: a\nfoundational set of processes in human vision that describes how separated\nelements can be grouped. In this paper, we revisit an algorithm called\nStochastic Completion Fields (SCFs) that mechanizes a set of such processes --\ngood continuity, closure, and proximity -- through contour completion. This\npaper implements a modernized model of the SCF algorithm, and uses it in an\nimage editing framework where we propose novel methods to complete fragmented\ncontours. We show how the SCF algorithm plausibly mimics results in human\nperception. We use the SCF completed contours as guides for inpainting, and\nshow that our guides improve the performance of state-of-the-art models.\nAdditionally, we show that the SCF aids in finding edges in high-noise\nenvironments. Overall, our described algorithms resemble an important mechanism\nin the human visual system, and offer a novel framework that modern computer\nvision models can benefit from.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 16:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

The position dependence of the\nelectric field is parameterised by a linear dependence at the two sides of the\ndiode, and a constant in the centre. The parameters as a function of voltage,\ntemperature and irradiation fluence are determined by fits of the model to the\ndata. For voltages below about 300V all data are well described by the model,\nand the results for the electric field agrees with expectations: Depleted\nhigh-field regions towards the two faces and a constant low electric field in\nthe centre, with values which agrees with the field in an ohmic resistor with\napproximately the intrinsic resistivity of silicon. For conditions at which the\nlow field region disappears and the diode is fully depleted, the method fails.\nThis happens around 300V for the lowest irradiation fluence at -30{\\deg}C, and\nat higher voltages for higher fluences and lower temperatures.

Back in 1999, observations performed with Beppo-SAX lead to the\ndetection of a cyclotron-resonant-scattering feature, which has not been found\nagain with any other instrument. A recent NuSTAR X-ray observation, performed\nduring the brightest phase of the source, allows us to perform sensitive\nsearches for cyclotron-resonant-scattering features in the hard X-ray spectrum\nof the source. We aim to characterise the source by means of temporal and\nspectral X-ray analysis, and to confidently search for the presence of\ncyclotron-resonant-scattering features. The observation was divided into four\ntime intervals in order to characterise each one. Several timing analysis tools\nwere used to obtain the pulse of the neutron star, and the light curves folded\ninto the time intervals. The NuSTAR spectrum in the energy range 3-79 keV was\nused, which was modelled with a power-law continuum emission model with a\nhigh-energy cutoff. We find the pulsations associated with the source in the\nfull observation, which are shifted due to the orbital Doppler effect. We show\nevidence that a cyclotron line at $35.6 \\pm 2.5$ keV is present in the\nspectrum. We use this energy to estimate the dipolar magnetic field at the\npulsar surface to be $4.0\\pm 0.2\\,\\times\\,10^{12}$ G. We further estimate a\nlower limit in the distance to OAO 1657-415 of $\\simeq 1$ kpc. And we also find\na possible positive correlation between the luminosity and the energy\nassociated with the cyclotron line.

The present work examines this critically in Fe-Cr\nsystem using atom probe tomography (APT) and small angle neutron scattering\n(SANS), and establishes the framework to distinguish the two different modes of\nalpha-prime phase separation in thermally aged Fe-35 at.% Cr and Fe-20 at.% Cr\nalloys. Independent APT analysis determines the mode of phase separation on the\nbasis of: (i) presence / absence of periodic chemical fluctuation through\nradial distribution function analysis; and (ii) inter-phase interface\ncharacteristics (diffuse / sharp). SANS analysis, in contrast, yields virtually\nindistinguishable correlation peaks for both the modes, which necessitates\nfurther investigation of the several different aspects of SANS profiles in the\nlight of APT results. For the first time, key features of SANS profiles have\nbeen identified that can unambiguously distinguish SD from NG in Fe-Cr system:\n(i) nature of temporal evolution of FWHM of the correlation peak; and (ii)\nappropriate value of 'gamma' for fitting with the dynamic scaling model\n('gamma'= 6 for SD, Fe-35 at.% Cr alloy; 'gamma'= 4 for NG, Fe-20 at.% Cr\nalloy).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 16:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

To address this\nchallenge, we propose continuous recurrent units (CRUs) -- a neural\narchitecture that can naturally handle irregular intervals between\nobservations. The CRU assumes a hidden state, which evolves according to a\nlinear stochastic differential equation and is integrated into an\nencoder-decoder framework. The recursive computations of the CRU can be derived\nusing the continuous-discrete Kalman filter and are in closed form. The\nresulting recurrent architecture has temporal continuity between hidden states\nand a gating mechanism that can optimally integrate noisy observations. We\nderive an efficient parameterization scheme for the CRU that leads to a fast\nimplementation f-CRU. We empirically study the CRU on a number of challenging\ndatasets and find that it can interpolate irregular time series better than\nmethods based on neural ordinary differential equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 16:49:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 02:27:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 15:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Furthermore, the\nadversarial examples created on one classification model can also fool another\ndifferent model. The transferability of the adversarial examples has recently\nattracted a growing interest since it makes black-box attacks on classification\nmodels feasible. As an extension of classification, semantic segmentation has\nalso received much attention towards its adversarial robustness. However, the\ntransferability of adversarial examples on segmentation models has not been\nsystematically studied. In this work, we intensively study this topic. First,\nwe explore the overfitting phenomenon of adversarial examples on classification\nand segmentation models. In contrast to the observation made on classification\nmodels that the transferability is limited by overfitting to the source model,\nwe find that the adversarial examples on segmentations do not always overfit\nthe source models. Even when no overfitting is presented, the transferability\nof adversarial examples is limited. We attribute the limitation to the\narchitectural traits of segmentation models, i.e., multi-scale object\nrecognition. Then, we propose a simple and effective method, dubbed dynamic\nscaling, to overcome the limitation. The high transferability achieved by our\nmethod shows that, in contrast to the observations in previous work,\nadversarial examples on a segmentation model can be easy to transfer to other\nsegmentation models.

For 6-day-ahead forecasts, the functional approach\nuncovers interpretable regional spatial effects, and captures the higher\nvariance observed in inland cities versus coastal cities, as well as the higher\nvariance observed in mountain and midwest states. The functional approach also\nnaturally handles missing data through modelling a continuum, and can be\nimplemented efficiently by exploiting the sparsity induced by a B-spline basis.\n  The temporal dependence in the data is modeled through temporal dependence in\nfunctional basis coefficients.

Solar\nrooftop potential assessment relies on several features such as building\ngeometry, location, and surrounding facilities. Hence, national-level\napproximations that do not take these factors into deep consideration are often\ninaccurate. This paper introduces Lebanon's first comprehensive footprint and\nsolar rooftop potential maps using deep learning-based instance segmentation to\nextract buildings' footprints from satellite images. A photovoltaic panels\nplacement algorithm that considers the morphology of each roof is proposed. We\nshow that the average rooftop's solar potential can fulfill the yearly electric\nneeds of a single-family residence while using only 5% of the roof surface. The\nusage of 50% of a residential apartment rooftop area would achieve energy\nsecurity for up to 8 households.

Factors such as size, ground coverage\nratio and PV_out are carefully investigated for each district. Baalbeck\ndistrict yielded the highest total solar rooftop potential despite its low\nbuilt-up area. While, Beirut capital city has the highest average solar rooftop\npotential due to its extremely populated urban nature.

A certain class of models is investigated where\nthe fluid is driven by peristaltic pumping and the nonlinear elements are ideal\nvalves that completely suppress backflow. This highly nonlinear system produces\ndiscontinuous solutions that are difficult to study. As the density of valves\nincreases, the pressure and flow are well-approximated by a continuum of valves\nwhich can be analytically treated. Interestingly, two different pumping\nmechanisms emerge from this model. At low frequencies, diffusive transport\npushes open all but one valve, and the radius takes the shape of the imposed\nforce. At high frequencies, half of the valves open, and the flow is determined\nby the advective transport induced by peristalsis. In either case, the induced\nflow is linear in the amplitude of the peristaltic forces and is independent of\npumping direction. Despite the continuum approximation used, the physical valve\ndensity is accounted for by modifying the resistance of the fluid\nappropriately. The suppression of backflow causes a net benefit in adding\nvalves when the valve density is low, but once the density is high enough, the\ndominant valve effect is to suppress the forward flow, suggesting there is an\noptimum number of valves per wavelength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 18:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

A common\nbelief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their\ncompetence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in\nTransformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still\nperform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general\narchitecture of the Transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module,\nis more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately\nreplace the attention module in Transformers with an embarrassingly simple\nspatial pooling operator to conduct only basic token mixing. Surprisingly, we\nobserve that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves competitive\nperformance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on ImageNet-1K,\nPoolFormer achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned Vision\nTransformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy with\n35%/52% fewer parameters and 50%/62% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of\nPoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of\n\"MetaFormer\", a general architecture abstracted from Transformers without\nspecifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that\nMetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent\nTransformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more\nfuture research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the\ntoken mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a\nstarting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design.

We found that between January and August of 2021: 1) Google's\nweekly VSI index was associated with the number of new vaccinations\nadministered in the subsequent three weeks, and 2) the average VSI index in\nearlier months was strongly correlated (up to r = 0.89) with vaccination rates\nmany months later.

While existing vision foundation models such as CLIP,\nALIGN, and Wu Dao 2.0 focus mainly on mapping images and textual\nrepresentations to a cross-modal shared representation, we introduce a new\ncomputer vision foundation model, Florence, to expand the representations from\ncoarse (scene) to fine (object), from static (images) to dynamic (videos), and\nfrom RGB to multiple modalities (caption, depth).

To address this issue, a\nflexible semi-nonparametric (SNP) model is introduced using the change of\nvariables technique to enrich the family of distributions to handle extreme\nloss events. The SNP models are proved to have the same maximum domain of\nattraction (MDA) as the parametric kernels, and it follows that the SNP models\nare consistent with the extreme value theory peaks over threshold method but\nwith different shape and scale parameters from the kernels. By using the\nsimulation dataset generated from a mixture of distributions with both light\nand heavy tails, the SNP models in the Frechet and Gumbel MDAs are shown to fit\nthe tail dataset satisfactorily through increasing the number of model\nparameters.

In\nthis paper, we study a variation called local communication complexity in which\nperformance instead measures the maximum number of bits sent or received at any\none player. We focus on a simple model where $n$ players, each with one input\nbit, execute a protocol by exchanging messages to compute a function on the $n$\ninput bits. We ask what can and cannot be solved with a small local\ncommunication complexity in this setting. We begin by establishing a\nnon-trivial lower bound on the local complexity for a specific function by\nproving that counting the number of $1$'s among the first $17$ input bits\ndistributed among the participants requires a local complexity strictly greater\nthan $1$. We further investigate whether harder counting problems of this type\ncan yield stronger lower bounds, providing a largely negative answer by showing\nthat constant local complexity is sufficient to count the number $1$ bits over\nthe entire input, and therefore compute any symmetric function. In addition to\ncounting, we show that both sorting and searching can be computed in constant\nlocal complexity. We then use the counting solution as a subroutine to\ndemonstrate that constant local complexity is also sufficient to compute many\nstandard modular arithmetic operations on two operands, including: comparisons,\naddition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Finally we\nestablish that function $GCD(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are in the range $[1,n]$\nhas local complexity of $O(1)$.

Three cosmological results of the Planck mission are\npresented next: the implications of the map of Comptonization fluctuations, the\ndipole analysis from cross-correlating cosmic microwave background anisotropy\nand Comptonization fluctuation maps, and the constraints on the primordial\ntensor-to-scalar perturbation ratio. Finally, we discuss some future\nperspectives and alternative scenarios in cosmology, such as the study of the\nLorentz invariance violation with the cosmic microwave background polarization,\nthe introduction of new gravitational degrees of freedom to solve the dark\nmatter problem, and the exploitation of the magnification bias with\nhigh-redshift sub-millimeter galaxies to constrain cosmological parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 19:13:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 10:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Recently,\nthe use of multiple virtual machines (VMs) on the same physical server was\nadopted due to cost reduction and flexibility. Nowadays, containers have become\npopular for application deployment due to smaller footprints than the VMs,\ntheir ability to start and stop more quickly, and their capability to pack the\napplication binaries and their dependencies in standalone units for seamless\nportability. A typical container ecosystem includes a code repository (e.g.,\nGitHub) where the container images are built from the codes and libraries and\nthen pushed to the image registry (e.g., Docker Hub) for subsequent deployment\nas application containers. However, the pervasive use of containers also leads\nto a wide-range of security breaches, such as stealing credentials and\nsensitive data from image registry and code repository, carrying out DoS\nattacks, and gaining root access to the underlying host. In this paper, we\nfirst perform threat modeling on the containers ecosystem using the popular\nthreat modeling framework, called STRIDE. Using STRIDE, we identify the\nvulnerabilities in each system component, and investigate potential security\nthreats and their consequences. Then, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the\nexisting countermeasures designed against the identified threats and\nvulnerabilities. In particular, we assess the strengths and weaknesses of the\nexisting mitigation strategies designed against such threats. We believe that\nthis work will help researchers and practitioners to gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the threat landscape in containers and the state-of-the-art\ncountermeasures. We also discuss open research problems and future research\ndirections in containers security, which may ignite further research to be done\nin this area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 19:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

On\none hand, the set of states that can be generated by the PQC has to be large\nenough to contain the solution state. Otherwise, one may at best find the best\napproximation of the solution restricted to the states generated by the chosen\nPQC. On the other hand, the PQC should contain as few parametric quantum gates\nas possible to minimize noise from the quantum device. Thus, when designing a\nPQC one needs to ensure that there are no redundant parameters. The dimensional\nexpressivity analysis discussed in these proceedings is a means of addressing\nthese counteracting effects. Its main objective is to identify independent and\nredundant parameters in the PQC. Using this information, superfluous parameters\ncan be removed and the dimension of the space of states that are generated by\nthe PQC can be computed. Knowing the dimension of the physical state space then\nallows us to deduce whether or not the PQC can reach all physical states.\nFurthermore, the dimensional expressivity analysis can be implemented\nefficiently using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm.

The challenges in reconstructing\nliquids, which is not faced in previous reconstruction works on rigid and\ndeforming surfaces, lies in the inability to use depth sensing and color\nfeatures due the variable index of refraction, opacity, and environmental\nreflections. Therefore, we limit ourselves to only surface detections (i.e.\nbinary mask) of liquids as observations and do not assume any prior knowledge\non the liquids properties. A novel optimization problem is posed which\nreconstructs the liquid as particles by minimizing the error between a rendered\nsurface from the particles and the surface detections while satisfying liquid\nconstraints. Our solvers to this optimization problem are presented and no\ntraining data is required to apply them. We also propose a dynamic prediction\nto seed the reconstruction optimization from the previous time-step.

This supports\nthe idea that these local systems are more chemically-similar to their\nprimordial high-redshift counterparts than to the bulk of nearby galaxies.\nFinally, we find significant tension between the strong stellar wind profiles\nobserved and our population synthesis models constrained by the photospheric\nforest in our highest-quality spectra. This reinforces the need for caution in\ninterpreting wind lines in isolation at high-redshift, but also suggests a\nunique path towards validating fundamental massive star physics at extremely\nlow metallicity with integrated ultraviolet spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 20:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

By the\nhelp of a global readout operation that simply aggregates all node (or\nnode-cluster) representations, existing GNN classifiers obtain a graph-level\nrepresentation of an input graph and predict its class label using the\nrepresentation. However, such global aggregation does not consider the\nstructural information of each node, which results in information loss on the\nglobal structure. Particularly, it limits the discrimination power by enforcing\nthe same weight parameters of the classifier for all the node representations;\nin practice, each of them contributes to target classes differently depending\non its structural semantic. In this work, we propose structural semantic\nreadout (SSRead) to summarize the node representations at the position-level,\nwhich allows to model the position-specific weight parameters for\nclassification as well as to effectively capture the graph semantic relevant to\nthe global structure. Given an input graph, SSRead aims to identify\nstructurally-meaningful positions by using the semantic alignment between its\nnodes and structural prototypes, which encode the prototypical features of each\nposition. The structural prototypes are optimized to minimize the alignment\ncost for all training graphs, while the other GNN parameters are trained to\npredict the class labels.

Previous work identified a promising means of extracting this\ncosmological information using a set of quadratic estimators for the radial and\ntransverse components of the velocity field. These estimators are based on the\nstatistically anisotropic components of the cross-correlation between the CMB\nand a tracer of large scale structure, such as a galaxy redshift survey. In\nthis work, we assess the challenges to the program of velocity reconstruction\nposed by various foregrounds and systematics in the CMB and galaxy surveys, as\nwell as biases in the quadratic estimators. To do so, we further develop the\nquadratic estimator formalism and implement a numerical code for computing\nproperly correlated spectra for all the components of the CMB\n(primary/secondary blackbody components and foregrounds) and a photometric\nredshift survey, with associated redshift errors, to allow for accurate\nforecasting. We create a simulation framework for generating realizations of\nproperly correlated CMB maps and redshift binned galaxy number counts, assuming\nthe underlying fields are Gaussian, and use this to validate a velocity\nreconstruction pipeline and assess map-based systematics such as masking. We\nhighlight the most significant challenges for velocity reconstruction, which\ninclude biases associated with: modelling errors, characterization of redshift\nerrors, and coarse graining of cosmological fields on our past light cone.\nDespite these challenges, the outlook for velocity reconstruction is quite\noptimistic, and we use our reconstruction pipeline to confirm that these\ntechniques will be feasible with near-term CMB experiments and photometric\ngalaxy redshift surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 20:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

In short,\nif cars spend little time idle waiting for a dispatch, then few cars are\navailable when a rider makes a request, and thus the mean distance between a\nrider and the closest available car is long, which means that en-route time is\nlong. This phenomenon is of great importance in ride-hailing, because en-route\ntime increases rapidly as the number of idle cars decreases, and every minute\nthat a car spends en-route is one minute less that the car can transport\nriders. In spite of this, the existing literature on price optimization for\nride-hailing, and on repositioning optimization for ride-hailing, ignores\nen-route time. Initial attempts to take this trade-off for the mean en-route\ntime into account when considering price optimization or repositioning\noptimization all resulted in intractable optimization problems. Then we found a\nway to reformulate a simultaneous price and repositioning optimization problem,\nthat takes this trade-off for the distribution of en-route time into account,\nas a tractable convex optimization problem. We show how the optimal solution\ncan be used to construct policies that perform much better in simulations than\nthe policies proposed in previous papers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 21:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

Scallop here is a minimal mathematical model of a swimmer composed by\ntwo arms connected via a hinge whose periodic motion (of opening and closing\nits arms) is not sufficient to achieve net displacement. Any source of\nincongruence on the motion or in the forces/torques experienced by such\ntime-reversible scallop will break the symmetry imposed by the Stokes linearity\nand lead to subsequent propulsion of the scallop. However, little is known\nabout the controllability of time-reversible scalloping systems. Here, we\nconsider two individually non-controllable scallops swimming together. Under a\nsuitable geometric assumption on the configuration of the system, it is proved\nthat non-zero net displacement can be achieved as a consequence of their\nhydrodynamic interaction. A detailed analysis of the control system of\nequations is carried out analytically by means of geometric control theory.

To tackle this\nproblem, we present ATLANTIS, a new benchmark for semantic segmentation of\nwaterbodies and related objects. ATLANTIS consists of 5,195 images of\nwaterbodies, as well as high quality pixel-level manual annotations of 56\nclasses of objects, including 17 classes of man-made objects, 18 classes of\nnatural objects and 21 general classes.

In addition, a novel deep neural network, AQUANet, is developed for\nwaterbody semantic segmentation by processing the aquatic and non-aquatic\nregions in two different paths. AQUANet also incorporates low-level feature\nmodulation and cross-path modulation for enhancing feature representation.\nExperimental results show that the proposed AQUANet outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks on ATLANTIS.

This consists in starting with a convergent presentation,\nand expliciting a family of generating confluences to obtain a coherent\npresentation -- one with generators, generating relations, and generating\nrelations between relations (syzygies). In this article we develop these ideas\nfor a class of monoids which encode the representation theory of complex\nsymmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras, called plactic monoids. The main tools for\nthis are the crystal realization of plactic monoids due to Kashiwara, and a\nclass of presentations compatible with a crystal structure, called crystal\npresentations.

In this paper, we revisit these\ngeometry-based constructions with the aim of understanding their limitations\nand generality. We introduce a new equation-of-state expansion for fluids near\na critical point, assuming analyticity with respect to the number density, and\nuse this to prove a number of key results, including the equivalence between\nthe $R$-crossing method and the standard construction of phase boundaries near\nthe critical point. The same conclusion is not seen to hold for the Widom line\nof fluids in general. However, for the ideal van der Waals fluid a slight tweak\nin the usual formulation of the Ruppeiner metric, which we call the\nRuppeiner-$N$ metric, makes the Ruppeiner geometry prediction of the Widom line\nexact. This is in contrast to the results of May and Mausbach where the\nprediction is good only up to the slope of the Widom line at the critical\npoint. We also apply the Ruppeiner-$N$ metric to improve the proposed\nclassification scheme of Di\\'osi et al. that partitions the van der Waals state\nspace into its different phases using Ruppeiner geodesics. Whereas the original\nDi\\'osi boundaries do not correspond to any established thermodynamic lines\nabove (or even below) the critical point, our construction remarkably detects\nthe Widom line.

In contrast, Nesterov's accelerated\ngradient (AG) method is optimal up to constant factors for this class. However,\nwhen specialized to quadratic function, conjugate gradient is optimal in a\nstrong sense among function-gradient methods. Therefore, there is seemingly a\ngap in the menu of available algorithms: NCG, the optimal algorithm for\nquadratic functions that also exhibits good practical performance for general\nfunctions, has poor complexity bounds compared to AG. We propose an NCG method\ncalled C+AG (\"conjugate plus accelerated gradient\") to close this gap, that is,\nit is optimal for quadratic functions and still satisfies the best possible\ncomplexity bound for more general smooth convex functions. It takes conjugate\ngradient steps until insufficient progress is made, at which time it switches\nto accelerated gradient steps, and later retries conjugate gradient.

The\nlow-cost DFT+U approach only improves surface formation energies for early\ntransition-metal oxides or adsorption energies for late transition-metal\noxides. In this work, we demonstrate that this inefficacy arises due to the\nconventional usage of metal-centered atomic orbitals as projectors within\nDFT+U. We analyze electron density rearrangement during surface formation and O\natom adsorption on rutile transition-metal oxides to highlight that a standard\nDFT+U correction fails to tune properties when the corresponding density\nrearrangement is highly delocalized across both metal and oxygen sites.

Timely detection and monitoring of\ncracks are crucial to managing these risks, especially if the systems can be\nmade highly automated through robots. Vision-based crack detection algorithms\nusing deep neural networks have exhibited promise for structured surfaces such\nas walls or civil engineering tunnels, but little work has addressed highly\nunstructured environments such as rock cliffs and bare mining tunnels. To\naddress this challenge, this paper presents PointCrack3D, a new\n3D-point-cloud-based crack detection algorithm for unstructured surfaces. The\nmethod comprises three key components: an adaptive down-sampling method that\nmaintains sufficient crack point density, a DNN that classifies each point as\ncrack or non-crack, and a post-processing clustering method that groups crack\npoints into crack instances. The method was validated experimentally on a new\nlarge natural rock dataset, comprising coloured LIDAR point clouds spanning\nmore than 900 m^2 and 412 individual cracks. Results demonstrate a crack\ndetection rate of 97% overall and 100% for cracks with a maximum width of more\nthan 3 cm, significantly outperforming the state of the art. Furthermore, for\ncross-validation, PointCrack3D was applied to an entirely new dataset acquired\nin different locations and not used at all in training and shown to detect 100%\nof its crack instances. We also characterise the relationship between detection\nperformance, crack width and number of points per crack, providing a foundation\nupon which to make decisions about both practical deployments and future\nresearch directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 02:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

However, the\ncorrelation operation between query feature and the given template only\nexploits accurate target localization, leading to state estimation error\nespecially when the target suffers from severe deformable variations. To\naddress this issue, segmentation-based trackers have been proposed that employ\nper-pixel matching to improve the tracking performance of deformable objects\neffectively. However, most of existing trackers only refer to the target\nfeatures in the initial frame, thereby lacking the discriminative capacity to\nhandle challenging factors, e.g., similar distractors, background clutter,\nappearance change, etc. To this end, we propose a dynamic compact memory\nembedding to enhance the discrimination of the segmentation-based deformable\nvisual tracking method. Specifically, we initialize a memory embedding with the\ntarget features in the first frame. During the tracking process, the current\ntarget features that have high correlation with existing memory are updated to\nthe memory embedding online. To further improve the segmentation accuracy for\ndeformable objects, we employ a point-to-global matching strategy to measure\nthe correlation between the pixel-wise query features and the whole template,\nso as to capture more detailed deformation information.

The former is achieved by\nminimizing a contrastive loss, and the latter can be achieved by a dynamic\nreweighing mechanism to attend to informative frames in the observed content\nwith a similarity comparison between feature of the current frame and observed\nframes. The learned final video representation can be further enhanced by\nmulti-task learning which performs joint feature learning on the target\nactivity labels and the automatically detected action and object class tokens.\nSRL sharply outperforms existing state-of-the-art in most cases on two\negocentric video datasets and two third-person video datasets. Its\neffectiveness is also verified by the experimental fact that the action and\nobject concepts that support the activity semantics can be accurately\nidentified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 03:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

To\novercome such problems, we establish a new class of tractable lossless\ncompression models that permit efficient encoding and decoding: Probabilistic\nCircuits (PCs).

Understanding these\nprocesses requires accurate observational constraints on the mass-loss rates of\nthe most luminous stars, which can also be used to test theories of stellar\nwind generation. In the past, mass-loss rates have been characterized via\ncollisional emission processes such as H$\\alpha$ and free-free radio emission,\nbut these so-called \"density squared\" diagnostics require correction in the\npresence of widespread clumping. Recent observational and theoretical evidence\npoints to the likelihood of a ubiquitously high level of such clumping in\nhot-star winds, but quantifying its effects requires a deeper understanding of\nthe complex dynamics of radiatively driven winds. Furthermore, large-scale\nstructures arising from surface anisotropies and propagating throughout the\nwind can further complicate the picture by introducing further density\nenhancements, affecting mass-loss diagnostics. Time series spectroscopy of UV\nresonance lines with high resolution and high signal-to-noise are required to\nbetter understand this complex dynamics, and help correct \"density squared\"\ndiagnostics of mass-loss rates.

In classical nonlinear elasticity, it is known that\nsubsonic interfaces require a kinetic law, in addition to momentum balance, to\nobtain unique solutions; in contrast, for supersonic interfaces, momentum\nbalance alone is sufficient to provide unique solutions. This work finds that\nperidynamics agrees with this classical result, in that different choices of\nregularization parameters provide different kinetics for subsonic motion but\nthe same kinetics for supersonic motion. In contrast, conventional phase-field\nmodels coupled to elastodynamics are unable to model, even qualitatively, the\nsupersonic motion of interfaces. This work identifies the shortcomings in the\nphysics of standard phase-field models to be: (1) the absence of higher-order\nstress to balance unphysical stress singularities, and (2) the ability of the\nmodel to access unphysical regions of the energy landscape.\n  Based on these observations, this work proposes an augmented phase-field\nmodel to introduce the missing physics. The augmented model adds: (1) a viscous\nstress to the momentum balance, in addition to the dissipative phase-field\nevolution, to regularize singularities; and (2) an augmented driving force that\nmodels the physical mechanism that keeps the system out of unphysical regions\nof the energy landscape. When coupled to elastodynamics, the augmented model\ncorrectly describes both subsonic and supersonic interface motion. The\naugmented model has essentially the same computational expense as conventional\nphase-field models and requires only minor modifications of numerical methods,\nand is therefore proposed as a replacement to the conventional phase-field\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 04:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

As a well studied\nproperty for CNN-based models, the receptive field is a measurement for\nmeasuring the spatial range covered by a single feature response, which is\ncrucial in improving the image categorization accuracy. In video domain, video\nevent semantics are actually described by complex interaction among different\nconcepts, while their behaviors vary drastically from one video to another,\nleading to the difficulty in concept-based analytics for accurate event\ncategorization. To model the concept behavior, we study temporal concept\nreceptive field of concept-based event representation, which encodes the\ntemporal occurrence pattern of different mid-level concepts. Accordingly, we\nintroduce temporal dynamic convolution (TDC) to give stronger flexibility to\nconcept-based event analytics. TDC can adjust the temporal concept receptive\nfield size dynamically according to different inputs. Notably, a set of\ncoefficients are learned to fuse the results of multiple convolutions with\ndifferent kernel widths that provide various temporal concept receptive field\nsizes.

Existing works employ a holistic fine-tuning paradigm to tackle this\nproblem, where the model is first pre-trained on all base classes with abundant\nsamples, and then it is used to carve the novel class feature space.\nNonetheless, this paradigm is still imperfect. Durning fine-tuning, a novel\nclass may implicitly leverage the knowledge of multiple base classes to\nconstruct its feature space, which induces a scattered feature space, hence\nviolating the inter-class separability. To overcome these obstacles, we propose\na two-step fine-tuning framework, Few-shot object detection via Association and\nDIscrimination (FADI), which builds up a discriminative feature space for each\nnovel class with two integral steps. 1) In the association step, in contrast to\nimplicitly leveraging multiple base classes, we construct a compact novel class\nfeature space via explicitly imitating a specific base class feature space.\nSpecifically, we associate each novel class with a base class according to\ntheir semantic similarity. After that, the feature space of a novel class can\nreadily imitate the well-trained feature space of the associated base class. 2)\nIn the discrimination step, to ensure the separability between the novel\nclasses and associated base classes, we disentangle the classification branches\nfor base and novel classes. To further enlarge the inter-class separability\nbetween all classes, a set-specialized margin loss is imposed.

This work investigates the similarities and\ndifferences between CHs and QS in the chromosphere using the Mg II h & k, C II\nlines, and transition region using Si IV line, for regions with identical\nabsolute magnetic flux density (|B|). We find CHs to have subdued intensity in\nall the ines, with the difference increasing with line formation height and\n|B|. The chromospheric lines show excess upflows and downflows in CH, while Si\nIV shows excess upflows (downflows) in CHs (QS), where the flows increase with\n|B|. We further demonstrate that the upflows (downflows) in Si IV are\ncorrelated with both upflows and downflows (only downflows) in the\nchromospheric lines. CHs (QS) show larger Si IV upflows (downflows) for similar\nflows in the chromosphere, suggesting a common origin to these flows. These\nobservations may be explained due to impulsive heating via interchange\n(closed-loop) reconnection in CHs (QS), resulting in bidirectional flows at\ndifferent heights, due to differences in magnetic field topologies. Finally,\nthe kinked field lines from interchange reconnection may be carried away as\nmagnetic field rotations and observed as switchbacks.

By\ncombining the two methods, the proposed research successfully leverages the\nadvantages of both RL and IL methods. First, a real mini-scale robot car was\nassembled and trained on a 6 feet by 9 feet real world track using imitation\nlearning. During the process, a handle controller was used to control the\nmini-scale robot car to drive on the track by imitating a human expert driver\nand manually recorded the actions using Microsoft AirSim's API. 331 accurate\nhuman-like reward training samples were able to be generated and collected.\nThen, an agent was trained in the Microsoft AirSim simulator using\nreinforcement learning for 6 hours with the initial 331 reward data inputted\nfrom imitation learning training.

An important direction of research has been to decompose an arbitrary\nentangled state, represented as a unitary, into a quantum circuit, that is, a\nsequence of gates supported by a quantum processor. It has been well known that\ncircuits with longer decompositions and more entangling multi-qubit gates are\nerror-prone for the current noisy, intermediate-scale quantum devices. To this\nend, there has been a significant interest to develop heuristic-based methods\nto discover compact circuits. We contribute to this effort by proposing\nQuantumCircuitOpt (QCOpt), a novel open-source framework which implements\nmathematical optimization formulations and algorithms for decomposing arbitrary\nunitary gates into a sequence of hardware-native gates. A core innovation of\nQCOpt is that it provides optimality guarantees on the quantum circuits that it\nproduces. In particular, we show that QCOpt can find up to 57% reduction in the\nnumber of necessary gates on circuits with up to four qubits, and in run times\nless than a few minutes on commodity computing hardware. We also validate the\nefficacy of QCOpt as a tool for quantum circuit design in comparison with a\nnaive brute-force enumeration algorithm. We also show how the QCOpt package can\nbe adapted to various built-in types of native gate sets, based on different\nhardware platforms like those produced by IBM, Rigetti and Google. We hope this\npackage will facilitate further algorithmic exploration for quantum processor\ndesigners, as well as quantum physicists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 06:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

The shallow water equations\n(SWEs) are commonly used for this purpose. However, traditional numerical\nsolvers of the SWEs are computationally expensive and require high-resolution\nriverbed profile measurement (bathymetry). In this work, we propose a two-stage\nprocess in which, first, using the principal component geostatistical approach\n(PCGA) we estimate the probability density function of the bathymetry from flow\nvelocity measurements, and then use machine learning (ML) algorithms to obtain\na fast solver for the SWEs. The fast solver uses realizations from the\nposterior bathymetry distribution and takes as input the prescribed range of\nBCs. The first stage allows us to predict flow velocities without direct\nmeasurement of the bathymetry. Furthermore, we augment the bathymetry posterior\ndistribution to a more general class of distributions before providing them as\ninputs to ML algorithm in the second stage.

The bistable potential is represented by a class composed of three\nfamilies of parametrized double-well potentials, whose minima and barrier\nheight can be tuned distinctly.

The high cost and\ncomplex logistics of direct bathymetry surveys, i.e., depth imaging, have\nencouraged the use of indirect measurements such as surface flow velocities.\nHowever, estimating high-resolution bathymetry from indirect measurements is an\ninverse problem that can be computationally challenging. Here, we propose a\nreduced-order model (ROM) based approach that utilizes a variational\nautoencoder (VAE), a type of deep neural network with a narrow layer in the\nmiddle, to compress bathymetry and flow velocity information and accelerate\nbathymetry inverse problems from flow velocity measurements. In our\napplication, the shallow-water equations (SWE) with appropriate boundary\nconditions (BCs), e.g., the discharge and/or the free surface elevation,\nconstitute the forward problem, to predict flow velocity.

A\nhigher steering rate (rotation angle per second) of gimbal is preferable for\nreal-time applications since a given field-of-view (FOV) can be revisited\nwithin a short period of time. However, due to relative motion between the\ngimbal and scene during the exposure time, the captured video frames can suffer\nfrom motion blur. Since most of the post-capture applications require blurfree\nimages, motion deblurring in real-time is an important need. Even though there\nexist blind deblurring methods which aim to retrieve latent images from blurry\ninputs, they are constrained by very high-dimensional optimization thus\nincurring large execution times. On the other hand, deep learning methods for\nmotion deblurring, though fast, do not generalize satisfactorily to different\ndomains (e.g., air, water, etc).

The problem is that the\navailable public datasets are limited either in size or in realism, and are\nthus suboptimal for training purposes. Indeed, the best results are currently\nobtained via a rather convoluted multi-step training process that involves both\nreal and synthetic datasets. To address this issue, starting from the\nobservation that the communities of rhythm games players provide a large amount\nof annotated data, we curated a new dataset of crowdsourced drum\ntranscriptions. This dataset contains real-world music, is manually annotated,\nand is about two orders of magnitude larger than any other non-synthetic\ndataset, making it a prime candidate for training purposes. However, due to\ncrowdsourcing, the initial annotations contain mistakes. We discuss how the\nquality of the dataset can be improved by automatically correcting different\ntypes of mistakes. When used to train a popular DTM model, the dataset yields a\nperformance that matches that of the state-of-the-art for DTM, thus\ndemonstrating the quality of the annotations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 09:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

The model is\nbased on our previous development of a self-consistent shock-in-jet model with\nrelativistic thermal and non-thermal particle distributions evaluated via\nMonte-Carlo simulations of diffusive shock acceleration, and time-dependent\nradiative transport. This model has been very successful in modeling spectral\nvariability patterns of several blazars, but has difficulties describing orphan\nflares, i.e., high-energy flares without a significant counterpart in the\nlow-frequency (synchrotron) radiation component.

Current works only consider the use of individual sensors, or\nsimply combine different sensors, ignoring the fact that the importance of\ndifferent sensors varies as the environment changes. In this paper, an adaptive\nweighting visual-LiDAR fusion method, named AdaFusion, is proposed to learn the\nweights for both images and point cloud features. Features of these two\nmodalities are thus contributed differently according to the current\nenvironmental situation. The learning of weights is achieved by the attention\nbranch of the network, which is then fused with the multi-modality feature\nextraction branch. Furthermore, to better utilize the potential relationship\nbetween images and point clouds, we design a twostage fusion approach to\ncombine the 2D and 3D attention.

This paper reveals an\nintriguing phenomenon that simply applying ReLU operation on the frequency\ndomain of a blur image followed by inverse Fourier transform, i.e., frequency\nselection, provides faithful information about the blur pattern (e.g., the blur\ndirection and blur level, implicitly shows the kernel pattern).

However, to the best of our knowledge, KD and DML have\nnever been jointly explored in a unified framework to solve the knowledge\ndistillation problem. In this paper, we investigate that the teacher model\nsupports more trustworthy supervision signals in KD, while the student captures\nmore similar behaviors from the teacher in DML. Based on these observations, we\nfirst propose to combine KD with DML in a unified framework. Furthermore, we\npropose a Semi-Online Knowledge Distillation (SOKD) method that effectively\nimproves the performance of the student and the teacher. In this method, we\nintroduce the peer-teaching training fashion in DML in order to alleviate the\nstudent's imitation difficulty, and also leverage the supervision signals\nprovided by the well-trained teacher in KD. Besides, we also show our framework\ncan be easily extended to feature-based distillation methods. Extensive\nexperiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the proposed method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 09:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

These observations show irregular\nshort-time variation of the Faraday rotation measure (RM), which probes the\ndensity-weighted line-of-sight magnetic field strength, of individual bursts\nduring the first 36 days, followed by a constant RM. We detected circular\npolarisation in more than half of the burst sample, including one burst\nreaching a high fractional circular polarisation of 75%. Oscillations in\nfractional linear and circular polarisations as well as polarisation angle as a\nfunction of wavelength were detected.

This\nchallenge is still a remaining research problem since most of the existing\nmethods rely on correspondence search. To solve this challenge, we propose a\nnew data-driven registration algorithm by investigating deep generative neural\nnetworks to point cloud registration. Given two point clouds, the motivation is\nto generate the aligned point clouds directly, which is very useful in many\napplications like 3D matching and search. We design an end-to-end generative\nneural network for aligned point clouds generation to achieve this motivation,\ncontaining three novel components. Firstly, a point multi-perception layer\n(MLP) mixer (PointMixer) network is proposed to efficiently maintain both the\nglobal and local structure information at multiple levels from the self point\nclouds. Secondly, a feature interaction module is proposed to fuse information\nfrom cross point clouds. Thirdly, a parallel and differential sample consensus\nmethod is proposed to calculate the transformation matrix of the input point\nclouds based on the generated registration results. The proposed generative\nneural network is trained in a GAN framework by maintaining the data\ndistribution and structure similarity. The experiments on both ModelNet40 and\n7Scene datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency. Notably, our method reduces $2\\times$\nin registration error (CD) and $12\\times$ running time compared to the\nstate-of-the-art correspondence-based algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 10:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

This can be addressed by\nimmersing the droplet in oil under regulated humidity and reducing the volume\nto the picoliter range. However, the evaporation dynamics of such a system is\nnot well understood. In this work, we present evaporation models applicable for\narrays of sessile microdroplets with dissolved solute submerged in a thin layer\nof oil. Our model accounts for the variable diffusion distance due to the\npresence of the oil film separating the droplet and air, the diffusive\ninteraction of neighboring droplets, as well as the variation of the solution\ndensity and water activity due to the evolving solute concentration. Our model\nshows excellent agreement with experimental data for both pure water and NaCl\nsolution. With this model, we demonstrate that assuming a constant evaporation\nrate and neglecting the diffusive interactions can lead to severe inaccuracies\nin the measurement of droplet concentration particularly during nucleation\nexperiments. Given the significance of droplet evaporation in a wide array of\nscientific and industrial applications, the models and insights presented\nherein would be of great value to many fields of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 10:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

However, RES\ngeneration is not dispatchable, and an increasing share of RES may lead to\ninefficiencies and even problems for the electricity network. Flexible\nresources are needed to handle RES generation in order to support the delicate\nelectricity generation and demand balance. Energy conversion technologies (P2X,\nPower to X) allow the flexibility of energy systems to be increased. These\ntechnologies make a connection between different energy sectors (e.g.,\nelectricity and gas) possible, and thus create new synergies within an overall\nmulti energy system. This paper analyzes how the P2G technology can be used at\nthe distribution network level (both gas and electricity) to optimize the use\nof RES. In fact, in order to coordinate P2X resources, it is necessary to take\ninto account the whole multi energy scenario, and not just the electrical side:\nit therefore becomes fundamental to recognize the pros and cons that Balancing\nService Providers (BSPs), composed of a number of P2G plants (representing the\nBalancing Responsible Providers, BRPs), may have when offering services to an\nelectricity network.

To characterize the young low-mass stellar population in\nthe central portion of the cluster, we carried out deep VI band observations of\nthe region using the 4K$\\times$4K CCD IMAGER mounted on the 3.6-m DOT. Our\nanalysis shows that the present data are deep enough to detect stars below\n$\\sim$24 mag. We found optical counterparts of $\\sim$220 candidate members,\nincluding young stars and unclassified cluster members from Caramazza et al.\n(2008). We estimated the membership probabilities of the Gaia sources (mostly\nbright stars with G$<$19 mag) located within the cluster radius using the Gaia\nEDR3. Toward the fainter end, we used the optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD)\nto select the cluster members from a sample of young stars. The unclassified\nmember candidates and X-ray sources from Caramazza et al. (2012) are also found\nto be young low-mass stars. In total, we identified $\\sim$425 young stars with\nage$<$10 Myr, and 110 of these are new. Most of these stars appear kinematic\nmembers of the cluster. By examining the CMD for the stars in the cluster\nregion, we suggest that the cluster has insignificant contamination due to\nfield stars in the pre-main sequence zone of the CMD. The slope of the mass\nfunction in the mass range 0.2$\\le$M/M$\\odot$$\\le$2.5 is found to be $\\Gamma$ =\n-1.43 $\\pm$ 0.15, consistent with those of other star-forming complexes. The\nspatial distribution of the young stars as a function of mass suggests that\ntoward the cluster center, most of the stars are massive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 11:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Almost all existing algorithms converge locally,\nand the proper selection of initial values is crucial. Therefore, in actual\noperation, they often combine a warm-starting technique to meet the rigid\nrequirement that the initial value must be sufficiently close to the optimal\nsolution of the corresponding problem. In this paper, based on the DC\n(difference of convex functions) property of MCP and SCAD penalties, we aim to\ndesign a global two-stage algorithm for the high-dimensional least squares\nlinear regression problems.

However, modelling global correlations with multi-head\nself-attention (MSA) layers leads to two widely recognized issues: the massive\ncomputational resource consumption and the lack of intrinsic inductive bias for\nmodelling local visual patterns. To solve both issues, we devise a simple yet\neffective method named Single-Path Vision Transformer pruning (SPViT), to\nefficiently and automatically compress the pre-trained ViTs into compact models\nwith proper locality added. Specifically, we first propose a novel\nweight-sharing scheme between MSA and convolutional operations, delivering a\nsingle-path space to encode all candidate operations. In this way, we cast the\noperation search problem as finding which subset of parameters to use in each\nMSA layer, which significantly reduces the computational cost and optimization\ndifficulty, and the convolution kernels can be well initialized using\npre-trained MSA parameters. Relying on the single-path space, we further\nintroduce learnable binary gates to encode the operation choices, which are\njointly optimized with network parameters to automatically determine the\nconfiguration of each layer. We conduct extensive experiments on two\nrepresentative ViTs showing that our SPViT achieves a new SOTA for pruning on\nImageNet-1k. For example, our SPViT can trim 52.0% FLOPs for DeiT-B and get an\nimpressive 0.6% top-1 accuracy gain simultaneously.

The raw time\nseries of the nuclear spin bath coherent dynamics is acquired through the\ntwo-point correlation function computed using the cluster correlation expansion\nmethod. The dynamics can be conveniently analyzed according to zero-, single-,\nand double-quantum transitions derived from the dipolar pairwise spin flips. We\nshow that in the early-time behavior when the coherence is preserved in the\nspin ensemble, the Overhauser field fluctuations are modulated by\ndipole-dipole-induced small inhomogeneous detunings of nearly resonant\ntransitions within the bath. The resulting beating extending over relatively\nlonger time intervals is featured on the scalograms where both temporal and\nspectral behaviors of nuclear spin noise are unveiled simultaneously. Moreover,\na second kind of beating that affects faster dynamics is readily discernible,\noriginating from the inhomogeneous spread of the hyperfine coupling of each\nnucleus with the central spin. Additionally, any quadrupolar nuclei within the\nbath imprint as beating residing in the zero-quantum channel. The nuclear spin\nenvironment can be directionally probed by orienting the hyperfine axis.\nThereby, crucial spatial information about the closely separated spin clusters\nsurrounding the central spin are accessible. Thus, a wavelet-based post\nprocessing can facilitate the identification of proximal nuclear spins as\nrevealed by their unique beating patterns on the scalograms.

In\nthis paper, we propose RIS-assisted receive quadrature space-shift keying\n(RIS-RQSSK), which enhances the spectral efficiency of an RIS-based index\nmodulation (IM) system by using the real and imaginary dimensions independently\nfor the purpose of IM. Therefore, the error rate performance of the system is\nimproved as all RIS elements reflect the incident transmit signal toward both\nselected receive antennas. At the receiver, a low-complexity but effective\ngreedy detector (GD) can be employed which determines the maximum energy per\ndimension at the receive antennas. A max-min optimization problem is defined to\nmaximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) components at both selected\nreceive antennas; an analytical solution is provided based on Lagrange duality.\nIn particular, the multi-variable optimization problem is shown to reduce to\nthe solution of a single-variable equation, which results in a very simple\ndesign procedure.

In this paper, we point out that in\nobject detection, the features of the teacher and student vary greatly in\ndifferent areas, especially in the foreground and background. If we distill\nthem equally, the uneven differences between feature maps will negatively\naffect the distillation. Thus, we propose Focal and Global Distillation (FGD).\nFocal distillation separates the foreground and background, forcing the student\nto focus on the teacher's critical pixels and channels. Global distillation\nrebuilds the relation between different pixels and transfers it from teachers\nto students, compensating for missing global information in focal distillation.\nAs our method only needs to calculate the loss on the feature map, FGD can be\napplied to various detectors. We experiment on various detectors with different\nbackbones and the results show that the student detector achieves excellent mAP\nimprovement.

One of the mission\ndesign solutions is utilizing asteroid flyby cycler trajectories with multiple\nEarth gravity assists. An asteroid flyby cycler trajectory design problem is a\nsubclass of global trajectory optimization problems with multiple flybys,\ninvolving a trajectory optimization problem for a given flyby sequence and a\ncombinatorial optimization problem to decide the sequence of the flybys. As the\nnumber of flyby bodies grows, the computation time of this optimization problem\nexpands maliciously. This paper presents a new method to design asteroid flyby\ncycler trajectories utilizing a surrogate model constructed by deep neural\nnetworks approximating trajectory optimization results. Since one of the\nbottlenecks of machine learning approaches is the computation time to generate\nmassive trajectory databases, we propose an efficient database generation\nstrategy by introducing pseudo-asteroids satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker\nconditions.

While\nroom-temperature magnetic skyrmions and their current-induced manipulation were\nrecently demonstrated, the stray field resulting from their finite\nmagnetization as well as their topological charge limit their minimum size and\nreliable motion in tracks. Antiferromagnetic (AF) skyrmions allow these\nlimitations to be lifted owing to their vanishing magnetization and net zero\ntopological charge, promising room-temperature, ultrasmall skyrmions, fast\ndynamics, and insensitivity to external magnetic fields. While room-temperature\nAF spin textures have been recently demonstrated, the observation and\ncontrolled nucleation of AF skyrmions operable at room temperature in\nindustry-compatible synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) material systems is still\nlacking.

On the other hand, when compared to giant\nradio galaxies (GRGs), GRQs have higher black hole mass and Eddington ratio.\nThe high core dominance factor of SRQs is an indicator of them lying closer to\nthe line of sight than GRQs. We also find a correlation of the accretion disc\nluminosity with the radio core and jet power of GRQs, which provides evidence\nfor disc-jet coupling.

We\nemploy explicit nuclear degrees of freedom only up to $n \\sim 1.5n_0$, in order\nto explore the possibility of further physical degrees of freedom than\nnucleonic here. The resulting QHC21, which has a peak in sound velocity in\n$\\sim 2$-$4 n_0$, is stiffer than the earlier QHC19 below 2$n_0$, predicting\nlarger radii in substantial agreement with the NICER data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 15:00:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 06:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Conventional\ntechniques mainly focus on face frontalization or face augmentation in image\nspace. However, transforming face images in image space is not guaranteed to\npreserve the lossless identity features of the original image. Moreover, these\nmethods suffer from more computational costs and memory requirements due to the\nadditional models. We argue that it is more desirable to perform feature\ntransformation in hierarchical feature space rather than image space, which can\ntake advantage of different feature levels and benefit from joint learning with\nrepresentation learning. To this end, we propose a lightweight and\neasy-to-implement attention block, named Pose Attention Module (PAM), for\npose-invariant face recognition. Specifically, PAM performs frontal-profile\nfeature transformation in hierarchical feature space by learning residuals\nbetween pose variations with a soft gate mechanism. We validated the\neffectiveness of PAM block design through extensive ablation studies and\nverified the performance on several popular benchmarks, including LFW, CFP-FP,\nAgeDB-30, CPLFW, and CALFW. Experimental results show that our method not only\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods but also effectively reduces memory\nrequirements by more than 75 times.

The system\nmoves in an unknown environment and should recognize new objects located in it.\nIn this case, the system should build comprehensive images of visible things\nand memorize them if necessary (and it should also choose the current goal\nset). The main problems here are object recognition, and the informational\nreward rating in the game. Thus, the main novelty of the paper is a new method\nof evaluating the amount of visual information about the object as the reward.\nIn such a system, we suggest using a minimally pre-trained neural network to be\nresponsible for the recognition: at first, we train the network only for\nBiederman geons (geometrical primitives).

Thus, programmers often prefer to use synchronization abstractions,\nwhich render code simpler and easier to reason about. Despite a wealth of work\non this topic, there is still a gap between the rich semantics provided by\nsynchronization abstractions in modern programming languages -- specifically,\n\\emph{fair} FIFO ordering of synchronization requests and support for\n\\emph{abortable} operations -- and frameworks for implementing it correctly and\nefficiently. Supporting such semantics is critical given the rising popularity\nof constructs for asynchronous programming, such as coroutines, which abort\nfrequently and are cheaper to suspend and resume compared to native threads.\n  This paper introduces a new framework called\n\\texttt{CancellableQueueSynchronizer} (CQS), which enables simple yet efficient\nimplementations of a wide range of fair and abortable synchronization\nprimitives: mutexes, semaphores, barriers, count-down latches, and blocking\npools. Our main contribution is algorithmic, as implementing both fairness and\nabortability efficiently at this level of generality is non-trivial.\nImportantly, all our algorithms, including the CQS framework and the primitives\nbuilt on top of it, come with \\emph{formal proofs} in the Iris framework for\nCoq for many of their properties. These proofs are modular, so it is easy to\nshow correctness for new primitives implemented on top of CQS. From a practical\nperspective, implementation of CQS for native threads on the JVM significantly\nimproves Java's \\texttt{AbstractQueuedSynchronizer}, the only practical\nabstraction offering similar semantics. In sum,\n\\texttt{CancellableQueueSynchronizer} is the first framework to combine\nexpressiveness with formal guarantees and solid practical performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 20:38:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 12:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

The lack, if not complete absence,\nof interpretability for these so-called black-box models can lead to serious\neconomic and ethical consequences, thereby hindering the development and\ndeployment of AI in wider fields, particularly in those involving critical and\nregulatory applications.

Based on the generated reason codes, we find that the\nhistorical RT feature is the dominant factor that has most impact on the model\nprediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 11:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

In this work, we put our focus on the context\nof periodic signals sampled with spatial measurements. The optimization\nproblems are penalized thanks to the total variation norm, using a specific\nclass of (pseudo-)differential operators to use well-chosen reconstruction\nfunctions. We introduce three algorithms and their adaptation to this specific\nuse case. The first one is a discrete grid-based $\\ell_1$ method, the second is\ncalled CPGD, which relies on the estimation of discrete innovations within the\nFRI framework, and the last one is the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. We put the\nemphasis on that later algorithm as we underline its greedy behavior. We\nconsider a refined version of this algorithm, that leads to very encouraging\noutputs. We pursue the algorithmic treatment with a theoretical analysis of the\noptimization problem, based on convexity and duality theory. We draw away two\nconditions that, if verified by the differential operator, would inform on the\nshape of the solutions and even ensure uniqueness, in some cases. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate the general expression of periodic one-dimensional exponential\nsplines, as a first step to verify the latter conditions for exponential\noperators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 10:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

In response, the proposed approach recursively\napplied a quantum annealing algorithm for Max-Cut optimization on D-Wave\nSystems, which grouped students into cohorts such that the number of possible\ninfection events via shared classrooms was minimized. To test this approach,\navailable coursework data was used to generate highly clustered course\nenrollment networks representing students and the classes they share.
