The most effective techniques for multimodal emotion\nrecognition efficiently leverage diverse and complimentary sources of\ninformation, such as facial, vocal, and physiological modalities, to provide\ncomprehensive feature representations. In this paper, we focus on dimensional\nemotion recognition based on the fusion of facial and vocal modalities\nextracted from videos, where complex spatiotemporal relationships may be\ncaptured. Most of the existing fusion techniques rely on recurrent networks or\nconventional attention mechanisms that do not effectively leverage the\ncomplimentary nature of audio-visual (A-V) modalities. We introduce a\ncross-attentional fusion approach to extract the salient features across A-V\nmodalities, allowing for accurate prediction of continuous values of valence\nand arousal. Our new cross-attentional A-V fusion model efficiently leverages\nthe inter-modal relationships. In particular, it computes cross-attention\nweights to focus on the more contributive features across individual\nmodalities, and thereby combine contributive feature representations, which are\nthen fed to fully connected layers for the prediction of valence and arousal.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated experimentally on\nvideos from the RECOLA and Fatigue (private) data-sets. Results indicate that\nour cross-attentional A-V fusion model is a cost-effective approach that\noutperforms state-of-the-art fusion approaches.

For this, we collected\nCOVID-19 related tweets from February 2020 to June 2021 to analyse vaccination\nstance, linguistic features, and social network characteristics. Our results\ndemonstrated that, compared to pro-vaxxers, anti-vaxxers tend to have more\nnegative emotions, narrative thinking, and worse moral tendencies. This study\ncan advance our understanding of the online anti-vaccination movement, and\nbecome critical for social media management and policy action during and after\nthe pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 16:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 06:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

TRACE\nis an efficient privacy-preserving ride-hailing service proposed by Wang et al.\nin 2018. TRACE uses masking along with other cryptographic techniques to ensure\nefficient and accurate ride-matching. The RS uses masked location information\nto match RCs and RVs within a quadrant without obtaining their exact locations,\nthus ensuring privacy. In this work, we disprove the privacy claims in TRACE by\nshowing the following: a) RCs and RVs can identify the secret spatial division\nmaintained by RS (this reveals information about the density of RVs in the\nregion and other potential trade secrets), and b) the RS can identify exact\nlocations of RCs and RVs (this violates location privacy). Prior to exchanging\nencrypted messages in the TRACE protocol, each entity masks the plaintext\nmessage with a secret unknown to others. Our attack allows other entities to\nrecover this plaintext from the masked value by exploiting shared randomness\nused across different messages, that eventually leads to a system of linear\nequations in the unknown plaintexts. This holds even when all the participating\nentities are honest-but-curious. We implement our attack and demonstrate its\nefficiency and high success rate. For the security parameters recommended for\nTRACE, an RV can recover the spatial division in less than a minute, and the RS\ncan recover the location of an RV in less than a second on a commodity laptop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 16:18:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2021 15:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

We first demonstrate that one can use this framework to\nexpress non-trivial (but sub-optimal) bounds for any learning algorithm that\noutputs hypotheses from a class of bounded VC dimension.

We further show that an\ninherent limitation of proper learning of VC classes contradicts the existence\nof a proper learner with constant CMI, and it implies a negative resolution to\nan open problem of Steinke and Zakynthinou (2020). We further study the CMI of\nempirical risk minimizers (ERMs) of class $H$ and show that it is possible to\noutput all consistent classifiers (version space) with bounded CMI if and only\nif $H$ has a bounded star number (Hanneke and Yang (2015)).

Contemporary Vector Processors (VPs)\nare designed either for short vector lengths, e.g., Fujitsu A64FX with 512-bit\nARM SVE vector support, or long vectors, e.g., NEC Aurora Tsubasa with 16Kbits\nMaximum Vector Length (MVL). Unfortunately, both approaches have drawbacks. On\nthe one hand, short vector length VP designs struggle to provide high\nefficiency for applications featuring long vectors with high Data Level\nParallelism (DLP). On the other hand, long vector VP designs waste resources\nand underutilize the Vector Register File (VRF) when executing low DLP\napplications with short vector lengths. Therefore, those long vector VP\nimplementations are limited to a specialized subset of applications, where\nrelatively high DLP must be present to achieve excellent performance with high\nefficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose an Adaptable Vector\nArchitecture (AVA) that leads to having the best of both worlds. AVA is\ndesigned for short vectors (MVL=16 elements) and is thus area and\nenergy-efficient. However, AVA has the functionality to reconfigure the MVL,\nthereby allowing to exploit the benefits of having a longer vector (up to 128\nelements) microarchitecture when abundant DLP is present. We model AVA on the\ngem5 simulator and evaluate the performance with six applications taken from\nthe RiVEC Benchmark Suite. To obtain area and power consumption metrics, we\nmodel AVA on McPAT for 22nm technology. Our results show that by reconfiguring\nour small VRF (8KB) plus our novel issue queue scheme, AVA yields a 2X speedup\nover the default configuration for short vectors. Additionally, AVA shows\ncompetitive performance when compared to a long vector VP, while saving 50% of\narea.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 18:12:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 May 2022 17:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

Presently, we investigate the strongly planar refraction of a\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shock wave at an inclined density interface. A\nmagnetic field is applied that is initially oriented either perpendicular and\nparallel to the motion of incident shock. We explore flow structure by varying\nthe magnitude of the magnetic field governed by the non-dimensional parameter\n$\\beta \\in (0.5, 10^6)$ and the inclination angle of density interface $\\alpha\n\\in (0.30, 1.52)$. The regular MHD shock refraction process results in a pair\nof outer fast shocks (reflected and transmitted) and a set of inner nonlinear\nmagneto-sonic waves. By varying magnetic field (strength and direction) and\ninclination interface angle, the latter waves can be slow shocks, slow\nexpansion fans, intermediate shocks or slow-mode compound waves. For a chosen\nincident shock strength, and density ratio, the MHD shock refraction\ntransitions from regular (all nonlinear waves meeting at a single point) into\nirregular when the inclined density interface angle is less than a critical\nvalue. Since the MHD shock refraction is self-similar, we further explore by\nconverting the initial value problem (IVP) into a boundary value problem (BVP)\nby a self-similar coordinate transformation. The self-similar solution to the\nBVP is numerically solved using an iterative method and implemented using the\np4est adaptive mesh framework. The simulation shows that a Mach stem occurs in\nirregular MHD shock refraction, the flow structure can be an MHD equivalent to\na single Mach reflexion irregular refraction $MRR$ and convex-forwards\nirregular refraction $CFR$ that occur in the hydrodynamic case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 18:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

However, the diagrams commonly employed to this effect\nare usually static, complex, and can sometimes be non-intuitive or even\ncounter-intuitive to newcomers in the field. To address some of these issues,\nthis paper introduces TULIPS, a python package that generates novel diagrams\nand animations of the structure and evolution of stellar objects. TULIPS\nvisualizes the output of one-dimensional physical simulations and is currently\noptimized for the MESA stellar evolution code. Utilizing the inherent spherical\nsymmetry of such simulations, TULIPS represents the physical properties of\nstellar objects as the attributes of circles. This enables an intuitive\nrepresentation of the evolution, energy generation and loss processes,\ncomposition, and interior properties of stellar objects, while retaining\nquantitative information. Users can interact with the output videos and\ndiagrams. The capabilities of TULIPS are showcased by example applications that\ninclude a Sun-like star, a massive star, a low-metallicity star, and an\naccreting white dwarf. Diagrams generated with TULIPS are compared to the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram and to the Kippenhahn diagram, and their advantages\nand challenges are discussed. TULIPS is open source and free.

Ship tracks are observable\nexamples of marine cloud brightening, a potential solar climate intervention\nthat shows promise in helping combat climate change. Whether or not a ship's\nemission path visibly impacts the clouds above and how long a ship track\nvisibly persists largely depends on the exhaust type and properties of the\nboundary layer with which it mixes. In order to be able to statistically infer\nthe longevity of ship-emitted aerosols and characterize atmospheric conditions\nunder which they form, a first step is to simulate, with mathematical surrogate\nmodel rather than an expensive physical model, the path of these cloud-aerosol\ninteractions with parameters that are inferable from imagery.

We\ntest this idea by correcting the positions and velocities of the MW satellites\nfor the Galactocentric-distance-dependent shifts inferred from a LMC-infall\nsimulation. While this should substantially reduce the observed clustering of\norbital poles if it were mainly caused by the LMC, we instead find that the\nstrong clustering remains preserved. We confirm the initial study's main result\nwith our simulation of an MW-LMC-like interaction, and use it to identify two\nreasons why this scenario is unable to explain the VPOS: (1) the orbital pole\ndensity enhancement in our simulation is very mild (~10% within 50-250 kpc)\ncompared to the observed enhancement (~220-300%), and (2) it is very sensitive\nto the specific angular momenta (AM) of the simulation particles, with higher\nAM particles being affected the least. Particles in simulated dark matter halos\ntend to follow more radial orbits (lower AM), so their orbital poles are more\neasily affected by small offsets in position and velocity caused by an LMC\ninfall than objects with more tangential velocity (higher AM), such as the\nobserved dwarf galaxies surrounding the MW.

Balloons\nattached to a ventilator and an air compressor were used to periodically\ngenerate a breathing cycle. A silicone tumor was also implanted in the lower\nlobe of the right balloon to investigate its displacement during respiration.\nDuring silent and deep breathing, qualitative and quantitative tests were\nconducted, and the results were compared to research conducted on real humans.\nResults: The CT images and the shape of the phantom matches those of the real\npatient.

Therefore, observations of an epidemic, in this case at\nthe population-level, contain information about the underlying network. This\ninformation, in turn, is useful for predicting the future course of an ongoing\nepidemic. To exploit this in a prediction framework, the exact high-dimensional\nstochastic model of an SIS epidemic on a network is approximated by a\nlower-dimensional surrogate model. The surrogate model is based on a\nbirth-and-death process; the effect of the underlying network is described by a\nparametric model for the birth rates. We demonstrate empirically that the\nsurrogate model captures the intrinsic stochasticity of the epidemic once it\nreaches a point from which it will not die out. Bayesian parameter inference\nallows for uncertainty about the model parameters and the class of the\nunderlying network to be incorporated directly into probabilistic predictions.\nAn evaluation of a number of scenarios shows that in most cases the resulting\nprediction intervals adequately quantify the prediction uncertainty. As long as\nthe population-level data is available over a long-enough period, even if not\nsampled frequently, the model leads to excellent predictions where the\nunderlying network is correctly identified and prediction uncertainty mainly\nreflects the intrinsic stochasticity of the spreading epidemic.

Not only does Neptune emit\nabout ten times the amount of heat that emitted by Uranus, the relative amount\nof emitted heat to the energy they absorb from the sun also differs greatly,\nbeing comparable at Uranus and the largest of all giant planets at Neptune. As\na result, it is questionable whether thermal convection occurs within the\ninterior of Uranus. However, the presence of an intrinsic magnetic field\nimplies that interior fluid motions must exist. Here, we consider compositional\nconvection driven by the release of hydrogen associated with the formation of\nlarge organic networks or diamond precipitation in the deep interior. We test\nthis hypotheses using a set of numerical rotating convection models where the\nconvective driving is varied between thermal and compositional sources and is\nsufficiently vigorous to not be strongly constrained by rotation. In most\ncases, we find ice-giant-like zonal flows develop, with three bands\ncharacterized by a retrograde equatorial jet and prograde jets at higher\nlatitudes. Large-scale circulation cells also develop and lead to heat and mass\nfluxes that tend to exhibit local maxima along the equatorial plane. This\nsimilarity between convective flows driven by thermal and compositional\nbuoyancy therefore predict Uranus and Neptune to have similar interior dynamics\ndespite Uranus' minimal internal heat flow and may thus explain why both ice\ngiants have comparable magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 19:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

Observations have indicated that hot Jupiters\nare at least an order of magnitude less prevalent in the central region of the\nglobular cluster 47 Tucanae than in the field. In this work, we explore the\nclaims in the literature for additional consequences for the low mass stellar\ninitial mass function. Tidal capture, the mechanism that produces X-ray\nbinaries in globular clusters, applies also to brown dwarfs (BDs). This process\nproduces tight stellar-BD binaries that would be detectable by transit surveys.\nApplying a Monte Carlo dynamical evolution model, we compute the overall BD\ncapture rates. We find that the number of captures is lower than previous\nestimates. Capture efficiency increases steeply with stellar mass, which means\nthat mass segregation reduces capture efficiency as BDs and low mass stars\noccupy the same regions. The result of this effect is that the current\nconstraints on the short period companion fraction remains marginally\nconsistent with initially equal numbers of BDs and stars. However, our findings\nsuggest that expanding the sample in 47 Tuc or surveying other globular\nclusters for close sub-stellar companions can yield constraints on the\nsub-stellar initial mass function in these environments. We estimate the\ncapture rates in other globular clusters and suggest that 47 Tuc remains a\npromising target for future transit surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 19:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

In this work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations combined with the Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) scheme aiming at\ndescribing the impact of the shear rate on the shape, magnetic structure and\nmotion of an MNG. We find that in a shear flow the centre of mass of an MNG\ntends to be in the centre of a channel and to move preserving the distance to\nboth walls. The MNG monomers along with translation are involved in two more\ntypes of motion, they rotate around the centre of mass and oscillate with\nrespect to the latter. It results in synchronised tumbling and wobbling of the\nwhole MNG accompanied by its volume oscillates. The fact the MNG is a highly\ncompressible and permeable for the carrier liquid object makes its behaviour\ndifferent from that predicted by classical Taylor-type models. We show that the\nfrequency of volume oscillations and rotations are identical and are growing\nfunction of the shear rate. We find that the stronger magnetic interactions in\nthe MNG are, the higher is the frequency of this complex oscillatory motion,\nand the lower is its amplitude. Finally, we show that the oscillations of the\nvolume lead to the periodic changes in MNG magnetic energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 19:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

We extract an effective measure of the\nspin-lattice coupling in CrI$_3$ which is up to ten times larger than what is\nfound for bcc Fe. The magnetic exchange interactions, including Heisenberg and\nrelativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, are sensitive both to the\nin-plane motion of Cr atoms and out-of-plane motion of ligand atoms.

Maintaining quasi-neutrality at all\norders requires that small-scale convective cell turbulence be driven by\ndisparate scale interaction. The cells in turn produce turbulent mixing of\nvorticity and pressure, which is calculated by fluctuation-dissipation type\nanalyses, and are relevant to pump-out phenomena. The development of\ncorrelation between the ambient magnetic perturbations and the cells is\ndemonstrated, showing that turbulence will `lock on' to ambient stochasticity.\nMagnetic perturbations are shown to produce a magnetic braking effect on\nvorticity generation at large scale.

The state of the art has\nfocused on conventional RGB video data acquired during minimally invasive\nsurgery, but full-scene semantic segmentation based on spectral imaging data\nand obtained during open surgery has received almost no attention to date. To\naddress this gap in the literature, we are investigating the following research\nquestions based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data of pigs acquired in an open\nsurgery setting: (1) What is an adequate representation of HSI data for neural\nnetwork-based fully automated organ segmentation, especially with respect to\nthe spatial granularity of the data (pixels vs. superpixels vs. patches vs.\nfull images)? (2) Is there a benefit of using HSI data compared to other\nmodalities, namely RGB data and processed HSI data (e.g. tissue parameters like\noxygenation), when performing semantic organ segmentation? According to a\ncomprehensive validation study based on 506 HSI images from 20 pigs, annotated\nwith a total of 19 classes, deep learning-based segmentation performance\nincreases, consistently across modalities, with the spatial context of the\ninput data. Unprocessed HSI data offers an advantage over RGB data or processed\ndata from the camera provider, with the advantage increasing with decreasing\nsize of the input to the neural network. Maximum performance (HSI applied to\nwhole images) yielded a mean DSC of 0.90 ((standard deviation (SD)) 0.04),\nwhich is in the range of the inter-rater variability (DSC of 0.89 ((standard\ndeviation (SD)) 0.07)). We conclude that HSI could become a powerful image\nmodality for fully-automatic surgical scene understanding with many advantages\nover traditional imaging, including the ability to recover additional\nfunctional tissue information.

However,\nfew studies have found definitive evidence that the quasars lie at cosmic\ndensity peaks, in clear contrast with theory predictions. Here we present new\nevidence that the radio-loud quasar SDSS J0836+0054 at z=5.8 could be part of a\nsurprisingly rich structure of galaxies. This conclusion is reached by\ncombining a number of findings previously reported in the literature: Bosman et\nal. (2020) obtained the redshifts of three companion galaxies, confirming an\noverdensity of i-dropouts found by Zheng et al. (2006). By comparing this\nstructure with those found near other quasars and large overdense regions in\nthe field at z~6-7, we show that the SDSS J0836+0054 field is among the densest\nstructures known at these redshifts. One of the spectroscopic companions is a\nvery massive star-forming galaxy (log M_*/M_sun ~ 10.3) based on its\nunambiguous detection in a Spitzer 3.6 um image. This suggests that the quasar\nfield hosts not one, but at least two rare, massive dark matter halos (log\nM_halo/M_sun > 12), corresponding to a galaxy overdensity of at least 20. We\ndiscuss the properties of the young radio source.

The goal is to keep every\nother node in the graph about the root as freshly informed as possible. Our\nsynchronous information spreading model uses telephone calls at each time step,\nin which any node can call at most one neighbor, thus forming a matching over\nwhich information is transmitted at each step. We introduce two problems in\nminimizing two natural objectives (Maximum and Average) of the latency of the\nroot's information at all nodes in the network.\n  After deriving a simple reduction from the maximum rooted latency problem to\nthe well-studied minimum broadcast time problem, we focus on the average rooted\nlatency version. We introduce a natural problem of finding a finite schedule\nthat minimizes the average broadcast time from a root. We show that any average\nrooted latency induces a solution to this average broadcast problem within a\nconstant factor and conversely, this average broadcast time is within a\nlogarithmic factor of the average rooted latency. Then, by approximating the\naverage broadcast time problem via rounding a time-indexed linear programming\nrelaxation, we obtain a logarithmic approximation to the average latency\nproblem.\n  Surprisingly, we show that using the average broadcast time for average\nrooted latency introduces this necessary logarithmic factor overhead even in\ntrees. We overcome this hurdle and give a 40-approximation for trees.

To the best\nof the authors' knowledge, this paper presents the first open source RRAM\ncompiler for automatic memory generation including its peripheral circuits,\nverification and timing characterisation. The RRAM compiler is written with\nCadence SKILL programming language and is integrated in Cadence environment.\nThe layout verification procedure takes place in Siemens Mentor Calibre tool.\nThe technology used by the compiler is TSMC 180nm. This paper analyses the\nnovel results of a plethora of M x N RRAMs generated by the compiler, up to M =\n128, N = 64 and word size B = 16 bits, for clock frequency equal to 12.5 MHz.\nFinally, the compiler achieves density of up to 0.024 Mb/mm2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 00:10:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 20:14:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 22:31:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 21:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

Nonetheless, surprisingly, we find these\nconclusions are drawn from unfair experimental settings, where Transformers and\nCNNs are compared at different scales and are applied with distinct training\nframeworks. In this paper, we aim to provide the first fair & in-depth\ncomparisons between Transformers and CNNs, focusing on robustness evaluations.\n  With our unified training setup, we first challenge the previous belief that\nTransformers outshine CNNs when measuring adversarial robustness. More\nsurprisingly, we find CNNs can easily be as robust as Transformers on defending\nagainst adversarial attacks, if they properly adopt Transformers' training\nrecipes. While regarding generalization on out-of-distribution samples, we show\npre-training on (external) large-scale datasets is not a fundamental request\nfor enabling Transformers to achieve better performance than CNNs. Moreover,\nour ablations suggest such stronger generalization is largely benefited by the\nTransformer's self-attention-like architectures per se, rather than by other\ntraining setups.

To codify such a difference in nonlinearities and reveal a linear\nestimation property, we define ResNEsts, i.e., Residual Nonlinear Estimators,\nby simply dropping nonlinearities at the last residual representation from\nstandard ResNets.

To alleviate such a single point failure, especially on the PS,\nsome existing work has provided decentralized FL (DFL) implementations like\nCDSGD and D-PSGD to facilitate FL in a decentralized topology. However, there\nare still some problems with these methods, e.g., significant divergence\nbetween users' final models in CDSGD and a network-wide model average necessity\nin D-PSGD. In order to solve these deficiency, this paper devises a new DFL\nimplementation coined as DACFL, where each user trains its model using its own\ntraining data and exchanges the intermediate models with its neighbors through\na symmetric and doubly stochastic matrix.

We also find that the phonon intensity is enhanced in the vicinity of\nthe charge-density-wave (CDW) excitations while the extracted EPC strength\nappears to be less sensitive to their proximity. By performing a comparative\nstudy of two cuprate families, we are able to identify general trends in the\nEPC for the cuprates and provide experimental input to theories invoking a\nsynergistic role for this interaction in $d$-wave pairing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 05:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

The method has high accuracy, but it incurs high costs if continuous\nmonitoring is needed. Techniques based on photogrammetry, with the relatively\ncheaper digital cameras, have gained wide applications in many fields. Besides\npoint measurement, photogrammetry can also create a three-dimensional (3D)\nmodel of the scene. Accurate 3D model reconstruction depends on high quality\nimages. Degraded images will result in large errors in the reconstructed 3D\nmodel. In this paper, we propose a method that can be used to improve the\nvisibility of the images, and eventually reduce the errors of the 3D scene\nmodel. The idea is inspired by image dehazing. Each original image is first\ntransformed into multiple exposure images by means of gamma-correction\noperations and adaptive histogram equalization. The transformed images are\nanalyzed by the computation of the local binary patterns. The image is then\nenhanced, with each pixel generated from the set of transformed image pixels\nweighted by a function of the local pattern feature and image saturation.\nPerformance evaluation has been performed on benchmark image dehazing datasets.\nExperimentations have been carried out on outdoor and indoor surveys. Our\nanalysis finds that the method works on different types of degradation that\nexist in both outdoor and indoor images.

By solving the field equations, we find that when the\nrotational speed of the magnetar is approaching the breakup limit, its radius\n$R$ and moment of inertia $I$ would undergo an obvious evolution as the\nmagnetar spins down. Meanwhile, the values of $R$ and $I$ would sensitively\ndepend on the adoption of neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) and the NS\nbaryonic mass. With different EoSs and baryonic masses considered, the magnetic\ndipole radiation luminosity ($L_{\\rm dip}$) could be variant within one to two\norders of magnitude. We thus suggest that when using the X-ray plateau data of\nGRBs to diagnose the properties of the nascent NSs, EoS and NS mass information\nshould be invoked as simultaneously constrained parameters. On the other hand,\ndue to the evolution of $R$ and $I$, the temporal behavior of $L_{\\rm dip}$\nwould become more complicated. For instance, if the spin-down process is\ndominated by gravitational wave emission due to the NS asymmetry caused by\nmagnetic field distortion ($\\epsilon\\propto B_{p}^{2}$), the segment $L_{\\rm\ndip}\\propto t^{0}$ could be followed by $L_{\\rm dip}\\propto t^{-\\gamma}$ with\n$\\gamma$ larger than 3. This case could naturally interpret the so-called\ninternal X-ray plateau feature shown in some GRB afterglows, which means the\nsharp decay following the plateau is unnecessarily corresponding to the NS\ncollapsing. This may explain why some internal X-ray plateaus are followed by\nlate time central engine activity, manifested through flares and second shallow\nplateaus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 06:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

Although they lack definite\nphysical explanations, many empirical correlations between GRB isotropic\nenergy/luminosity and some directly detectable spectral/temporal properties\nhave been proposed to make GRBs standard candles. Since the observed GRB rate\nfalls off rapidly at low redshifts, thus preventing a cosmology independent\ncalibration of these correlations. In order to avoid the circularity problem,\nSN Ia data are usually used to calibrate the luminosity relations of GRBs in\nthe low redshift region (limited by the redshift range for SN Ia sample), and\nthen extrapolate it to the high redshift region. This approach is based on the\nassumption of no redshift evolution for GRB luminosity relations.

The neutrinos would be detected\nwith the near and far detectors of the experiment, the former within several\nhundred meters of the neutrino production point and the latter within several\nhundred kilometers. The far detector will consist of a megaton-scale\nwater-Cherenkov detector, and the near detector will consist of a kiloton-scale\nwater-Cherenkov detector in combination with a fine-grained tracking detector\nand an emulsion detector. The purpose of the near detector is to constrain the\nflux of the neutrino beam as well as to extract the electron-neutrino\ninteraction cross-section in water, which requires high-performance energy\nreconstruction and particle flavor identification techniques.

Besides a single recent claim, no\nlensed GRB has been detected so far by using the gamma-ray data only. In this\npaper, we suggest that the multi-band afterglow data might be an efficient way\nto search for lensed GRB events. Using the standard afterglow model we\ncalculate the characteristics of the lensed afterglow lightcurves under the\nassumption of two popular analytic lens models: point mass and Singular\nIsothermal Sphere (SIS) model. In particular, when different lensed images\ncannot be resolved, their signals would be superimposed together with a given\ntime delay. In this case, the X-ray afterglows are likely to contain several\nX-ray flares of similar width in linear scale and similar spectrum, and the\noptical afterglow lightcurve will show rebrightening signatures. Since the\nlightcurves from the image arriving later would be compressed and deformed in\nthe logarithmic time scale, the larger time delay (i.e. the larger mass of the\nlens), the easier is to identify the lensing effect. We analyzed the archival\ndata of optical afterglows and found one potential candidate of the lensed GRB\n(130831A) with time delay $\\sim$500 s, however, observations of this event in\ngamma-ray and X-ray band seem not to support the lensing hypothesis.

However, this simple and greedy\nsolution suffers from serious performance degradation, as it regards the\ndecision in each stage separately, leading to an improper ad selection metric\nfor the pre-auction stage. In this work, we explicitly investigate the relation\nbetween the coarse and refined ad quality metrics, and design a two-stage ad\nauction by taking the decision interaction between the two stages into account.\nWe decouple the design of the two-stage auction by solving a stochastic subset\nselection problem in the pre-auction stage and conducting a general second\nprice (GSP) auction in the second stage.

In\ncontinuous-wave experiments, we found the valley polarization increases as gate\nvoltage is tuned away from the charge neutrality, with the degree of valley\npolarization increased from near zero to 38 % for excitons and to 33 % for\ntrions. This is the first successful observation of valley-polarization in\nMoTe2 without a magnetic field. In pump-probe experiments, we found that the\nintervalley scattering process of excitons is significantly suppressed as gate\nvoltage is tuned away from charge neutrality, with scattering time from 0.85 ps\nto ~ 2.17 ps. In contrast, the intervalley scattering rate for trions increases\ndue to increased availability of partner charges for trion spin flipping, with\nscattering time from 1.39 ns down to ~100 ps away from charge neutrality.\nInterestingly, our results show that, despite the accelerated intervalley\nscattering, the trion polarization degree increases due to polarized trion\ngeneration from the exciton-to-trion conversion overtaking the intervalley\ntrion scatterings. Importantly, the efficient exciton-to-trion conversion\nchanged the dominant depolarization mechanisms. As a result, the valley\nlifetime is dramatically improved by 1000 times from excitons to trions at the\ncharge neutrality. Our results shed new light into the depolarization dynamics\nand the interplay of various depolarization channels for excitons and trions\nand provide an effective strategy for prolonging the valley polarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 07:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

In\nconversational recommendation approaches, these needs and preferences are\nacquired by the system in an interactive, multi-turn dialog. A common approach\nin the literature to drive such dialogs is to incrementally ask users about\ntheir preferences regarding desired and undesired item features or regarding\nindividual items. A central research goal in this context is efficiency,\nevaluated with respect to the number of required interactions until a\nsatisfying item is found. This is usually accomplished by making inferences\nabout the best next question to ask to the user. Today, research on dialog\nefficiency is almost entirely empirical, aiming to demonstrate, for example,\nthat one strategy for selecting questions is better than another one in a given\napplication. With this work, we complement empirical research with a\ntheoretical, domain-independent model of conversational recommendation. This\nmodel, which is designed to cover a range of application scenarios, allows us\nto investigate the efficiency of conversational approaches in a formal way, in\nparticular with respect to the computational complexity of devising optimal\ninteraction strategies. Through such a theoretical analysis we show that\nfinding an efficient conversational strategy is NP-hard, and in PSPACE in\ngeneral, but for particular kinds of catalogs the upper bound lowers to\nPOLYLOGSPACE. From a practical point of view, this result implies that catalog\ncharacteristics can strongly influence the efficiency of individual\nconversational strategies and should therefore be considered when designing new\nstrategies.

Most existing schemes\nassume that observations from all nodes are available, but in many practical\nenvironments, only a subset of nodes is accessible. A natural (and sometimes\neffective) approach is to disregard the role of unobserved nodes, but this\nignores latent network effects, deteriorating the quality of the estimated\ngraph. Differently, this paper investigates the problem of inferring the\ntopology of a network from nodal observations while taking into account the\npresence of hidden (latent) variables. Our schemes assume the number of\nobserved nodes is considerably larger than the number of hidden variables and\nbuild on recent graph signal processing models to relate the signals and the\nunderlying graph. Specifically, we go beyond classical correlation and partial\ncorrelation approaches and assume that the signals are smooth and/or stationary\nin the sought graph. The assumptions are codified into different constrained\noptimization problems, with the presence of hidden variables being explicitly\ntaken into account. Since the resulting problems are ill-conditioned and\nnon-convex, the block matrix structure of the proposed formulations is\nleveraged and suitable convex-regularized relaxations are presented. Numerical\nexperiments over synthetic and real-world datasets showcase the performance of\nthe developed methods and compare them with existing alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 09:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

The\nmodel encapsulates several realistic features, such as the different\neffectiveness of the vaccine against transmission and development of severe\nsymptoms, testing practices, the possible implementation of non-pharmaceutical\ninterventions to reduce the transmission, isolation of detected individuals,\nand human behaviour. Using a mean-field approach, we analytically derive the\nepidemic threshold of the model and, if the system is above such a threshold,\nwe compute the epidemic prevalence at the endemic equilibrium.

The discretisation is based on an unfitted finite element\ndiscretisation on a time-independent mesh.

Its applications range\nfrom augmented reality to robotics and digital content creation. Typically this\ntask is performed through direct object shape and pose predictions which is\ninaccurate. A promising research direction ensures meaningful shape predictions\nby retrieving CAD models from large scale databases and aligning them to the\nobjects observed in the image. However, existing work does not take the object\ngeometry into account, leading to inaccurate object pose predictions,\nespecially for unseen objects. In this work we demonstrate how cross-domain\nkeypoint matches from an RGB image to a rendered CAD model allow for more\nprecise object pose predictions compared to ones obtained through direct\npredictions. We further show that keypoint matches can not only be used to\nestimate the pose of an object, but also to modify the shape of the object\nitself. This is important as the accuracy that can be achieved with object\nretrieval alone is inherently limited to the available CAD models. Allowing\nshape adaptation bridges the gap between the retrieved CAD model and the\nobserved shape.

Here we take heat transfer problem in\nmultilayer fabrics as a typical example. It is coupled by multiple temperature\nfields with strong correlation, and the values of variables are extremely\nunbalanced among different dimensions. We clarify the potential difficulties of\nsolving such problems by classic PINNs, and propose a parallel physics-informed\nneural networks with bidirectional balance. In detail, our parallel solving\nframework synchronously fits coupled equations through several multilayer\nperceptions. Moreover, we design two modules to balance forward process of data\nand back-propagation process of loss gradient. This bidirectional balance not\nonly enables the whole network to converge stably, but also helps to fully\nlearn various physical conditions in PDEs. We provide a series of ablation\nexperiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results\nshow that our approach makes the PINNs unsolvable problem solvable, and\nachieves excellent solving accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 11:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

The assumption underlying statistical ML resulting in theoretical or\nempirical performance guarantees is that the distribution of the training data\nis representative of the production data distribution. This assumption often\nbreaks; for instance, statistical distributions of the data may change. We term\nchanges that affect ML performance `data drift' or `drift'.\n  Many classification techniques compute a measure of confidence in their\nresults. This measure might not reflect the actual ML performance. A famous\nexample is the Panda picture that is correctly classified as such with a\nconfidence of about 60\\%, but when noise is added it is incorrectly classified\nas a Gibbon with a confidence of above 99\\%. However, the work we report on\nhere suggests that a classifier's measure of confidence can be used for the\npurpose of detecting data drift.\n  We propose an approach based solely on classifier suggested labels and its\nconfidence in them, for alerting on data distribution or feature space changes\nthat are likely to cause data drift. Our approach identities degradation in\nmodel performance and does not require labeling of data in production which is\noften lacking or delayed. Our experiments with three different data sets and\nclassifiers demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in detecting data\ndrift. This is especially encouraging as the classification itself may or may\nnot be correct and no model input data is required. We further explore the\nstatistical approach of sequential change-point tests to automatically\ndetermine the amount of data needed in order to identify drift while\ncontrolling the false positive rate (Type-1 error).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 12:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

The first legacy product data release (DR1), made available with\nthis paper, includes the MeerKAT visibilities, basic image cubes at $\\sim$8\"\nresolution, and enhanced spectral and polarisation image cubes at $\\sim$8\" and\n15\" resolutions.

We begin by asking which (simple) environments can\nbest disentangle the level-k model from its leading rival, Bayes-Nash\nequilibrium. We find two environments that are particularly suited to this\npurpose: an all-pay auction with uniformly distributed values, and a\nfirst-price auction with the possibility of cancelled bids. We then implement\nboth of these environments in a virtual laboratory in order to see which theory\ncan best explain observed bidding behaviour. We find that, when plausibly\ncalibrated, the level-k model substantially under-predicts the observed bids\nand is clearly out-performed by equilibrium. Moreover, attempting to fit the\nlevel-k model to the observed data results in implausibly high estimated\nlevels, which in turn bear no relation to the levels inferred from a game known\nto trigger level-k reasoning. Finally, subjects almost never appeal to iterated\nreasoning when asked to explain how they bid. Overall, these findings suggest\nthat, despite its notable success in predicting behaviour in other strategic\nsettings, the level-k model (and its close cousin cognitive hierarchy) cannot\nexplain behaviour in auctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 13:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

There are several\nbinary tests, where each test $i$ is associated with a probability $p_i$ of\nbeing positive and a cost $c_i$. The score of an outcome is a weighted sum of\nall positive tests, and the range of possible scores is partitioned into\nintervals corresponding to different classes. The goal is to perform tests\nsequentially (and possibly adaptively) so as to identify the class at the\nminimum expected cost. We provide the first constant-factor approximation\nalgorithm for this problem, which improves over the previously-known\nlogarithmic approximation ratio. Moreover, our algorithm is $non$ $adaptive$:\nit just involves performing tests in a $fixed$ order until the class is\nidentified. Our approach also extends to the $d$-dimensional score\nclassification problem and the \"explainable\" stochastic halfspace evaluation\nproblem (where we want to evaluate some function on $d$ halfspaces).

Surprisingly, recent works show that large graphs\noften involve many redundant components that can be removed without\ncompromising the performance too much.

We compare the\noptical properties of WSe2 homobilayers with 2H and 3R stacking using\nphotoluminescence, Raman spectroscopy, and reflectance contrast measurements\nunder ambient and cryogenic temperatures. Clear stacking- dependent differences\nare evident for all temperatures, with both photoluminescence and reflectance\ncontrast spectra exhibiting a blue shift in spectral features in 2H compared to\n3R bilayers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate the source\nof the variations and the fundamental differences between 2H and 3R stackings.\nDFT finds larger energies for both A and B excitonic features in 2H than in 3R,\nconsistent with experimental results. In both stacking geometries, the\nintensity of the dominant A1g Raman mode exhibits significant changes as a\nfunction of laser excitation wavelength. These variations in intensity are\nintimately linked to the stacking- and temperature-dependent optical absorption\nthrough resonant enhancement effects. The strongest enhancement is achieved\nwhen the laser excitation coincides with the C excitonic feature, leading to\nthe largest Raman intensity under 514 nm excitation in 2H stacking and at 520\nnm in 3R stacked WSe2 bilayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

Although\nexisting computational approaches achieve inspiring results, they ignore that\nthe action of a drug is mainly caused by its chemical substructures. In\naddition, their interpretability is still weak. Results: In this paper, by\nsupposing that the interactions between two given drugs are caused by their\nlocal chemical structures (sub-structures) and their DDI types are determined\nby the linkages between different substructure sets, we design a novel\nSubstructure-ware Tensor Neural Network model for DDI prediction (STNN-DDI).\nThe proposed model learns a 3-D tensor of (substructure, in-teraction type,\nsubstructure) triplets, which characterizes a substructure-substructure\ninteraction (SSI) space. According to a list of predefined substructures with\nspecific chemical meanings, the mapping of drugs into this SSI space enables\nSTNN-DDI to perform the multiple-type DDI prediction in both transductive and\ninductive scenarios in a unified form with an explicable manner. The\ncompar-ison with deep learning-based state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates\nthe superiority of STNN-DDI with the significant improvement of AUC, AUPR,\nAccuracy, and Precision. More importantly, case studies illustrate its\ninterpretability by both revealing a crucial sub-structure pair across drugs\nregarding a DDI type of interest and uncovering interaction type-specific\nsubstructure pairs in a given DDI. In summary, STNN-DDI provides an effective\napproach to predicting DDIs as well as explaining the interaction mechanisms\namong drugs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:32:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 09:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

As hotspots\nfor (green) innovation and experimentation, cities could play an important role\nin this transition. They are also known to profit from each other's ideas, with\npolicy and technology innovations spreading to other cities. In this way,\ncities can be conceptualized as nodes in a globe-spanning learning network. The\ndynamics of this process are important for society's response to climate change\nand other challenges, but remain poorly understood on a macroscopic level. In\nthis contribution, we develop an approach to identify whether network-based\ncomplex contagion effects are a feature of sustainability policy adoption by\ncities, based on dose-response contagion and surrogate data models. We apply\nthis methodology to an example data set, comprising empirical data on the\nspreading of a public transport innovation (Bus Rapid Transit Systems) and a\nglobal inter-city connection network based on scheduled flight routes. We find\nevidence pointing towards a contagious spreading process which cannot be\nexplained by either the network structure or the increase in global adoption\nrate alone. This suggests that the actions of a city's abstract \"global\nneighborhood\" within the network of cities may be an important factor in which\npolicies and innovations are implemented, with potential connections to the\nemergence of social tipping processes. The methodology is generic, and can be\nused to compare the predictive power for innovation spreading of different\nkinds of inter-city network connections, e.g. via transport links, trade, or\nco-membership in political networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

By\nintegrating communication and computation into a joint design, AirComp can\nsignificantly enhance the communication efficiency, but at the cost of\naggregation errors caused by channel fading and noise. This paper studies a\nparticular type of FEEL with federated averaging (FedAvg) and AirComp-based\nmodel-update aggregation, namely over-the-air FedAvg (Air-FedAvg). We\ninvestigate the transmission power control to combat against the AirComp\naggregation errors for enhancing the training accuracy and accelerating the\ntraining speed of Air-FedAvg. Towards this end, we first analyze the\nconvergence behavior (in terms of the optimality gap) of Air-FedAvg with\naggregation errors at different outer iterations. Then, to enhance the training\naccuracy, we minimize the optimality gap by jointly optimizing the transmission\npower control at edge devices and the denoising factors at edge server, subject\nto a series of power constraints at individual edge devices. Furthermore, to\naccelerate the training speed, we also minimize the training latency of\nAir-FedAvg with a given targeted optimality gap, in which learning\nhyper-parameters including the numbers of outer iterations and local training\nepochs are jointly optimized with the power control. Finally, numerical results\nshow that the proposed transmission power control policy achieves significantly\nfaster convergence for Air-FedAvg, as compared with benchmark policies with\nfixed power transmission or per-iteration mean squared error (MSE)\nminimization.

To this end we transfer\nto viscosity solutions and prove their unique existence in appropriate Sobolev\n(static case) and Sobolev-Bochner (dynamic case) spaces under a certain\nassumption that allows only small variations of the refractive index. Numerical\nevidence is given that the viscosity solution solves the original transport\nequation if the viscosity term turns to zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

In this way, we can understand their\nrelationships, assumptions, simplifications, and, ultimately, limitations.\nPrompted by the current Covid19 pandemic, we have a special focus on spread\nforecasting. We illustrate the difficulties encountered to do realistic\npredictions. In general, they are only approximations to a reality whose\nbiological and societal complexity is much larger. Particularly troublesome are\nthe large underlying variability, the problem's time-varying nature, and the\ndifficulty to estimate the required parameters for a faithful model.\nAdditionally, we will also see that these models have a multiplicative nature\nimplying that small errors in the system parameters cause a huge uncertainty in\nthe prediction. Stochastic or agent-based models can overcome some of the\nmodeling problems of systems based on differential or stochastic equations.\nTheir main difficulty is that they are as accurate and realistic as the data\navailable to estimate their detailed parametrization, and very often this\ndetailed data is not at the modeller's disposal. Although the predictive power\nof mathematical models to forecast the evolution of a contagious disease is\nvery limited, these models are still very useful to plan interventions as they\ncan calculate their impact if all other parameters stay fixed.

Despite the\nneed to accurately capture the dynamics of these plasmas and the implications\nfor relativistic transients, their fluid modeling is typically done using a\nnumber of (overly) simplifying assumptions, which do not hold in general. This\nis especially true when the mean free path in the plasma is large compared to\nthe system size, and kinetic effects start to become important. Going beyond\ncommon approaches used in the literature, we describe a fully relativistic\ncovariant 14-moment based two-fluid system appropriate for the study of\nelectron-ion or electron-positron plasmas. This generalized Israel-Stewart-like\nsystem of equations of motion is obtained directly from the relativistic\nBoltzmann-Vlasov equation. Crucially, this new formulation can account for\nnon-ideal effects, such as anisotropic pressures and heat fluxes. We show that\na relativistic two-fluid plasma can be recast as a single fluid coupled to\nelectromagnetic fields with (potentially large) out-of-equilibrium corrections.\nIn particular, we keep all electron degrees of freedom, which provide\nself-consistent evolution equations for electron temperature and momentum. The\nequations outlined in this paper are able to capture the full two-fluid\ncharacter of collisionless plasmas found in black hole accretion and flaring\nprocesses around compact objects, as well Braginskii-like two-fluid\nmagnetohydrodynamics applicable to weakly collisional plasmas inside accretion\ndisks.

Measurements were performed with different\ncentrality selections as well as the total inelastic, 0%--100%, selection for\nall collision systems. For 0%--100% collisions, the nuclear modification\nfactors, $R_{xA}$, are consistent with unity for $p_T$ above 8 GeV/$c$, but\nexhibit an enhancement in peripheral collisions and a suppression in central\ncollisions. The enhancement and suppression characteristics are similar for all\nsystems for the same centrality class. It is shown that for high-$p_T$-$\\pi^0$\nproduction, the nucleons in the $d$ and $^3$He interact mostly independently\nwith the Au nucleus and that the counter intuitive centrality dependence is\nlikely due to a physical correlation between multiplicity and the presence of a\nhard scattering process. These observations disfavor models where parton energy\nloss has a significant contribution to nuclear modifications in small systems.\nNuclear modifications at lower $p_T$ resemble the Cronin effect -- an increase\nfollowed by a peak in central or inelastic collisions and a plateau in\nperipheral collisions.

By introducing disorder in the masses of the lattice\nparticles, we investigate how different nonlinearities (cubic, quartic and\ntheir combination) lead to energy delocalization, equipartition and chaotic\ndynamics. We excite the lattice using single site initial momentum excitations\ncorresponding to a strongly localized linear mode and increase the initial\nenergy of excitation.

After a\ndiscussion about our current understanding of music as a communication medium\nand its relationship to natural language, the chapter focuses on the techniques\ndeveloped to (a) encode musical compositions as quantum circuits, and (b)\ndesign a quantum classifier. The chapter ends with demonstrations of\ncompositions created with the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 12:35:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 13:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

However,\ncross/self-attention suffers from inferior efficiency in both training and\ninference. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale Fine-grained Interactive\nLanguage-Image Pre-training (FILIP) to achieve finer-level alignment through a\ncross-modal late interaction mechanism, which uses a token-wise maximum\nsimilarity between visual and textual tokens to guide the contrastive\nobjective.

When considering\naccuracy, CNNs are also surprisingly robust to compression techniques, such as\nquantization, which aim to reduce computational and memory costs. We show that\nthis robustness can be partially explained by the calibration behavior of\nmodern CNNs, and may be improved with overconfidence. This is due to an\nintuitive result: low confidence predictions are more likely to change\npost-quantization, whilst being less accurate. High confidence predictions will\nbe more accurate, but more difficult to change. Thus, a minimal drop in\npost-quantization accuracy is incurred.

Ionic\nliquid ion sources produce ion beams by extracting single ions and metastable\nsolvated ion clusters from the surface of the ionic liquid and accelerating\nthem using an electric field generated by applying a voltage between a sharp\ntip and a plate with an aperture. The solvated ion clusters often fragment in\nthe electric field region, reducing the specific impulse and efficiency for\npropulsion applications and increasing the beam spot size for focused ion beam\napplications.\n  Fragmentation behavior has previously been characterized in the region with\nno electric field. However, fragmentation in an electric field has not been\ninvestigated as experimental results are difficult to interpret. The goal of\nthis work is to use various numerical methods to characterize fragmentation\nunder the effect of an electric field. Molecular dynamics simulations are\nperformed of various ionic liquid clusters under different conditions to\ndetermine the rate of fragmentation. Physics-based models are compared to the\nmolecular dynamics results with the goal of deriving a new model that accounts\nfor the effect of the electric field on fragmentation.

In most of the calculations we prescribe a constant\naccretion rate for the solid core. The evolution of the gaseous envelope\nassumes that: (1) it is in quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium, (2) the gas accretion\nrate is determined by the requirement that the outer radius of the planet is\nthe place at which the thermal velocity of the gas allows it to reach the\nboundary of the planet's Hill sphere, (3) the gas accretion rate is limited,\nmoreover, by the prescribed maximum rate at which the nebula can supply the\ngas, and (4) the growth of the planet stops once it obtains approximately the\nminimum mass determined from radial velocity measurements. Calculations are\ncarried out through an initial phase during which solid accretion dominates,\npast the point of crossover when the masses of solid and gaseous material are\nequal, through the phase of rapid gas accretion, and into the final phase of\ncontraction and cooling at constant mass.

The results of the estimation\nare threefold. First, the finding shows a small day-of-the week effect in\nvolatility on Saturday and Sunday than in the rest of the week. Second,\nalthough the holiday effects are examined in active trading countries, namely\nJapan, China, Germany, and the United States, the positive post-holiday effect\non the returns and weak positive pre-holiday effect on the volatility are only\nobserved in the United States. Finally, the asymmetry effect is not observed. A\ncomparison of Bitcoin to several assets such as stock, currency, and gold shows\nBitcoin's positioning between stock, currency, and gold in relation to the week\nand holiday effects, its reaction to federal funds and medium of exchange\ncharacteristics, and the lack of asymmetry effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 05:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

Developing novel methods to identify early mortality is\ncritical for improving survival outcomes in sepsis patients. Using the\nMIMIC-III database, we integrated demographic data, physiological measurements\nand clinical notes. We built and applied several machine learning models to\npredict the risk of hospital mortality and 30-day mortality in sepsis patients.\nFrom the clinical notes, we generated clinically meaningful word\nrepresentations and embeddings. Supervised learning classifiers and a deep\nlearning architecture were used to construct prediction models. The\nconfigurations that utilized both structured and unstructured clinical features\nyielded competitive F-measure of 0.512.

In this study, we investigate this\nproblem by using 1,294,644 AI related collaborative papers harvested from the\nMicrosoft Academic Graph (MAG) dataset. A framework including 13 indicators to\nquantify the distance factors between countries from 5 perspectives (i.e.,\ngeographic distance, economic distance, cultural distance, academic distance,\nand industrial distance) is proposed. The relationships were conducted by the\nmethods of descriptive analysis and regression analysis. The results show that\ninternational collaboration in the field of AI today is not prevalent (only\n15.7%). All the separations in international collaborations have increased over\nyears, except for the cultural distance in masculinity/felinity dimension and\nthe industrial distance. The geographic distance, economic distance and\nacademic distances have shown significantly negative relationships with the\ndegree of international collaborations in the field of AI. The industrial\ndistance has a significant positive relationship with the degree of\ninternational collaboration in the field of AI. Also, the results demonstrate\nthat the participation of the United States and China have promoted the\ninternational collaboration in the field of AI. This study provides a\ncomprehensive understanding of internationalizing AI research in geographic,\neconomic, cultural, academic, and industrial aspects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 00:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}
