Stochastic mechanical systems include pure\ndiffusions in Euclidean space or on Lie groups, as well as systems evolving on\nphase space for which the fluctuation-dissipation theorem applies, i.e.,\nreturn-to-equilibrium processes. Two separate ways for ensembles of such\nmechanical systems forced by noise to reach equilibrium are examined here.\nFirst, a restorative potential and damping can be applied, leading to a\nclassical return-to-equilibrium process wherein energy taken out by damping can\nbalance the energy going in from the noise. Second, the process evolves on a\ncompact configuration space (such as random walks on spheres, torsion angles in\nchain molecules, and rotational Brownian motion) lead to long-time solutions\nthat are constant over the configuration space, regardless of whether or not\ndamping and random forcing balance. This is a kind of potential-free\nequilibrium distribution resulting from topological constraints. Inertial and\nnoninertial (kinematic) systems are considered. These systems can consist of\nunconstrained particles or more complex systems with constraints, such as\nrigid-bodies or linkages. These more complicated systems evolve on Lie groups\nand model phenomena such as rotational Brownian motion and nonholonomic robotic\nsystems.

This paradigm was challenged by the\ndiscovery of topological order, in materials where the number of accessible\nstates is not solely determined by the number of broken symmetries, but also by\nspace topology. Until now however, the concept of topological order has been\nlinked to quantum entanglement and has therefore remained out of reach in\nclassical systems. Here, we show that classical systems whose global geometry\nfrustrates the emergence of homogeneous order realise an unanticipated form of\ntopological order defined by non-orientable order-parameter bundles:\nnon-orientable order. We validate experimentally and theoretically this concept\nby designing frustrated mechanical metamaterials that spontaneously break a\ndiscrete symmetry under homogeneous load. While conventional order leads to a\ndiscrete ground-state degeneracy, we show that non-orientable order implies an\nextensive ground-state degeneracy -- in the form of topologically protected\nzero-nodes and zero-lines. Our metamaterials escape the traditional\nclassification of order by symmetry breaking. Considering more general stress\ndistributions, we leverage non-orientable order to engineer robust mechanical\nmemory and achieve non-Abelian mechanical responses that carry an imprint of\nthe braiding of local loads.

In this paper, we propose a\nsimple yet effective Calibrated Feature Decomposition (CFD) module that focuses\non improving the generalization capacity for person re-identification through a\nmore judicious feature decomposition and reinforcement strategy. Specifically,\na calibrated-and-standardized Batch normalization (CSBN) is designed to learn\ncalibrated person representation by jointly exploring intra-domain calibration\nand inter-domain standardization of multi-source domain features. CSBN\nrestricts instance-level inconsistency of feature distribution for each domain\nand captures intrinsic domain-level specific statistics. The calibrated person\nrepresentation is subtly decomposed into the identity-relevant feature, domain\nfeature, and the remaining entangled one. For enhancing the generalization\nability and ensuring high discrimination of the identity-relevant feature, a\ncalibrated instance normalization (CIN) is introduced to enforce discriminative\nid-relevant information, and filter out id-irrelevant information, and\nmeanwhile the rich complementary clues from the remaining entangled feature are\nfurther employed to strengthen it. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong\ngeneralization capability of our framework. Our models empowered by CFD modules\nsignificantly outperform the state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches\non multiple widely-used benchmarks.

In the present work, detailed\ntrack-structure Monte Carlo simulations, performed with the code SEED\n(Secondary Electron Energy Deposition), are presented for carbon ions in a wide\nenergy range in liquid water. Liquid water is the main constituent of\nbiological tissues, and carbon ions are one of the most promising projectiles\ncurrently available for ion beam cancer therapy. The simulations are based on\naccurate cross sections for the different elastic and inelastic events\ndetermining the interaction of charged particles with condensed-phase\nmaterials. The latter are derived from the ab initio calculation of the\nelectronic excitation spectrum of liquid water by means of time-dependent\ndensity functional theory (TDDFT), which is then used within the dielectric\nformalism to obtain inelastic electronic cross sections for both carbon ions\nand secondary electrons. Both the ionisation cross sections of water by carbon\nions and the excitation and ionisation cross sections for electron impact are\nobtained in very good agreement with known experimental data. The elastic\nscattering cross sections for electrons in condensed-phase water are also\nobtained from ab initio calculations by solving the Dirac-Hartree-Fock\nequation.

We have calculated the stopping\npower of the transition metals Pt and Au for protons and alpha particles in a\nwide energy range, using the dielectric formalism, which realistically accounts\nfor the excitation spectrum of each metal through the Mermin Energy Loss\nFunction - Generalised Oscillator Strength methodology. For each combination of\nprojectile, energy and target, we have considered: (i) the equilibrium charge\nstate of the projectile through the target, (ii) the energy-loss due to\nelectron capture and loss processes, and (iii) the energy loss resulting from\nthe polarisation of the projectile's electronic cloud due to the self-induced\nelectric field. Our calculated stopping powers show a fairly good agreement\nwith the available experimental data for platinum and gold, particularly the\nmost recent ones around the stopping power maximum, which validates the\nmethodology we have used to be further extended to other transition metals.

In the US Veteran\nAffairs Health Care System (VA), many of the enrollees are susceptible to\nCOVID-19. Predicting the COVID-19 to allocate medical resources promptly\nbecomes a critical issue. When the VA enrollees have COVID-19 symptoms, it is\nrecommended that their first step should be to call the VA Call Center. For\nconfirmed COVID-19 patients, the median time from the first symptom to hospital\nadmission was seven days. By predicting the number of COVID-19 related calls,\nwe could predict imminent surges in healthcare use and plan medical resources\nahead. Objective: The study aims to develop a method to forecast the daily\nnumber of COVID-19 related calls for each of the 110 VA medical centers.\nMethods: In the proposed method, we pre-trained a model using a cluster of\nmedical centers and fine-tuned it for individual medical centers. At the\ncluster level, we performed feature selection to select significant features\nand automatic hyper-parameter search to select optimal hyper-parameter value\ncombinations for the model. Conclusions: This study proposed an accurate method\nto forecast the daily number of COVID-19 related calls for VA medical centers.\nThe proposed method was able to overcome modeling challenges by grouping\nsimilar medical centers into clusters to enlarge the dataset for training\nmodels, and using hyper-parameter search to automatically find optimal\nhyper-parameter value combinations for models. With the proposed method, surges\nin health care can be predicted ahead. This allows health care practitioners to\nbetter plan medical resources and combat COVID-19.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2021 20:36:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 05:29:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 16:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

This\ntype of off-road environment is an extreme case of situations autonomous cars\ncould encounter in northern regions. Thus, it is important to understand the\nimpact of this harsh environment on autonomous navigation systems. To this end,\nwe present a field report analyzing teach-and-repeat navigation in a subarctic\nforest while subject to fluctuating weather, including light and heavy snow,\nrain and drizzle. First, we describe the system, which relies on point cloud\nregistration to localize a mobile robot through a boreal forest, while\nsimultaneously building a map. We experimentally evaluate this system in over\n18.8 km of autonomous navigation in the teach-and-repeat mode. Over 14 repeat\nruns, only four manual interventions were required, three of which were due to\nlocalization failure and another one caused by battery power outage. We show\nthat dense vegetation perturbs the GNSS signal, rendering it unsuitable for\nnavigation in forest trails. Furthermore, we highlight the increased\nuncertainty related to localizing using point cloud registration in forest\ntrails. We demonstrate that it is not snow precipitation, but snow\naccumulation, that affects our system's ability to localize within the\nenvironment. Finally, we expose some challenges and lessons learned from our\nfield campaign to support better experimental work in winter conditions.

Specifically, it allows for the problem to be split into an\nonline phase where a stream of appointment requests arrive requiring a\nscheduled time, followed by an offline phase where those appointments are\nscheduled into rooms. Similar to the bin-packing problem, the aim is to use the\nminimum number of rooms in the final configuration. This model more accurately\ncaptures scheduling appointments than bin packing. For example, a dialysis\npatient needs to know what time to arrive for an appointment, but does not need\nto know the assigned station ahead of time.\n  Previous work developed a randomized algorithm for this problem which\nachieved an asymptotic competitive ratio of at most 1.5, proving that online\nMPAS was fundamentally different from the online bin-packing problem. Our main\ncontribution is to develop a new randomized algorithm for the problem that\nachieves an asymptotic competitive ratio under 1.455, indicating the potential\nfor further progress. This improvement is attained by modifying the process for\nscheduling appointments to increase the density of the packing in the worst\ncase, along with utilizing the dual of the bin-packing linear programming\nrelaxation to perform the analysis. We also present the first known lower bound\nof 1.2 on the asymptotic competitive ratio of both deterministic and randomized\nonline MPAS algorithm. These results demonstrate how deferred decision-making\ncan be leveraged to yield improved worst-case performance, a phenomenon which\nshould be investigated in a broader class of settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2021 21:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

However, the data collected with new\nphotography tools is usually oblique - they are difficult to be georeferenced,\nand huge amounts of data is often obsolete. Georeferencing oblique imagery data\nmay be solved by a technique called monoplotting, which only requires a single\nimage and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In traditional monoplotting, a human\nuser has to manually choose a series of ground control point (GCP) pairs in the\nimage and DEM and then determine the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters of the\ncamera to establish a pixel-level correspondence between photos and the DEM to\nenable the mapping and georeferencing of objects in photos. This traditional\nmethod is difficult to scale due to several challenges including the\nlabor-intensive inputs, the need of rich experience to identify well-defined\nGCPs, and limitations in camera pose estimation. Therefore, existing\nmonoplotting methods are rarely used in analyzing large-scale databases or\nnear-real-time warning systems. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a\nnovel semi-automatic monoplotting framework that provides pixel-level\ncorrespondence between photos and DEMs requiring minimal human interventions.

Two numerical\nexperiments show that the framework is superior in georeferencing visual data\nin 3-D coordinates, paving a way toward fully automatic monoplotting\nmethodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 02:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

Existing studies have applied GNNs to capture\ncollaborative relations in the data. However, in real-world scenarios, the\nrelations in a recommendation graph can be of various kinds. For example, two\nmovies may be associated either by the same genre or by the same\ndirector/actor. If we use a single graph to elaborate all these relations, the\ngraph can be too complex to process. To address this issue, we bring the idea\nof pre-training to process the complex graph step by step. Based on the idea of\ndivide-and-conquer, we separate the large graph into three sub-graphs: user\ngraph, item graph, and user-item interaction graph. Then the user and item\nembeddings are pre-trained from user and item graphs, respectively. To conduct\npre-training, we construct the multi-relational user graph and item graph,\nrespectively, based on their attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel\nReinforced Attentive Multi-relational Graph Neural Network (RAM-GNN) to the\npre-train user and item embeddings on the user and item graph prior to the\nrecommendation step. Specifically, we design a relation-level attention layer\nto learn the importance of different relations. Next, a Reinforced Neighbor\nSampler (RNS) is applied to search the optimal filtering threshold for sampling\ntop-k similar neighbors in the graph, which avoids the over-smoothing issue. We\ninitialize the recommendation model with the pre-trained user/item embeddings.\nFinally, an aggregation-based GNN model is utilized to learn from the\ncollaborative relations in the user-item interaction graph and provide\nrecommendations. Our experiments demonstrate that RAM-GNN outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art graph-based recommendation models and multi-relational graph\nneural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 03:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

To gather\nrich sensing information and a higher line-of-sight (LoS) availability,\nTHz-operated reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) acting as base stations\nare deployed.

To solve this problem, we propose an efficient\nstereo geometry network (ESGN). The key in our ESGN is an efficient\ngeometry-aware feature generation (EGFG) module. Our EGFG module first uses a\nstereo correlation and reprojection module to construct multi-scale stereo\nvolumes in camera frustum space, second employs a multi-scale BEV projection\nand fusion module to generate multiple geometry-aware features. In these two\nsteps, we adopt deep multi-scale information fusion for discriminative\ngeometry-aware feature generation, without any complex aggregation networks.

However, the existing data\npreprocessing techniques, in particular SMOTE and its derivatives, which\nconstitute the most prevalent paradigm of imbalanced data preprocessing, tend\nto be susceptible to various data difficulty factors.

The understanding of not only the formation, but also the\ncomposition of clouds is crucial to the understanding of future observations.\nAs observations of the planet's surface will remain very difficult, it is\nessential to link the observable high atmosphere gas and cloud composition to\nthe surface conditions. We present a fast and simple chemical equilibrium (eq.)\nmodel for the troposphere of rocky exoplanets, which is in chemical and phase\neq. with the crust. The hydrostatic eq. atmosphere is built from bottom to top.\nIn each atmospheric layer chemical eq. is solved and all thermally stable\ncondensates are removed, depleting the atmosphere above in the effected\nelements. These removed condensates build an upper limit for cloud formation\nand can be separated into high and low temperature condensates. The most\nimportant cloud condensates for 1000K>T>400K are KCl, NaCl, FeS, FeS2, FeO,\nFe2O3, Fe3O4. For T<400K H2O, C, NH3, NH4Cl, NH4SH are thermally stable. For\neven lower temperatures of T<150K CO2, CH4, NH3, H2S become stable.

Our proposed work is able to manipulate the desired attributes of\nthe query image while maintaining its other attributes. For example, the collar\nattribute of the query image can be changed from round to v-neck to retrieve\nsimilar images from a large dataset. A key challenge in e-commerce is that\nimages have multiple attributes where users would like to manipulate and it is\nimportant to estimate discriminative feature representations for each of these\nattributes. The proposed FashionSearchNet-v2 architecture is able to learn\nattribute specific representations by leveraging on its weakly-supervised\nlocalization module, which ignores the unrelated features of attributes in the\nfeature space, thus improving the similarity learning. The network is jointly\ntrained with the combination of attribute classification and triplet ranking\nloss to estimate local representations. These local representations are then\nmerged into a single global representation based on the instructed attribute\nmanipulation where desired images can be retrieved with a distance metric. The\nproposed method also provides explainability for its retrieval process to help\nprovide additional information on the attention of the network. Experiments\nperformed on several datasets that are rich in terms of the number of\nattributes show that FashionSearchNet-v2 outperforms the other state-of-the-art\nattribute manipulation techniques.

The sonic point, mathematically corresponds to a singularity\nof the system of differential equations describing the flow. In the problem of\nan isothermal wind, the Parker solution provides an exact analytical expression\ntuned appropriately so that the singularity does not affect the solution.\nHowever, if the wind is polytropic it is not possible to find an analytical\nsolution and a numerical approach needs to be followed. We study solutions of\nspherical winds that are driven by pressure within a gravitational field. The\nsolutions pass smoothly from the critical point and allow us to study the\nimpact of the changes of the polytropic index to these winds. We explore the\nproperties of these solutions as a function of the polytropic index and the\nboundary conditions used. We apply the Complex Plane Strategy (CPS) and we\nobtain numerically solutions of polytropic winds. This allows us to avoid the\nsingularity appearing in the equations through the introduction complex\nvariables and integration on the complex plane. Applying this method, we obtain\nsolutions with physical behaviour at the stellar surface, the sonic point and\nat large distances from the star. We further explore the role of the polytropic\nindex in the flow and the effect of mass--loss rate and temperature on the\nsolution.

Using real-world data, we\nshow that TCAM outperforms traditional methods, as well as state-of-the-art\ntensor-based approaches for longitudinal microbiome data analysis. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate the versatility of TCAM by applying it to several different omics\ndatasets, and the applicability of it as a drop-in replacement within\nstraightforward ML tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 14:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Centralized training decentralized\nexecution paradigm brings out the best of these two approaches; however,\ncentralized training still has an upper limit of scalability not only for\nacquired coordination performance but also for model size and training time. In\nthis work, we adopt the centralized training with decentralized execution\nparadigm and investigate the generalization and transfer capacity of the\ntrained models across variable number of agents.

We perform experimental\nevaluations on predator prey and traffic junction environments and demonstrate\nthat it is possible to obtain similar or higher evaluation performance by\ntraining with less agents.

We use the most popular\n$f(R)$ gravity model, namely the $R^2$ gravity, and calculate the maximum\nbaryon mass of static neutron stars adopting several realistic equations of\nstate and one ideal equation of state, namely that of causal limit. Our\nmotivation is based on the fact that neutron stars with baryon masses larger\nthan the maximum mass for static neutron star configurations inevitably\ncollapse to black holes. Thus with our analysis, we want further to enlighten\nthe predictions for the maximum baryon masses of static neutron stars in $R^2$\ngravity, which, in turn, further strengthens our understanding of the\nmysterious mass-gap region. As we show, the baryon masses of most of the\nequations of states studied in this paper, lie in the lower limits of the\nmass-gap region $M\\sim 2.5-5 M_{\\odot}$, but intriguingly enough, the highest\nvalue of the maximum baryon masses we found is of the order of $M\\sim 3\nM_{\\odot}$. This upper mass limit also appears as a maximum static neutron star\ngravitational mass limit in other contexts.

This, in\nturn, implies that maximum neutron star masses in the context of $R^2$ gravity\nare likely to be in the lower limits of the range of $M\\sim 2.4-3 M_{\\odot}$.\nHence our work further supports the General Relativity claim that neutron stars\ncannot have gravitational masses larger than $3$$M_{\\odot}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 15:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

An ongoing challenge in all these is finding an\nefficient and controllable mechanism to entangle photons. Recent experimental\ndevelopments in electron microscopy enable to control the quantum interaction\nbetween free electrons and light. Here, we show that free electrons can create\nentanglement and bunching of light. Free electrons can control the second-order\ncoherence of initially independent photonic states, even in spatially separated\ncavities that cannot directly interact. Free electrons thus provide a type of\noptical nonlinearity that acts in a nonlocal manner, offering a new way of\nheralding the creation of entanglement. Intriguingly, pre-shaping the\nelectron's wavefunction provides the knob for tuning the photonic quantum\ncorrelations. The concept can be generalized to entangle not only photons but\nalso photonic quasiparticles such as plasmon-polaritons and phonons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 15:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

However, training the zero-shot classification models still requires\nattribute labeling for each class (or even instance) in the training dataset,\nwhich is also expensive. To this end, in this paper, we bring up a new problem\nscenario: \"Can we derive zero-shot learning for novel attribute\ndetectors/classifiers and use them to automatically annotate the dataset for\nlabeling efficiency?\". Basically, given only a small set of detectors that are\nlearned to recognize some manually annotated attributes (i.e., the seen\nattributes), we aim to synthesize the detectors of novel attributes in a\nzero-shot learning manner. Our proposed method, Zero-Shot Learning for\nAttributes (ZSLA), which is the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge,\ntackles this new research problem by applying the set operations to first\ndecompose the seen attributes into their basic attributes and then recombine\nthese basic attributes into the novel ones. Extensive experiments are conducted\nto verify the capacity of our synthesized detectors for accurately capturing\nthe semantics of the novel attributes and show their superior performance in\nterms of detection and localization compared to other baseline approaches.\nMoreover, we demonstrate the application of automatic annotation using our\nsynthesized detectors on Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset. Various\ngeneralized zero-shot classification algorithms trained upon the dataset\nre-annotated by ZSLA show comparable performance with those trained with the\nmanual ground-truth annotations.

By treating code as a series of interdependent events\nthat occur continuously, we design a model namely EDAM to encode code semantic\ninformation based on event embedding and event dependency. The EDAM model uses\nthe event embedding method to model the execution characteristics of program\nstatements and the data dependence information between all statements. In this\nway, we can embed the program semantic information into a vector and use the\nvector to detect codes similar in semantics.

The superior pairing of ubiquitously available WiFi signals with\ncomputationally capable smartphones is set to revolutionize the area of indoor\nlocalization. However, the observed signal characteristics from independently\nmaintained WiFi access points vary greatly over time. Moreover, some of the\nWiFi access points visible at the initial deployment phase may be replaced or\nremoved over time. These factors are often ignored in indoor localization\nframeworks and cause gradual and catastrophic degradation of localization\naccuracy post-deployment (over weeks and months). To overcome these challenges,\nwe propose a Siamese neural encoder-based framework that offers up to 40%\nreduction in degradation of localization accuracy over time compared to the\nstate-of-the-art in the area, without requiring any retraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 07:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-02"}

The volume of digital data in general\nand security event data in specific is increasing exponentially. The velocity\nwith which the security event data is generated and fed into a BDCA system is\nunpredictable. Therefore, a BDCA system should be highly scalable to deal with\nthe unpredictable increase/decrease in the velocity of security event data.\nHowever, there has been little effort to investigate the scalability of BDCA\nsystems to identify and exploit the sources of scalability improvement. In this\npaper, we first investigate the scalability of a Spark-based BDCA system with\ndefault Spark settings. we then identify Spark configuration parameters (e.g.,\nexecution memory) that can significantly impact the scalability of a BDCA\nsystem. Based on the identified parameters, we finally propose a\nparameter-driven adaptation approach, SCALER, for optimizing a system's\nscalability. We have conducted a set of experiments by implementing a\nSpark-based BDCA system on a large-scale OpenStack cluster. We ran our\nexperiments with four security datasets. We have found that (i) a BDCA system\nwith default Spark configuration parameters deviates from ideal scalability by\n59.5% (ii) 9 out of 11 studied Spark configuration parameters significantly\nimpact scalability (iii) SCALER improves the BDCA system's scalability by 20.8%\ncompared to the scalability with default Spark parameter setting. The findings\nof our study highlight the importance of exploring the parameter space of the\nunderlying big data framework (e.g., Apache Spark) for scalable cyber security\nanalytics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 07:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}
