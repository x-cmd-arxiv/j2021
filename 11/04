Treating collision partners as\nrigid rotors, the time evolution of interaction-induced dipole is accumulated\nover a vast ensemble of classical trajectories and subsequently transformed\ninto CIA spectrum via Fourier transform. In our calculations, both bound and\nunbound states are properly accounted for, and the rigorous theory of\nlower-order spectral moments is addressed to check the accuracy of simulated\nprofiles. Classically derived trajectory-based profiles are subject to two\napproximate desymmetrization procedures so that resulting profiles conform to\nthe quantum principle of detailed balance. The simulated profiles are compared\nto laboratory measurements and employed for modeling Titan's spectra in the\n50-500 cm$^{-1}$ range. Based on the desymmetrized simulated profiles, a new\nsemi-empirical model for CH$_4-$N$_2$ CIA is proposed for modeling Titan's\ninfrared spectra. Synthetic spectra derived using this model yield an excellent\nagreement with the data recorded by the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS)\naboard the Cassini spacecraft at low and high emission angles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 16:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

Here, we propose the band tilt induced nonlinear Nernst\neffect (NLNE) in TIs as a clean and efficient route to generate\nhigh-performance spin polarization (SP). We show that in the presence of SML\nand hexagonal warping effect a finite band tilt can induce an imbalance of two\nspin carriers and effectively give rise to spin-polarized NLNE current in TIs.\nIn our scheme, both the spin current and charge current regime can be achieved\nunder the thermal drive. The obtainable SP can be efficiently tuned in either a\nsmooth or rapid way, exhibiting highly flexible tunability. In addition,\nnear-unity SP can be generated within a wide range of tunable parameters, which\nis also found to be robust against temperature. Therefore, our work provides a\nmechanism to realize controllable room-temperature high-degree SP based on TIs,\nwhich is of essential importance for future spintronics applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 16:03:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 02:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

Many existing\nstudies of GANs focus on improving the realness of the generated image data for\nvisual applications, and few of them concern about improving the quality of the\ngenerated data for training other classifiers -- a task known as the model\ncompatibility problem. As a consequence, existing GANs often prefer generating\n`easier' synthetic data that are far from the boundaries of the classifiers,\nand refrain from generating near-boundary data, which are known to play an\nimportant roles in training the classifiers. To improve GAN in terms of model\ncompatibility, we propose Boundary-Calibration GANs (BCGANs), which leverage\nthe boundary information from a set of pre-trained classifiers using the\noriginal data. In particular, we introduce an auxiliary Boundary-Calibration\nloss (BC-loss) into the generator of GAN to match the statistics between the\nposterior distributions of original data and generated data with respect to the\nboundaries of the pre-trained classifiers. The BC-loss is provably unbiased and\ncan be easily coupled with different GAN variants to improve their model\ncompatibility. Experimental results demonstrate that BCGANs not only generate\nrealistic images like original GANs but also achieves superior model\ncompatibility than the original GANs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 16:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

We derive an analytic distribution of shortest path lengths, on the\ngiant component in the supercritical regime or on small components in the\nsubcritical regime, of any sparse (possibly directed) graph with conditionally\nindependent edges, in the infinite-size limit. We provide specific results for\nwidely used network families like stochastic block models, dot-product graphs,\nrandom geometric graphs, and graphons. The survival function of the shortest\npath length distribution possesses a simple closed-form lower bound which is\nasymptotically tight for finite lengths, has a natural interpretation of\ntraversing independent geodesics in the network, and delivers novel insight in\nthe above network families. Notably, the shortest path length distribution\nallows us to derive, for the network families above, important graph properties\nlike the bond percolation threshold, size of the giant component, average\nshortest path length, and closeness and betweenness centralities. We also\nprovide a corroborative analysis of a set of 20 empirical networks.

We report the design,\nmanufacturing, and conditioning process for a new HVFT that utilizes ultra-high\nmolecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) as the insulating material. Our HVFT is\nhighly customizable, inexpensive, and has proven to be effective in high\nvoltage applications. After a couple of weeks of gas and voltage conditioning,\nwe achieved a maximum voltage of 180 kV with a progressively improved vacuum\nlevel of 1.8 x $10^{-8}$ Torr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 17:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

In IL from\ndemonstrations, an important challenge is to obtain agent policies that are\nsmooth with respect to the inputs. Learning through imitation a policy that is\nsmooth as a function of a large state-action ($s$-$a$) space (typical of high\ndimensional continuous control environments) can be challenging. We take a\nfirst step towards tackling this issue by using smoothness inducing\nregularizers on \\textit{both} the policy and the cost models of adversarial\nimitation learning. Our regularizers work by ensuring that the cost function\nchanges in a controlled manner as a function of $s$-$a$ space; and the agent\npolicy is well behaved with respect to the state space. We call our new smooth\nIL algorithm \\textit{Smooth Policy and Cost Imitation Learning} (SPaCIL,\npronounced 'Special'). We introduce a novel metric to quantify the smoothness\nof the learned policies. We demonstrate SPaCIL's superior performance on\ncontinuous control tasks from MuJoCo.

The intra-frame contrastive loss helps separate the foreground and\nbackground features, and the inter-frame contrastive loss improves the temporal\nconsistency. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets for\nvideo salient object detection and unsupervised video object segmentation, and\nshow that the proposed method requires less computation, and performs favorably\nagainst the state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 17:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

These essentially compressive waves perturb the\ncoronal thermal equilibrium, leading to the phenomenon of a wave-induced\nthermal misbalance. Representing an additional natural mechanism for the\nexchange of energy between the plasma and the wave, thermal misbalance makes\nthe corona an active medium for magnetoacoustic waves, so that the wave can not\nonly lose but also gain energy from the coronal heating source (similarly to\nburning gases, lasers and masers). We review recent achievements in this newly\nemerging research field, focussing on the effects that slow-mode\nmagnetoacoustic waves experience as a back-reaction of this perturbed coronal\nthermal equilibrium. The new effects include enhanced frequency-dependent\ndamping or amplification of slow waves, and effective, not associated with the\ncoronal plasma non-uniformity, dispersion. We also discuss the possibility to\nprobe the unknown coronal heating function by observations of slow waves and\nlinear theory of thermal instabilities. The manifold of the new properties that\nslow waves acquire from a thermodynamically active nature of the solar corona\nindicate a clear need for accounting for the effects of combined coronal\nheating/cooling processes not only for traditional problems of the formation\nand evolution of prominences and coronal rain, but also for an adequate\nmodelling and interpretation of magnetohydrodynamic waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 17:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

Unveiling the relationship between these hydrodynamic\nequations and the underlying microscopic theory usually requires a great effort\nby condensed matter theorists. In the present paper, we develop a new\nmachine-learning framework for automated discovery of effective equations from\na limited set of available data, thus bypassing complicated analytical\nderivations.

One of the\nmost elementary classical operations is the addition of bit strings.

This new use of the method offers further understanding of its\napplicability.\n  Considering state tomography we suggest circumventing our impossibility by\nrelaxing to random superposition or entangled superposition.

Within strong pinning theory, vortices get pinned\nby individual defects, with the jumps in the pinning energy ($\\Delta\ne_\\mathrm{pin}$) and force ($\\Delta f_\\mathrm{pin}$) between bistable pinned\nand free states quantifying the pinning process. We find that the evolution of\nthe Campbell length $\\lambda_{\\rm C}(t)$ as a function of time $t$ is the\nresult of two competing effects, the change in the force jumps $\\Delta\nf_\\mathrm{pin}(t)$ and a change in the trapping area $S_\\mathrm{trap}(t)$ of\nvortices; the latter describes the area around the defect where a nearby vortex\ngets and remains trapped.

A long-standing\nopen problem has been to establish a true second law of entanglement, and in\nparticular a unique function which governs all transformations between\nentangled systems, mirroring the role of entropy in thermodynamics. Contrary to\nprevious promising evidence, here we show that this is impossible, and no\ndirect counterpart to the second law of thermodynamics can be established. This\nis accomplished by demonstrating the irreversibility of entanglement theory\nfrom first principles -- assuming only the most general microscopic physical\nconstraints of entanglement manipulation, we show that entanglement theory is\nirreversible under all non-entangling transformations. We furthermore rule out\nreversibility without significant entanglement expenditure, showing that\nreversible entanglement transformations require the generation of\nmacroscopically large amounts of entanglement according to certain measures.\nOur results not only reveal fundamental differences between quantum\nentanglement transformations and thermodynamic processes, but also showcase a\nunique property of entanglement which distinguishes it from other known quantum\nresources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 18:00:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 11:05:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 00:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

Their main properties\nare usually attributed to the accumulation of dynamically significant net\nmagnetic (vertical) flux throughout the arrested region, which is then\nregulated by interchange instabilities. Here we propose instead that it is\nmainly a dynamically important {\\it toroidal} field -- the result of dynamo\naction triggered by the significant but still relatively weak vertical field --\nthat defines and regulates the properties of MADs. We suggest that rapid\nconvection-like instabilities, involving interchange of toroidal flux tubes and\noperating concurrently with the magnetorotatonal instability (MRI), can\nregulate the structure of the disc and the escape of net flux. We generalize\nthe convective stability criteria and disc structure equations to include the\neffects of a strong toroidal field and show that convective flows could be\ndriven towards two distinct marginally stable states, one of which we associate\nwith MADs. We confirm the plausibility of our theoretical model by comparing\nits quantitative predictions to simulations of both MAD and SANE (strongly\nmagnetized but not \"arrested\") discs, and suggest a set of criteria that could\nhelp to distinguish MADs from other accretion states.

Inspired by 2D panoptic segmentation, we propose to\nunify the tasks of geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D\ninstance segmentation into the task of panoptic 3D scene reconstruction - from\na single RGB image, predicting the complete geometric reconstruction of the\nscene in the camera frustum of the image, along with semantic and instance\nsegmentations. We thus propose a new approach for holistic 3D scene\nunderstanding from a single RGB image which learns to lift and propagate 2D\nfeatures from an input image to a 3D volumetric scene representation. We\ndemonstrate that this holistic view of joint scene reconstruction, semantic,\nand instance segmentation is beneficial over treating the tasks independently,\nthus outperforming alternative approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 18:06:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 15:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

However,\nmultiple recent works show that state-of-the-art architectures yet struggle to\nachieve this goal. In particular, they report an elevated amount of high\nfrequencies in the spectral statistics which makes it straightforward to\ndistinguish real and generated images. Explanations for this phenomenon are\ncontroversial: While most works attribute the artifacts to the generator, other\nworks point to the discriminator. We take a sober look at those explanations\nand provide insights on what makes proposed measures against high-frequency\nartifacts effective. To achieve this, we first independently assess the\narchitectures of both the generator and discriminator and investigate if they\nexhibit a frequency bias that makes learning the distribution of high-frequency\ncontent particularly problematic. Based on these experiments, we make the\nfollowing four observations: 1) Different upsampling operations bias the\ngenerator towards different spectral properties. 2) Checkerboard artifacts\nintroduced by upsampling cannot explain the spectral discrepancies alone as the\ngenerator is able to compensate for these artifacts. 3) The discriminator does\nnot struggle with detecting high frequencies per se but rather struggles with\nfrequencies of low magnitude. 4) The downsampling operations in the\ndiscriminator can impair the quality of the training signal it provides. In\nlight of these findings, we analyze proposed measures against high-frequency\nartifacts in state-of-the-art GAN training but find that none of the existing\napproaches can fully resolve spectral artifacts yet. Our results suggest that\nthere is great potential in improving the discriminator and that this could be\nkey to match the distribution of the training data more closely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 18:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}

They are routinely used for inference\nand various prediction tasks, such as to build species distribution maps or\nbiomass estimation over spatial areas. Existing JSDM's cannot, however, model\nmutual exclusion between species, which may happen in some species groups, such\nas mosses in the bottom layer of a peatland site. We tackle this deficiency in\nthe context of modeling plant percentage cover data, where mutual exclusion\narises from limited growing space and competition for light. We propose a\nhierarchical JSDM where multivariate latent Gaussian variable model describes\nspecies' niche preferences and Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution models the\nobservation process and exclusive competition for space between species. We use\nboth stationary and non-stationary multivariate Gaussian processes to model\nresidual phenomena.

In this paper, we proposed a novel method of exploiting model\nparallelism to separate a neural network for distributed inferences. To achieve\na better balance between communication latency, computation latency, and\nperformance, we adopt neural architecture search (NAS) to search for the best\ntransmission policy and reduce the amount of communication. The best model we\nfound decreases by 86.6% of the amount of data transmission compared to the\nbaseline and does not impact performance much.

Most existing works focus on identifying coarse actions such as\nrunning, climbing, or cutting a vegetable, which have relatively long\ndurations. This is an important limitation for applications that require the\nidentification of subtle motions at high temporal resolution. For example, in\nstroke recovery, quantifying rehabilitation dose requires differentiating\nmotions with sub-second durations. Our goal is to bridge this gap. To this end,\nwe introduce a large-scale, multimodal dataset, StrokeRehab, as a new\naction-recognition benchmark that includes subtle short-duration actions\nlabeled at a high temporal resolution. These short-duration actions are called\nfunctional primitives, and consist of reaches, transports, repositions,\nstabilizations, and idles.

Building upon previous findings,\nhere we combine MUSE observations conducted within the GASP program and a\ngeneral survey of the literature to robustly measure the AGN fraction in\ncluster's ram pressure stripped galaxies using BPT emission line diagrams.\nConsidering a sample of 115 ram pressure stripped galaxies with stellar masses\n$\\geq 10^9 \\, M_{\\odot}$, we find an AGN fraction of $\\sim27\\%$. This fraction\nstrongly depends on stellar mass: it raises to 51% when only ram-pressure\nstripped galaxies of masses $M_* \\geq 10^{10} \\, M_{\\odot}$ are considered. We\nthen investigate whether the AGN incidence is in excess in ram pressure\nstripped galaxies compared to non-stripped galaxies, using as comparison a\nsample of non-cluster galaxies observed by the survey MaNGA. Considering\nmass-matched samples, we find that the incidence of AGN activity is\nsignificantly higher (at a confidence level $>99.95\\%$) when ram-pressure\nstripping is on act, supporting the hypothesis of an AGN-ram pressure\nconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 21:51:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 14:09:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

The ability to detect presentation attacks\nor spoofing attempts is a pressing concern for the integrity, security, and\ntrust of facial recognition systems.

We argue that the magnetism of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ has a dual\nnature and bears certain aspects of both itineracy and localization. On the one\nhand, the magnetism is soft, where the local magnetic moments strongly depend\non temperature and the angles formed by these moments at different Co sites of\nthe kagome lattice, as expected for itinerant magnets. On the other hand, the\npicture of localized spins still remains adequate for the description of the\nlocal stability of the ferromagnetic (FM) order with respect to the transversal\nspin fluctuations. For the latter purposes, we employ two approaches, which\nprovide quite different pictures for interatomic exchange interactions: the\nregular magnetic force theorem and a formally exact theory based on the\ncalculation of the inverse response function. The exact theory predicts\nCo$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ to be a three-dimensional ferromagnet with the strongest\ninteraction operating between next-nearest neighbors in the adjacent kagome\nplanes. The ligand states are found to play a very important role by\nadditionally stabilizing the FM order. When the local moments decrease, the\ninterplane interactions sharply decrease, first causing the FM order to become\nquasi-two-dimensional, and then making it unstable with respect to the\nspin-spiral order propagating perpendicular to the kagome plane. The latter\ninstability is partly contributed by the states at the Fermi surface and may be\nrelevant to the magnetic behavior of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ near the Curie\ntemperature. Peculiarities of the half-metallic ferromagnetism in\nCo$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 01:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-17"}

Without the\nknowledge of future channel fading, it is very challenging to determine the\nsequential control actions that are tightly coupled by the battery and data\nbuffer dynamics. To solve the problem, we propose an online algorithm named\nLEESE that applies the perturbed Lyapunov optimization technique to decompose\nthe multi-stage stochastic problem into per-slot deterministic optimization\nproblems. We show that each per-slot problem can be equivalently transformed\ninto a convex optimization problem. To facilitate online implementation in\nlarge-scale MEC systems, instead of solving the per-slot problem with\noff-the-shelf convex algorithms, we propose a block coordinate descent\n(BCD)-based method that produces close-to-optimal solution in less than 0.04\\%\nof the computation delay. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nLEESE algorithm can provide 21.9\\% higher data sensing rate than the\nrepresentative benchmark methods considered, while incurring sub-millisecond\ncomputation delay suitable for real-time control under fading channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 02:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}

The\nsafety assessments can be highly sensitive to the choice of the statistical\nflood frequency model. Standard dam safety assessments are typically based on a\nsingle distribution model of flood frequency, often the Log Pearson Type III or\nGeneralized Extreme Value distributions.

To explore the practicality and potential value of implementing\nmixed distribution statistical models in engineering design, we compare the\ngoodness of fit of several single- and mixed-distribution peak flow models, as\nwell as the contingent dam safety assessment at Pueblo, Colorado as a didactic\nexample. Summer snowmelt and intense summer rainstorms are both key drivers of\nannual peak flow at Pueblo. We analyze the potential implications for the\nannual probability of overtopping-induced failure of the Pueblo Dam as a\ndidactic example. We address the temporal and physical cause separation\nproblems by building on previous work with mixed distributions. We find a Mixed\nGeneralized Extreme Value distribution model best fits peak flows observed in\nthe gaged record, historical floods, and paleo floods at Pueblo. Finally, we\nshow that accounting for mixed distributions in the safety assessment at Pueblo\nDam increases the assessed risk of overtopping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 03:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}

A leftmost\nseparator of size $k$ is a minimal separator $S$ that separates two given sets\nof vertices $X$ and $Y$ such that we \"cannot move $S$ more towards $X$\" such\nthat $|S|$ remains smaller than the threshold. One of the incentives is that by\nusing leftmost separators we can improve the time complexity of treewidth\napproximation. Treewidth approximation is a problem which is known to have a\nlinear time FPT algorithm in terms of input size, and only single exponential\nin terms of the parameter, treewidth. It is not known whether this result can\nbe improved theoretically. However, the coefficient of the parameter $k$ (the\ntreewidth) in the exponent is large.

A Bayesian approach to the\nestimation of covariance structures uses priors that force zeros on some\noff-diagonal entries of covariance matrices and put a positive definite\nconstraint on matrices. In this paper, we consider a spike and slab prior on\noff-diagonal entries, which uses a mixture of point-mass and normal\ndistribution. The point-mass naturally introduces sparsity to covariance\nstructures so that the resulting posterior from this prior renders covariance\nstructure learning. Under this prior, we calculate posterior model\nprobabilities of covariance structures using Laplace approximation. We show\nthat the error due to Laplace approximation becomes asymptotically marginal at\nsome rate depending on the posterior convergence rate of covariance matrix\nunder the Frobenius norm.

When skin effect emerges, eigenstates in the\nbulk continuum can become localized on the edges, making the distinction\nbetween edge and bulk states challenging. We establish the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence for a Chern insulator model with non-Hermitian skin effect by\ncombining two approaches (\"non-Bloch\" approach and \"biorthogonal\" approach).\nBoth approaches can suppress the skin effect but they are based on different\nmathematical tools. A biorthogonal inverse participation ratio is used as a\nmeasure to distinguish between bulk states and edge states, and a non-Bloch\nChern number is used to characterize the topology and predict the number of\ntopological edge bands. In addition to tangential degeneracies, crossing\ndegeneracies are found to occur between the bulk and edge bands. Their presence\nenriches the (de)localization behavior of the edge states but does not affect\nthe Chern number. The phase diagram of the system has interesting features that\nare not found in Hermitian systems. For example, one topological transition and\ntwo non-Hermitian phase transitions can be induced by tuning a single\nparameter. The gapless phase is topologically protected due to the stable\nexistence of the non-Hermitian band degeneracies guaranteed by nonzero\ndiscriminant numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 06:08:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 04:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 08:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

It is able to image objects\nthat are large (compared to wavelength) and have high permittivity values, that\nexisting radio frequency (RF) inverse scattering techniques find very\nchallenging, making it suitable for indoor RF imaging. The technique utilizes a\nRytov based inverse scattering model with a deep learning framework. The\ninverse scattering model is based on an extended Rytov approximation (xRA) that\npre-reconstructs the RF measurements. Under strong scattering conditions, this\npre-reconstruction is related to the actual permittivity profile by a\nnon-linear function, which is learned by a modified U-Net model to obtain the\npermittivity profile of the object. Thus, our proposed approach not only\nreconstructs the shape of objects, but also estimates their permittivity values\naccurately. We demonstrate its imaging performance using simulations as well as\nexperimental results in an actual indoor environment using 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi\nphaseless measurements. For incident wavelength $\\lambda_0$, the proposed\nframework can reconstruct objects with relative permittivity as high as 77 and\nelectrical size as large as $40 \\lambda$, where $\\lambda =\\lambda_0/\\sqrt{77}$.\nThis is in contrast to existing phaseless imaging techniques which cannot\nreconstruct permittivity values beyond 3 or 4.

With the massive\namount of available programs such as (on GitHub or Stack Overflow), identifying\nand localizing the precise code is critical for the software developers. In\naddition, Deep learning has recently been widely applied to different\ncode-related scenarios, e.g., vulnerability detection, source code\nsummarization. However, automated deep code search is still challenging since\nit requires a high-level semantic mapping between code and natural language\nqueries. Most existing deep learning-based approaches for code search rely on\nthe sequential text i.e., feeding the program and the query as a flat sequence\nof tokens to learn the program semantics while the structural information is\nnot fully considered. Furthermore, the widely adopted Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) have proved their effectiveness in learning program semantics, however,\nthey also suffer the problem of capturing the global dependencies in the\nconstructed graph, which limits the model learning capacity. To address these\nchallenges, in this paper, we design a novel neural network framework, named\nGraphSearchNet, to enable an effective and accurate source code search by\njointly learning the rich semantics of both source code and natural language\nqueries. Specifically, we propose to construct graphs for the source code and\nqueries with bidirectional GGNN (BiGGNN) to capture the local structural\ninformation of the source code and queries. Furthermore, we enhance BiGGNN by\nutilizing the multi-head attention module to supplement the global dependencies\nthat BiGGNN missed to improve the model learning capacity.

In this paper,\nwe propose MixSiam, a mixture-based approach upon the traditional siamese\nnetwork. On the one hand, we input two augmented images of an instance to the\nbackbone and obtain the discriminative representation by performing an\nelement-wise maximum of two features. On the other hand, we take the mixture of\nthese augmented images as input, and expect the model prediction to be close to\nthe discriminative representation. In this way, the model could access more\nvariant data samples of an instance and keep predicting invariant\ndiscriminative representations for them. Thus the learned model is more robust\ncompared to previous contrastive learning methods.

With no endmarkers, by\ncontrast, a machine must constantly stay in either accepting or rejecting\nstates at any moment since it never notices the end of the input instance. This\nsituation, however, helps us analyze the behavior of the machine whose tape\nhead makes the consecutive moves on all prefixes of a given extremely long\ninput word.

This situation\ncan be realized in a composite system that includes a negative-mass subsystem,\nwhich can be implemented by, e.g., a polarized spin ensemble or a\ntwo-tone-driven optomechanical system. The realization of a trajectory without\nquantum uncertainties implies entanglement between the subsystems, and allows\nfor measurements of motion, fields and forces with, in principle, unlimited\nprecision. To date, these principles have been developed theoretically and\ndemonstrated experimentally for a number of composite systems. However, the\nutility of the concept has been limited by the dominating requirement of close\nproximity of the resonance frequencies of the system of interest and the\nnegative-mass reference system, and by the need to embed the subsystems in a\nnarrowband cavity, which could be problematic while at the same time achieving\ngood overcoupling. Here we propose a general approach which overcomes these\nlimitations by employing periodic modulation of the driving fields (e.g.,\ntwo-tone driving) in combination with coherent or measurement-based anti-noise\npaths. This approach makes it possible to engineer a QMFS of two systems with\nvastly different spectra and with arbitrary signs of their masses, while\ndispensing with the need to embed the subsystems in a sideband-resolving\ncavity.

The output of the algorithm\nis a level of mismatch between printed and synthetic reference layers. Twelve\nsimilarity and distance measures were implemented and compared for their\neffectiveness at detecting 3D printing errors on six different representative\nfailure types and their control error-free print images.

The Tafel\nslope is lower in the case of 2D monolayer Mn-MoS$_2$ material due to the\noverlap of the s-orbital of the hydrogen and d-orbitals of the Mn atoms\nappeared in the HOMO and LUMO transition states (TS1 and TS2) of both the\nVolmer and Heyrovsky reaction steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 09:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 18:39:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 13:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Physisorption is one\nof the promising ways to store H$_2$ for its practical applications. Covalent\nOrganic Frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates for H$_2$-storage due to\nhigh porosity, surface area and tunable characteristics. To improve the\nhydrogen physisorption in the COFs, the chelation of transition metals (TM) in\nthe building blocks of the framework has been studied by using first\nprinciple-based density functional theory (DFT) method. Here, we report total\n96 H$_2$ complexes made of six different COF linkers and chelated with the Sc,\nTi and V atoms interacting with up to H$_2$ molecules. The molecular\ninteractions between physisorption H$_2$ and these Sc-, Ti- and V-chelated\nlinkers have been explored in detail. The binding enthalpy of the most\ncomplexes is higher than ~10 kJ/mol, which is the basic requirement for\npractical H$_2$-storage. In the total interaction energy (between physisorption\nH$_2$ and chelated linkers), the dispersion and electrostatic interactions are\ndominant. This study is essential in finding out the more efficient COF linkers\nfor practical H$_2$ storage. It can also help to improve the uptake of existing\nporous materials for H$_2$ storage. The present study paves a way to design\ntransition metal chelated COFs for an effective H$_2$-storage and the knowledge\ngained from this study is expected to provide some inspiration for developing\nthe corresponding experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 10:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}

One of the major research challenges\nis to allocate the physical resources such that the failure of the physical\nresources would bring less impact onto the users' service. Additionally, the\nmajor challenge is to handle the embedding process of growing number of\nincoming users' VNs from the algorithm design point-of-view. Considering both\nof the above-mentioned research issues, a novel Failure aware Semi-Centralized\nVNE (FSC-VNE) algorithm is proposed for the Fat-Tree data center network with\nthe goal to reduce the impact of the resource failure onto the existing users.\nThe impact of failure of the Physical Machines (PMs), physical links and\nnetwork devices are taken into account while allocating the resources to the\nusers. The beauty of the proposed algorithm is that the VMs are assigned to\ndifferent PMs in a semi-centralized manner. In other words, the embedding\nalgorithm is executed by multiple physical servers in order to concurrently\nembed the VMs of a VN and reduces the embedding time.

As a consequence, the pointing calibration of these\ninstruments cannot be done in general exploiting the standard astrometry of the\nfocal plane. In this paper we validate a procedure to overcome this problem for\nthe case of the innovative ASTRI telescope, developed by INAF, exploiting sky\nimages produced as an ancillary output by its novel Cherenkov camera. In fact,\nthis instrument implements a statistical technique called \"Variance method\"\n(VAR) owning the potentiality to image the star field (angular resolution $\\sim\n11'$). We demonstrate here that VAR images can be exploited to assess the\nalignment of the Cherenkov camera with the optical axis of the telescope down\nto $\\sim 1''$. To this end, we evaluate the position of the stars with\nsub-pixel precision thanks to a deep investigation of the convolution between\nthe point spread function and the pixel distribution of the camera, resulting\nin a transformation matrix that we validated with simulations. After that, we\nconsidered the rotation of the field of view during long observing runs,\nobtaining light arcs that we exploited to investigate the alignment of the\nCherenkov camera with high precision, in a procedure that we have already\ntested on real data. The strategy we have adopted, inherited from optical\nastronomy, has never been performed on Variance images from a Cherenkov\ntelescope until now, and it can be crucial to optimize the scientific accuracy\nof the incoming MiniArray of ASTRI telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 10:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}

The core of our framework is a new compound logic operating with\ntwo types of sentences, expressing graph modification: the modulator sentence,\ndefining some property of the modified part of the graph, and the target\nsentence, defining some property of the resulting graph. In our framework,\nmodulator sentences are in counting monadic second-order logic (CMSOL) and have\nmodels of bounded treewidth, while target sentences express first-order logic\n(FOL) properties along with minor-exclusion. Our logic captures problems that\nare not definable in first-order logic and, moreover, may have instances of\nunbounded treewidth. Also, it permits the modeling of wide families of problems\ninvolving vertex/edge removals, alternative modulator measures (such as\nelimination distance or $\\mathcal{G}$-treewidth), multistage modifications, and\nvarious cut problems.

Many techniques have been\nproposed in the last decades which allow decomposing multi-component signals\ninto simple oscillatory mono-components, like the groundbreaking Empirical Mode\nDecomposition technique and the Iterative Filtering method. When a signal\ncontains mono-components that have rapid varying instantaneous frequencies, we\ncan think, for instance, to chirps or whistles, it becomes particularly hard\nfor most techniques to properly factor out these components. The Adaptive Local\nIterative Filtering technique has recently gained interest in many applied\nfields of research for being able to deal with non-stationary signals\npresenting amplitude and frequency modulation. In this work, we address the\nopen question of how to guarantee a priori convergence of this technique, and\npropose two new algorithms. The first method, called Stable Adaptive Local\nIterative Filtering, is a stabilized version of the Adaptive Local Iterative\nFiltering that we prove to be always convergent. The stability, however, comes\nat the cost of higher complexity in the calculations. The second technique,\ncalled Resampled Iterative Filtering, is a new generalization of the Iterative\nFiltering method. We prove that Resampled Iterative Filtering is guaranteed to\nconverge a priori for any kind of signal. Furthermore, in the discrete setting,\nby leveraging on the mathematical properties of the matrices involved, we show\nthat its calculations can be accelerated drastically. Finally, we present some\nartificial and real-life examples to show the powerfulness and performance of\nthe proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 11:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}

A recent\napproach to this problem is concerned with the construction of dense forests\nand is obtained by a suitable weakening of the volume constraint. A dense\nforest is a discrete point set of finite density getting uniformly close to\nlong enough line segments. The distribution of points in a dense forest is then\nquantified in terms of a visibility function. Another way to weaken the\nassumptions in Danzer's problem is by relaxing the density constraint. In this\nrespect, a new concept is introduced in this paper, namely that of an optical\nforest. An optical forest in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a point set with optimal\nvisibility but not necessarily with finite density. In the literature, the best\nconstructions of Danzer sets and dense forests lack effectivity. The goal of\nthis paper is to provide constructions of dense and optical forests which yield\nthe best known results in any dimension $d \\ge 2$ both in terms of visibility\nand density bounds and effectiveness. Namely, there are three main results in\nthis work: (1) the construction of a dense forest with the best known\nvisibility bound which, furthermore, enjoys the property of being\ndeterministic; (2) the deterministic construction of an optical forest with a\ndensity failing to be finite only up to a logarithm and (3) the construction of\na planar Peres-type forest (that is, a dense forest obtained from a\nconstruction due to Peres) with the best known visibility bound.

However, it has\nbeen very challenging to design an ML-based detection system by utilising\nheterogeneous network data samples originating from several sources. This is\nmainly due to privacy concerns and the lack of a universal format of datasets.\nIn this paper, we propose a collaborative federated learning scheme to address\nthese issues. The proposed framework allows multiple organisations to join\nforces in the design, training, and evaluation of a robust ML-based network\nintrusion detection system. The threat intelligence scheme utilises two\ncritical aspects for its application; the availability of network data traffic\nin a common format to allow for the extraction of meaningful patterns across\ndata sources. Secondly, the adoption of a federated learning mechanism to avoid\nthe necessity of sharing sensitive users' information between organisations. As\na result, each organisation benefits from other organisations cyber threat\nintelligence while maintaining the privacy of its data internally. The model is\ntrained locally and only the updated weights are shared with the remaining\nparticipants in the federated averaging process.

A fiber measurement system that combines automated data acquisition\nand processing represents a disruptive impact in the management of optical\nfiber networks with fast and reliable event detection. It has been shown in the\nliterature that the linearized Bregman iterations (LBI) algorithm and\nvariations can be successfully used for processing and accurately identifying\nfaults in a fiber profile. One of the factors that impact the performance of\nthese algorithms is the degradation of spatial resolution, which is mainly\ncaused by the appearance of fault clusters due to a reduced number of\niterations. In this paper, a method is proposed based on an approximate\ndeconvolution approach for increasing the spatial resolution, possible after a\nthorough analysis of fault clusters that appear in the algorithm's output. The\neffect of such approximate deconvolution is shown to extend beyond the\nimprovement of spatial resolution, allowing for better performances to be\nreached at shorter processing times. An efficient hardware architecture that\nimplements the approximate deconvolution, compatible with the hardware\nstructure recently presented for the LBI algorithm, is also proposed and\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 12:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}

We\ninvestigate the details of this process at comet 67P using the Rosetta Ion\nComposition Analyzer. Aims: This study aims to compare the interaction of the\nsolar wind and cometary ions during two different time periods in the Rosetta\nmission. Methods: We compared both the integrated ion moments (density,\nvelocity, and momentum flux) and the velocity distribution functions for two\ndays, four months apart. The velocity distribution functions were projected\ninto a coordinate system dependent on the magnetic field direction and averaged\nover three hours. Results: The first case shows highly scattered H+ in both ion\nmoments and velocity distribution function. The He2+ ions are somewhat\nscattered, but less so, and appear more like those of H2O+ pickup ions. The\nsecond case shows characteristic evidence of mass-loading, where the solar wind\nspecies are deflected, but the velocity distribution function is not\nsignificantly changed. Conclusions: The distributions of H+ in the first case,\nwhen compared to He2+ and H2O+ pickup ions, are indicative of a narrow\ncometosheath on the scale of the H+ gyroradius. Thus, He2+ and H2O+, with\nlarger gyroradii, are largely able to pass through this cometosheath. An\nexamination of the momentum flux tensor suggests that all species in the first\ncase have a significant non-gyrotropic momentum flux component that is higher\nthan that of the second mass-loaded case. Mass loading is not a sufficient\nexplanation for the distribution functions and momentum flux tensor in the\nfirst case, and so we assume this is evidence of bow shock formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 12:20:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 12:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

However, the state-of-the-art pFL methods rely on\nmodel parameters aggregation at the server side, which require all models to\nhave the same structure and size, and thus limits the application for more\nheterogeneous scenarios. To deal with such model constraints, we exploit the\npotentials of heterogeneous model settings and propose a novel training\nframework to employ personalized models for different clients. Specifically, we\nformulate the aggregation procedure in original pFL into a personalized group\nknowledge transfer training algorithm, namely, KT-pFL, which enables each\nclient to maintain a personalized soft prediction at the server side to guide\nthe others' local training. KT-pFL updates the personalized soft prediction of\neach client by a linear combination of all local soft predictions using a\nknowledge coefficient matrix, which can adaptively reinforce the collaboration\namong clients who own similar data distribution. Furthermore, to quantify the\ncontributions of each client to others' personalized training, the knowledge\ncoefficient matrix is parameterized so that it can be trained simultaneously\nwith the models.

On the\nother hand, the BHs in observed low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are\nsignificantly lighter than the astrophysical BBH population, but this may just\nbe due to a correlation between component masses in a binary system. Given\ntheir light stellar companions, we expect light BHs in LMXBs. The observed\nspins in HMXBs and LMXBs, however, are in tension with the inferred BBH spin\ndistribution at the $>99.9\\%$ level. We discuss possible scenarios behind the\nsignificantly larger spins in observed BH-XRBs. One possibility is that a small\nsubpopulation (conservatively $<30\\%$) of BBHs have rapidly spinning primary\ncomponents, indicating that they may have followed a similar evolutionary\npathway to the observed HMXBs. In LMXBs, it has been suggested that BHs can\nspin up by accretion. If LMXB natal spins follow the BBH spin distribution, we\nfind LMXBs must gain an average dimensionless spin of $0.47^{+0.10}_{-0.11}$,\nbut if their natal spins follow the observed HMXB spins, the average spinup\nmust be $<0.03$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 15:14:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 14:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

We investigate the resolved\nstellar content and the extended halo of NGC 5128 as a function of\ngalactocentric distance. We used HST images to resolve individual red giant\nbranch (RGB) stars in 28 independent pointings. Star counts from deep VI\ncolor-magnitude diagrams reaching at least 1.5 mag below the tip of the RGB are\nused to derive the surface density distribution of the halo. The contamination\nby Milky Way stars is assessed with a new control field, with models, and by\ncombining optical and near-IR photometry. We present a new calibration of the\nWFC3 F606W+F814W photometry to the ground-based VI photometric system. The\nphotometry shows that the stellar halo of NGC 5128 is dominated by old RGB\nstars that are present in all fields. The V-band surface brightness changes\nfrom 23 to 32 mag/arcsec$^2$ between 8.3 kpc from the galaxy center to our\noutermost halo fields located 140 kpc away from the center along the major axis\nand 92 kpc along the minor axis.

This\npopulation contributes only up to 10% in total stellar mass if it is 2 Gyr old,\nbut a larger fraction of 30-40% is required if its age is 3 Gyr. The stellar\nsurface density profile is well fit by a r$^{1/4}$ curve or a power-law $\\sim\nr^{-3.1}$ over the full radial range, with no obvious break in the slope, but\nwith large field-to-field scatter.

One major class of such scalable algorithms is known as network\nrepresentation learning or network embedding. These algorithms try to learn\nrepresentations of network functionals (e.g.~nodes) by first running multiple\nrandom walks and then using the number of co-occurrences of each pair of nodes\nin observed random walk segments to obtain a low-dimensional representation of\nnodes on some Euclidean space. The aim of this paper is to rigorously\nunderstand the performance of two major algorithms, DeepWalk and node2vec, in\nrecovering communities for canonical network models with ground truth\ncommunities. Depending on the sparsity of the graph, we find the length of the\nrandom walk segments required such that the corresponding observed\nco-occurrence window is able to perform almost exact recovery of the underlying\ncommunity assignments. We prove that, given some fixed co-occurrence window,\nnode2vec using random walks with a low non-backtracking probability can succeed\nfor much sparser networks compared to DeepWalk using simple random walks.\nMoreover, if the sparsity parameter is low, we provide evidence that these\nalgorithms might not succeed in almost exact recovery. The analysis requires\ndeveloping general tools for path counting on random networks having an\nunderlying low-rank structure, which are of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 14:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

However, their\ntraditional get/put interface is unable to exploit data locality at its\nfullest, and limits reaching its peak performance. In particular, there is one\nway to improve data locality that has not yet achieved mainstream adoption: the\nactive object store. Although there are some projects that have implemented the\nmain idea of the active object store such as Swift's Storlets or Ceph Object\nClasses, the scope of these implementations is limited.\n  We believe that there is a huge potential for active object stores in the\ncurrent status quo. Hyper-converged nodes are bringing more computing\ncapabilities to storage nodes --and viceversa. The proliferation of\nnon-volatile memory (NVM) technology is blurring the line between system memory\n(fast and scarce) and block devices (slow and abundant). More and more\napplications need to manage a sheer amount of data (data analytics, Big Data,\nMachine Learning & AI, etc.), demanding bigger clusters and more complex\ncomputations. All these elements are potential game changers that need to be\nevaluated in the scope of active object stores.\n  In this article we propose an active object store software stack and evaluate\nit on an NVM-populated node. We will show how this setup is able to reduce\nexecution times from 10% up to more than 90% in a variety of representative\napplication scenarios.
