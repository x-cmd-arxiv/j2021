The CN emission is extended from the central\nprotostars to their immediate surroundings also tracing outflows, likely as a\nproduct of HCN photodissociation.

This is notably the case of\nsocial robots. The domain of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) emerged to\ninvestigate these issues. \"Human-robot trust\" has been highlighted as one of\nthe most challenging and intriguing factors influencing HRI. On the one hand,\nuser studies and technical experts underline how trust is a key element to\nfacilitate users' acceptance, consequently increasing the chances to pursue the\ngiven task. On the other hand, such a phenomenon raises also ethical and\nphilosophical concerns leading scholars in these domains to argue that humans\nshould not trust robots. However, trust in HRI is not an index of fragility, it\nis rooted in anthropomorphism, and it is a natural characteristic of every\nhuman being. Thus, instead of focusing solely on how to inspire user trust in\nsocial robots, this paper argues that what should be investigated is to what\nextent and for which purpose it is suitable to trust robots.

This study aimed\nto achieve automatic and intelligent priority-tuning, by developing a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) based method to model the tuning behaviors of\nhuman planners. Methods: We built a priority-tuning policy network using deep\nconvolutional neural networks.

To localize\nitself, the auxiliary agents must be within the communication range of an\n{anchor}, directly or indirectly. The robotic team's objective is to minimize\nenvironmental uncertainty through persistent monitoring.

We show that a traditional BGP-based BPH identification approach\ncannot detect the CyberBunker, but find characteristics from a domain and\ntraffic perspective that can add to future identification approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 17:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Varying either the interaction strength of the sine-Gordon model\nor the amplitude of the external source field, an interesting transition is\nobserved in the expectation value of the soliton density. This affects both the\ninitial profile of the density and its time evolution and can be summarised as\na steep transition between behaviours reminiscent of the Klein-Gordon, and the\nfree massive Dirac fermion theory with initial external fields of high enough\nmagnitude. The transition in the initial state is also displayed by the\nclassical sine-Gordon theory and hence can be understood by semi-classical\nconsiderations in terms of the presence of small amplitude field configurations\nand the appearance of soliton excitations, which are naturally associated with\nbosonic and fermionic excitations on the quantum level, respectively.

However, out of\nthese 58 mergers, 7 are consistent with having high effective spin parameter\n(chi_eff>0.3). Additionally, 2 events seem to have high effective spins sourced\nfrom the spin of the primary (more massive) BH. These particular observations\ncould be used to discriminate between the isolated binary and dynamical\nformation channels.

The daily frequency of sampling, without\nthe temporal averaging of annual composites, requires the distinction between\napparent changes of imaged night light related to the imaging process and\nactual changes in the underlying sources of the light being imaged. This study\ncharacterizes night light variability over a range of spatial and temporal\nscales to provide a context for interpretation of changes on both subannual and\ninterannual time scales. This analysis uses a combination of temporal moments,\nspatial correlation and Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. A key\nresult is the pervasive heteroskedasticity of VIIRS monthly mean night light.\nSpecifically, the monotonic decrease of temporal variability with increasing\nmean brightness. Anthropogenic night light is remarkably stable on subannual\ntime scales. Overall variance partition derived from the eigenvalues of the\nspatiotemporal covariance matrix are 88%, 2% and 2% for spatial, seasonal and\ninterannual variance in the most diverse geographic region on Earth (Eurasia).\nHeteroskedasticity is present in all areas for all months, suggesting that\nmuch, if not most, of observed month-to-month variability may result from\nluminance of otherwise stable sources subjected to multiple aspects of the\nimaging process varying in time. Given the skewed distribution of all night\nlight arising from radial peripheral dimming of bright sources, even aggregate\nmetrics using thresholds must be interpreted in light of the fact that much\nlarger numbers of more variable low luminance pixels may statistically\noverwhelm smaller numbers of stable higher luminance pixels and cause apparent\nchanges related to the imaging process to be interpreted as actual changes in\nthe light sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 18:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

The first is that\nall/most stars are born as rapid rotators and that interacting binaries brake a\nfraction of the stars, resulting in two populations. The second is that the\nrotational distribution is a reflection of the early evolution of pre-main\nsequence stars, in particular, whether they are able to retain or lose their\nprotoplanetary discs during the first few Myr. Here, we test the binary channel\nby exploiting multi-epoch VLT/MUSE observations of NGC 1850, a 100Myr massive\ncluster in the LMC, to search for differences in the binary fractions of the\nslow and fast rotating populations.

A natural approach for this\nscenario is to apply a weighted $L_2$ loss in performance assessment to reflect\nthe region-specific interest.

The\nnonsymmorphic symmetries transform the $k_z=\\pi/c$ plane of the Brillouin zone\nboundary into a node-surface. Band-structure calculations reveal that distinct\nFermi surfaces become degenerate on the node-surface and form Dirac lines and a\nDirac loop at the Fermi level. Two symmetry related Dirac points remain\ndegenerate under spin-orbit coupling. ARPES measurements confirm the\ncalculations and provide evidence for the Fermi surface degeneracies on the\nnode-surface. These unique topological features enable an unconventional\nsuperconducting gap in which time-reversal symmetry can be broken in the\nabsence of other typical ingredients. LaNiGa$_2$ is therefore a topological\ncrystalline superconductor that breaks time-reversal symmetry without any\noverlapping magnetic ordering or fluctuations. Our findings will enable future\ndiscoveries of additional topological superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 22:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

There is thus now a standard set of\nnull tests of general relativity (GR) applied to LIGO-Virgo detections and many\nmore such tests proposed. However, the relation between all these tests is not\nyet well understood. We start to investigate this by applying a set of standard\ntests to simulated observations of binary black holes in GR and with\nphenomenological deviations from GR. We consider four types of tests:\nresiduals, inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency, parameterized phasing (two\nvarieties), and modified dispersion relation. We also check the consistency of\nthe unmodeled reconstruction of the waveforms with the waveform recovered using\nGR templates. These tests are applied to simulated observations similar to\nGW150914 with both large and small deviations from GR and similar to GW170608\njust with small deviations from GR. We find that while very large deviations\nfrom GR are picked up with high significance by almost all tests, more moderate\ndeviations are picked up by only a few tests, and some deviations are not\nrecognized as GR violations by any test at the moderate signal-to-noise ratios\nwe consider. Moreover, the tests that identify various deviations with high\nsignificance are not necessarily the expected ones. In particular, the\nparameterized tests recover PN test parameters much closer to zero than their\ntrue values in some cases. Additionally, we find that of the GR deviations we\nconsider, the residuals test is only able to detect extreme deviations from GR\nthat no longer look like binary black hole coalescences in GR. The\nreconstruction comparison shows more promise for detecting relatively small GR\ndeviations in an unmodeled framework, at least for high-mass systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 22:09:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 17:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

This concept has been invoked to explain nonlinear dynamical\nphenomena such as featureless energy spectra that have been observed\nempirically for earthquakes, avalanches, and solar flares. If this\ninterpretation proves correct, it implies that the solar coronal magnetic field\nmaintains itself in a critical state via a delicate balance between the\ndynamo-driven injection of magnetic energy and the release of that energy via\nflaring events. All-sky high-cadence surveys like the Transiting Exoplanet\nSurvey Satellite (TESS) provide the necessary data to compare the energy\ndistribution of flaring events in stars of different spectral types to that\nobserved in the Sun.

To\nthis end, we extend the Brutus N-body code to include Post-Newtonian pairwise\nterms up to 2.5 order, and the first order Taylor expansion to the\nEinstein-Infeld-Hoffmann equations of motion. The degree to which our system is\nrelativistic depends on the scaling of the total mass (the unit size was 1\nparsec). Using the Brutus method of convergence, we test for time-reversibility\nin the conservative regime, and demonstrate that we are able to obtain\ndefinitive solutions to the relativistic three-body problem. It is also\nconfirmed that the minimal required numerical accuracy for a successful\ntime-reversibility test correlates with the amplification factor of an initial\nperturbation. When we take into account dissipative effects through\ngravitational wave emission, we find that the duration of the resonance, and\nthe amount of exponential growth of small perturbations depend on the mass\nscaling. For a unit mass <= 10 MSun, the system behavior is indistinguishable\nfrom the Newtonian case, and the resonance always ends in a binary and one\nescaping body. For a mass scaling up to 1e7 MSun, relativity gradually becomes\nmore prominent, but the majority of the systems still dissolve. The first\nmergers start to appear for a mass of ~1e5 MSun, and between 1e7 MSun and 1e9\nMSun all systems end prematurely in a merger. These mergers are preceded by a\ngravitational wave driven in-spiral. For a mass scaling >= 1e9 MSun, all\nsystems result in a gravitational wave merger upon the first close encounter.\nRelativistic three-body encounters thus provide an efficient pathway for\nresolving the final parsec problem. The onset of mergers at the characteristic\nmass scale of 1e7 MSun potentially leaves an imprint in the mass function of\nsupermassive black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 23:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

We also find,\nhowever, that performance is heavily influenced by word frequency, with\nexperiments showing that both the absolute frequency of a verb form, as well as\nthe frequency relative to the alternate inflection, are causally implicated in\nthe predictions BERT makes at inference time. Closer analysis of these\nfrequency effects reveals that BERT's behavior is consistent with a system that\ncorrectly applies the SVA rule in general but struggles to overcome strong\ntraining priors and to estimate agreement features (singular vs. plural) on\ninfrequent lexical items.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 23:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

Recent developments in the study of space-time wave\npackets -- pulsed beams in which the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom\nare inextricably intertwined -- have pointed to the existence of\nnon-differentiable AD: field configurations in which the propagation angle does\nnot possess a derivative at some wavelength. Here we investigate the\nconsequences of introducing non-differentiable AD into a pulsed field and show\nthat it is the crucial ingredient required to realize group velocities that\ndeviate from $c$ (the speed of light in vacuum) along the propagation axis in\nfree space. In contrast, the on-axis phase and group velocities are always\nequal in conventional scenarios. Furthermore, we show that non-differentiable\nAD is needed for realizing anomalous or normal group-velocity dispersion along\nthe propagation axis, while simultaneously suppressing all higher-order\ndispersion terms. These and several other consequences of non-differentiable AD\nare verified experimentally using a pulsed-beam shaper capable of introducing\nAD with arbitrary spectral profile. Rather than being an exotic phenomenon,\nnon-differentiable AD is an accessible, robust, and versatile resource for\nsculpting pulsed optical fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 01:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

Our key insight is that traffic environments feature\nsignificant geometric and temporal structure, leading to highly organized\ncollective behaviors, often drawn from a small set of dominant modes. In this\nwork, we propose a representation based on the formalism of topological braids\nthat can summarize arbitrarily complex multiagent behavior into a compact\nobject of dual geometric and symbolic nature, capturing critical events of\ninteraction.

The\nlensing light curves of the events have a common characteristic that the\nplanetary signals were produced by the crossings of faint source stars over the\nresonant caustics formed by giant planets located near the Einstein rings of\nhost stars. For all planetary events, the lensing solutions are uniquely\ndetermined without any degeneracy. It is estimated that the host masses are in\nthe range of $0.45\\lesssim M/M_\\odot \\lesssim 0.59$, which corresponds to early\nM to late K dwarfs, and thus the host stars are less massive than the sun. On\nthe other hand, the planets, with masses in the range of $2.1\\lesssim M/M_{\\rm\nJ}\\lesssim 6.2$, are heavier than the heaviest planet of the solar system, that\nis, Jupiter.

They allow for CNN\nvisualization and interpretation without training on fully annotated image\ndatasets. CAM methods are typically integrated within off-the-shelf CNN\nbackbones, such as ResNet50. Due to convolution and pooling operations, these\nbackbones yield low resolution CAMs with a down-scaling factor of up to 32,\ncontributing to inaccurate localizations. Interpolation is required to restore\nfull size CAMs, yet it does not consider the statistical properties of objects,\nsuch as color and texture, leading to activations with inconsistent boundaries,\nand inaccurate localizations. As an alternative, we introduce a generic method\nfor parametric upscaling of CAMs that allows constructing accurate full\nresolution CAMs (F-CAMs).

Furthermore, a finite element model\nis built to validate the theoretical model and to investigate the post-buckling\nbehaviors.

In this paper, firstly, we propose a new complementary feature\nenhanced framework, in which the complementary features are learned by several\ncomplementary subtasks and then together serve to boost the performance of the\nprimary task. One of the prominent advantages of the new framework is that the\npurposively chosen complementary tasks can focus on learning weakly dependent\ncomplementary features, avoiding repetitive and ineffective learning of the\nnetworks.

It\nis difficult to optimize as the prediction slot of each object query does not\nhave a specific mode. In other words, each object query will not focus on a\nspecific region. To solved these problems, in our query design, object queries\nare based on anchor points, which are widely used in CNN-based detectors.

Different combustion\nmodes are investigated through considering various premixed gas equivalence\nratios (0.2 to 2.0) and incident shock wave Mach numbers (1.8 to 3.2). Four\nignition and DDT modes are observed from the studied cases, i.e., no ignition,\ndeflagration combustion, detonation after reflected shock and deflagration\nbehind the incident shock. For detonation development behind the reflected\nshock, three autoignition hot spots are formed. The first one occurs at the\nwall surface after the re-compression of the reflected shock and contact\nsurface, which further develops to a reaction shock because of the explosion in\nthe explosion regime. The other two are off the wall, respectively caused by\nthe reflected shock rarefaction wave interaction and reaction induction in the\ncompressed mixture. The last hot spot develops to a reaction wave and couples\nwith the reflected shock after a DDT process, which eventually leads to\ndetonation combustion. For deflagration development behind the reflected shock,\nthe wave interactions, wall surface autoignition hot spot as well as its\ninduction of reaction shock are qualitatively similar to the mode of detonation\nafter incident shock reflection, before the reflected shock rarefaction wave\ncollision point.

These findings suggest that conservative\nforces that shape creative domains might be underestimated. To this end, we\nprovide the first large-scale formal evidence of the persistent association\nbetween poetic meter and semantics in 18-19th European literatures, using\nCzech, German and Russian collections with additional data from English poetry\nand early modern Dutch songs. Our study traces this association through a\nseries of clustering experiments using the abstracted semantic features of\n150,000 poems. With the aid of topic modeling we infer semantic features for\nindividual poems. Texts were also lexically simplified across collections to\nincrease generalizability and decrease the sparseness of word frequency\ndistributions. Topics alone enable recognition of the meters in each observed\nlanguage, as may be seen from highly robust clustering of same-meter samples\n(median Adjusted Rand Index between 0.48 and 1). In addition, this study shows\nthat the strength of the association between form and meaning tends to decrease\nover time. This may reflect a shift in aesthetic conventions between the 18th\nand 19th centuries as individual innovation was increasingly favored in\nliterature. Despite this decline, it remains possible to recognize semantics of\nthe meters from past or future, which suggests the continuity of semantic\ntraditions while also revealing the historical variability of conditions across\nlanguages. This paper argues that distinct metrical forms, which are often\ncopied in a language over centuries, also maintain long-term semantic inertia\nin poetry. Our findings, thus, highlight the role of the formal features of\ncultural items in influencing the pace and shape of cultural evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 08:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

For this reason, the Center for High Angular\nResolution Astronomy (CHARA), an array of six telescopes, requires a new\nconfiguration of longitudinal dispersion compensators to keep the fringe\ncontrast above 95 per cent simultaneously in all spectral bands, while\npreserving the transmission above 85 per cent. In this paper, we propose a new\nmethod for defining the longitudinal dispersion compensators (LDC) suited for\nmultiband observations. A literal approximation of the contrast loss resulting\nfrom the dispersion residues enables us to define a general criterion for\nfringe contrast maximization on several bands simultaneously. The optimization\nof this criterion leads to a simple solution with only two LDC stages per arm\nand existing differential delay lines, to the glass choice and a simple linear\nformula for thickness control of all these media. A refined criterion can also\ntake into account glass transmission. After presenting this criterion, we give\nthe optimal solution (medium, configuration) and its expected performance for\nthe planned observing modes on CHARA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 08:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

The performance of the deep learning methods are largely\ndependent on the data distribution they were trained on, and it is important to\nuse data from the robot's actual operating domain during training. Therefore,\nit is not possible to rely on pre-built, generic datasets when deploying robots\nin real environments, creating a need for efficient data collection and\nannotation in the specific operating conditions the robots will operate in. The\nchallenge is then: how do we reduce the cost of obtaining such datasets to a\npoint where we can easily deploy our robots in new conditions, environments and\nto support new sensors? As an answer to this question, we propose a data\nannotation pipeline based on SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and 3D-to-2D geometry.\nThe pipeline allows creating 3D and 2D bounding boxes, along with per-pixel\nannotations of arbitrary objects without needing accurate 3D models of the\nobjects prior to data collection and annotation.

Similarly, for the holographic NLSM we observe multiple nodal lines\ninstead of just one. We show, however, that as the temperature is raised these\nnodal lines broaden and disappear into the continuum one by one, so there is a\nfinite range of temperatures for which there is only a single nodal line\nvisible in the spectrum. We compute several transport coefficients in the\nholographic NLSM as a function of temperature, namely the charge and thermal\nconductivities, and the shear viscosities.

These developments, however, have been tied to\nspecific tasks, and progress in out-of-distribution generalization has been\nlimited. While it is assumed that these limitations can be overcome by\nincorporating suitable inductive biases, the notion of inductive biases itself\nis often left vague and does not provide meaningful guidance. In the paper, I\narticulate a different learning approach where representations do not emerge\nfrom biases in a neural architecture but are learned over a given target\nlanguage with a known semantics. The basic ideas are implicit in mainstream AI\nwhere representations have been encoded in languages ranging from fragments of\nfirst-order logic to probabilistic structural causal models. The challenge is\nto learn from data the representations that have traditionally been crafted by\nhand. Generalization is then a result of the semantics of the language. The\ngoals of this paper are to make these ideas explicit, to place them in a\nbroader context where the design of the target language is crucial, and to\nillustrate them in the context of learning to act and plan. For this, after a\ngeneral discussion, I consider learning representations of actions, general\npolicies, and subgoals (\"intrinsic rewards\"). In these cases, learning is\nformulated as a combinatorial problem but nothing prevents the use of deep\nlearning techniques instead. Indeed, learning representations over languages\nwith a known semantics provides an account of what is to be learned, while\nlearning representations with neural nets provides a complementary account of\nhow representations can be learned. The challenge and the opportunity is to\nbring the two together.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 10:24:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 18:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

We show that many of these local\noptimal modes are needed to capture the dynamics of the decay, that the most\nsignificant optimal mode on the initially occupied sites remains well described\nby a coherent-state typical for small polarons, and that those on the initially\nempty sites deviate from the coherent-state form. Additionally, we compute the\ncurrent through the structure in the metallic regime as a function of voltage.\nFor small voltages, we reproduce results for the Luttinger parameters. As the\nvoltage is increased, the effect of larger electron-phonon coupling strengths\nbecomes prominent. Further, the most significant optimal mode remains almost\nunchanged when going from the ground state to the current-carrying state in the\nmetallic regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 10:28:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 10:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Based on a model of IM\noccurrence that we generate through an experiment with 29 participants, the\nmapping between robot velocity, robot-human distance, and the relative\nfrequency of IM occurrence is established. This mapping is processed towards a\nreal-time capable robot motion generator, which limits the robot velocity\nduring task execution if necessary.

However, this is still a highly challenging\nproblem, mainly due to the computational complexity of the artificial neural\nnetworks (NNs) required for the efficient equalization of nonlinear optical\nchannels with large dispersion-induced memory. To implement the NN-based\noptical channel equalizer in hardware, a substantial complexity reduction is\nneeded, while we have to keep an acceptable performance level of the simplified\nNN model. In this work, we address the complexity reduction problem by applying\npruning and quantization techniques to an NN-based optical channel equalizer.\nWe use an exemplary NN architecture, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to\nmitigate the impairments for 30GBd 1000km transmission over a standard\nsingle-mode fiber, and demonstrate that it is feasible to reduce the\nequalizer's memory by up to 87.12%, and its complexity by up to 78.34%, without\nnoticeable performance degradation. In addition to this, we accurately define\nthe computational complexity of a compressed NN-based equalizer in the digital\nsignal processing (DSP) sense. Further, we examine the impact of using\ndifferent CPU and GPU settings on the power consumption and latency for the\ncompressed equalizer. We also verify the developed technique experimentally, by\nimplementing the reduced NN equalizer on two standard edge-computing hardware\nunits: Raspberry Pi 4 and Nvidia Jetson Nano, which are used to process the\ndata generated via simulating the signal's propagation down the optical-fiber\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 10:44:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 18:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

In both papers, the main technical\nresults rely on the combinatorial and algebraic analysis of the invertible-map\nequivalences $\\equiv^\\text{IM}_{k,Q}$ on certain variants of\nCai-F\\\"urer-Immerman (CFI) structures. These\n$\\equiv^\\text{IM}_{k,Q}$-equivalences, for a number $k$ and a set of\nprimes~$Q$, refine the well-known Weisfeiler-Leman equivalences used in\nalgorithms for graph isomorphism. The intuition is that two graphs\n$G\\equiv^\\text{IM}_{k,Q}H$ cannot be distinguished by iterative refinements of\nequivalences on $k$-tuples defined via linear operators on vector spaces over\nfields of characteristic $p \\in Q$. In the first paper it has been shown, using\nconsiderable algebraic machinery, that for a prime $q \\notin Q$, the\n$\\equiv^\\text{IM}_{k,Q}$ equivalences do not distinguish between non-isomorphic\nCFI-structures over the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. In the second paper, a similar\nbut not identical construction for CFI-structures over the rings\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{2^i}$ has, again by rather involved combinatorial and algebraic\narguments, been shown to be indistinguishable with respect to\n$\\equiv^\\text{IM}_{k,\\{2\\}}$.

This implies the following two results.\n  1. There is no fixed $k$ such that the invertible-map equivalence\n$\\equiv^\\text{IM}_{k,\\mathbb{P}}$ coincides with isomorphism on all finite\ngraphs.\n  2.

Throughout this paper we will refer to the model corresponding to\nthe second approach as the \\textit{beam-rod model}. In our discussion, we\nobserve that the beam-rod model has more \\textit{degrees of freedom} if\ncompared with the isotropic plate model. For this reason the beam-rod model is\nsupposed to be more appropiate to describe the behavior of the deck of a real\nsuspension bridge. A possible strategy to make the plate model more efficient\ncould be to relax the isotropy condition with a more general condition of\northotropy, which is expected to increase the degrees of freedom in view of the\nlarger number of elastic parameters. In this new setting, a comparison between\nthe two approaches becomes now possible.\n  Basic results are proved for the suggested problem, from existence and\nuniqueness of solutions to spectral properties. We suggest realistic values for\nthe elastic parameters thus obtaining with both approaches similar responses in\nthe static and dynamic behavior of the deck.

Therefore we derive and present deterministic\nreinforcement learning dynamics where the agents observe the true state of the\nenvironment only partially.

For instance, partially observant agents can\nlearn better outcomes faster, in a more stable way and even overcome social\ndilemmas. Furthermore, our method allows the application of dynamical systems\ntheory to partially observable multiagent leaning. In this regard we find the\nemergence of catastrophic limit cycles, a critical slowing down of the learning\nprocesses between reward regimes and the separation of the learning dynamics\ninto fast and slow directions, all caused by partial observability.

One primary objective of LDP is frequency (or histogram)\nestimation, in which the aggregator estimates the number of users for each\npossible value. In practice, when a study with rich content on a population is\ndesired, the interest is in the multiple attributes of the population, that is\nto say, in multidimensional data ($d \\geq 2$). However, contrary to the problem\nof frequency estimation of a single attribute (the majority of the works), the\nmultidimensional aspect imposes to pay particular attention to the privacy\nbudget.

In addition, the MAN instantiates a number of attention heads to\nsimultaneously attend to multiple facial areas and build attention maps on\nthese regions. Further, the AFN distracts these attentions to multiple\nlocations before fusing the attention maps to a comprehensive one. Extensive\nexperiments on three public datasets (including AffectNet, RAF-DB, and SFEW\n2.0) verified that the proposed method consistently achieves state-of-the-art\nfacial expression recognition performance. Code will be made available at\nhttps://github.com/yaoing/DAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 13:15:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2021 08:52:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 03:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 03:23:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 07:09:23 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 03:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

It is a major\nextension to the IEEE-standard 1057 by permitting the background to be time\nvarying; additionally, any number of harmonics of the periodic portion can be\nmodelled. This paper focuses on using B-Splines to implement a piecewise\npolynomial model for the aperiodic portion of the signal. A thorough algebraic\nderivation of the method is presented, as well as a comparison to using global\npolynomial approximation. It is proven that B-Splines work better for modelling\na more complicated aperiodic portion when compared to higher order polynomials.\nFurthermore, the piecewise polynomial model is capable of modelling the local\nsignal variations produced by the interaction of a control system with a\nprocess in industrial applications. The method of variable projection reduces\nthe problem to a one-dimensional nonlinear optimization, combined with a linear\nleast-squares computation. An added benefit of using the method of variable\nprojection is the possibility to calculate the covariances of the linear\ncoefficients of the model, enabling the calculation of confidence and\nprediction intervals. The method is tested on both real measurement data\nacquired in industrial processes, as well as synthetic data. The method shows\npromising results for the precise characterization of periodic signals embedded\nin highly complex aperiodic backgrounds.

Generally, these methods simply calculate similarities between\nphrase embeddings and document embedding, which is insufficient to capture\ndifferent context for a more effective UKE model. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel method for UKE, where local and global contexts are jointly modeled. From\na global view, we calculate the similarity between a certain phrase and the\nwhole document in the vector space as transitional embedding based models do.\nIn terms of the local view, we first build a graph structure based on the\ndocument where phrases are regarded as vertices and the edges are similarities\nbetween vertices. Then, we proposed a new centrality computation method to\ncapture local salient information based on the graph structure. Finally, we\nfurther combine the modeling of global and local context for ranking. We\nevaluate our models on three public benchmarks (Inspec, DUC 2001, SemEval 2010)\nand compare with existing state-of-the-art models. The results show that our\nmodel outperforms most models while generalizing better on input documents with\ndifferent domains and length.

In contrast, the superfluorescent emissions burst on a\nmuch-reduced timescale and their beatings involve both directly and indirectly\nexcited energy sublevels. In this work, picosecond and femtosecond\nsuperfluorescent beatings are observed from a dense cesium atomic vapor. Cesium\natoms are excited by 60-femtosecond long, 800 nm laser pulses via two-photon\nprocesses into their coherent superpositions of the ground 6S and excited 8S\nstates. As a part of the transient four wave mixing process, the yoked\nsuperfluorescent blue light at lower transitions of 6S - 7P are recorded and\nstudied. Delayed buildup time of this blue light is measured as a function of\nthe input laser beam power using a high-resolution 2 ps streak camera. The\npower dependent buildup delay time is consistently doubled as the vapor\ntemperature is lowered to cut the number of atoms by half. At low power and\ndensity, a beating with a period of 100 picoseconds representing the ground\nstate splitting is observed. The autocorrelation measurements of the generated\nblue light exhibit a beating with a quasi-period of 230 fs corresponding to the\nsplitting of the 7P level primarily at lower input laser power. Understanding\nand, eventually, controlling the intriguing nature of superfluorescent beatings\nmay permit a rapid quantum operation free from the rather slow spontaneous\nemission processes from atoms and molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 13:42:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

Here we retrospectively explore the\neffectiveness of this strategy using a stochastic SEIR framework, showing that\neven under the unrealistic assumption of perfect shielding, hospitals would\nhave been rapidly overwhelmed with many avoidable deaths among lower risk\nindividuals. Crucially, even a small (20%) reduction in the effectiveness of\nshielding would have likely led to a large increase (>150%) in the number of\ndeaths compared to perfect shielding. Our findings demonstrate that shielding\nthe vulnerable while allowing infections to spread among the wider population\nwould not have been a viable public health strategy for COVID-19 and is\nunlikely to be effective for future pandemics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 13:55:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 19:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

The accuracy of the cosmological constraints derived from these\nmeasurements will depend on the knowledge of the underlying redshift\ndistributions based on photometric redshift calibrations. A new approach is\nproposed to use the stacked spectra from Euclid slitless spectroscopy to\naugment broad-band photometric information to constrain the redshift\ndistribution with spectral energy distribution fitting. The high spectral\nresolution available in the stacked spectra complements the photometry and\nhelps to break the colour-redshift degeneracy and constrain the redshift\ndistribution of galaxy samples. We modelled the stacked spectra as a linear\nmixture of spectral templates. The mixture may be inverted to infer the\nunderlying redshift distribution using constrained regression algorithms. We\ndemonstrate the method on simulated Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid mock\nsurvey data sets based on the Euclid Flagship mock galaxy catalogue.

Computer-aided diagnosis systems using deep learning\nmodels have been trained and used for the late mycological diagnostic stages.\nHowever, there are no reference literature works made for the early stages. A\nmycological laboratory in Colombia donated the images used for the development\nof this research work. They were manually labelled into five classes and\ncurated with a subject matter expert assistance. The images were later cropped\nand patched with automated code routines to produce the final dataset.

A\nportion of this noise, particularly in land datasets, presents itself as random\nnoise. In recent years, neural networks have been successfully used to denoise\nseismic data in a supervised fashion. However, supervised learning always comes\nwith the often unachievable requirement of having noisy-clean data pairs for\ntraining. Using blind-spot networks, we redefine the denoising task as a\nself-supervised procedure where the network uses the surrounding noisy samples\nto estimate the noise-free value of a central sample. Based on the assumption\nthat noise is statistically independent between samples, the network struggles\nto predict the noise component of the sample due to its randomnicity, whilst\nthe signal component is accurately predicted due to its spatio-temporal\ncoherency. Illustrated on synthetic examples, the blind-spot network is shown\nto be an efficient denoiser of seismic data contaminated by random noise with\nminimal damage to the signal; therefore, providing improvements in both the\nimage domain and down-the-line tasks, such as inversion. To conclude the study,\nthe suggested approach is applied to field data and the results are compared\nwith two commonly used random denoising techniques: FX-deconvolution and\nCurvelet transform. By demonstrating that blind-spot networks are an efficient\nsuppressor of random noise, we believe this is just the beginning of utilising\nself-supervised learning in seismic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 14:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

The sampling in these Monte Carlo algorithms is typically performed with\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms employing local update rules, which often\nsuffer from long autocorrelation times and interdependent samples. We propose a\nsampling algorithm that generates independent samples from a PEPS, bypassing\nall problems related to finite autocorrelation times. This algorithm is a\ngeneralization of an existing direct sampling algorithm for unitary tensor\nnetworks. We introduce an auxiliary probability distribution from which\nindependent samples can be drawn, and combine it with importance sampling in\norder to evaluate expectation values accurately. We benchmark our algorithm on\nthe classical Ising model and on variational optimization of two-dimensional\nquantum spin models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 15:09:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 14:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

In this study, we present a detailed spectral analysis of AT2019wey\nin the low/hard state during its X-ray outburst on the basis of Nuclear\nSpectroscopic Telescope Array \\emph observations. We obtain tight constraints\non several of its important physical parameters by applying the State-of-art\n\\texttt{relxill} relativistic reflection model family. In particular, we\ndetermine that the measured inner radius of the accretion disk is most likely\nto have extended to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius, i.e.,\n$R_{\\text{in}}=1.38^{+0.23}_{-0.16}~R_{\\text{ISCO}}$. Hence, assuming\n$R_{\\text{in}}$=$R_{\\text{ISCO}}$, we find the spin of AT2019wey to be\n$a_{*}\\sim$ $0.97$, which is close to the extreme and an inner disk inclination\nangle of ~$i\\sim$ $22 ^{\\circ}$.

The motion of the\nparticle is driven by the fluid velocity in the matrix for passive particles or\ncombined with its self-propelling velocity for active particles. The excluded\nvolume effect between a pair of particles or between a particle and the\nboundary is modeled by a repulsive potential force. The drag exerted to the\nfluid by a particle is assumed proportional to its velocity. When the particle\nis rigid, its state is described by a zero velocity gradient tensor within the\nnonzero phase field that defines its profile and a constraining stress exists\ntherein. While the particle is elastic, a linear constitutive equation for the\nelastic stress is provided within the particle domain.

It has been previously noted that for a significant\nrange of the parameter space of this class of models, the annihilation of dark\nmatter particles into a pair of dark photons can dominate the freeze-out\nprocess even when this process is kinematically forbidden for dark matter at\nrest -- this is known as the \"forbidden dark matter\" (FDM) regime. Prior\nstudies of this regime, however, assume that any \"dark Higgs\" associated with\nbreaking the dark $U(1)$ and imparting mass to the dark photon is decoupled\nfrom the dark matter and as such plays no role in the freeze-out process. In\nthis paper, we explore the effects of a dark Higgs on sub-GeV dark matter\nphenomenology in this FDM regime by considering the simplest possible\nconstruction in which there exist non-trivial dark matter-dark Higgs couplings:\na model with a single complex scalar DM candidate coupled directly to the dark\nHiggs field.

Facial age translation has received considerable\nresearch attention in the last decade due to its practical value in cross-age\nface recognition and various entertainment applications. However, most existing\nmethods model age changes between holistic images, regardless of the human face\nstructure and the age-changing patterns of individual facial components.\nConsequently, the lack of semantic supervision will cause infidelity of\ngenerated faces in detail. To this end, we propose a unified framework for\nbiphasic facial age translation with noisy-semantic guided generative\nadversarial networks. Structurally, we project the class-aware noisy semantic\nlayouts to soft latent maps for the following injection operation on the\nindividual facial parts. In particular, we introduce two sub-networks,\nProjectionNet and ConstraintNet. ProjectionNet introduces the low-level\nstructural semantic information with noise map and produces soft latent maps.\nConstraintNet disentangles the high-level spatial features to constrain the\nsoft latent maps, which endows more age-related context into the soft latent\nmaps. Specifically, attention mechanism is employed in ConstraintNet for\nfeature disentanglement. Meanwhile, in order to mine the strongest mapping\nability of the network, we embed two types of learning strategies in the\ntraining procedure, supervised self-driven generation and unsupervised\ncondition-driven cycle-consistent generation. As a result, extensive\nexperiments conducted on MORPH and CACD datasets demonstrate the prominent\nability of our proposed method which achieves state-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 15:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

Due to test-particle simulations as well as powerful non-linear\nanalytical tools our understanding of this type of transport is almost\ncomplete. However, previously developed non-linear analytical theories do not\nalways agree perfectly with simulations. Therefore, a correction factor $a^2$\nwas incorporated into such theories with the aim to balance out inaccuracies.\nIn this paper a new analytical theory for perpendicular transport is presented.\nThis theory contains the previously developed unified non-linear transport\ntheory, the most advanced theory to date, in the limit of small Kubo number\nturbulence. For two-dimensional turbulence new results are obtained. In this\ncase the new theory describes perpendicular diffusion as a process which is\nsub-diffusive while particles follow magnetic field lines. Diffusion is\nrestored as soon as the turbulence transverse complexity becomes important. For\nlong parallel mean free paths one finds that the perpendicular diffusion\ncoefficient is a reduced field line random walk limit. For short parallel mean\nfree paths, on the other hand, one gets a hybrid diffusion coefficient which is\na mixture of collisionless Rechester & Rosenbluth and fluid limits. Overall the\nnew analytical theory developed in the current paper is in agreement with\nheuristic arguments. Furthermore, the new theory agrees almost perfectly with\npreviously performed test-particle simulations without the need of the\naforementioned correction factor $a^2$ or any other free parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 16:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

The quality of\ngenerated adversarial samples relies on the adequacy of training data samples.\nHowever, in low data regimes like medical diagnostic imaging and cybersecurity,\nthe anomaly samples are scarce in number. This paper proposes a novel GAN\ndesign called Evasion Generative Adversarial Network (EVAGAN) that is more\nsuitable for low data regime problems that use oversampling for detection\nimprovement of ML classifiers. EVAGAN not only can generate evasion samples,\nbut its discriminator can act as an evasion-aware classifier. We have\nconsidered Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN) as a benchmark to evaluate the\nperformance of EVAGAN on cybersecurity (ISCX-2014, CIC-2017 and CIC2018) botnet\nand computer vision (MNIST) datasets. We demonstrate that EVAGAN outperforms\nACGAN for unbalanced datasets with respect to detection performance, training\nstability and time complexity. EVAGAN's generator quickly learns to generate\nthe low sample class and hardens its discriminator simultaneously. In contrast\nto ML classifiers that require security hardening after being adversarially\ntrained by GAN-generated data, EVAGAN renders it needless. The experimental\nanalysis proves that EVAGAN is an efficient evasion hardened model for low data\nregimes for the selected cybersecurity and computer vision datasets.

A\nrooted symmetric tree is a tree in which all vertices at the same level from\nroot vertex have the same degree. It has been known since 1979 that rooted\nsymmetric trees are graceful. However, the proofs that have been presented for\nthis fact are either indirect inductive proofs or algorithmic descriptive\nproofs showing the many separate steps involved in labelling the vertices.\nGiven a rooted symmetric tree, we find a graceful labelling f of T in the form\nof a direct algebraic function that algebraically maps each vertex of T to a\nunique label. Interestingly, f turns out to be a generalisation of the way a\npath is canonically gracefully labelled as algorithmically described by A. Rosa\nwho is a pioneer in this field of research. The algebraic function that defines\nthe graceful labelling is used to show that a class of rooted symmetric trees\nthat contains the class of binomial trees has weakly {\\alpha}-labelling and it\ncan provide a concise practical, computational way of producing graceful\nlabelling of large rooted symmetric trees in, relatively, minimal time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 12:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

A new type of recurrent network\narchitecture, named Oscillatory Fourier Neural Network, based on the proposed\nneuron is presented and applied to various types of sequential tasks. We\ndemonstrate that recurrent neural network with the proposed neuron model is\nmathematically equivalent to a simplified form of discrete Fourier transform\napplied onto periodical activation. In particular, the computationally\nintensive back-propagation through time in training is eliminated, leading to\nfaster training while achieving the state of the art inference accuracy in a\ndiverse group of sequential tasks. For instance, applying the proposed model to\nsentiment analysis on IMDB review dataset reaches 89.4% test accuracy within 5\nepochs, accompanied by over 35x reduction in the model size compared to LSTM.\nThe proposed novel RNN architecture is well poised for intelligent sequential\nprocessing in resource constrained hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 19:08:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 18:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

Because of\na series of global and regional \"black swans,\" such as the COVID-19 pandemic,\nthe U.S. stock market triggered the circuit breaker three times within one week\nof March 9 to 16, which is unprecedented throughout history. Affected by the\nwhole circumstance, the stock prices of individual corporations also plummeted\nby rates that were never predicted by any pre-developed forecasting models. It\nreveals that there was a lack of satisfactory models that could predict the\nchanges in stocks prices when catastrophic, highly unlikely events occur. To\nfill the void of such models and to help prevent investors from heavy losses\nduring uncertain times, this paper aims to capture the movement pattern of\nstock prices under anomalous circumstances. First, we detect outliers in\nsequential stock prices by fitting a standard ARIMA model and identifying the\npoints where predictions deviate significantly from actual values. With the\nselected data points, we train ARIMA and LSTM models at the single-stock level,\nindustry level, and general market level, respectively. Since the public moods\naffect the stock market tremendously, a sentiment analysis is also incorporated\ninto the models in the form of sentiment scores, which are converted from\ncomments about specific stocks on Reddit. Based on 100 companies' stock prices\nin the period of 2016 to 2020, the models achieve an average prediction\naccuracy of 98% which can be used to optimize existing prediction\nmethodologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 18:50:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

Smart homes equipped with ADA compliant\nappliances and services are critical for people with disabilities (i.e., visual\nimpairments and limited mobility) to improve independence, safety, and quality\nof life. Despite all advancements in smart home technologies, some fundamental\ndesign and implementation issues remain. For example, people with disabilities\noften feel insecure to respond when someone knocks on the door or rings the\ndoorbell. In this paper, we present an intelligent system called \"SafeAccess+\"\nto build safer and ADA compliant premises (e.g. smart homes, offices). The key\nfunctionalities of the SafeAccess+ are: 1) Monitoring the inside/outside of\npremises and identifying incoming people; 2) Providing users relevant\ninformation to assess incoming threats (e.g., burglary, robbery) and ongoing\ncrimes 3) Allowing users to grant safe access to homes for friends/family\nmembers. We have addressed several technical and research challenges: -\ndeveloping models to detect and recognize person/activity, generating image\ndescriptions, designing ADA compliant end-end system. In addition, we have\ndesigned a prototype smart door showcasing the proof-of-concept. The premises\nare expected to be equipped with cameras placed in strategic locations that\nfacilitate monitoring the premise 24/7 to identify incoming persons and to\ngenerate image descriptions. The system generates a pre-structured message from\nthe image description to assess incoming threats and immediately notify the\nusers. The completeness and generalization of models have been ensured through\na rigorous quantitative evaluation.
