A feature-block can contain features of a specific type or\nfeatures derived from a particular source, which are presented to the neural\nnetwork in separate input branches (multiblock ANNs). This work presents three\nmethods pursuing distinct strategies to rank features in multiblock ANNs by\ntheir importance: (1) a composite strategy building on individual feature\nimportance rankings, (2) a knock-in, and (3) a knock-out strategy. While the\ncomposite strategy builds on state-of-the-art feature importance rankings,\nknock-in and knock-out strategies evaluate the block as a whole via a mutual\ninformation criterion.

In contrast, experimental measurements probe the true flow with lesser\nidealizations, but they continually contend with spatio-temporal sensor\nresolution. Assimilating observations directly in simulations can combine the\nbenefits of both approaches. The problem is expressed in variational form,\nwhere we seek a Navier-Stokes solution that minimizes a cost function defined\nin terms of the deviation of numerical predictions and observations. In this\nframework, measurements are no longer a mere record of the instantaneous, local\nquantity, but rather an encoding of the antecedent flow events that we aim to\ndecode using the governing equations. We examine three state estimation\nproblems: In circular Couette flow, starting from wall stress data, we\naccurately reconstruct the nonlinear saturated wavy Taylor vortices. Through a\ndiscussion of transition to chaos in a Lorenz system, we highlight the\nchallenge of navigating the landscape of the cost function, and how the\nlandscape can be modified by sensor placement. In turbulent channel flow, the\nTaylor microscale and Lyapunov timescale place restrictions on the resolution\nof observations that ensure an accurate reconstruction of all the scales. The\nnotion of domain of dependence of an observation is introduced and related to\nthe Hessian of the cost function. For measurements of wall stress, the\neigenspectrum of the Hessian demonstrates the sensitivity of short-time\nobservations to the near-wall turbulent scales and to outer large scales. At\nlong times, backward chaos obfuscates the interpretation of the data:\nobservations that are infinitesimally close may be traced back to entirely\ndifferent earlier flow states--a dual to the more common butterfly effect for\nforward trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 16:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

Their effect may\nalso reduce the timescale of angular momentum exchanges between the disk and\nhost star during the early pre-main-sequence phase. To improve our\nunderstanding of the environmental influence on the rotational history of\nstars, we developed a model that considers the influence of the local\nfar-ultraviolet radiation on the spin evolution of low mass stars. Our model\nincludes an assumption of disk-locking, which fixes the rotation rate during\nthe star-disk-interaction phase, with the duration of this phase parametrised\nas a function of the local far-ultraviolet radiation and stellar mass (in the\nrange 0.1--1.3 M$_\\odot$). In this way, we demonstrate how the feedback from\nmassive stars can significantly influence the spin evolution of stars and\nexplain the mass-dependency observed in period-mass distributions of young\nregions like Upper Sco and NGC 2264. The high far-ultraviolet environments of\nhigh-mass stars can skew the period distribution of surrounding stars towards\nfast-rotation, explaining the excess of fast-rotating stars in the open cluster\nh Per. The proposed link between rotation and the pre-main-sequence environment\nopens new avenues for interpreting the rotational distributions of young stars.\nFor example, we suggest that stellar rotation may be used as a tracer for the\nprimordial ultraviolet irradiation for stars up to $\\sim$1 Gyr, which offers a\npotential method to connect mature planetary systems to their birth\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 16:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for\nacquiring short-horizon skills autonomously. However, the focus of RL\nalgorithms has largely been on the success of those individual skills, more so\nthan learning and grounding a large repertoire of skills that can be sequenced\nto complete extended multi-stage tasks. The latter demands robustness and\npersistence, as errors in skills can compound over time, and may require the\nrobot to have a number of primitive skills in its repertoire, rather than just\none. To this end, we introduce EMBER, a model-based RL method for learning\nprimitive skills that are suitable for completing long-horizon visuomotor\ntasks. EMBER learns and plans using a learned model, critic, and success\nclassifier, where the success classifier serves both as a reward function for\nRL and as a grounding mechanism to continuously detect if the robot should\nretry a skill when unsuccessful or under perturbations. Further, the learned\nmodel is task-agnostic and trained using data from all skills, enabling the\nrobot to efficiently learn a number of distinct primitives. These visuomotor\nprimitive skills and their associated pre- and post-conditions can then be\ndirectly combined with off-the-shelf symbolic planners to complete long-horizon\ntasks.

The log risk may be written as the sum of fixed effects and latent random\neffects. The commonly used BYM model further decomposes the latent effects into\na sum of independent effects and spatial effects to account for potential\noverdispersion and a spatial correlation structure among the counts. However,\nthis model suffers from an identifiably issue. The BYM2 model reparametrises\nthe latter by decomposing each latent effect into a weighted sum of independent\nand spatial effects.

The main question\nsurrounding this phenomenon is whether or not it is important enough to lead to\nmeasurable effects on the scale factor evolution eventually explaining its\nacceleration or the Hubble tension. One of the most important result on this\nsubject is the Buchert-Ehlers theorem (Buchert \\& Ehlers, 1997) stating that\nbackreaction is exactly zero when calculated using Newton's theory of\ngravitation, which may not be the case in general relativity.

We will show that this is not necessarily the case, in the sense that\nthis implication does not apply to a universe which is still well described by\nNewton's theory on small scales but has a non-Euclidean topology. The theorem\nshould therefore be generalised to account for such a scenario. In a heuristic\ncalculation where we construct a theory which is locally Newtonian but defined\non a non-Euclidean topology, we show that backreaction is non-zero, meaning\nthat it might be non-relativistic depending on the topological class of our\nUniverse.

For 2-electron systems\nas described by the Schr{\\\"o}dinger-Pauli theory Hamiltonian with a symmetrical\nbinding potential, we report a new symmetry operation of the electronic\ncoordinates. The symmetry operation is such that it leads to the equality of\nthe transformed wave function to the wave function. This equality is referred\nto as the Wave Function Identity. The symmetry operation is a two-step process:\nan interchange of the spatial coordinates of the electrons whilst keeping their\nspin moments unchanged, followed by an inversion. The Identity is valid for\narbitrary structure of the binding potential, arbitrary electron interaction of\nthe form $w(|{\\bf{r}} - {\\bf{r}}'|)$, all bound electronic states, and\narbitrary dimensionality.

Redshift values are assigned\nwhile matching the abundance of ionized mass according to a given mass-weighted\nionization fraction $\\bar{x}_\\mathrm{i}(z)$.

The reionization process is further controlled\nthrough the minimum halo mass $M_\\mathrm{min}$ for galaxy formation and the\nradiation mean free path $l_\\mathrm{mfp}$ for radiative transfer.

We show that such small\ndifferences in scaling exponents can have a significant impact on the character\nand long-term evolution of growth trajectories. These results illustrate that\nwhile companies are part of a larger class of growth phenomena driven by\nincomes and costs that scale with size, they are unique in that they grow\nfollowing a temporal power-function which sets them apart from organisms,\ncities, nations, and markets, whose growth over time is often exponential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 18:03:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 04:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

A global optimizer can be a potential solution but is computationally\nintractable in a real-time setting. In this paper, we present a real-time MPC\ncapable of searching over different driving modalities. Our basic idea is\nsimple: we run several goal-directed parallel trajectory optimizations and\nscore the resulting trajectories based on user-defined meta cost functions.\nThis allows us to perform a global search over several locally optimal motion\nplans. Although conceptually straightforward, realizing this idea in real-time\nwith existing optimizers is highly challenging from technical and computational\nstandpoints. With this motivation, we present a novel batch non-holonomic\ntrajectory optimization whose underlying matrix algebra is easily\nparallelizable across problem instances and reduces to computing large batch\nmatrix-vector products. This structure, in turn, is achieved by deriving a\nlinearization-free multi-convex reformulation of the non-holonomic kinematics\nand collision avoidance constraints. We extensively validate our approach using\nboth synthetic and real data sets (NGSIM) of traffic scenarios. We highlight\nhow our algorithm automatically takes lane-change and overtaking decisions\nbased on the defined meta cost function.

By converting binary code into images, researchers have shown\nsatisfactory results in applying machine learning to extract features that are\ndifficult to discover manually. Such visualization-based malware detection\nmethods can capture malware patterns from many different malware families and\nimprove malware detection speed. On the other hand, recent research has also\nshown adversarial attacks against such visualization-based malware detection.\nAttackers can generate adversarial examples by perturbing the malware binary in\nnon-reachable regions, such as padding at the end of the binary. Alternatively,\nattackers can perturb the malware image embedding and then verify the\nexecutability of the malware post-transformation. One major limitation of the\nfirst attack scenario is that a simple pre-processing step can remove the\nperturbations before classification. For the second attack scenario, it is hard\nto maintain the original malware's executability and functionality. In this\nwork, we provide literature review on existing malware visualization techniques\nand attacks against them. We summarize the limitation of the previous work, and\ndesign a new adversarial example attack against visualization-based malware\ndetection that can evade pre-processing filtering and maintain the original\nmalware functionality.

Instead, we train a tree with\nmissing incorporated as attribute (MIA), which does not require explicit\nimputation, and we optimize a fairness-regularized objective function.

With numerical optimization methods\nsuch as gradient boosting, ensembles of local decision rules can gain good\npredictive performance on data involving global structure. Meanwhile, machine\nlearning models are being increasingly used to solve problems in high-stake\ndomains including healthcare and finance. Here, there is an emerging consensus\nregarding the need for practitioners to understand whether and how those models\ncould perform robustly in the deployment environments, in the presence of\ndistributional shifts. Past research on local decision rules has focused mainly\non maximizing discriminant patterns, without due consideration of robustness\nagainst distributional shifts. In order to fill this gap, we propose a new\nmethod to learn and ensemble local decision rules, that are robust both in the\ntraining and deployment environments. Specifically, we propose to leverage\ncausal knowledge by regarding the distributional shifts in subpopulations and\ndeployment environments as the results of interventions on the underlying\nsystem.

The proposed algorithm is robust to changes in the starting\npose of the camera/robot, where a pose is defined as the planar position plus\nthe orientation around the vertical axis. VTR consists of a teach phase in\nwhich a robot moves in a prescribed path, and a repeat phase in which the robot\ntries to repeat the same path starting from the same or a different pose. Most\navailable VTR algorithms are pose dependent and cannot perform well in the\nrepeat phase when starting from an initial pose far from that of the teach\nphase. To achieve more robust pose independency, the key is to generate a 3D\nsemantic map of the environment containing the camera trajectory and the\npositions of surrounding objects during the teach phase. For specific\nimplementation, we use ORB-SLAM to collect the camera poses and the 3D point\nclouds of the environment, and YOLOv3 to detect objects in the environment. We\nthen combine the two outputs to build the semantic map. In the repeat phase, we\nrelocalize the robot based on the detected objects and the stored semantic map.\nThe robot is then able to move toward the teach path, and repeat it in both\nforward and backward directions.

Rewinding the SC process in a memory-efficient way is a problem\nthat we address in this paper.

Cardiac mapping techniques acquire local temporal measurements\nand combine them to visualize the spread of electrophysiological wave phenomena\nacross the heart surface.

For instance, electro-anatomical catheter\nmapping is severely limited by the sparsity of the measurements, and optical\nmapping is prone to noise and motion artifacts. In the past, several approaches\nhave been proposed to obtain more reliable maps from noisy or sparse mapping\ndata.

To\nfacilitate the understanding of dialogues, in this paper, we propose a novel\ncontextual dialogue encoder (i.e. DialogueBERT) based on the popular\npre-trained language model BERT. Five self-supervised learning pre-training\ntasks are devised for learning the particularity of dialouge utterances. Four\ndifferent input embeddings are integrated to catch the relationship between\nutterances, including turn embedding, role embedding, token embedding and\nposition embedding. DialogueBERT was pre-trained with 70 million dialogues in\nreal scenario, and then fine-tuned in three different downstream dialogue\nunderstanding tasks. Experimental results show that DialogueBERT achieves\nexciting results with 88.63% accuracy for intent recognition, 94.25% accuracy\nfor emotion recognition and 97.04% F1 score for named entity recognition, which\noutperforms several strong baselines by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 01:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

Our results\nreveal various interesting phase transitions which depend on the interplay of\nthe sample size $n$ and the signal strength $\\varepsilon$ with the dimension\n$d$ and the sparsity level $s$. For instance, if the sample size is less than a\nthreshold (which depends on $d$ and $s$), then all tests are asymptotically\npowerless, irrespective of the magnitude of the signal strength. On the other\nhand, if the sample size is above the threshold, then the detection boundary\nundergoes a further phase transition depending on the signal strength. Here, a\n$\\chi^2$-type test attains the detection boundary in the dense regime, whereas\nin the sparse regime a Bonferroni correction of two maximum-type tests and a\nversion of the Higher Criticism test is optimal up to sharp constants. These\nresults combined provide a complete description of the phase diagram for the\nsparse uniformity testing problem across all regimes of the parameters $n$,\n$d$, and $s$.

This is due to the fact that most of\ncurrent FL frameworks only consider a star network topology where all local\ntrained models are aggregated at a single server (e.g., a cloud server). This\ncauses significant overhead at the server when the number of users are huge and\nlocal models' sizes are large. This paper proposes a novel edge network\narchitecture which decentralizes the model aggregation process at the server,\nthereby significantly reducing the aggregation latency of the whole network. In\nthis architecture, we propose a highly-effective in-network computation\nprotocol consisting of two components. First, an in-network aggregation process\nis designed so that the majority of aggregation computations can be offloaded\nfrom cloud server to edge nodes. Second, a joint routing and resource\nallocation optimization problem is formulated to minimize the aggregation\nlatency for the whole system at every learning round. The problem turns out to\nbe NP-hard, and thus we propose a polynomial time routing algorithm which can\nachieve near optimal performance with a theoretical bound. Numerical results\nshow that our proposed framework can dramatically reduce the network latency,\nup to 4.6 times. Furthermore, this framework can significantly decrease cloud's\ntraffic and computing overhead by a factor of K/M, where K is the number of\nusers and M is the number of edge nodes, in comparison with conventional\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 02:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

The overall\nnetwork consists of two independent networks, named DRN and the dehazing\nnetwork respectively.

This work connects a supervised denoising\nand a semantic segmentation model together to form a end-to-end model, which\ncan make use of the semantic labels while still provides a denoised image as an\nintermediate product. We use both the supervised and the self-supervised models\nfor the denoising and introduce a new cost term for the joint denoising and the\nsegmentation setup. We test the proposed approach on both the synthetic data\nand the real-world data, including the optical neuroimaing dataset and the\nelectron microscope dataset. The result shows that the joint denoising result\noutperforms the one using the denoising method alone and the joint model\nbenefits the segmentation and other downstream task as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 03:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

The underlying reason is that most neural dialogue\nmodels only capture the syntactic and semantic information, but fail to model\nthe logical consistency between the dialogue history and the generated\nresponse. Recently, a new multi-turn dialogue reasoning task has been proposed,\nto facilitate dialogue reasoning research. However, this task is challenging,\nbecause there are only slight differences between the illogical response and\nthe dialogue history. How to effectively solve this challenge is still worth\nexploring. This paper proposes a Fine-grained Comparison Model (FCM) to tackle\nthis problem. Inspired by human's behavior in reading comprehension, a\ncomparison mechanism is proposed to focus on the fine-grained differences in\nthe representation of each response candidate. Specifically, each candidate\nrepresentation is compared with the whole history to obtain a history\nconsistency representation. Furthermore, the consistency signals between each\ncandidate and the speaker's own history are considered to drive a model to\nprefer a candidate that is logically consistent with the speaker's history\nlogic. Finally, the above consistency representations are employed to output a\nranking list of the candidate responses for multi-turn dialogue reasoning.\nExperimental results on two public dialogue datasets show that our method\nobtains higher ranking scores than the baseline models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 04:16:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 13:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-24"}

Unlike the similar effects, such as defocus blur, which is now easily\ncontrolled even by smartphones, motion blur is still uncontrollable and makes\nundesired effects on photographs. In this paper, an unified framework to add\nmotion blur on per-object basis is proposed. In the method, multiple frames are\ncaptured without motion blur and they are accumulated to create motion blur on\ntarget objects. To capture images without motion blur, shutter speed must be\nshort, however, it makes captured images dark, and thus, a sensor gain should\nbe increased to compensate it. Since a sensor gain causes a severe noise on\nimage, we propose a color compensation algorithm based on non-linear filtering\ntechnique for solution. Another contribution is that our technique can be used\nto make HDR images for fast moving objects by using multi-exposure images.

These two characteristics produce a meaningful\nrepresentation, where the cluster area is proportional to its size in number,\nand relationships between clusters are materialized by closeness on the\nembedding.\n  This algorithm is non-parametric, therefore two initializations of the\nalgorithm would lead to two different embedding.

Specifically, we propose the\n\\underline{M}inimalist \\underline{E}nsemble \\underline{P}olicy\n\\underline{G}radient framework (MEPG), which introduces minimalist ensemble\nconsistent Bellman update by utilizing a modified dropout operator. MEPG holds\nensemble property by keeping the dropout consistency of both sides of the\nBellman equation. Additionally, the dropout operator also increases MEPG's\ngeneralization capability. Moreover, we theoretically show that the policy\nevaluation phase in the MEPG maintains two synchronized deep Gaussian\nProcesses. To verify the MEPG framework's ability to generalize, we perform\nexperiments on the gym simulator, which presents that the MEPG framework\noutperforms or achieves a similar level of performance as the current\nstate-of-the-art ensemble methods and model-free methods without increasing\nadditional computational resource costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 07:30:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 00:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

Here, even mild ultrasonication is found to rapidly extract\nthe inner single-wall CNTs (SWCNTs) from the outer shells of the double-wall\nCNTs (DWCNTs). As-synthesized DWCNTs are gently solubilized in a surfactant\nsolution, strictly avoiding any ultrasonication, followed by two consecutive\ndensity gradient ultracentrifugation (DGU) steps to obtain a purified colloidal\nsolution of isolated DWCNTs. The latter is carefully selected based on in situ\nresonant Raman (RRS) and fluorescence (PL) spectroscopy, measured as a function\nof depth directly in the ultracentrifuge tube after DGU.

Traditionally, click is\nusually treated as a positive implicit feedback signal of relevance or\nusefulness, while non-click (especially non-click after examination) is\nregarded as a signal of irrelevance or uselessness. However, there are many\ncases where users do not click on any search results but still satisfy their\ninformation need with the contents of the results shown on the Search Engine\nResult Page (SERP). This raises the problem of measuring result usefulness and\nmodeling user satisfaction in \"Zero-click\" search scenarios.\n  Previous works have solved this issue by (1) detecting user satisfaction for\nabandoned SERP with context information and (2) considering result-level click\nnecessity with external assessors' annotations. However, few works have\ninvestigated the reason behind non-click behavior and estimated the usefulness\nof non-click results. A challenge for this research question is how to collect\nvaluable feedback for non-click results. With neuroimaging technologies, we\ndesign a lab-based user study and reveal differences in brain signals while\nexamining non-click search results with different usefulness levels. The\nfindings in significant brain regions and electroencephalogram~(EEG) spectrum\nalso suggest that the process of usefulness judgment might involve similar\ncognitive functions of relevance perception and satisfaction decoding. Inspired\nby these findings, we conduct supervised learning tasks to estimate the\nusefulness of non-click results with brain signals and conventional information\n(i.e., content and context factors).

To construct a semicosmological evolving model potential with\nchanging masses and sizes of the Galactic components, we have used the\nalgorithm described in Haghi et al. (2015). The adopted axisymmetric\nthree-component model potential of the Galaxy includes a spherical bulge, a\nflat Miyamoto--Nagai disk, and a spherical Navarro--Frenk--White dark matter\nhalo.The orbits are integrated backward in time. We compare the orbital\nparameters of globular clusters derived in static and evolving potentials when\nintegrating the orbits for 5 and 12 Gyr backward. For the first time we have\nstudied the influence of separately a change in the masses and a change in the\nsizes of the Galactic components. The changes in the masses and sizes of the\ncomponents are shown to act on the orbital parameters in the opposite way. At\nsmall Galactocentric distances this influence is maximally compensated for. The\norbits of distant globular clusters and those with a large apocenter distance\nundergo the biggest changes.

We performed photometric and spectropolarimetric\nfollow-up observations of this system with CFHT/ESPaDOnS in order to\ninvestigate its variability over several rotational periods. We derive a 4.38\nday period from the K2 light curve. This period is also seen in the radial\nvelocity variations, ascribed to spot modulation. The narrow component of the\nHe I 5876 {\\AA} line as well as the red wing of the H{\\beta} and H{\\gamma} line\nprofiles also vary in intensity with the same periodicity. The former traces\nthe accretion shock at the stellar surface, and the latter is a signature of an\naccretion funnel flow crossing the line of sight. We derive a surface\nbrightness and magnetic field topology from the modeling of Stokes I and V\nprofiles, respectively, for photospheric lines and for the He I line. This\nreveals a bright spot at the stellar surface, located at a latitude of 60 deg,\nand a maximum field strength of about 2 kG. The magnetic field topology at the\nstellar surface is dominated by a dipolar component inclined by about 40 deg\nonto the spin axis. Despite of its clear and stable dipper behavior, we derive\na relatively low inclination of about 50 deg for this system, which calls\nquestion the origin of the dips. This low inclination is also consistent with\nthe absence of deep inverse P Cygni components in the line profiles. We\nconclude that magnetospheric accretion is ongoing in V807 Tau, taking place\nthrough non-axisymmetric accretion funnel flows controlled by a strong, tilted,\nand mainly dipolar magnetic topology. Whether an inner disk warp resulting from\nthis process can account for the dipper character of this source remains to be\nseen, given the low inclination of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 08:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

To improve the usability of pruning, many auto\npruning methods have been developed. Recently, Bayesian optimization (BO) has\nbeen considered to be a competitive algorithm for auto pruning due to its solid\ntheoretical foundation and high sampling efficiency. However, BO suffers from\nthe curse of dimensionality. The performance of BO deteriorates when pruning\ndeep CNNs, since the dimension of the design spaces increase. We propose a\nnovel clustering algorithm that reduces the dimension of the design space to\nspeed up the searching process. Subsequently, a rollback algorithm is proposed\nto recover the high-dimensional design space so that higher pruning accuracy\ncan be obtained. We validate our proposed method on ResNet, MobileNetV1, and\nMobileNetV2 models. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly\nimproves the convergence rate of BO when pruning deep CNNs with no increase in\nrunning time.

In their simplest implementation, an external agent switches on, for a\ngiven time, the interaction between the system and a specimen from the\nreservoir. Generically, in this operation the external agent performs work onto\nthe system, preventing thermalization when the reservoir is at equilibrium. One\ncan recover thermalization by considering an autonomous global setup where the\nreservoir particles colliding with the system possess a kinetic degree of\nfreedom. The drawback is that the corresponding scattering problem is rather\ninvolved. Here, we present a formal solution of the problem in one dimension\nand for flat interaction potentials. The solution is based on the transfer\nmatrix formalism and allows one to explore the symmetries of the resulting\nscattering map. One of these symmetries is micro-reversibility, which is a\ncondition for thermalization. We then introduce two approximations of the\nscattering map that preserve these symmetries and, consequently, thermalize the\nsystem. These relatively simple approximate solutions constitute models of\nquantum thermostats and are useful tools to study quantum systems in contact\nwith thermal baths. We illustrate their accuracy in a specific example, showing\nthat both are good approximations of the exact scattering problem even in\nsituations far from equilibrium. Moreover, one of the models consists of the\nremoval of certain coherences plus a very specific randomization of the\ninteraction time. These two features allow one to identify as heat the energy\ntransfer due to switching on and off the interaction. Our results prompt the\nfundamental question of how to distinguish between heat and work from the\nstatistical properties of the exchange of energy between a system and its\nsurroundings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 09:46:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 17:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

This\nis usually considered as an auxiliary integral regulator to be removed after\nperforming computations by sending it to infinity. In this paper, we analyse\nthe dependence of the classical and quantum theory of homogeneous, isotropic\nand spatially flat cosmology on this fiducial cell. We show that each fixed\n$V_o$ regularisation leads to a different canonically independent theory. At\nthe classical level, the dynamics of observables is not affected by the\nregularisation choice on-shell. For the quantum theory, however, this leads to\na family of regulator dependent quantum representations labelled by $V_o$ and\nthe limit $V_o\\to\\infty$ becomes then more subtle. First, we construct a novel\nisomorphism between different $V_o$-regularisations, which allows us to\nidentify states in the different $V_o$-labelled Hilbert spaces to ensure\nequivalent dynamics for any value of the regulator. The $V_o \\rightarrow\n\\infty$ limit would then correspond to choosing a state for which the volume\nassigned to the fiducial cell becomes infinite. As second main result of our\nanalysis, by looking at observables respectively smeared over the fiducial cell\n$V_o$ and subregions $V$, we find that quantum fluctuations of the latter\nexplicitly depend on the size of the fiducial cell. Physically relevant\nfluctuations for a finite region, as e.g. in the early time regime, would then\nbe unreasonably suppressed in the limit where the volume of the fiducial cell\nbecomes infinite. Our results suggest that the fiducial cell is not playing the\nrole of a mere regularisation but is physically relevant at the quantum level\nand complement previous statements in the literature based on different\narguments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 11:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

The main terms of the shape functionals we consider are either E f\n($\\Omega$), the Dirichlet energy of the Laplacian in the domain $\\Omega$, or\n$\\lambda$ 1 ($\\Omega$), the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet-Laplacian.\nUsually, one considers minimization of such functionals (often with measure\nconstraint), as for example for the famous Saint-Venant and Faber-Krahn\ninequalities. By adding the convexity constraint (and possibly other\nconstraints to ensure existence of an optimal shape) one allows to consider the\nrather unusual and difficult question of maximizing these functionals. This\npaper follows a series of papers by the authors, where the leading idea is that\na certain concavity property of the shape functional that is minimized leads\noptimal shapes to locally saturate the convexity constraint, which\ngeometrically means that they are polygonal. In these previous papers, the\nleading term in the shape functional usually was the opposite of the perimeter,\nfor which the aforementioned concavity property was rather easy to obtain\nthrough computations of its second order shape derivative. By carrying\nclassical shape calculus, a similar concavity property can be observed for the\nopposite of E f or $\\lambda$ 1 , for shapes that are smooth and convex. The\nmain novelty in the present paper is indeed the proof of a weak convexity\nproperty of E f and $\\lambda$ 1 when it is only known that the shape is planar\nand convex, which means we have to consider rather non-smooth shapes.

They model, however, only pairwise\nrelations between nodes and are not designed for encoding the higher-order\nrelations. This drawback is mitigated by hypergraphs, in which an edge can\nconnect an arbitrary number of nodes. Most hypergraph learning approaches\nconvert the hypergraph structure to that of a graph and then deploy existing\ngeometric deep learning methods. This transformation leads to information loss,\nand sub-optimal exploitation of the hypergraph's expressive power. We present\nHyperMSG, a novel hypergraph learning framework that uses a modular two-level\nneural message passing strategy to accurately and efficiently propagate\ninformation within each hyperedge and across the hyperedges. HyperMSG adapts to\nthe data and task by learning an attention weight associated with each node's\ndegree centrality. Such a mechanism quantifies both local and global importance\nof a node, capturing the structural properties of a hypergraph. HyperMSG is\ninductive, allowing inference on previously unseen nodes. Further, it is robust\nand outperforms state-of-the-art hypergraph learning methods on a wide range of\ntasks and datasets.

Our main analysis considers the\nrelationship between the order of the voxels sorted according to their\nepistemic uncertainty values and the misclassification of the prediction. Under\nthis consideration, the comparison of combined uncertainty maps reveals that\nthe multi-class entropy and the multi-class mutual information statistically\nout-perform the other combined uncertainty maps under study. In a\nclass-specific scenario, the one-versus-all entropy statistically out-performs\nthe class-wise entropy, the class-wise variance and the one versus all mutual\ninformation. The class-wise entropy statistically out-performs the other\nclass-specific uncertainty maps in terms of calibration. We made a python\npackage available to reproduce our analysis on different data and tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 12:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

We demonstrate here that the efficient\ninclusion of static modes in the RSE results in its quick convergence to the\nexact solution regardless of the static mode set used. We then apply the RSE to\nspherically symmetric systems with continuous radial variations of the\npermittivity. We show that in TM polarization, the spectral transition from\nwhispering gallery to Fabry-Perot modes is characterized by a peak in the mode\nlosses and an additional mode as compared to TE polarization. Both features are\nexplained quantitatively by the Brewster angle of the surface reflection which\noccurs in this frequency range. Eliminating the discontinuity at the sphere\nsurface by using linear or quadratic profiles of the permittivity modifies this\npeak and increases the Fabry-Perot mode losses, in qualitative agreement with a\nreduced surface reflectivity. These profiles also provide a nearly parabolic\nconfinement for the whispering gallery modes, for which an analytical\napproximation using the Morse potential is presented. Both profiles result in a\nreduced TE-TM splitting, which is shown to be further suppressed by choosing a\nprofile radially extending the mode fields. Based on the concepts of ray\noptics, phase analysis of the secular equation, and effective\nquantum-mechanical potential for a wave equation, we have further developed a\nnumber of useful approximations which shed light on the physical phenomena\nobserved in the spectra of graded-index systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 13:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

Among the various types of aerial robots, blimps are very well suited to\nperform long-duration tasks while being energy efficient, relatively silent and\nsafe. To address the blimp navigation and control task, in our recent work, we\nhave developed a software-in-the-loop simulation and a PID-based controller for\nlarge blimps in the presence of wind disturbance. However, blimps have a\ndeformable structure and their dynamics are inherently non-linear and\ntime-delayed, often resulting in large trajectory tracking errors. Moreover,\nthe buoyancy of a blimp is constantly changing due to changes in the ambient\ntemperature and pressure. In the present paper, we explore a deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) approach to address these issues.

In this article, we report the coexistence of\nantiferromagnetic order and spin glass behaviors in a quasi-one-dimensional\niron telluride TaFe$_{1+x}$Te$_3$ ($x$=0.25). Its antiferromagnetism is\nbelieved to arise from the antiferromagnetic interchain coupling between the\nferromagnetically aligned FeTe chains along the $b$-axis, while the spin glassy\nstate stems from the disordered Fe interstitials. This dichotomic role of chain\nand interstitial sublattices is responsible for the large exchange bias\nobserved at low temperatures, with the interstitial Fe acting as the\nuncompensated moment and its neighboring Fe chain providing the source for its\npinning. This iron-based telluride may thereby represent a new paradigm to\nstudy the large family of transition metal chalcogenides whose magnetic order\nor even the dimensionality can be tuned to a large extent, forming a fertile\nplayground to manipulate or switch the spin degrees of freedom thereof.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 13:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

Thus, reliably predicting such\nmanoeuvre in advance is critical for the safe and comfortable operation of\nautomated driving systems.

Furthermore, most of the previous works do not estimate the key\ntimings of the manoeuvre (e.g., crossing time), which can actually yield more\nuseful information for the decision making in the ego vehicle. To address these\nshortcomings, this paper proposes a novel multi-task model to simultaneously\nestimate the likelihood of LC manoeuvres and the time-to-lane-change (TTLC). In\nboth tasks, an attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is used as a\nshared feature extractor from a bird's eye view representation of the driving\nenvironment. The spatial attention used in the CNN model improves the feature\nextraction process by focusing on the most relevant areas of the surrounding\nenvironment.

This\npaper proposes a decentralised reciprocal collision-avoidance algorithm, which\nis based on stigmergy and scalable. The algorithm is computationally\ninexpensive, based on the gradient of the locally measured dynamic cumulative\nsignal strength field which results from the signals emitted by the swarm. The\nsignal strength acts as a repulsor on each drone, which then tends to steer\naway from the noisiest regions (cluttered environment), thus avoiding\ncollisions. The magnitudes of these repulsive forces can be tuned to control\nthe relative importance assigned to collision avoidance with respect to the\nother phenomena affecting the agent's dynamics. We carried out numerical\nexperiments on a self-organising swarm of drones aimed at fighting wildfires\nautonomously. As expected, it has been found that the collision rate can be\nreduced either by decreasing the cruise speed of the agents and/or by\nincreasing the sampling frequency of the global signal strength field. A\nconvenient by-product of the proposed collision-avoidance algorithm is that it\nhelps maintain diversity in the swarm, thus enhancing exploration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 14:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

In asteroseismology the pulsation mode frequencies of a star are the\nfundamental data that are compared to theoretical predictions to determine a\nstar's interior physics.

Aims. We aim to quantify the impact of various choices\nmade throughout the observational aspects of extracting pulsation mode\nfrequencies in main sequence stars with gravity modes. Methods. We use a\nwell-studied benchmark slowly pulsating B star, KIC 7760680, to investigate the\nsensitivity of forward asteroseismic modelling to various sources of\nobservational uncertainty that affect the precision of the input pulsation mode\nfrequencies. Results. We quantify the impact of the propagation of the\nobservational uncertainties involved in forward asteroseismic modelling.

However, generating exhaustive and\naccurate annotations is labor-intensive, challenging, and costly. Drawing only\ncoarse and approximate annotations is a much easier task, less costly, and it\nalleviates pathologists' workload. In this paper, we study the problem of\nrefining these approximate annotations in digital pathology to obtain more\naccurate ones. Some previous works have explored obtaining machine learning\nmodels from these inaccurate annotations, but few of them tackle the refinement\nproblem where the mislabeled regions should be explicitly identified and\ncorrected, and all of them require a -- often very large -- number of training\nsamples.

In a chemical space of ABX$_{3}$ perovskites with a selected set of\noptions for A, B, and X atoms, pseudo-cubic structures of compounds with B-site\nmixing are simulated using density functional theory (DFT) and several\nproperties are computed, including stability, lattice constant, band gap,\nvacancy formation energy, refractive index, and optical absorption spectrum,\nusing both semi-local and hybrid functionals. Neural networks (NN) are used to\ntrain predictive models for every property using tabulated elemental properties\nof A, B, and X site atoms as descriptors. Starting from the DFT dataset of 229\npoints, we use the trained NN models to predict the structural, energetic,\nelectronic and optical properties of a complete dataset of 17,955 compounds,\nand perform high-throughput screening in terms of stability, band gap and\ndefect tolerance, to obtain 574 promising compounds that are ranked as\npotential absorbers according to their photovoltaic figure of merit.\nCompositional trends in the screened set of attractive mixed cation halide\nperovskites are revealed and additional computations are performed on selected\ncompounds.

In this work, we propose a\ndual-branch architecture, where the upper branch (teacher) receives strong\nannotations, while the bottom one (student) is driven by limited supervision\nand guided by the upper branch. Combined with a standard cross-entropy loss\nover the labeled pixels, our novel formulation integrates two important terms:\n(i) a Shannon entropy loss defined over the less-supervised images, which\nencourages confident student predictions in the bottom branch; and (ii) a KL\ndivergence term, which transfers the knowledge (i.e., predictions) of the\nstrongly supervised branch to the less-supervised branch and guides the entropy\n(student-confidence) term to avoid trivial solutions. We show that the synergy\nbetween the entropy and KL divergence yields substantial improvements in\nperformance.

Many of these and other data-driven policies, especially in the realm\nof public policy, are based on known, deterministic rules to ensure their\ntransparency and interpretability. For example, algorithmic pre-trial risk\nassessments, which serve as our motivating application, provide relatively\nsimple, deterministic classification scores and recommendations to help judges\nmake release decisions. How can we use the data based on existing deterministic\npolicies to learn new and better policies? Unfortunately, prior methods for\npolicy learning are not applicable because they require existing policies to be\nstochastic rather than deterministic. We develop a robust optimization approach\nthat partially identifies the expected utility of a policy, and then finds an\noptimal policy by minimizing the worst-case regret. The resulting policy is\nconservative but has a statistical safety guarantee, allowing the policy-maker\nto limit the probability of producing a worse outcome than the existing policy.\nWe extend this approach to common and important settings where humans make\ndecisions with the aid of algorithmic recommendations. Lastly, we apply the\nproposed methodology to a unique field experiment on pre-trial risk assessment\ninstruments. We derive new classification and recommendation rules that retain\nthe transparency and interpretability of the existing instrument while\npotentially leading to better overall outcomes at a lower cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 00:52:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 16:45:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 21:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}
