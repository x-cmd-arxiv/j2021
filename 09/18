The inherent optoelectronic noises, however, make\nthe photonic systems error-prone in practice. It is thus imperative to devise\nstrategies to mitigate and, if possible, harness noises in photonic computing\nsystems. Here, we demonstrate a photonic generative network as a part of a\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN). This network is implemented with a\nphotonic core consisting of an array of four programable phase-change memory\ncells to perform 4-elements vector-vector dot multiplication. We demonstrate\nthat the GAN can generate a handwritten number (\"7\") in experiments and full\nten digits in simulation. We realize an optical random number generator derived\nfrom the amplified spontaneous emission noise, apply noise-aware training by\ninjecting additional noise and demonstrate the network's resilience to hardware\nnon-idealities.

In general, fuzzing provides various\ninputs to the target program to discover unhandled exceptions and crashes. In\nbusiness sectors where the time budget is limited, software vendors often\nlaunch many fuzzing instances in parallel as common means of increasing code\ncoverage. However, most of the popular fuzzing tools in their parallel\nmode-naively run multiple instances concurrently, without elaborate\ndistribution of workload. This can lead different instances to explore\noverlapped code regions, eventually reducing the benefits of concurrency. In\nthis paper, we propose a general model to describe parallel fuzzing. This model\ndistributes mutually-exclusive but similarly-weighted tasks to different\ninstances, facilitating concurrency and also fairness across instances.\nFollowing this model, we develop a solution, called AFL-EDGE, to improve the\nparallel mode of AFL, considering a round of mutations to a unique seed as a\ntask and adopting edge coverage to define the uniqueness of a seed. We have\nimplemented AFL-EDGE on top of AFL and evaluated the implementation with AFL on\n9 widely used benchmark programs. It shows that AFL-EDGE can benefit the edge\ncoverage of AFL. In a 24-hour test, the increase of edge coverage brought by\nAFL-EDGE to AFL ranges from 9.49% to 10.20%, depending on the number of\ninstances.

Therefore State\nRepresentation Learning (SRL) is proposed to specifically learn to encode\ntask-relevant features from complex sensory data into low-dimensional states.\nHowever, the pervasive implementation of SRL is usually conducted by a\ndecoupling strategy in which the observation-state mapping is learned\nseparately, which is prone to over-fit. To handle such problem, we present a\nnew algorithm called Policy Optimization via Abstract Representation which\nintegrates SRL into the original RL scale. Firstly, We engage RL loss to assist\nin updating SRL model so that the states can evolve to meet the demand of\nreinforcement learning and maintain a good physical interpretation. Secondly,\nwe introduce a dynamic parameter adjustment mechanism so that both models can\nefficiently adapt to each other. Thirdly, we introduce a new prior called\ndomain resemblance to leverage expert demonstration to train the SRL model.\nFinally, we provide a real-time access by state graph to monitor the course of\nlearning. Results show that our algorithm outperforms the PPO baselines and\ndecoupling strategies in terms of sample efficiency and final rewards. Thus our\nmodel can efficiently deal with tasks in high dimensions and facilitate\ntraining real-life robots directly from scratch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 16:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

We first analyze how the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in a pure\nmetric approach describes the quantum Universe, showing how the singularity is\nnot removed.

In the second part of the review we consider the\nisotropic Universe and the Bianchi models in the framework of polymer quantum\nmechanics. We first address the polymerization in terms of the\nAshtekar-Barbero-Immirzi connection and show how the resulting dynamics is\nisomorphic to the $\\mu_0$.

Finally, we consider the polymer\nquantum dynamics of the homogeneous and inhomogeneous Mixmaster model through a\nmetric approach. We compare the results obtained by using the volume variable\nto the standard Misner variable. In the latter case we find a cosmology that is\nstill singular, and its chaotic properties depend on the ratio between the\nlattice steps for the isotropic and anisotropic variables. We conclude the\nreview with some considerations on changing variables in the polymer\nrepresentation.

Here we aim to reduce\nthe costs of Transformers by searching for a more efficient variant. Compared\nto previous approaches, our search is performed at a lower level, over the\nprimitives that define a Transformer TensorFlow program. We identify an\narchitecture, named Primer, that has a smaller training cost than the original\nTransformer and other variants for auto-regressive language modeling. Primer's\nimprovements can be mostly attributed to two simple modifications: squaring\nReLU activations and adding a depthwise convolution layer after each Q, K, and\nV projection in self-attention.\n  Experiments show Primer's gains over Transformer increase as compute scale\ngrows and follow a power law with respect to quality at optimal model sizes. We\nalso verify empirically that Primer can be dropped into different codebases to\nsignificantly speed up training without additional tuning. For example, at a\n500M parameter size, Primer improves the original T5 architecture on C4\nauto-regressive language modeling, reducing the training cost by 4X.\nFurthermore, the reduced training cost means Primer needs much less compute to\nreach a target one-shot performance.

Specifically, we find that the primary challenge under this\nsetting is learning localization -- when stripped of idealized localization,\nagents fail to stop precisely at the goal despite reliably making progress\ntowards it. To address this we introduce a set of auxiliary losses to help the\nagent learn localization. Further, we explore the idea of treating the precise\nlocation of the agent as privileged information -- it is unavailable during\ntest time, however, it is available during training time in simulation. We\ngrant the agent restricted access to ground-truth localization readings during\ntraining via an information bottleneck. Under this setting, the agent incurs a\npenalty for using this privileged information, encouraging the agent to only\nleverage this information when it is crucial to learning.

The\nanomalous Nernst effect emerges from an ordinary quasiparticle background below\na temperature of 80K, far above T$_\\text{c}$ = 20K. At the lowest fields and\nclose to T$_\\text{c}$, the scaling of the effect is captured by a model based\non Gaussian fluctuations. The temperature up to which we observe fluctuations\nis exceptionally high for a three-dimensional isotropic system, where\nfluctuation effects are usually suppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 17:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

An efficient segmentation of brain Magnetic Resonance\nImages (MRIs) is of prime concern to radiologists due to their poor\nillumination and other conditions related to de acquisition of the images.\nThresholding is a popular method for segmentation that uses the histogram of an\nimage to label different homogeneous groups of pixels into different classes.\nHowever, the computational cost increases exponentially according to the number\nof thresholds.

The dual classical code is constructed from spacetime patterns\nof out-of-time ordered correlation functions among local operators and measured\nPauli operators in the past, suggesting that the volume-law entanglement in a\nmonitored circuit emerges from quantum information scrambling, namely the\ngrowth of local operators.

Following this, we show\nthat quantum cosmological considerations can drastically change the above\nscenario.

There is an urgent need to come up with\nefficient anti-cocaine addiction drugs. Unfortunately, no medications have been\napproved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), despite the extensive\neffort in the past few decades. The main challenge is the intricate molecular\nmechanisms of cocaine addiction, involving synergistic interactions among\nproteins upstream and downstream of dopamine transporter (DAT) functions\nimpacted by cocaine. However, traditional in vivo or in vitro experiments can\nnot address the roles of so many proteins, highlighting the need for innovative\nstrategies in the field. We propose a proteome-informed machine learning/deep\nlearning (ML/DL) platform to discover nearly optimal anti-cocaine addiction\nlead compounds. We construct and analyze proteomic protein-protein interaction\n(PPI) networks for cocaine dependence to identify 141 involved drug targets and\nrepresent over 60,000 associated drug candidates or experimental drugs in the\nlatent space using an autoencoder (EA) model trained from over 104 million\nmolecules. We build 32 ML models for cross-target analysis of these drug\ncandidates for side effects and repurposing potential. We further screen the\nabsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET)\nproperties of these candidates. Our platform reveals that essentially all of\nthe existing drug candidates, including dozens of experimental drugs, fail to\npass our cross-target and ADMET screenings. Nonetheless, we have identified two\nnearly optimal leads for further optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 18:58:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

On\nthis paper we focus on the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) Allgather many to\nmany collective, which is amongst the most called and time-consuming\noperations. Each MPI algorithm for this call suffers from different operational\nand performance limitations, that might include only working for restricted\ncases, requiring linear amounts of communication steps with the growth in\nnumber of processes, memory copies and shifts to assure correct data\norganization, and non-local data exchange patterns, most of which negatively\ncontribute to the total operation time. All these characteristics create an\nenvironment where there is no algorithm which is the best for all cases and\nthis consequently implies that careful choices of alternatives must be made to\nexecute the call. Considering such aspects, we propose the Stripe Parallel\nBinomial Trees (Sparbit) algorithm, which has optimal latency and bandwidth\ntime costs with no usage restrictions. It also maintains a much more local\ncommunication pattern that minimizes the delays due to long range exchanges,\nallowing the extraction of more performance from current systems when compared\nwith asymptotically equivalent alternatives.

In particular, it remains unclear\nwhether or not plate tectonics and an active carbonate-silicate cycle were\npresent. In the presence of liquid water but without plate tectonics,\nweathering would have been limited to freshly produced basaltic crust, with an\nearly carbon cycle restricted to the crust and atmosphere. With the evaporation\nof surface water, weathering would cease. With ongoing volcanism, carbonate\nsediments would be buried and sink downwards. Thereby, carbonates would heat up\nuntil they become unstable and the crust would become depleted in carbonates.\nWith CO$_2$ supply to the atmosphere the surface temperature rises further, the\ndepth below which decarbonation occurs decreases, causing the release of even\nmore CO$_2$.\n  We assess the habitable period of an early stagnant-lid Venus by employing a\ncoupled interior-atmosphere evolution model accounting for CO$_2$ degassing,\nweathering, carbonate burial, and crustal decarbonation. We find that if\ninitial surface conditions allow for liquid water, weathering can keep the\nplanet habitable for up to 900 Myr, followed by evaporation of water and rapid\ncrustal carbonate depletion. For the atmospheric CO$_2$ of stagnant-lid\nexoplanets, we predict a bimodal distribution, depending on whether or not\nthese planets experienced a runaway greenhouse in their history. Planets with\nhigh atmospheric CO$_2$ could be associated with crustal carbonate depletion as\na consequence of a runaway greenhouse, whereas planets with low atmospheric\nCO$_2$ would indicate active silicate weathering and thereby a habitable\nclimate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 20:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

As these HDR images cannot be\ndisplayed on standard display devices, the real challenge comes while\nconverting these HDR images to Low dynamic range (LDR) images. The conversion\nof HDR image to LDR image is performed using Tone-mapped operators (TMOs). This\nconversion results in the loss of much valuable information in structure,\ncolor, naturalness, and exposures. The loss of information in the LDR image may\nnot directly be visible to the human eye. To calculate how good an LDR image is\nafter conversion, various metrics have been proposed previously. Some are not\nnoise resilient, some work on separate color channels (Red, Green, and Blue one\nby one), and some lack capacity to identify the structure.

Specifically, we first develop the architecture for the asymmetrical\ntransceiver where the number of receive RF chains is different from that of the\ntransmit RF chains. Due to this unequal number of RF chains, channel\ninconsistency appears. To overcome the channel inconsistency and thus fully\nharness the system's downlink data transmission capability, we propose two\nuplink-to-downlink channel transfer algorithms. The cost and power consumption\nmodels for the asymmetrical transceiver are also developed and the uplink\nsignal-to-noise loss due to the channel inconsistency is investigated. Through\nanalyzing system spectral, cost, and energy efficiency, we demonstrate that the\nproposed asymmetrical transceiver-based massive MIMO system can achieve\nexcellent downlink spectral efficiency while maintaining a reasonable energy\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 02:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

The\nperformance of the AO system can be significantly hindered if the on-sky spot\nprofile of its sLGS is degraded by the turbulence along the laser launching\nuplink path. One effective method to overcome this problem is to perform\nreal-time pre-correction on the laser before it is launched onto the sky to\ncounter this turbulence effect especially for the lower altitude where\nturbulence is stronger. The by-product Rayleigh backscatter generated by large\nmolecule and aerosols at low altitude when projecting sLGS is a perfect\ncandidate for real time detection of low altitude turbulence. It is therefore\nimportant to evaluate whether this by-product of a sodium laser guide star\ncould achieve suitable performance for wavefront sensing. In this paper, we\nattempt to answer the question regarding to the achievable photon return of\nsuch Rayleigh backscattered plume. A comparison between results from our field\ntest and theoretical model of MSISE-90 was presented.

In this case, the mismatch may come\nfrom missing physics, oversimplified or inaccurate model recipes, or\ninappropriate methods of extracting basic astrophysical quantities from\nsimulations. The latter is a crucial aspect to consider to avoid misleading\nconclusions when comparing simulations with observations. In this paper, we\nhave applied a new method to produce `observed' galaxies identified in mock\nimaging of hydrodynamical simulations. We generate low-redshift mock galaxies\nfrom the TNG100-1 simulation of IllustrisTNG and analyse them using standard\n`observational' techniques to extract their main structural parameters. We show\nthat our technique can produce realistic surface-brightness distributions of\nthe simulated galaxies, including classical morphological substructures, such\nas spiral arms and bars. In particular, we find a very good agreement of the\ntotal luminosity and stellar mass versus halo mass relationships, and the\ngalaxy stellar mass versus size relationship between mock observations and real\ngalaxies. We also compare the luminosity function and the mass function of the\nmock galaxy sample with literature data and find a good agreement at all\nluminosity and mass scales. In particular, we find no significant tension at\nthe bright end of the galaxy luminosity function, as reported in many analyses\nusing simplified recipes to identify galaxy haloes, which in fact miscount the\ncontribution of the extended galaxy haloes around large galaxies. This\ndemonstrates the critical impact of using observational driven approaches to\nthe simulation analyses to produce realistic predictions to compare to\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 05:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 08:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

However, RGB-IR ReID always demands discriminative features, leading\nto over-rely feature sensitivity of seen classes, \\textit{e.g.}, via\nattention-based feature alignment or metric learning. Therefore, predicting the\nunseen query category from predefined training classes may not be accurate and\nleads to a sub-optimal adversarial gradient.

A backdoored deep hashing model behaves normally on\noriginal query images, while returning the images with the target label when\nthe trigger presents, which makes the attack hard to be detected. In this\npaper, we uncover this security concern by utilizing clean-label data\npoisoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the\nbackdoor attack against deep hashing models.

The decrease\nof the widths of spectral bands leads to a decrease in the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) of measurements. The decreased SNR reduces the reliability of\nmeasured features or information extracted from HSIs. Furthermore, the image\ndegradations linked with various mechanisms also result in different types of\nnoise, such as Gaussian noise, impulse noise, deadlines, and stripes. This\npaper introduces a fast and parameter-free hyperspectral image mixed noise\nremoval method (termed FastHyMix), which characterizes the complex distribution\nof mixed noise by using a Gaussian mixture model and exploits two main\ncharacteristics of hyperspectral data, namely low-rankness in the spectral\ndomain and high correlation in the spatial domain. The Gaussian mixture model\nenables us to make a good estimation of Gaussian noise intensity and the\nlocation of sparse noise. The proposed method takes advantage of the\nlow-rankness using subspace representation and the spatial correlation of HSIs\nby adding a powerful deep image prior, which is extracted from a neural\ndenoising network.

Despite significant\nefforts to understand the dynamics of warped discs, previous work fails to\naddress arguably the most prevalent regime -- nonlinear warps in Keplerian\ndiscs for which there is a resonance between the orbital, epicyclic and\nvertical oscillation frequencies. In this work, we implement a novel nonlinear\nring model, developed recently by Fairbairn and Ogilvie, as a framework for\nunderstanding such resonant warp dynamics. Here we uncover two distinct\nnonlinear regimes as the warp amplitude is increased. Initially we find a\nsmooth modulation theory which describes warp evolution in terms of the\naveraged Lagrangian of the oscillatory vertical motions of the disc. This hints\ntowards the possibility of connecting previous warp theory under a generalised\nsecular framework. Upon the warp amplitude exceeding a critical value, which\nscales as the square root of the aspect-ratio of our ring, the disc enters into\na bouncing regime with extreme vertical compressions twice per orbit. We\ndevelop an impulsive theory which predicts special retrograde and prograde\nprecessing warped solutions, which are identified numerically using our full\nequation set. Such solutions emphasise the essential activation of nonlinear\nvertical oscillations within the disc and may have important implications for\nenergy and warp dissipation. Future work should search for this behaviour in\ndetailed numerical studies of the internal flow structure of warped discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 09:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

Exploring the source of the excess sulfur has been the subject of\nconsiderable interest. Here, from a systematic computational investigation of\nsulfur-oxygen compounds under pressure, a hitherto unknown S3O4 compound\ncontaining a mixture of sulfur oxidation states +II and +IV emerges and is\npredicted to be stabilized above a pressure of 79 GPa. We predict that S3O4 can\nbe produced via multiple redox reactions involving subducted S-bearing minerals\n(e.g., sulfates and sulfides) at high pressure conditions relevant to the deep\nlower mantle, and conversely be decomposed into SO2 and S at shallow depths of\nEarth. Therefore, S3O4 can be considered as a key intermediate compound to\npromote the decomposition of sulfates to release SO2, which offers an\nalternative source of the excess sulfur released during explosive eruptions.\nThese findings provide a possible resolution to the geological paradox of\nexcess sulfur degassing and a viable mechanism for the understanding of S\nexchange between surface and the lower mantle for the deep sulfur cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 09:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

One important aspect is the recognition of the fact\nthat the growth of a population can be subject to an Allee effect, where the\nper capita growth rate increases with the population density. Including an\nAllee effect has been shown to fundamentally change predator-prey dynamics and\nstrongly impact species persistence, but previous studies mostly focused on\nscenarios of an Allee effect in the prey population. Here we explore a\npredator-prey model with an ecologically important case of the Allee effect in\nthe predator population where it occurs in the numerical response of predator\nwithout affecting its functional response. Biologically, this can result from\nvarious scenarios such as a lack of mating partners, sperm limitation and\ncooperative breeding mechanisms, among others. Unlike previous studies, we\nconsider here a generic mathematical formulation of the Allee effect without\nspecifying a concrete parameterisation of the functional form, and analyse the\npossible local bifurcations in the system. Further, we explore the global\nbifurcation structure of the model and its possible dynamical regimes for three\ndifferent concrete parameterisations of the Allee effect. The model possesses a\ncomplex bifurcation structure: there can be multiple coexistence states\nincluding two stable limit cycles. Inclusion of the Allee effect in the\npredator generally has a destabilising effect on the coexistence equilibrium.\nWe also show that regardless of the parametrisation of the Allee effect,\nenrichment of the environment will eventually result in extinction of the\npredator population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 10:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

Our code and data can provide an effective\npipeline to benchmark CQA models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 12:58:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 02:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

During the last decade, matching markets\nhave emerged and grown rapidly through the medium of the Internet. They have\nevolved into a new format, called Online Matching Markets (OMMs), with examples\nranging from crowdsourcing to online recommendations to ridesharing. There are\ntwo features distinguishing OMMs from traditional matching markets. One is the\ndynamic arrival of one side of the market: we refer to these as online agents\nwhile the rest are offline agents. Examples of online and offline agents\ninclude keywords (online) and sponsors (offline) in Google Advertising; workers\n(online) and tasks (offline) in Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT); riders (online)\nand drivers (offline when restricted to a short time window) in ridesharing.\nThe second distinguishing feature of OMMs is the real-time decision-making\nelement. However, studies have shown that the algorithms making decisions in\nthese OMMs leave disparities in the match rates of offline agents. For example,\ntasks in neighborhoods of low socioeconomic status rarely get matched to gig\nworkers, and drivers of certain races/genders get discriminated against in\nmatchmaking. In this paper, we propose online matching algorithms which\noptimize for either individual or group-level fairness among offline agents in\nOMMs. We present two linear-programming (LP) based sampling algorithms, which\nachieve online competitive ratios at least 0.725 for individual fairness\nmaximization (IFM) and 0.719 for group fairness maximization (GFM),\nrespectively.

Existing initialization schemes solve this problem in\nspecific cases by assuming that the network has a certain activation function\nor topology. It is difficult to derive such weight initialization strategies,\nand modern architectures therefore often use these same initialization schemes\neven though their assumptions do not hold. This paper introduces AutoInit, a\nweight initialization algorithm that automatically adapts to different neural\nnetwork architectures. By analytically tracking the mean and variance of\nsignals as they propagate through the network, AutoInit appropriately scales\nthe weights at each layer to avoid exploding or vanishing signals. Experiments\ndemonstrate that AutoInit improves performance of convolutional, residual, and\ntransformer networks across a range of activation function, dropout, weight\ndecay, learning rate, and normalizer settings, and does so more reliably than\ndata-dependent initialization methods. This flexibility allows AutoInit to\ninitialize models for everything from small tabular tasks to large datasets\nsuch as ImageNet. Such generality turns out particularly useful in neural\narchitecture search and in activation function discovery. In these settings,\nAutoInit initializes each candidate appropriately, making performance\nevaluations more accurate.

It is worth noting that the\nproposed methods offer closed-form robust instantaneous CSI-adaptive\nbeamforming designs which can promptly adapt to rapid CSI changes over slots\nand robust quasi-static phase shift designs of low computation and phase\nadjustment costs in the presence of imperfect CSIT and inter-cell interference.\nNumerical results further demonstrate the notable gains of the proposed robust\njoint designs over existing ones and reveal the practical values of the\nproposed solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 02:49:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

The LF\nmodel involves two types of groups--the leader group and the follower group.\nAll leader groups have their target opinion.

A leader group agent has a constant degree\nto its target and mix it with the average opinion of its group neighbors at\neach update. A follower has a constant degree to the average opinion of each\nleader group neighbors and mix it with the average opinion of its group\nneighbors at each update. In this paper, we consider a variant of the LF model,\nnamely the mixed model, in which the degrees can vary over time, the opinions\ncan be high dimensional, and the number of leader groups can be more than two.\nThe LF model can be applied to e-commerce and the mixed model covers it when\nthere is only one confidence threshold.

Do viewers\nunderstand drawings based solely on their ability to resemble the entities they\nrefer to (i.e., as images), or do they understand drawings based on shared but\narbitrary associations with these entities (i.e., as symbols)? In this paper,\nwe provide evidence for a cognitive account of pictorial meaning in which both\nvisual and social information is integrated to support effective visual\ncommunication. To evaluate this account, we used a communication task where\npairs of participants used drawings to repeatedly communicate the identity of a\ntarget object among multiple distractor objects. We manipulated social cues\nacross three experiments and a full internal replication, finding pairs of\nparticipants develop referent-specific and interaction-specific strategies for\ncommunicating more efficiently over time, going beyond what could be explained\nby either task practice or a pure resemblance-based account alone. Using a\ncombination of model-based image analyses and crowdsourced sketch annotations,\nwe further determined that drawings did not drift toward arbitrariness, as\npredicted by a pure convention-based account, but systematically preserved\nthose visual features that were most distinctive of the target object. Taken\ntogether, these findings advance theories of pictorial meaning and have\nimplications for how successful graphical conventions emerge via complex\ninteractions between visual perception, communicative experience, and social\ncontext.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 23:05:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

However, all the MOP-WENO-X schemes bring about the serious deficiency\nthat their resolutions in the region with high-frequency but smooth waves are\ndramatically decreased compared to their associated WENO-X schemes. The purpose\nof this paper is to overcome this drawback. We firstly present the definition\nof the locally order-preserving (LOP) mapping. Then, by using a new proposed\nposteriori adaptive technique, we apply this LOP property to obtain the new\nmappings from those of the WENO-X schemes. The essential idea of the posteriori\nadaptive technique is to identify the global stencil in which the existing\nmappings fail to preserve the LOP property, and then replace the mapped weights\nwith the weights of the classic WENO-JS scheme to recover the LOP property. We\nbuild the resultant mapped WENO schemes and denote them as LOP-WENO-X. The\nnumerical experiments demonstrate that the resolutions in the region with\nhigh-frequency but smooth waves of the LOP-WENO-X schemes are similar or even\nbetter than those of their associated WENO-X schemes and naturally much higher\nthan the MOP-WENO-X schemes. Furthermore, the LOP-WENO-X schemes gain all the\ngreat advantages of the MOP-WENO-X schemes, such as attaining high resolutions\nand in the meantime preventing spurious oscillations near discontinuities when\nsolving the one-dimensional linear advection problems with long output times,\nand significantly reducing the post-shock oscillations in the simulations of\nthe two-dimensional problems with shock waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 13:14:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 12:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

Fortunately, if ASD is\ndiagnosed and treated early, then the patient will have a much higher chance of\ndeveloping normally.
