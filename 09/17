Here, we\nreport on the observation of anomalous Hall effect in nominally non-magnetic\nKTaO3. Anomalous Hall effect emerges in reduced KTaO3 and shows an extrinsic to\nintrinsic crossover. A paramagnetic behavior is observed in reduced samples\nusing first principles calculations and quantitative magnetometry. The observed\nanomalous Hall effect follows the oxygen vacancy-induced magnetization\nresponse, suggesting that the localized magnetic moments of the oxygen\nvacancies scatter conduction electrons asymmetrically and give rise to\nanomalous Hall effect. The anomalous Hall conductivity becomes insensitive to\nscattering rate in the low temperature limit (T<5 K), implying that the Berry\ncurvature of the electrons on the Fermi surface controls the anomalous Hall\neffect. Our observations describe a detailed picture of many-body interactions,\ntriggering anomalous Hall effect in a non-magnetic system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 16:02:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 17:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

In order to find\nthe optimal result within a limited number of checks, a load pickup checklist\ngeneration (LPCG) algorithm is developed to ensure the optimality. Then, the\nfast robust load restoration strategy acquisition is achieved based on the\ndesigned one-line strategy generation (OSG) algorithm. The proposed method\nfinds the optimal result in a model-free way, holds the robustness to handle\nuncertainties, and provides real-time computation. It can completely replace\nconventional robust optimization and supports on-line robust load restoration\nwhich better satisfies the changeable restoration process. The effectiveness of\nthe proposed method is validated using the IEEE 30-bus system and the IEEE\n118-bus system, showing high computational efficiency and considerable\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 16:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

This\npaper describes our work to assist non-profits that employ automated messaging\nprograms to deliver timely preventive care information to beneficiaries (new\nand expecting mothers) during pregnancy and after delivery. Unfortunately, a\nkey challenge in such information delivery programs is that a significant\nfraction of beneficiaries drop out of the program. Yet, non-profits often have\nlimited health-worker resources (time) to place crucial service calls for live\ninteraction with beneficiaries to prevent such engagement drops. To assist\nnon-profits in optimizing this limited resource, we developed a Restless\nMulti-Armed Bandits (RMABs) system. One key technical contribution in this\nsystem is a novel clustering method of offline historical data to infer unknown\nRMAB parameters. Our second major contribution is evaluation of our RMAB system\nin collaboration with an NGO, via a real-world service quality improvement\nstudy. The study compared strategies for optimizing service calls to 23003\nparticipants over a period of 7 weeks to reduce engagement drops. We show that\nthe RMAB group provides statistically significant improvement over other\ncomparison groups, reducing ~ 30% engagement drops. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the utility of RMABs in real\nworld public health settings.

The strong decay $D^*\\to D\\pi$ serves as\na benchmark, as it is the only physical open-charm observable that can be\nrelated to the effective Lagrangian's couplings.

When dealing with large networks\nof oscillators, the control over the chirality of the bulk states becomes\nsignificantly more complicated and requires complex apparatus for generating\nasymmetric coupling or artificial gauge fields. Here we present a new approach\nfor precise control over the chirality of a triangular array of hundreds of\nsymmetrically-coupled lasers, by introducing a weak non-Hermitian complex\npotential, requiring only local on-site control of loss and frequency. In the\nunperturbed network, lasing states with opposite chirality (staggered vortex\nand staggered anti-vortex) are equally probable. We show that by tuning the\ncomplex potential to an exceptional point, a nearly pure chiral lasing state is\nachieved. While our approach is applicable to any oscillators network, we\ndemonstrate how the inherent non-linearity of the lasers effectively pulls the\nnetwork to the exceptional point, making the chirality extremely resilient\nagainst noises and imperfections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 16:19:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 10:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

The main objective of this\npaper is to systematically review primary studies that have investigated the\neffects of various human aspects on RE. A systematic literature review (SLR)\nwas conducted and identified 474 initial primary research studies. These were\neventually filtered down to 74 relevant, high-quality primary studies. Among\nthe studies, the effects of communication have been considered in many RE\nstudies. Other human aspects such as personality, motivation and gender have\nmainly been investigated to date related to SE studies including RE as one\nphase. Findings show that studying more than one human aspect together is\nbeneficial, as this reveals relationships between various human aspects and how\nthey together impact the RE process. However, the majority of these studied\ncombinations of human aspects are unique. From 56.8% of studies that identified\nthe effects of human aspects on RE, 40.5% identified the positive impact, 30.9%\nnegative, 26.2% identified both impacts whereas 2.3% mentioned that there was\nno impact. This implies that a variety of human aspects positively or\nnegatively affects the RE process and a well-defined theoretical analysis on\nthe effects of different human aspects on RE remains to be defined and\npractically evaluated. Findings of this SLR help researchers who are\ninvestigating the impact of various human aspects on RE by identifying\nwell-studied research areas, and highlight new areas that should be focused on\nin future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 16:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

We begin with a review of recent work by several authors on\nthe classical generation of integrable sigma models from four dimensional\nChern-Simons theory. This approach involves introducing classes of\ntwo-dimensional defects into the bulk on which the gauge field must satisfy\ncertain boundary conditions. One finds integrable sigma models from\nfour-dimensional Chern-Simons theory by substituting the solutions to its\nequations of motion back into the action. The integrability of these sigma\nmodels is guaranteed because the gauge field is gauge equivalent to the Lax\nconnection of the sigma model. By considering a theory with two\nfour-dimensional Chern-Simons fields coupled together on two-dimensional\nsurfaces in the bulk we are able to introduce new classes of `gauged' defects.\nBy solving the bulk equations of motion we find a unified action for a set of\ngenus zero integrable gauged sigma models.

Objective SQA methods that rely on the availability of the\ncorresponding clean reference have been the primary go-to approaches for SQA.\nClearly, these methods fail in real-world scenarios where the ground truth\nclean references are not available. In recent years, non-intrusive methods that\ntrain neural networks to predict ratings or scores have attracted much\nattention, but they suffer from several shortcomings such as lack of\nrobustness, reliance on labeled data for training and so on. In this work, we\npropose a new direction for speech quality assessment. Inspired by human's\ninnate ability to compare and assess the quality of speech signals even when\nthey have non-matching contents, we propose a novel framework that predicts a\nsubjective relative quality score for the given speech signal with respect to\nany provided reference without using any subjective data. We show that neural\nnetworks trained using our framework produce scores that correlate well with\nsubjective mean opinion scores (MOS) and are also competitive to methods such\nas DNSMOS, which explicitly relies on MOS from humans for training networks.\nMoreover, our method also provides a natural way to embed quality-related\ninformation in neural networks, which we show is helpful for downstream tasks\nsuch as speech enhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 17:27:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 17:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

Consequently, the study of decentralized\nlearning dynamics that guarantee convergence to correlated solution concepts in\nmultiplayer, general-sum extensive-form (i.e., tree-form) games has become an\nimportant topic of active research. The per-iteration complexity of the\ncurrently known learning dynamics depends on the specific correlated solution\nconcept considered. For example, in the case of extensive-form correlated\nequilibrium (EFCE), all known dynamics require, as an intermediate step at each\niteration, to compute the stationary distribution of multiple Markov chains, an\nexpensive operation in practice. Oppositely, in the case of normal-form coarse\ncorrelated equilibrium (NFCCE), simple no-external-regret learning dynamics\nthat amount to a linear-time traversal of the tree-form decision space of each\nagent suffice to guarantee convergence. This paper focuses on extensive-form\ncoarse correlated equilibrium (EFCCE), an intermediate solution concept that is\na subset of NFCCE and a superset of EFCE. Being a superset of EFCE, any\nlearning dynamics for EFCE automatically guarantees convergence to EFCCE.\nHowever, since EFCCE is a simpler solution concept, this begs the question: do\nlearning dynamics for EFCCE that avoid the expensive computation of stationary\ndistributions exist? This paper answers the previous question in the positive.\nOur learning dynamics only require the orchestration of no-external-regret\nminimizers, thus showing that EFCCE is more akin to NFCCE than to EFCE from a\nlearning perspective. Our dynamics guarantees that the empirical frequency of\nplay after $T$ iteration is a $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$-approximate EFCCE with high\nprobability, and an EFCCE almost surely in the limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 17:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

For\nsuch extreme finite source effect (EFSE) events, finite source effects dominate\nthroughout the duration of the event. Here, we demonstrate and explore a\ncontinuous degeneracy between multiple parameters of such EFSE events. The\nfirst component in the degeneracy arises from the fact that the\ndirectly-observable peak change of the flux depends on both the ratio of the\nangular source radius to the angular Einstein ring radius and the fraction of\nthe baseline flux that is attributable to the lensed source star. The second\ncomponent arises because the directly-observable duration of the event depends\non both the impact parameter of the event and the relative lens-source proper\nmotion. These two pairwise degeneracies become coupled when the detailed\nmorphology of the light curve is considered, especially when including a\nlimb-darkening profile of the source star. We derive these degeneracies\nmathematically through analytic approximations and investigate them further\nnumerically with no approximations. We explore the likely physical situations\nin which these mathematical degeneracies may be realized and potentially\nbroken. As more and more low-mass lensing events (with ever decreasing Einstein\nring radii) are detected with improving precision and increasing cadence from\nmicrolensing surveys, one can expect that more of these EFSE events will be\ndiscovered.

Cosmic rays (CRs) play an important role in the chemistry and\ndynamics of the interstellar medium.

The algorithm presents a genuine quantum\ncounterpart to decoding based on the classical belief propagation algorithm,\nwhich has found wide success in classical coding theory when used in\nconjunction with LDPC or Turbo codes.

Conventional approximation\napproaches factorize the square matrix into a number matrices of much lower\nranks. However, the low-rank constraint is a performance bottleneck if the\napproximated matrix is intrinsically high-rank or close to full rank. In this\npaper, we propose to approximate a large square matrix with a product of sparse\nfull-rank matrices. In the approximation, our method needs only $N(\\log N)^2$\nnon-zero numbers for an $N\\times N$ full matrix. We present both non-parametric\nand parametric ways to find the factorization. In the former, we learn the\nfactorizing matrices directly, and in the latter, we train neural networks to\nmap input data to the non-zero matrix entries. The sparse factorization method\nis tested for a variety of synthetic and real-world square matrices. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method gives a better approximation\nwhen the approximated matrix is sparse and high-rank. Based on this finding, we\nuse our parametric method as a scalable attention architecture that performs\nstrongly in learning tasks for long sequential data and defeats Transformer and\nits several variants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 18:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

Recently, explorations in\ndevising such systems either take approaches that rely on semantic guarantees\nlike $k$-anonymity -- which can be easily subverted when combining with\nalternative information, and do not take into account the possibility that even\nknowledge of such clusters is privacy-invasive in themselves. Other approaches\nprovide full privacy by moving all data and processing logic to clients -- but\nwhich is prohibitively expensive for both clients and servers. In this work, we\ndevise a new framework called PrivateFetch for building practical ad-delivery\npipelines that rely on cryptographic hardness and best-case privacy, rather\nthan syntactic privacy guarantees or reliance on real-world anonymization\ntools. PrivateFetch utilizes local computation of preferences followed by\nhigh-performance single-server private information retrieval (PIR) to ensure\nthat clients can pre-fetch ad content from servers, without revealing any of\ntheir inherent characteristics to the content provider.

A subset of these systems, autophoretic droplet swimmers that\nmove as a result of Marangoni stresses, have additionally been shown to respond\nto local, self-produced chemical gradients that can mediate self-avoidance or\nself-attraction. Via this mechanism, we present a mathematical model\nconstructed to encode experimentally observed self-avoidant memory and\nnumerically study the effect of this particular memory on the enhanced\ndiffusion of such swimming droplets.

To meet the\nreal-time requirement, existing research proposed to apply the\nconnected-component-labeling (CCL) technique on LiDAR spherical range image\nwith a heuristic condition to check if two neighbor points are connected.\nHowever, LiDAR range image is different from a binary image which has a\ndeterministic condition to tell if two pixels belong to the same component. The\nheuristic condition used on the LiDAR range image only works empirically, which\nsuggests the LiDAR clustering algorithm should be robust to potential failures\nof the empirical heuristic condition. To overcome this challenge, this paper\nproposes a divide-and-merge LiDAR clustering algorithm. This algorithm firstly\nconducts clustering in each evenly divided local region, then merges the local\nclustered small components by voting on edge point pairs. Assuming there are\n$N$ LiDAR points of objects in total with $m$ divided local regions, the time\ncomplexity of the proposed algorithm is $O(N)+O(m^2)$. A smaller $m$ means the\nvoting will involve more neighbor points, but the time complexity will become\nlarger. So the $m$ controls the trade-off between the time complexity and the\nclustering accuracy. A proper $m$ helps the proposed algorithm work in\nreal-time as well as maintain good performance. We evaluate the\ndivide-and-merge clustering algorithm on the SemanticKITTI panoptic\nsegmentation benchmark by cascading it with a state-of-the-art semantic\nsegmentation model. The final performance evaluated through the leaderboard\nachieves the best among all published methods. The proposed algorithm is\nimplemented with C++ and wrapped as a python function. It can be easily used\nwith the modern deep learning framework in python.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 21:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

RAPID-RL enables conditional\nactivation of DNN layers based on the difficulty level of inputs.

In this large-scale study we performed extensive computations.\nOur results demonstrate that the CS, DictL and DL algorithms yield\nsystematically biased results when naively trained on seemingly-appropriate\ndata: the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) improves consistently with\nthe preprocessing extent, showing an artificial increase of 25%-48% in some\ncases. Since this phenomenon is generally unknown, biased results are sometimes\npublished as state-of-the-art; we refer to that as subtle data crimes. This\nwork hence raises a red flag regarding naive off-label usage of Big Data and\nreveals the vulnerability of modern inverse problem solvers to the resulting\nbias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 22:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 01:31:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 05:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

In this paper, I have\nsynthesized and organized information from AI Ethics and Emotion Recognition\nliterature to present fifty ethical considerations relevant to AER. Notably,\nthe sheet fleshes out assumptions hidden in how AER is commonly framed, and in\nthe choices often made regarding the data, method, and evaluation. Special\nattention is paid to the implications of AER on privacy and social groups.\nAlong the way, key recommendations are made for responsible AER. The objective\nof the sheet is to facilitate and encourage more thoughtfulness on why to\nautomate, how to automate, and how to judge success well before the building of\nAER systems. Additionally, the sheet acts as a useful introductory document on\nemotion recognition (complementing survey articles).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 00:18:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 01:09:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 21:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

Controlled comparisons of\nhemodynamics in patients with different forms of bicuspid valve disease are\nchallenging because of confounding factors, and simulations offer the\nopportunity for direct and systematic comparisons. Using fluid-structure\ninteraction simulations, we simulate flows through multiple aortic valve models\nin a patient-specific geometry. The aortic geometry is based on a healthy\npatient with no known aortic or valvular disease, which allows us to isolate\nthe hemodynamic consequences of changes to the valve alone. Four fully-passive,\nelastic model valves are studied: a tricuspid valve and bicuspid valves with\nfusion of the left- and right-, right- and non-, and non- and left-coronary\ncusps. The resulting tricuspid flow is relatively uniform, with little\nsecondary or reverse flow, and little to no pressure gradient across the valve.\nThe bicuspid cases show localized jets of forward flow, excess streamwise\nmomentum, elevated secondary and reverse flow, and clinically significant\nlevels of stenosis. Localized high flow rates correspond to locations of\ndilation observed in patients, with the location related to which valve cusps\nare fused. Thus, the simulations support the hypothesis that chronic exposure\nto high local flow contributes to localized dilation and aneurysm formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 00:45:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 23:07:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 20:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

Experiments in\nsimulation and on a physical cable routing experiment suggest that\nThriftyDAgger's intervention criteria balances task performance and supervisor\nburden more effectively than prior algorithms. ThriftyDAgger can also be\napplied at execution time, where it achieves a 100% success rate on both the\nsimulation and physical tasks. A user study (N=10) in which users control a\nthree-robot fleet while also performing a concentration task suggests that\nThriftyDAgger increases human and robot performance by 58% and 80% respectively\ncompared to the next best algorithm while reducing supervisor burden.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 01:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

To tackle the scalability issue, we\npresent DMAPF - a decentralized and distributed MAPF solver, which is a\ncontinuation of our recently published work, ros-dmapf. We address the issues\nof ros-dmapf where it (i) only works in maps without obstacles; and (ii) has a\nlow success rate with dense maps.

Its general form, the MEP problem,\ninvolves multiple agents who need to reason about both the state of the world\nand the information flows between agents.

In particular, we aim to achieve such goal\nby defining a new action-based language for multi-agent epistemic planning and\nto implement an epistemic planner based on it.

Generalising\nsemi-supervised learning to cross-domain data is of high importance to further\nimprove model robustness. However, the widely existing distribution difference\nand sample mismatch between different data domains hinder the generalisation of\nsemi-supervised learning. In this study, we alleviate these problems by\nproposing an Adaptive Hierarchical Dual Consistency (AHDC) for the\nsemi-supervised LA segmentation on cross-domain data. The AHDC mainly consists\nof a Bidirectional Adversarial Inference module (BAI) and a Hierarchical Dual\nConsistency learning module (HDC). The BAI overcomes the difference of\ndistributions and the sample mismatch between two different domains. It mainly\nlearns two mapping networks adversarially to obtain two matched domains through\nmutual adaptation. The HDC investigates a hierarchical dual learning paradigm\nfor cross-domain semi-supervised segmentation based on the obtained matched\ndomains. It mainly builds two dual-modelling networks for mining the\ncomplementary information in both intra-domain and inter-domain. For the\nintra-domain learning, a consistency constraint is applied to the\ndual-modelling targets to exploit the complementary modelling information.

Among them,\nthe one-sided two-player zero-sum partially observable stochastic game\n(OTZ-POSG) has emerged as a popular model because it allows players to compete\nfor multiple stages based on partial knowledge of the system. All existing work\non OTZ-POSG has focused on the simultaneous move scenario and assumed that one\nplayer's actions are private in the execution process. However, this assumption\nmay become questionable since one player's action may be detected by the\nopponent through deploying action detection strategies. Hence, in this paper,\nwe propose a turn-based OTZ-POSG with the assumption of public actions and\ninvestigate the existence and properties of a Stackelberg equilibrium for this\ngame. We first prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium for the\none-stage case and show that the one-stage game can be converted into a\nlinear-fractional programming problem and therefore solved by linear\nprogramming. For multiple stages, the main challenge is the information leakage\nissue as the public run-time action reveals certain private information to the\nopponent and allows the opponent to achieve more rewards in the future. To deal\nwith this issue, we adopt the concept of $\\epsilon$-Stackelberg equilibrium and\nprove that this equilibrium can be achieved for finite-horizon OTZ-POSGs. We\npropose a space partition approach to solve the game iteratively and show that\nthe value function of the leader is piece-wise linear and the value function of\nthe follower is piece-wise constant for multiple stages. Finally, examples are\ngiven to illustrate the space partition approach and show that value functions\nare piece-wise linear and piece-wise constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 03:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

To solve it in a federated\nand privacy-preserving manner, we consider the equivalent dual form of the\nproblem and develop an asynchronous gradient coordinate-descent ascent\nalgorithm, where some active data parties perform multiple parallelized local\nupdates per communication round to effectively reduce the number of\ncommunication rounds. The messages that the server sends to passive parties are\ndeliberately designed such that the information necessary for local updates is\nreleased without intruding on the privacy of data and sensitive attributes. We\nrigorously study the convergence of the algorithm when applied to general\nnonconvex-concave min-max problems. We prove that the algorithm finds a\n$\\delta$-stationary point of the dual objective in $\\mathcal{O}(\\delta^{-4})$\ncommunication rounds under mild conditions. Finally, the extensive experiments\non three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method\nin training fair models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 04:40:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2021 22:08:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 06:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

However, there is still a substantial gap in solution quality between\nmachine learning and operations research algorithms.

In particular, search perturbation operators\nhave been used to improve the solution. Nevertheless, using the perturbation\nmay not guarantee a quality solution. This paper presents \"Learning to Guide\nLocal Search\" (L2GLS), a learning-based approach for routing problems that uses\na penalty term and reinforcement learning to adaptively adjust search efforts.\nL2GLS combines local search (LS) operators' strengths with penalty terms to\nescape local optimals. Routing problems have many practical applications, often\npresetting larger instances that are still challenging for many existing\nalgorithms introduced in the learning to optimise field.

Without considering\nthe Coulomb correlation, two energetically favorable out-of-plane stacking\nconfigurations are identified: one is a metallic phase with a single-layer\nstacking pattern, another is a band insulator with a paired-bilayer stacking\nconfiguration. Even though the Coulomb correlation is taken into account, the\ntwo energetic favorable stacking orders are still far more stable than other\nstacking orders. Furthermore, increasing the Coulomb interaction, the\npaired-bilayer stacking configuration transforms from nonmagnetic band\ninsulator to antiferromagnetic insulator, while the single-layer stacking\nundergoes a Slater-Mott metal-insulator transition, which indicates the\nnon-negligible role of electron-electron correlation interactions.

Recently, the National\nVeterinary Service (NVS) has implemented individual identification of pigs,\nmovement control and mandatory vaccination against CSF, looking for a future\neradication. Our aim was to characterise the pig premises according to risk\ncriteria, analyse the effect of random and targeted strategies to control CSF\nand consider the temporal development of the network. We used social network\nanalysis (SNA), SIRS (susceptible, infected, recovered, susceptible) network\nmodelling and temporal network analysis. The data set contained 751,003\nshipments and 6 million pigs from 2017 to 2019. 165,593 premises were involved:\n144,118 farms, 138 industrials, 21,337 traders, and 51 markets. On annual\naverage, 124,976 premises (75%) received or sent one movement with 1.5 pigs, in\ncontrast, 166 (0.01%) with 1,372 movements and 11,607 pigs. Simulations\nresulted in CSF mean prevalence of 29.93%; Targeted selection strategy reduced\nthe prevalence to 3.3%, while 24% with random selection. Selection of high-risk\npremises in every province was the best strategy using available surveillance\ninfrastructure. Notably, selecting 10 traders/markets reduced the CSF\nprevalence to 4%, evidencing their prime influence over the network. Temporal\nanalysis showed an overestimation of 38% (causal fidelity) in the number of\ntransmission paths; The steps to cross the network were 4.3 (average path\nlength), but take approximately 233 days. In conclusion, surveillance\nstrategies applied by the NVS could be more efficient to find cases, reduce the\nspread of diseases and enable the implementation of risk-based surveillance. To\nfocus the efforts on target selection of high-risk premises, special attention\nshould be given to markets/traders which proved similar disease spread\npotential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 05:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

For easy use\nand intuitive control, semantically meaningful and fully disentangled\nparameters should be used as modifications.

In this paper, a Portrait Image Neural\nRenderer (PIRenderer) is proposed to control the face motions with the\nparameters of three-dimensional morphable face models (3DMMs). The proposed\nmodel can generate photo-realistic portrait images with accurate movements\naccording to intuitive modifications.

The main control challenge in a SBW system is to\nfollow the steering commands in the face of parametric uncertainties, external\ndisturbances and actuator delay; crucially, perturbations in inertial\nparameters and damping forces give rise to state-dependent uncertainties, which\ncannot be bounded a priori by a constant. However, the state-of-the-art control\nmethods of SBW system rely on a priori bounded uncertainties, and thus, become\ninapplicable when state-dependent dynamics become unknown. In addition,\nensuring tracking accuracy under actuator delay is always a challenging task.\nThis work proposes two control frameworks to overcome these challenges.\nFirstly, an adaptive controller is proposed to tackle the state-dependent\nuncertainties and external disturbances in a typical SBW system without any a\npriori knowledge of their structures and of their bounds. The stability of the\nclosed-loop system is studied analytically via uniformly ultimately bounded\nnotion and the effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified via\nsimulations against the state-of-the-art solution. While this proposed\ncontroller handles the uncertainties and external perturbations, it does not\nconsider the actuator delay which sometimes result in decreased accuracy.\nTherefore, a new adaptive-robust control framework is devised to tackle the\nsame control problem of an SBW system under the influence of time-varying input\ndelay. In comparison to the existing strategies, the proposed framework removes\nthe conservative assumption of a priori bounded uncertainty and, in addition,\nthe Razumikhin theorem based stability analysis allows the proposed scheme to\ndeal with arbitrary variation in input delay. The effectiveness of the both\ncontrollers is proved using comparative simulation studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 07:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

Secondly, such\na framework can only leverage the already generated words but not the possible\nfuture words, and thus lacks the ability of global planning on linguistic\ninformation.

With this motivation in\nmind, here we scrutinize recent experimental results showing evidence of rapid\nevolution of tolerance by lag in bacterial populations that are periodically\nexposed to antibiotic stress in laboratory conditions. In particular, the\ndistribution of single-cell lag times evolves its average value to\napproximately fit the antibiotic-exposure time. Moreover, the distribution\ndevelops right skewed heavy tails, revealing the presence of individuals with\nanomalously large lag times. Here, we develop a parsimonious individual-based\nmodel mimicking the actual demographic processes of the experimental setup.\nIndividuals are characterized by a single phenotypic trait: their intrinsic lag\ntime, which is transmitted with variation to the progeny. The model (in a\nversion in which the amplitude of phenotypic variations grows with the\nparent\\'s lag time) is able to reproduce quite well the key empirical\nobservations. Furthermore, we develop a general mathematical framework allowing\nus to describe with good accuracy the properties of the stochastic model by\nmeans of a macroscopic equation, which generalizes the Crow Kimura equation in\npopulation genetics. From a broader perspective, this work represents a\nbenchmark for the mathematical framework designed to tackle much more general\neco-evolutionary problems, thus paving the road to further research avenues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 09:01:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 09:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

The increase of toroidal flux is owing to the flare reconnection in\nthe early phase that transforms the sheared arcade to twisted field lines,\nwhile its decrease is a result of reconnection between field lines in the\ninterior of the MFR in the later phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 09:19:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

In\nrecent years it has become apparent that the GCE may not be spherically\nsymmetric, but may be spatially correlated with the distribution of stellar\nmass in the Galactic bulge, potentially favoring an unresolved population of\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs) scenario. In this thesis, we perform detailed\nmodelling of the Galactic MSP population. Including in our model the spin down\nbetween formation and observation, we find a model in which luminosity $L\n\\propto E_{\\rm cut}^{1.2 \\pm 0.3} B^{0.1 \\pm 0.4} \\dot{E}^{0.5 \\pm 0.1}$\nprovides the best fit to the data, where $E_{\\rm cut}$ is spectral energy\ncutoff, $B$ is magnetic field strength, and $\\dot{E}$ is the spin-down power.\nDue to differing star formation histories it is expected that the MSPs in the\nGalactic bulge are older and therefore dimmer than those in the Galactic disk.\nOur results demonstrate that we do not require that there is anything\nsystematically different about the inner Galaxy MSPs to explain the GCE. In the\n\"recycling\" channel of MSP formation the neutron star forms from a core\ncollapse supernovae that undergoes a random \"kick\" due to the asymmetry of the\nexplosion. This would imply a smoothing out of the spatial distribution of the\nMSPs. We use N-body simulations to model how the MSP spatial distribution\nchanges. We estimate the probability distribution of natal kick velocities\nusing the resolved gamma-ray MSP proper motions, where MSPs have velocities\nrelative to circular motion of 77 +/- 6 km/s, as determined as part of our\nGalactic MSP population model. We find that, due to the natal kicks, there is\nan approximately 10% increase in each of the bulge MSP spatial distribution\ndimensions and also the bulge MSP distribution becomes less boxy but is still\nfar from being spherical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 10:02:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

The edge states (non-dispersive bands near the Fermi level) are\nstates localized at the edge of graphene nanoribbon that only exists in certain\nrange of momentum $k_y$.

They are trained to\npredict a fixed set of predefined categories, limiting their transferable\nability on new datasets with unseen concepts. In this paper, we provide a new\nperspective on action recognition by attaching importance to the semantic\ninformation of label texts rather than simply mapping them into numbers.\nSpecifically, we model this task as a video-text matching problem within a\nmultimodal learning framework, which strengthens the video representation with\nmore semantic language supervision and enables our model to do zero-shot action\nrecognition without any further labeled data or parameters requirements.\nMoreover, to handle the deficiency of label texts and make use of tremendous\nweb data, we propose a new paradigm based on this multimodal learning framework\nfor action recognition, which we dub \"pre-train, prompt and fine-tune\". This\nparadigm first learns powerful representations from pre-training on a large\namount of web image-text or video-text data. Then it makes the action\nrecognition task to act more like pre-training problems via prompt engineering.\nFinally, it end-to-end fine-tunes on target datasets to obtain strong\nperformance.

Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown\npromising results in urban driving scenarios. However, DRL is known to be\nsample inefficient, and most previous works assume perfect observations such as\nground-truth locations and motions of vehicles without considering noises and\nocclusions, which might be a too strong assumption for policy deployment.

While the effectiveness of learned\nindexes as an alternative to traditional index structures such as B+Trees have\nalready been demonstrated by several studies, previous work tend to focus on\nhigher-level performance metrics such as throughput and index size. In this\npaper, our goal is to dig deeper and investigate how learned indexes behave at\na micro-architectural level compared to traditional indexes.\n  More specifically, we focus on previously proposed learned index structure\nALEX, which is a tree-based in-memory index structure that consists of a\nhierarchy of machine learned models. Unlike the original proposal for learned\nindexes, ALEX is designed from the ground up to allow updates and inserts.\nTherefore, it enables more dynamic workloads using learned indexes. In this\nwork, we perform a micro-architectural analysis of ALEX and compare its\nbehavior to the tree-based index structures that are not based on learned\nmodels, i.e., ART and B+Tree.\n  Our results show that ALEX is bound by memory stalls, mainly stalls due to\ndata misses from the last-level cache. Compared to ART and B+Tree, ALEX\nexhibits fewer stalls and a lower cycles-per-instruction value across different\nworkloads. On the other hand, the amount of instructions required to handle\nout-of-bound inserts in ALEX can increase the instructions needed per request\nsignificantly (10X) for write-heavy workloads. However, the micro-architectural\nbehavior shows that this increase in the instruction footprint exhibit high\ninstruction-level parallelism, and, therefore, does not negatively impact the\noverall execution time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 12:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

A key enabling\nchallenge is the formation of systems containing both QDs and plasmonic\nnanoparticles in high purity.

In essence, the decision-making agent maps each arriving job to one of\nthe possibly heterogeneous servers while aiming at an optimization goal such as\nload balancing, low average delay or low loss rate. One main difficulty in\nfinding optimal load balancing policies here is that the agent only partially\nobserves the impact of its decisions, e.g., through the delayed\nacknowledgements of the served jobs. In this paper, we provide a partially\nobservable (PO) model that captures the load balancing decisions in parallel\nbuffered systems under limited information of delayed acknowledgements. We\npresent a simulation model for this PO system to find a load balancing policy\nin real-time using a scalable Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. We numerically\nshow that the resulting policy outperforms other limited information load\nbalancing strategies such as variants of Join-the-Most-Observations and has\ncomparable performance to full information strategies like:\nJoin-the-Shortest-Queue, Join-the-Shortest-Queue(d) and\nShortest-Expected-Delay.

As a consequence, those in charge of\ndeveloping these models must carefully evaluate their impact on different\ngroups of people and favour group fairness, that is, ensure that groups\ndetermined by sensitive demographic attributes, such as race or sex, are not\ntreated unjustly. To achieve this goal, the availability (awareness) of these\ndemographic attributes to those evaluating the impact of these models is\nfundamental. Unfortunately, collecting and storing these attributes is often in\nconflict with industry practices and legislation on data minimisation and\nprivacy. For this reason, it can be hard to measure the group fairness of\ntrained models, even from within the companies developing them. In this work,\nwe tackle the problem of measuring group fairness under unawareness of\nsensitive attributes, by using techniques from quantification, a supervised\nlearning task concerned with directly providing group-level prevalence\nestimates (rather than individual-level class labels). We show that\nquantification approaches are particularly suited to tackle the\nfairness-under-unawareness problem, as they are robust to inevitable\ndistribution shifts while at the same time decoupling the (desirable) objective\nof measuring group fairness from the (undesirable) side effect of allowing the\ninference of sensitive attributes of individuals. More in detail, we show that\nfairness under unawareness can be cast as a quantification problem and solved\nwith proven methods from the quantification literature. We show that these\nmethods outperform previous approaches to measure demographic parity in five\nexperimental protocols, corresponding to important challenges that complicate\nthe estimation of classifier fairness under unawareness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 13:45:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 07:50:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 09:39:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 13:02:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 13:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Chem.\nPhys. {\\bf 150}, 164118 (2019)]. The main feature of this method is the\ndecomposed form of the doubly-excited amplitudes which are expanded in the\nbasis of largest magnitude eigenvectors of the MP2 or MP3 amplitudes. This\napproach enables a substantial compression of the amplitudes with only minor\nloss of accuracy. However, the formal scaling of the computational costs with\nthe system size ($N$) is unaffected in comparison with the conventional CCSD\ntheory ($\\propto N^6$) due to presence of some terms quadratic in the\namplitudes. We show how to solve this problem, exploiting the fact that their\neffective rank increases only linearly with the system size and reduce the\nscaling of the RR-CCSD iterations down to the level of $N^5$. This is combined\nwith an iterative method of finding dominant eigenpairs of the MP2 or MP3\namplitudes which eliminates the necessity to perform the complete\ndiagonalization. Next, we consider the evaluation of the perturbative\ncorrections to the CCSD energies resulting from triply excited configurations.\nThe triply-excited amplitudes present in the CCSD(T) method are decomposed to\nthe Tucker-3 format using the higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI)\nprocedure. This enables to compute the energy correction due to triple\nexcitations non-iteratively with $N^6$ cost. The accuracy of the resulting\nrank-reduced CCSD(T) method is studied both for total and relative correlation\nenergies of a diverse set of molecules. Accuracy levels better than 99.9\\% can\nbe achieved with a substantial reduction of the computational costs. Concerning\nthe computational timings, break-even point between the rank-reduced and\nconventional CCSD implementations occurs for systems with about $30-40$ active\nelectrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:00:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 10:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

Existing methods usually encode the entire\nhierarchical structure and fail to construct a robust label-dependent model,\nmaking it hard to make accurate predictions on sparse lower-level labels and\nachieving low Macro-F1. In this paper, we propose a novel PAMM-HiA-T5 model for\nHTC: a hierarchy-aware T5 model with path-adaptive mask mechanism that not only\nbuilds the knowledge of upper-level labels into low-level ones but also\nintroduces path dependency information in label prediction. Specifically, we\ngenerate a multi-level sequential label structure to exploit hierarchical\ndependency across different levels with Breadth-First Search (BFS) and T5\nmodel. To further improve label dependency prediction within each path, we then\npropose an original path-adaptive mask mechanism (PAMM) to identify the label's\npath information, eliminating sources of noises from other paths. Comprehensive\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets show that our novel PAMM-HiA-T5 model\ngreatly outperforms all state-of-the-art HTC approaches especially in Macro-F1.\nThe ablation studies show that the improvements mainly come from our innovative\napproach instead of T5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

One mechanism suggested as a solution for hot Jupiters is the\nheating of the deep atmosphere via the vertical advection of potential\ntemperature resulting in an increased internal entropy. Here we intend to\nexplore if this mechanism can also explain the observed brown dwarf radii\ntrend: a general increase in radius with irradiation, with an exception for\nhighly-irradiated brown dwarfs orbiting white dwarfs. We use a 3D GCM,\nDYNAMICO, to run a series of long-timescale models of the atmospheres of\nKepler-13Ab, KELT-1b, and SDSS1411B. These models allow us to explore not only\nif a stable advective adiabat can develop, but also the associated dynamics. We\nfind that our models fall into two distinct regimes: Kepler-13Ab and KELT-1b\nboth show signs of significant deep heating and hence maintain adiabats that\nare hotter than 1D models predict. On the other hand, SDSS1411B exhibits a much\nweaker downward heating profile which not only struggles to heat the interior\nunder ideal conditions, but is highly sensitive to the presence of deep\nradiative dynamics. We find that the vertical advection of potential\ntemperature by large-scale atmospheric circulations represents a robust\nmechanism to explain the trend of increasing inflation with irradiation,\nincluding the exception for highly irradiated brown dwarfs orbiting white\ndwarfs. This can be understood as occurring due to the role that increasing\nrotational influence plays on mid- to-high latitude advective dynamics.\nFurthermore, when paired with a suitable parametrisation of the outer\natmosphere irradiation profile, this mechanism alone could potentially provide\na complete explanation for the observed levels of inflation in our brown\ndwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:32:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 12:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Additionally, we collected and\nmanually labeled a generative lexicon containing nearly 10,000 verb, noun and\nadjective stems, named entities, and other types of word stems. We used these\nrule sets and resources to implement CKMorph Analyzer based on finite-state\ntransducers. In order to provide a benchmark for future research, we collected,\nmanually labeled, and publicly shared test sets for evaluating accuracy and\ncoverage of the analyzer. CKMorph was able to correctly analyze 95.9% of the\naccuracy test set, containing 1,000 CK words morphologically analyzed according\nto the context. Moreover, CKMorph gave at least one analysis for 95.5% of 4.22M\nCK tokens of the coverage test set. The demonstration of the application and\nresources including CK verb database and test sets are openly accessible at\nhttps://github.com/CKMorph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:45:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 20:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-04"}

William Lane Craig disagrees and argues\nthat although relativity is empirically adequate within a domain of\napplication, relativity should be supplanted by a Neo-Lorentzian alternative\nthat allows for absolute time. Meanwhile, Craig and co-author Sinclair have\nargued that physical cosmology supports the conclusion that physical reality\nbegan to exist at a finite time in the past. However, on their view, the\nbeginning of physical reality requires the objective passage of absolute time,\nso that the beginning of physical reality stands or falls with Craig's\nNeo-Lorentzian metaphysics. I raise doubts about whether, given Craig's\nNeoLorentzian metaphysics, physical cosmology could adequately support a\nbeginning of physical reality within the finite past. Craig and Sinclair's\nconception of the beginning of the universe requires a past boundary to the\nuniverse. A past boundary to the universe cannot be directly observed and so\nmust be inferred from the observed matter-energy distribution in conjunction\nwith auxilary hypotheses drawn from a substantive physical theory. Craig's\nbrand of Neo Lorentzianism has not been sufficiently well specified so as to\ninfer either that there is a past boundary or that the boundary is located in\nthe finite past. Thus, Neo Lorentzianism implicitly introduces a form of\nskepticism that removes the ability that we might have otherwise had to infer a\nbeginning of the universe. Furthermore, in analyzing traditional big bang\nmodels, I develop criteria that Neo-Lorentzians should deploy in thinking about\nthe direction and duration of time in cosmological models generally. For my\nlast task, I apply the same criteria to bounce cosmologies and show that Craig\nand Sinclair have been wrong to interpret bounce cosmologies as including a\nbeginning of physical reality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

In particular, rule-based KBC has led to interpretable rules\nwhile being comparable in performance with graph embeddings. Even within\nrule-based KBC, there exist different approaches that lead to rules of varying\nquality and previous work has not always been precise in highlighting these\ndifferences. Another issue that plagues most rule-based KBC is the\nnon-uniformity of relation paths: some relation sequences occur in very few\npaths while others appear very frequently. In this paper, we show that not all\nrule-based KBC models are the same and propose two distinct approaches that\nlearn in one case: 1) a mixture of relations and the other 2) a mixture of\npaths. When implemented on top of neuro-symbolic AI, which learns rules by\nextending Boolean logic to real-valued logic, the latter model leads to\nsuperior KBC accuracy outperforming state-of-the-art rule-based KBC by 2-10% in\nterms of mean reciprocal rank. Furthermore, to address the non-uniformity of\nrelation paths, we combine rule-based KBC with graph embeddings thus improving\nour results even further and achieving the best of both worlds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 17:54:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

Extremophiles gain equal value by being part of a framework for\nhigh-level characterisation of the evolutionary mechanisms that must\nnecessarily restrict or promote their emergence and presence on solar system\nbodies. Thus, extremophiles exist in extreme environments, and therein lies the\nparadox: extremophiles can only live in extreme environments but yet are not\nable to originate in such environments. Therefore, even though the range of\nextremophile capabilities in extreme environments is wider than that in\nmesophiles, the range of their emergence possibilities is still equally\nrestricted. Therefore, even if one locates an extreme exoworld where\nterrestrial extremophiles could live here-and-now, it can be predicted that no\nextremophile analogues are present anyway. Furthermore, it is possible for a\nworld to be uninhabited, yet be habitable, and therein arises the extreme\nenvironment paradox: an extreme environment can sustain chemical evolution as\nwell as arriving non-native life, yet native life cannot be built up in that\nvery environment. Thus, life may exist on an extraterrestrial extreme world (if\nimported there), and chemical evolution may be present on that world. However,\nit can be predicted that there is no native life anyway. This situation can be\npredicted to function as a chemosignature and eventually as a biosignature.\nHowever, the fact that a non-native extremopile in principle can exist in\nextreme environments may demonstrate that the intermediate step between\nchemical evolution and extremophiles can still occur in the form of a\nstatistical deviation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 08:43:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 07:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

How can the whole have a smaller mass than its components?

It turns out that the\nsame is true here; the hydrogen atom is a little bit lighter than the sum of\nits constituents. This difference corresponds to the ionisation energy of\nhydrogen. This observation allows a simple explanation for how this is\npossible; the destructive interference between the electric fields of the\nproton and electron causes a reduction in the energy of the electric field and\nhence a reduction in the contribution to the mass of the system from the\nelectric field energy. The same explanation can be extended to the nucleus,\nthus giving some intuition about how this mass reduction happens.
