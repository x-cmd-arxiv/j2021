Our method is based on a quantum algorithm\nwhose complexity scales polynomially in the total number of input/output\nsystems, in the dimension of the systems involved in each interaction, and in\nthe inverse of the chosen threshold for the strength of the causal\ndependencies. Under additional assumptions, we also provide a second algorithm\nthat has lower complexity and requires only local state preparation and local\nmeasurements. Our algorithms can be used to identify processes that can be\ncharacterized efficiently with the technique of quantum process tomography.\nSimilarly, they can be used to identify useful communication channels in\nquantum networks, and to test the internal structure of uncharacterized quantum\ncircuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:28:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 08:38:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 04:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

The main novelty comes from\nhaving three layers of environmental fluctuations. The first layer is due to\nthe environment switching at random times between different environmental\nstates. This is similar to having sudden environmental changes or catastrophes.\nThe second layer is due to seasonal variation, where there is a significant\nchange in the dynamics between seasons. Finally, the third layer is due to the\nconstant presence of environmental stochasticity -- between the seasonal or\nrandom regime switches, the species is affected by fluctuations which can be\nmodelled by white noise. This framework is more realistic because it can\ncapture both significant random and deterministic environmental shifts as well\nas small and frequent fluctuations in abiotic factors. Our framework also\nallows for the price or cost of harvesting to change deterministically and\nstochastically, something that is more realistic from an economic point of\nview.\n  The combined effects of seasonal and random fluctuations make it impossible\nto find the optimal harvesting-stocking strategy analytically. We get around\nthis roadblock by developing rigorous numerical approximations and proving that\nthey converge to the optimal harvesting-stocking strategy.

We follow the ASpiX methodology: the distribution of the\nobserved X-ray properties of the cluster population is analysed in a 3D\nobservable space (count rate, hardness ratio, redshift) and modelled as a\nfunction of cosmology. Compared to more traditional methods, ASpiX allows the\ninclusion of clusters down to a few tens of photons.

Adding\nconstraints from the XXL cluster 2-point correlation function and the BAO from\nvarious surveys decreases the uncertainties by 23 and 53 % respectively, and\n62% when adding both.

As part of the\nMATLAS survey, a deep imaging large program at the Canada-France-Hawaii\nTelescope (CFHT), our team has identified 2210 dwarf galaxies, 59 (~3%) of\nwhich qualify as UDGs. Averaging over the survey area, we find ~0.4 UDG per\nsquare degree. They are found in a range of low to moderate density\nenvironments, although 61% of the sample fall within the virial radii of\ngroups. Based on a detailed analysis of their photometric and structural\nproperties, we find that the MATLAS UDGs do not show significant differences\nfrom the traditional dwarfs, except from the predefined size and surface\nbrightness cut. Their median color is as red as the one measured in galaxy\nclusters, albeit with a narrower color range. The majority of the UDGs are\nvisually classified as dwarf ellipticals with log stellar masses of ~6.5-8.7.\nThe fraction of nucleated UDGs (~34%) is roughly the same as the nucleated\nfraction of the traditional dwarfs. Only five (~8%) UDGs show signs of tidal\ndisruption and only two are tidal dwarf galaxy candidates. A study of globular\ncluster (GC) candidates selected in the CFHT images finds no evidence of a\nhigher GC specific frequency S_N for UDGs than for classical dwarfs, contrary\nto what is found in most clusters. The UDG halo-to-stellar mass ratio\ndistribution, as estimated from the GC counts, peaks at roughly the same value\nas for the traditional dwarfs, but spans the smaller range of ~10-2000. We\ninterpret these results to mean that the large majority of the field-to-group\nUDGs do not have a different formation scenario than traditional dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

It requires a subtle study of wave interaction.\nIn the later part of this article, we discuss the initial-boundary value\nproblem for the Euler-Poisson system. We prove the existence of $BV$ solution\nfor the initial-boundary value problem with large initial and boundary data. By\nan explicit example, we also show ill-posedness of initial-boundary value\nproblem for the isentropic Euler equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:55:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 17:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

The\nprocedure converts out-of-equilibrium critical fluctuations described by\nextended hydrodynamics, known as Hydro+, into cumulants of hadron\nmultiplicities that can be subsequently measured. We introduce a critical sigma\nfield whose fluctuations cause correlations between observed hadrons due to the\ncouplings of the sigma field to the hadrons.

The analysis brings out the concepts of hybrid spin textures\nintermixing the effects of valence and conduction bands under topological\nquantum phase transitions, and spin texture binaries where alignment of the\nspins are reversed between domains in the momentum space with sharp boundaries.\nThe results are validated through density functional calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:16:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 15:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

This paper presents an end-to-end stress analysis for video gaming\nstimuli using EEG. The PSD value of the Alpha and Beta bands is computed to\ncalculate the Beta-to-Alpha ratio (BAR). In this article, BAR is used to denote\nmental stress. Subjects are chosen based on various factors such as gender,\ngameplay experience, age, and BMI. EEG is recorded using Scan SynAmps2 Express\nequipment. There are three types of video gameplay: strategic, puzzle, and\ncombinational. Relaxation is accomplished in this study by the use of music of\nvarious pitches. Two types of regression analysis are done to mathematically\nmodel stress and relaxation curve. Brain topography is rendered to indicate the\nstressed and relaxed region of the brain. In the relaxed state, the subjects\nhave BAR 0.701, which is considered the baseline value. Non-gamer subjects have\nan average BAR of 2.403 for 1 hour of strategic video gameplay, whereas gamers\nhave 2.218 BAR concurrently.

Oceans on icy worlds\nexert a considerable influence on the dynamics of the ice-ocean system and,\nbecause of the astrobiological potential, represent an important objective for\nfuture missions. The Pluto-Charon system is representative of an icy moon\norbiting a dwarf planet formed from the remnants of a giant impact. Evolution\nof icy moons is primarily controlled by the mode and efficiency of heat\ntransfer through the outer ice shell, which is influenced by the presence of\nimpurities, by tidal dissipation in the ice shell, and the radioactive element\nbudget in the core. Previous studies on the evolution of the Pluto-Charon\nsystem considered either only the thermal or the tidal evolution, and in the\ncases where both were considered, the important effect of the presence of\nimpurities in the liquid oceans was not addressed. We consider the joint\ntidal-thermal evolution of the system by combining a comprehensive tidal model\nthat incorporates a viscoelastic tidal response with a parameterized convection\nmodel developed for icy worlds. This approach enables an extensive analysis of\nthe conditions required for formation and maintenance of subsurface liquid\noceans to the present. Our results show that because of fast circularization\nand synchronization of the orbits, tidal heating is only important during the\nearly stages of evolution (<1 Myr). We test the sensitivity of our results to\nthe initial orbital and thermal parameters. In all the cases, oceans on Pluto\nare always predicted to remain liquid to the present, ranging from 40 km to\n150-km thick, whereas oceans on Charon have solidified. This is supported by\nNew Horizons observations of extensional faults on Pluto and both extensional\nand compressional faults on Charon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

However, when $\\mathcal{L}(x,\\mu)$ is highly nonconvex with complex\nconstraints in $x$, the minimization over $x$ may not achieve global\noptimality, and hence the dual ascent step loses its valid intuition. This\nobservation motivates us to propose a new class of primal-dual algorithms for\nnonconvex constrained optimization with the key feature to reverse dual ascent\nto a conceptually new dual descent, in a sense, elevating the dual variable to\nthe same status as the primal variable. Surprisingly, this new dual scheme\nachieves some best iteration complexities for solving nonconvex optimization\nproblems. In particular, when the dual descent step is scaled by a fractional\nconstant, we name it scaled dual descent (SDD), otherwise, unscaled dual\ndescent (UDD). For nonconvex multiblock optimization with nonlinear equality\nconstraints, we propose SDD-ADMM and show that it finds an\n$\\epsilon$-stationary solution in $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-4})$ iterations.

In an\naxisymmetric, non-spherical prolate explosion, the shock first breaches the\nsurface along the symmetry axis, then peels around to larger angles, producing\na breakout light curve which may differ substantially from the spherically\nsymmetric case. We study the emergence of a non-relativistic, bipolar shock\nfrom a spherical star, and estimate the basic properties of the associated\nbolometric shock breakout signal. We identify four possible classes of breakout\nlight curves, depending on the degree of asphericity. Compared to spherical\nbreakouts, we find that the main distinguishing features of significantly\naspherical breakouts are 1) a longer and fainter initial breakout flash and 2)\nan extended phase of slowly-declining, or even rising, emission which is\nproduced as ejecta flung out by the oblique breakout expand and cool. We find\nthat the breakout flash has a maximum duration of roughly $\\sim R_*/v_{\\rm bo}$\nwhere $R_*$ is the stellar radius and $v_{\\rm bo}$ is the velocity of the\nfastest-moving ejecta.

To overcome\nthese issues we employ the Multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE) method of\nrepresenting a galaxy's profile together with a Bayesian framework for fitting\nimages.

Through a case study of this Critical Comparative Data Structures and\nAlgorithms pedagogy, we argue that justice-centered approaches to higher CS\neducation can help all computing students not only learn about the ethical\nimplications of nominally technical concepts, but also develop greater respect\nfor diverse epistemologies, cultures, and experiences surrounding computing\nthat are essential to creating the socially-just worlds we need.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:08:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 18:05:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 18:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-09"}

DSP systems are still affected by significant\ndrawbacks, such as low light absorption efficiency. Recently, it has been\ndemonstrated that the plasmonic metal nanostructures can be used to enhance the\nlight absorption efficiency and the overall dye-sensitization rate of DSP\nsystems through the plasmonic Mie resonance-enhanced dye-sensitization\napproach. In this contribution, we report an alternate and novel approach,\ndielectric Mie resonance-enhanced dye sensitization. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate that the dielectric Mie resonances in cuprous oxide (Cu2O)\nspherical and cubical nanostructures can be used to enhance the\ndye-sensitization rate of methylene blue dye. The Cu2O nanostructures\nexhibiting dielectric Mie resonances exhibit up to an order of magnitude higher\ndye-sensitization rate as compared to Cu2O nanostructures not exhibiting\ndielectric Mie resonances. Our model system developed from finite-difference\ntime-domain simulation predicts a volcano-type relationship between the dye\nsensitization rate and the size of Cu2O nanostructures. The predicted\nstructure-property-performance relationship is experimentally verified and the\noptimal size ranges of Cu2O nanospheres and nanocubes are identified. Although\nwe demonstrate the dielectric Mie resonance-enhanced dye-sensitization approach\nusing Cu2O nanostructures, the proposed approach can be used to design a wide\nrange of DSP systems, including CeO2, {\\alpha}-Fe2O3, and TiO2\nnanostructures-based DSP systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:08:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 17:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Specifically, if $r_{opt}$ is the optimal\nradius for $k$ centers, then in $n^{O(1/\\varepsilon^2)}$ time we can produce a\nset of $(1+\\varepsilon)k$ centers with radius $\\leq r_{opt}$. If instead one\nconsiders the standard goal of approximating the optimal clustering radius,\nwhile keeping $k$ as a hard constraint, we show that the radius cannot be\napproximated within any factor in polynomial time unless $\\mathsf{P=NP}$, even\nwhen $\\mathscr{C}$ is a set of line segments. When $\\mathscr{C}$ is a set of\nunit disks we show the problem is hard to approximate within a factor of\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{13}-\\sqrt{3}}{2-\\sqrt{3}}\\approx 6.99$. This hardness result\ncomplements our main result, where we show that when the objects are disks, of\npossibly differing radii, there is a $(5+2\\sqrt{3})\\approx 8.46$ approximation\nalgorithm. Additionally, for unit disks we give an $O(n\\log\nk)+(k/\\varepsilon)^{O(k)}$ time $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation to the optimal\nradius, that is, an FPTAS for constant $k$ whose running time depends only\nlinearly on $n$. Finally, we show that the one dimensional version of the\nproblem, even when intersections are allowed, can be solved exactly in $O(n\\log\nn)$ time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

Handling tasks from multiple different\ndistributions is challenging for meta-learning due to a so-called task\nambiguity issue. This paper proposes a novel method, ST-MAML, that empowers\nmodel-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to learn from multiple task distributions.\nST-MAML encodes tasks using a stochastic neural network module, that summarizes\nevery task with a stochastic representation. The proposed Stochastic Task (ST)\nstrategy allows a meta-model to get tailored for the current task and enables\nus to learn a distribution of solutions for an ambiguous task.

Multiple\ntarget and model combinations with these features were explored. First, we use\nthe logarithm of critical casting thickness, $log_{10}(D_{max})$, as the target\nand trained regression models on 21 compositions. Application of 3-fold\ncross-validation on the 21 $log_{10}(D_{max})$ alloys showed only weak\ncorrelation between the model predictions and the target values. Second, the\nGFA of alloys were quantified by melt-spinning or suction casting amorphization\nbehavior, with alloys that showed crystalline phases after synthesis classified\nas Poor GFA and those with pure amorphous phases as Good GFA. Binary GFA\nclassification was then modeled using decision tree-based methods (random\nforest and gradient boosting models) and were assessed with nested-cross\nvalidation. The maximum F1 score for the precision-recall with Good Glass\nForming Ability as the positive class was $0.82 \\pm 0.01$ for the best model\ntype.

More specifically, we\npropose to learn non-linear warpings on the latent space, each one parametrized\nby a set of RBF-based latent space warping functions, and where each warping\ngives rise to a family of non-linear paths via the gradient of the function.\nBuilding on the work of Voynov and Babenko, that discovers linear paths, we\noptimize the trainable parameters of the set of RBFs, so as that images that\nare generated by codes along different paths, are easily distinguishable by a\ndiscriminator network. This leads to easily distinguishable image\ntransformations, such as pose and facial expressions in facial images. We show\nthat linear paths can be derived as a special case of our method, and show\nexperimentally that non-linear paths in the latent space lead to steeper, more\ndisentangled and interpretable changes in the image space than in state-of-the\nart methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

In the present theoretical study, we re-examine the\nrelation of HF-CC and KS-CC methods by comparing the results of widely applied\ntruncated CC calculations (CCSD, CCSD(T), CCSDT) to the limit of full\nconfiguration interaction (FCI), which in contrast to wave-function diagnostics\nwith vague physical meaning or experimental data with considerable uncertainty\nserves as an undebatable reference point of accuracy.

Furthermore, the\nintroduction of common approximations (frozen core, density fitting) to the CC\ncalculation results in significantly higher errors in the case of KS reference.\nWe conclude that the use of KS reference orbitals is not expected to increase\nthe reliability of low-level CC energetics. Nevertheless, molecular errors from\nthe components of the studied chemical reaction might fortunately cancel out\nresulting in illusory improvement compared to HF-CC. It is also notable that\nthe choice of reference orbitals has negligible influence on the results at\nsufficiently high CC levels which can be estimated by test calculations or by\nthe magnitude of double amplitudes.

However,\ntreatment estimates are biased if an individual's outcome affects their\nsibling's outcome. We propose a robustness test for assessing the presence of\noutcome-to-outcome interference in linear two-sibling FE models. We regress a\ngain-score--the difference between siblings' continuous outcomes--on both\nsiblings' treatments and on a pre-treatment observed FE. Under certain\nrestrictions, the observed FE's partial regression coefficient signals the\npresence of outcome-to-outcome interference. Monte Carlo simulations\ndemonstrated the robustness test under several models. We found that an\nobserved FE signaled outcome-to-outcome spillover if it was directly associated\nwith an sibling-invariant confounder of treatments and outcomes, directly\nassociated with a sibling's treatment, or directly and equally associated with\nboth siblings' outcomes. However, the robustness test collapsed if the observed\nFE was directly but differentially associated with siblings' outcomes or if\noutcomes affected siblings' treatments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 23:54:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 19:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

Using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we\nsimultaneously evolve both WDs assuming conservative mass transfer and angular\nmomentum loss from gravitational radiation. This self-consistent evolution\nyields the important feedback of the properties of the donor on the mass\ntransfer rate, $\\dot{M}$, as well as the thermal evolution of the accreting WD.\nConsistent with earlier work, we find that the high $\\dot{M}$'s at early times\nforces an adiabatic evolution of the donor for $P_{\\mathrm{orb}} < 30$ minutes\nso that its mass-radius relation depends primarily on its initial entropy. As\nthe donor reaches $ M_{\\mathrm{He}} \\approx 0.02-0.03 \\, M_{\\odot}$ at\n$P_{\\mathrm{orb}} \\simeq 30 $ minutes, it becomes fully convective and could\nlose entropy and expand much less than expected under further mass loss.\nHowever, we show that the lack of reliable opacities for the donor's surface\ninhibit a secure prediction for this possible cooling. Our calculations capture\nthe core heating that occurs during the first $\\approx 10^7$ years of accretion\nand continue the evolution into the phase of WD cooling that follows. When\ncompared to existing data for accreting WDs, as seen by Cheng and collaborators\nfor isolated WDs, we also find that the accreting WDs are not as cool as we\nwould expect given the amount of time they have had to cool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 00:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

Structure dynamics during\nproton conduction, particularly at grain boundaries, are crucial for stability\nand proton transport in nanostructured PCCs. A common assumption is that PCCs\nare structurally stable at low operating temperatures; however, material\npolycrystallinity, absorption, and reactive operating conditions have so far\nprevented verifying this assumption by nano resolved in-situ structure\nmeasurements.

For efficient annotation,\nwe created a tool to label 3D scenes with bounding primitives and developed a\nmodel that transfers this information into the 2D image domain, resulting in\nover 150k images and 1B 3D points with coherent semantic instance annotations\nacross 2D and 3D. Moreover, we established benchmarks and baselines for several\ntasks relevant to mobile perception, encompassing problems from computer\nvision, graphics, and robotics on the same dataset, e.g., semantic scene\nunderstanding, novel view synthesis and semantic SLAM. KITTI-360 will enable\nprogress at the intersection of these research areas and thus contribute\ntowards solving one of today's grand challenges: the development of fully\nautonomous self-driving systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 00:41:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 07:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

HR Car is a famous member of this class in the Galaxy. It has a large\ncircumstellar nebula and has also been confirmed as being in a binary system.\nOne means of gaining information about the evolutionary status and physical\nnature of LBVs is studying their environments. We investigated the stellar\ncontent within ~100 pc of HR Car and also its circumstellar nebula. Very Large\nTelescope (VLT) Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of a\n2'x2' region around the star highlight the incompleteness of stellar\nclassification for stars with magnitudes of V > 13 mag. Eight B0 to B9 stars\nhave been identified which may lie in close spatial vicinity to HR Car. For a\nregion with a radius of r =1.2 degree (~100 pc at a distance of 4.8 kpc) around\nHR Car, existing catalogs list several late O-type and early B-type stars, but\nonly one early O-type star. Given the relatively low stellar and nebular masses\nin the HR Car system, no early O-type stars and only a few late O-type stars\nwould be expected in association with HR Car. Instead, HR Car's location in a\npoint vector diagram suggests that HR Car is not isolated, but is part of a\nmoving group with a population of B-type stars in a spiral arm, and it has not\nreceived a strong kick from a supernova explosion of a companion star or a\nmerger event. Potential binary evolution pathways for the HR Car system cannot\nbe fully explored because of the unknown nature of the companion star.\nFurthermore, the MUSE observations reveal the presence of a fast outflow and\n\"bullets\" that have been ejected at intervals of about 400 years.

However, recent advances mostly focus on\nlearning node embeddings as deterministic \"vectors\" for static graphs yet\ndisregarding the key graph temporal dynamics and the evolving uncertainties\nassociated with node embedding in the latent space. In this work, we propose an\nefficient stochastic dynamic graph embedding method (DynG2G) that applies an\ninductive feed-forward encoder trained with node triplet-based contrastive\nloss. Every node per timestamp is encoded as a time-dependent probabilistic\nmultivariate Gaussian distribution in the latent space, hence we can quantify\nthe node embedding uncertainty on-the-fly. We adopted eight different\nbenchmarks that represent diversity in size (from 96 nodes to 87,626 and from\n13,398 edges to 4,870,863) and diversity in dynamics. We demonstrate via\nextensive experiments on these eight dynamic graph benchmarks that DynG2G\nachieves new state-of-the-art performance in capturing the underlying temporal\nnode embeddings. We also demonstrate that DynG2G can predict the evolving node\nembedding uncertainty, which plays a crucial role in quantifying the intrinsic\ndimensionality of the dynamical system over time. We obtain a universal\nrelation of the optimal embedding dimension, $L_o$, versus the effective\ndimensionality of uncertainty, $D_u$, and we infer that $L_o=D_u$ for all\ncases. This implies that the uncertainty quantification approach we employ in\nthe DynG2G correctly captures the intrinsic dimensionality of the dynamics of\nsuch evolving graphs despite the diverse nature and composition of the graphs\nat each timestamp. Moreover, this $L_0 - D_u$ correlation provides a clear path\nto select adaptively the optimum embedding size at each timestamp by setting $L\n\\ge D_u$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 02:36:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 20:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

However, existing methods assume that the target\nalways moves and is the stand-alone object. Moreover, they fail to track the\nstopped non-independent moving objects on fixed scenes.

Diagonal gates such as the transversal $T$ gate play an\nimportant role in implementing a universal set of quantum operations. This\npaper introduces a framework that describes the process of preparing a code\nstate, applying a diagonal physical gate, measuring a code syndrome, and\napplying a Pauli correction that may depend on the measured syndrome (the\naverage logical channel induced by an arbitrary diagonal gate). It focuses on\nCSS codes, and describes the interaction of code states and physical gates in\nterms of generator coefficients determined by the induced logical operator. The\ninteraction of code states and diagonal gates depends very strongly on the\nsigns of $Z$-stabilizers in the CSS code, and the proposed generator\ncoefficient framework explicitly includes this degree of freedom. The paper\nderives necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary diagonal gate to\npreserve the code space of a stabilizer code, and provides an explicit\nexpression of the induced logical operator. When the diagonal gate is a\nquadratic form diagonal gate (introduced by Rengaswamy et al.), the conditions\ncan be expressed in terms of divisibility of weights in the two classical codes\nthat determine the CSS code. These codes find application in magic state\ndistillation and elsewhere. When all the signs are positive, the paper\ncharacterizes all possible CSS codes, invariant under transversal $Z$-rotation\nthrough $\\pi/2^l$, that are constructed from classical Reed-Muller codes by\nderiving the necessary and sufficient constraints on $l$. The generator\ncoefficient framework extends to arbitrary stabilizer codes but there is\nnothing to be gained by considering the more general class of non-degenerate\nstabilizer codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 04:39:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 21:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

That is, by design,\nthe machine should first cooperate, and then only consider alternatives if\nthere are problems. It is argued that being cooperative is not only important\nfor their improved functioning, especially, when they use shared resources\n(e.g., parking spaces, public roads, curbside space and walkways), but also as\na favourable requirement analogous to how humans cooperating with other humans\ncan be advantageous and often viewed favourably. The usefulness of such\nmachine-to-machine cooperation are illustrated via examples including\ncooperative crowdsourcing, cooperative traffic routing and parking as well as\nfuturistic scenarios involving urban robots for delivery and shopping. It is\nargued that just as privacy-by-design and security-by-design are important\nconsiderations, in order to yield systems that fulfil ethical requirements,\ncooperative-by-design should also be an imperative for autonomous systems that\nare separately owned but co-inhabit the same spaces and use common resources.\nIf a machine using shared public spaces is not cooperative, as one might\nexpect, then it is not only anti-social but not behaving ethically.

It consists of pretraining a source model represented by a conditional\nVAE (CVAE) and then estimating separation matrices along with other unknown\nparameters so that the log-likelihood is non-decreasing given an observed\nmixture signal. Although the MVAE method has been shown to provide high source\nseparation performance, one drawback is the computational cost of the\nbackpropagation steps in the separation-matrix estimation algorithm. To\novercome this drawback, a method called \"FastMVAE\" was subsequently proposed,\nwhich uses an auxiliary classifier VAE (ACVAE) to train the source model. By\nusing the classifier and encoder trained in this way, the optimal parameters of\nthe source model can be inferred efficiently, albeit approximately, in each\nstep of the algorithm. However, the generalization capability of the trained\nACVAE source model was not satisfactory, which led to poor performance in\nsituations with unseen data. To improve the generalization capability, this\npaper proposes a new model architecture (called the \"ChimeraACVAE\" model) and a\ntraining scheme based on knowledge distillation. The experimental results\nrevealed that the proposed source model trained with the proposed loss function\nachieved better source separation performance with less computation time than\nFastMVAE.

Although young, the powerful radio\nsource has grown to a size of a few kpc, making it capable of affecting the ISM\nof the host galaxy. We detect an extended distribution of molecular gas with a\nmass between 0.3 and 3x10^10 Msun, depending on the CO conversion factor. The\ngas has a maximum extent of ~24 kpc and is distributed asymmetrically wrt the\nradio galaxy. Overall, the observed properties are reminiscent of molecular\nstructures observed in some galaxy clusters. However, in the inner few kpc, the\nkinematics of the gas appears to be affected by the radio source. In the\ncentral regions we observe the brightest emission and the broadest profiles\n(FWZI ~ 500 km/s), which indicate a direct interaction of the jet with dense\nclouds. On larger scales, the molecular gas appears to avoid the radio lobes\nand gas with smaller velocity dispersion (FWZI ~350 km/s) is observed around\nthe them. There, the gas appears to be affected by the expanding cocoon\nsurrounding the radio source, dispersing and heating preexisting molecular\nclouds. The data suggest that the mode of coupling between radio jets and ISM\nchanges from an outflowing phase in the inner regions to a maintenance phase at\nlarger radii. This reveals that on galaxy scales the impact of the AGN is not\nlimited to outflows. With a star-formation rate of 25 Msun/yr, PKS0023-26 is\nlocated on the SFR-M* relation for star forming galaxies. The AGN does not\nappear to have, at present, a major impact on the overall level of star\nformation of the host galaxy. However, as the jet and lobes expand throughout\nthe galaxy, they will carry enough energy to prevent further gas cooling and/or\nto inject turbulence and affect future star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 06:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

This results in the demand\nfor automatically understanding the sketches. Thus, the sketch recognition task\nbecomes more significant than before. To accomplish this task, it is necessary\nto solve the critical issue of improving the distinction of the sketch\nfeatures. To this end, we have made efforts in three aspects. First, a novel\nmulti-scale residual block is designed. Compared with the conventional basic\nresidual block, it can better perceive multi-scale information and reduce the\nnumber of parameters during training. Second, a hierarchical residual structure\nis built by stacking multi-scale residual blocks in a specific way. In contrast\nwith the single-level residual structure, the learned features from this\nstructure are more sufficient. Last but not least, the compact triplet-center\nloss is proposed specifically for the sketch recognition task. It can solve the\nproblem that the triplet-center loss does not fully consider too large\nintra-class space and too small inter-class space in sketch field. By studying\nthe above modules, a hierarchical residual network as a whole is proposed for\nsketch recognition and evaluated on Tu-Berlin benchmark thoroughly.

Because phonons have a large spread in their\nproperties, the non-gray (i.e. considering different phonon bands) phonon BTE\nis needed to accurately capture the nanoscale transport phenomena. However, BTE\nsolvers generally require large computational cost. Non-gray modeling imposes\nsignificant additional complexity to the numerical simulations, which hinders\nthe modeling of real nanoscale systems. In this work, we address this issue by\na systematic investigation on the phonon band discretization scheme using real\nmaterial properties of four representative materials, including silicon,\ngallium arsenide, diamond, and lead telluride. We find that the schemes used in\nprevious studies require at least a few tens of bands to ensure the accuracy,\nwhich requires large computational costs. We then propose an improved band\ndiscretization scheme, in which we divide the mean free path domain into two\nsubdomains, one on either side of the inflection point of the mean free path\naccumulated thermal conductivity and adopt the Gauss-Legendre quadrature for\neach subdomain. With this scheme, the solution of phonon BTE converges (error <\n1%) with less than 10 phonon bands for all these materials. The proposed scheme\nallows to significantly reduce the time and memory consumption of the numerical\nBTE solver, which is an important step towards large-scale phonon BTE\nsimulation for real materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 08:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

The\nacceleration of electrons by this type of laser pulse is analysed as a function\nof radial mode number and it is shown that the radial mode number has a\nprofound effect on electron acceleration close to the laser axis.Using\nthree-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations a circular-polarized helical\nlaser beam with power of 0.6 PW is shown to produce several dense attosecond\nbunches.

Nevertheless, it can be challenging for edge\ninfrastructure providers (EIPs) with limited edge resources to support IoT\napplications performed in a CDC approach in edge networks, given the additional\ncomputational resources required by CDC. In this paper, we propose coded edge\nfederation, in which different EIPs collaboratively provide edge resources for\nCDC tasks. To study the Nash equilibrium, when no EIP has an incentive to\nunilaterally alter its decision on edge resource allocation, we model the coded\nedge federation based on evolutionary game theory. Since the replicator\ndynamics of the classical evolutionary game are unable to model economic-aware\nEIPs which memorize past decisions and utilities, we propose fractional\nreplicator dynamics with a power-law fading memory via Caputo fractional\nderivatives. The proposed dynamics allow us to study a broad spectrum of EIP\ndynamic behaviors, such as EIP sensitivity and aggressiveness in strategy\nadaptation, which classical replicator dynamics cannot capture. Theoretical\nanalysis and extensive numerical results justify the existence, uniqueness, and\nstability of the equilibrium in the fractional evolutionary game.

In this\npaper, we compare the time evolution of $R_J$ and $\\dot{M}_{in}$ for the four\noutbursts.

We also compute the radiative efficiency in X-rays during the\ncycles and consider its impact on the radio--X-ray correlation. Within the\nJED-SAD paradigm, we find that the accretion flow is always radiatively\nefficient in the hard states, with between $15\\%$ and $40\\%$ of the accretion\npower being radiated away at any given time.

These changes give birth to two different regimes\nwith different radiative efficiencies: the thick disk and the slim disk. While\nthe existence of these two regimes is intrinsically linked to the JED-SAD\nmodel, we show direct observational evidence of the presence of two different\nregimes using the evolution of the X-ray power-law spectral index, a\nmodel-independent estimate.

It is well known that designs that are optimal\nover certain exponential families can achieve expected regret that grows\nlogarithmically in the number of arm plays, at a rate governed by the\nLai-Robbins lower bound. In this paper, we show that when one uses such\noptimized designs, the regret distribution of the associated algorithms\nnecessarily has a very heavy tail, specifically, that of a truncated Cauchy\ndistribution. Furthermore, for $p>1$, the $p$'th moment of the regret\ndistribution grows much faster than poly-logarithmically, in particular as a\npower of the total number of arm plays. We show that optimized UCB bandit\ndesigns are also fragile in an additional sense, namely when the problem is\neven slightly mis-specified, the regret can grow much faster than the\nconventional theory suggests. Our arguments are based on standard\nchange-of-measure ideas, and indicate that the most likely way that regret\nbecomes larger than expected is when the optimal arm returns below-average\nrewards in the first few arm plays, thereby causing the algorithm to believe\nthat the arm is sub-optimal. To alleviate the fragility issues exposed, we show\nthat UCB algorithms can be modified so as to ensure a desired degree of\nrobustness to mis-specification. In doing so, we also provide a sharp trade-off\nbetween the amount of UCB exploration and the tail exponent of the resulting\nregret distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 10:11:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 08:34:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 16:01:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 00:42:38 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 00:57:23 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 00:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

This is significant in understanding and\ncontrolling thermo-acoustic phenomena, particularly in combustors. This work\naims at quantifying the acoustic energy change in such configurations, using\nthe acoustic absorption coefficient, $\\Delta$. The acoustic response of the\nduct to acoustic forcing is determined using an analytical model, neglecting\nthe effect of entropy fluctuations on the acoustic field, and subsequently,\n$\\Delta$ is estimated. The model predictions of $\\Delta$ are validated using a\nlinearised Euler equations (LEEs) solver. The model was found to be accurate\nfor Mach numbers below $0.25$, provided the lower frequency limit set by the\nanalytical solution is satisfied. For conically varying area ducts with linear\nmean temperature gradient, it was observed that $\\Delta$ showed very little\ndependence on frequency, and that the absolute value of $\\Delta$ tended to be\nmaximised when the upstream boundary was anechoic rather than non-anechoic.\nMore importantly, $\\Delta$ was also observed to show stronger dependence on the\nmean temperature gradient than area gradient variation for such configurations.\nFurther parametric and optimisation studies for $\\Delta$ revealed a crucial\nfinding that a positive mean temperature gradient, representing a heated duct\ncaused acoustic energy absorption. Similarly, a negative mean temperature\ngradient, representing a cooled duct caused acoustic energy generation -- a key\nresult of this analysis. This behaviour was shown to be consistent with a\nsimplified analysis of the acoustic energy balance. Based on this finding, a\nlinearly proportional reduction in acoustic energy generation was achieved by\nchanging the mean temperature gradient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 11:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

The property of keeping sensitive data inside the\ndevice is even more important in this setting as a vulnerable application might\nexpose the full API to an attacker.

By dynamically tuning the reflection\namplitudes/phase shifts of a large number of passive elements, IRS enables\nflexible wireless channel control and configuration, and thereby enhances the\nwireless signal transmission rate and reliability significantly. Despite the\nvast literature on designing and optimizing assorted IRS-aided wireless\nsystems, prior works have mainly focused on enhancing wireless links with\nsingle signal reflection only by one or multiple IRSs, which may be\ninsufficient to boost the wireless link capacity under some harsh propagation\nconditions (e.g., indoor environment with dense blockages/obstructions). This\nissue can be tackled by employing two or more IRSs to assist each wireless link\nand jointly exploiting their single as well as multiple signal reflections over\nthem. However, the resultant double-/multi-IRS aided wireless systems face more\ncomplex design issues as well as new practical challenges for implementation as\ncompared to the conventional single-IRS counterpart, in terms of IRS reflection\noptimization, channel acquisition, as well as IRS deployment and\nassociation/selection. As such, a new paradigm for designing multi-IRS\ncooperative passive beamforming and joint active/passive beam routing arises\nwhich calls for innovative design approaches and optimization methods.

Despite decades of experimental\nand modelling studies, the exact underlying mechanisms behind hydrogen\nembrittlement remain elusive. To unlock understanding of the mechanism and\nthereby help mitigate the influence of hydrogen and the associated\nembrittlement, it is essential to examine the interactions of hydrogen with\nstructural defects such as grain boundaries, dislocations and stacking faults.\nAtom probe tomography (APT) can, in principle, analyse hydrogen located\nspecifically at such microstructural features but faces strong challenges when\nit comes to charging specimens with hydrogen or deuterium. Here, we describe\nthree different workflows enabling hydrogen/deuterium charging of site-specific\nAPT specimens: namely cathodic, plasma and gas charging. We discuss in detail\nthe caveats of the different approaches in order to help with future research\nefforts and facilitate further studies of hydrogen in metals. Our study\ndemonstrates successful cathodic and gas charging, with the latter being more\npromising for the analysis of the high-strength steels at the core of our work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 12:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

This improves upon other estimates of the SFR in simulations of\njet--ISM interactions, which are often solely based on local gas density,\nneglecting the impact of turbulence. We apply this framework to the results of\na suite of jet-ISM interaction simulations to study how the jet regulates the\nSFR both globally and on the scale of individual star-forming clouds. We find\nthat the jet strongly affects the multi-phase ISM in the galaxy, inducing\nturbulence and increasing the velocity dispersion within the clouds. This\ncauses a global reduction in the SFR compared to a simulation without a jet.\nThe shocks driven into clouds by the jet also compress the gas to higher\ndensities, resulting in local enhancements of the SFR. However, the velocity\ndispersion in such clouds is also comparably high, which results in a lower SFR\nthan would be observed in galaxies with similar gas mass surface densities and\nwithout powerful radio jets. We thus show that both local negative and positive\njet feedback can occur in a single system during a single jet event, and that\nthe star-formation rate in the ISM varies in a complicated manner that depends\non the strength of the jet-ISM coupling and the jet break-out time-scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 12:16:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 02:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

This keeps undue interference among users under control. A QCSS\nperforms better than the perfect complementary sequence set (PCSS) does in\nschemes with fractional delays.\n  The optimality of a set of periodic sequences is measured by its maximum\nperiodic correlation magnitude, for which there is an established lower bound\nto aim at.

Recently however, it was argued that an effective\nfriction, scaling as $\\gamma_w^2$ (with $\\gamma_w$ being the Lorentz factor for\nthe bubble wall velocity), persists in local equilibrium. This was derived\nassuming constant plasma temperature and velocity throughout the wall. On the\nother hand, it is known that, at the leading order in derivatives, the plasma\nin local equilibrium only contributes a correction to the zero-temperature\npotential in the equation of motion of the background scalar field. For a\nconstant plasma temperature, the equation of motion is then completely\nanalogous to the vacuum case, the only change being a modified potential, and\nthus no friction should appear. We resolve these apparent contradictions in the\ncalculations and their interpretation and show that the recently proposed\neffective friction in local equilibrium originates from inhomogeneous\ntemperature distributions, such that the $\\gamma_w^2$-scaling of the effective\nforce is violated. Further, we propose a new matching condition for the\nhydrodynamic quantities in the plasma valid in local equilibrium and tied to\nlocal entropy conservation. With this added constraint, bubble velocities in\nlocal equilibrium can be determined once the parameters in the equation of\nstate are fixed, where we use the bag equation in order to illustrate this\npoint.

A significant challenge in the development\nof MEMS gravimeters is maintaining stability over long time periods, which is\nessential for long term monitoring applications.

Our photonic lattice provides a useful platform to study the\ninterplay among topological phases, symmetries, and the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 13:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

Prior\nmethods mainly focus on single-task speech restoration (SSR), such as speech\ndenoising or speech declipping. However, SSR systems only focus on one task and\ndo not address the general speech restoration problem. In addition, previous\nSSR systems show limited performance in some speech restoration tasks such as\nspeech super-resolution. To overcome those limitations, we propose a general\nspeech restoration (GSR) task that attempts to remove multiple distortions\nsimultaneously. Furthermore, we propose VoiceFixer, a generative framework to\naddress the GSR task. VoiceFixer consists of an analysis stage and a synthesis\nstage to mimic the speech analysis and comprehension of the human auditory\nsystem. We employ a ResUNet to model the analysis stage and a neural vocoder to\nmodel the synthesis stage. We evaluate VoiceFixer with additive noise, room\nreverberation, low-resolution, and clipping distortions. Our baseline GSR model\nachieves a 0.499 higher mean opinion score (MOS) than the speech enhancement\nSSR model. VoiceFixer further surpasses the GSR baseline model on the MOS score\nby 0.256. Moreover, we observe that VoiceFixer generalizes well to severely\ndegraded real speech recordings, indicating its potential in restoring old\nmovies and historical speeches.

A comparative study is\nconducted by employing conventional non-magnetic heavy-metals (Ta, W or Mo)\ncapping layers along with an anti-ferromagnetic IrMn in a symmetric-MTJ\nX/FeCo/MgO/FeCo/X, where X=Ta, W, Mo or IrMn. Firstly, the calculations without\nincluding spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are presented where the highest TMR is\nachieved in IrMn-IrMn MTJ compared to that of Ta-Ta, W-W and Mo-Mo MTJs. The\norigin of this large TMR is attributed to, both, the large spin-polarization\ndue to reduced lattice-mismatch and the non-identical signatures of both the\nanti-parallel conduction-channels caused by the anti-ferromagnetic ordering of\nIrMn that reflects the spins at IrMn/FeCo interface. Moreover, when SOC is\nswitched-on, the increase of TMR is observed in all the MTJs with a\nparticularly giant enhancement in IrMn-IrMn MTJ. This SOC-induced increase in\nTMR is ascribed to the mixed contribution of $\\Delta_1$ and $\\Delta_5$ states\nand the additional increase in the band levels of the out-of-plane orbitals,\n\\emph{p}$_z$, \\emph{d}$_{z}^2$ and \\emph{d}$_{xz}$ due to the lifting of\ndegeneracy. Furthermore, it was also observed that the lattice-mismatch-induced\nstrain might create an orbital reconstruction within the capping layer,\nprobably, due to the crystallographic deformation and, in turn, in the adjacent\nFeCo-electrode. This microscopic mechanism also plays an additional decisive\nrole in enhancing the TMR. Finally, our results indicate that IrMn can offer\ngiant TMR in future spin-orbit toque (SOT) based MRAM devices with a\nstraightforward design strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 13:57:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 19:25:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

Specifically, we\nfirst exploit an auto-encoder to represent input data samples with latent\nfeatures for the construction of an attribute matrix. We also construct a mixed\nsigned and symmetric structure matrix to capture the local geometric structure\nunderlying data samples. Then, we perform self-expressiveness on the\nconstructed attribute and structure matrices to learn their affinity graphs\nseparately. Finally, we design a novel attention-based fusion module to\nadaptively leverage these two affinity graphs to construct a more\ndiscriminative affinity graph. Extensive experimental results on commonly used\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that our AASSC-Net significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Recent\ndevelopments in both areas increased their synergistic overlap. By microfluidic\nintegration, many complex experimental steps can be brought together onto a\nsingle platform. Microfluidic devices are therefore increasingly finding\napplications in medical diagnostics, forensic analysis, and biomedical\nresearch. In particular, they provide novel and powerful ways to culture cells,\ncell aggregates, and even functional models of entire organs. Nuclear magnetic\nresonance is a non-invasive, high-resolution spectroscopic technique which\nallows real-time process monitoring with chemical specificity. It is ideally\nsuited for observing metabolic and other biological and chemical processes in\nmicrofluidic systems. However, its intrinsically low sensitivity has limited\nits application. Recent advances in nuclear hyperpolarization techniques may\nchange this: under special circumstances, it is possible to enhance NMR signals\nby up to 5 orders of magnitude, which dramatically extends the utility of NMR\nin the context of microfluidic systems. At the same time, hyperpolarization\nrequires complex chemical and/or physical manipulations, which in turn may\nbenefit from microfluidic implementation. In fact, many hyperpolarization\nmethodologies rely on processes that are more efficient at the micro-scale,\nsuch as molecular diffusion, penetration electromagnetic radiation into the\nsample, or restricted molecular mobility on a surface. In this review we\nexamine the confluence between the fields of hyperpolarization-enhanced NMR and\nmicrofluidics, and assess how these areas of research have mutually benefited\none another, and will continue to do so.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 14:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

The\nhigh sensitivity of Sagnac interferometry permits for the first time optical\nquantification of spin-orbit torque from small-angle magnetic tilting of\nsamples with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). We find significant\ndisagreement between Sagnac measurements and simultaneously-performed harmonic\nHall (HH) measurements of spin-orbit torque on Pt/Co/MgO and Pd/Co/MgO samples\nwith PMA. The Sagnac results for PMA samples are consistent with both HH and\nSagnac measurements for the in-plane geometry, so we conclude that the\nconventional analysis framework for PMA HH measurements is flawed. We suggest\nthat the explanation for this discrepancy is that although magnetic-field\ninduced magnetic tilting in PMA samples can produce a strong planar Hall\neffect, when tilting is instead generated by spin-orbit torque it produces\nnegligible change in the planar Hall signal. This very surprising result\ndemonstrates an error in the most-popular method for measuring spin-orbit\ntorques in PMA samples, and represents an unsolved puzzle in understanding the\nplanar Hall effect in magnetic thin films.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 14:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

The foundations of these relationships\nare rooted in the decision making of individuals, and whether they choose to be\nselfish or altruistic. How individuals choose their behaviors can be analyzed\nusing a strategy optimization process in the framework of game theory. Previous\nstudies have shown that reference to individuals' previous actions plays an\nimportant role in their choice of strategies and establishment of social\nrelationships. A fundamental question remains as to whether an individual with\nmore information can exploit another who has less information when learning the\nchoice of strategies. Here we demonstrate that a player using a memory-one\nstrategy, who can refer to their own previous action and that of their\nopponent, can be exploited by a reactive player, who only has the information\nof the other player, based on mutual adaptive learning. This is\ncounterintuitive because the former has more choice in strategies and can\npotentially obtain a higher payoff. We demonstrated this by formulating the\nlearning process of strategy choices to optimize the payoffs in terms of\ncoupled replicator dynamics and applying it to the prisoner's dilemma game.\nFurther, we show that the player using a memory-one strategy, by referring to\ntheir previous experience, can sometimes act more generous toward the\nopponent's defection, thereby accepting the opponent's exploitation. Mainly, we\nfound that through adaptive learning, a player with limited information usually\nexploits the player with more information, leading to asymmetric exploitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 15:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

Population Based Training (PBT) has\nrecently been proposed to automate this process. PBT trains a population of\nneural networks concurrently, frequently mutating their hyperparameters\nthroughout their training. However, the decision mechanisms of PBT are greedy\nand favour short-term improvements which can, in some cases, lead to poor\nlong-term performance. This paper presents Faster Improvement Rate PBT (FIRE\nPBT) which addresses this problem. Our method is guided by an assumption: given\ntwo neural networks with similar performance and training with similar\nhyperparameters, the network showing the faster rate of improvement will lead\nto a better final performance. Using this, we derive a novel fitness metric and\nuse it to make some of the population members focus on long-term performance.\nOur experiments show that FIRE PBT is able to outperform PBT on the ImageNet\nbenchmark and match the performance of networks that were trained with a\nhand-tuned learning rate schedule. We apply FIRE PBT to reinforcement learning\ntasks and show that it leads to faster learning and higher final performance\nthan both PBT and random hyperparameter search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 15:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

The method\nutilizes the GDMaps to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the\nunderlying behavior of physical/mathematical systems with respect to\nuncertainties in the input parameters. Using this representation, geometric\nharmonics, an out-of-sample function extension technique, is employed to create\na global map from the space of input parameters to a Grassmannian diffusion\nmanifold. Geometric harmonics is also employed to locally map points on the\ndiffusion manifold onto the tangent space of a Grassmann manifold. The\nexponential map is then used to project the points in the tangent space onto\nthe Grassmann manifold, where reconstruction of the full solution is performed.\nThe performance of the proposed surrogate modeling is verified with three\nexamples.

In the second example, errors associated with the various\nmappings employed in the technique are assessed by studying response\npredictions of the electric potential of a dielectric cylinder in a homogeneous\nelectric field.

A\n3D model of the solar atmosphere from the MHD code Bifrost was used to produce\nhigh-cadence observables at mm and submm wavelengths.

Responding to a change of these dynamics is\ncritical for the fitness of living flow networks, e.g. the animal vasculature,\nwhich are subject to frequent and sudden shifts when the pump (the heart)\ntransitions between different steady states. The combination of flow\nresistance, fluid inertia, and elasticity of the vessel walls causes the flow\nand pressure of the fluid throughout the network to respond to these\ntransitions and adapt to the new power source operating profiles over a nonzero\ntime scale. We find that this response time can exist in one of two possible\nregimes; one dominated by the decay rate of travelling wavefronts and\nindependent of system size, and one dominated by the diffusive nature of the\nfluid mechanical energy over large length scales. These regimes are shown to\nexist for both single vessels and hierarchically structured networks with\nsystems smaller than a critical size in the former and larger systems in the\nlater.

Research endeavours\ninvolving WBAN are directed towards effective transmission of detected\nparameters to a Local Processing Unit (LPU, usually a mobile device) and\nanalysis of the parameters at the LPU or a back-end cloud. An important concern\nin WBAN is the lightweight nature of WBAN nodes and the need to conserve their\nenergy. This is especially true for subcutaneously implanted nodes that cannot\nbe recharged or regularly replaced. Work in energy conservation is mostly aimed\nat optimising the routing of signals to minimise energy expended. In this\npaper, a simple yet innovative approach to energy conservation and detection of\nalarming health status is proposed. Energy conservation is ensured through a\ntwo-tier approach wherein the first tier eliminates `uninteresting' health\nparameter readings at the site of a sensing node and prevents these from being\ntransmitted across the WBAN to the LPU. A reading is categorised as\nuninteresting if it deviates very slightly from its immediately preceding\nreading and does not provide new insight on the patient's well being. In\naddition to this, readings that are faulty and emanate from possible sensor\nmalfunctions are also eliminated. These eliminations are done at the site of\nthe sensor using algorithms that are light enough to effectively function in\nthe extremely resource-constrained environments of the sensor nodes. We notice,\nthrough experiments, that this eliminates and thus reduces around 90% of the\nreadings that need to be transmitted to the LPU leading to significant energy\nsavings. Furthermore, the proper functioning of these algorithms in such\nconstrained environments is confirmed and validated over a hardware simulation\nset up. The second tier of assessment includes a proposed anomaly detection\nmodel at the LPU that is capable of identifying anomalies from streaming health\nparameter readings and indicates an adverse medical condition. In addition to\nbeing able to handle streaming data, the model works within the\nresource-constrained environments of an LPU and eliminates the need of\ntransmitting the data to a back-end cloud, ensuring further energy savings. The\nanomaly detection capability of the model is validated using data available\nfrom the critical care units of hospitals and is shown to be superior to other\nanomaly detection techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

The dosimeter\ndemonstrated a very good stability despite the high value of the absorbed dose\nduring the performed experiments (about 100 Gy). The measured dose-per-pulse\nvalues of 278 uGy and 556 uGy at 6 MV and 18 MV, respectively, are in excellent\nagreement with the nominal values expected for the LINAC apparatus used for the\ntests. In addition to single-pulse measurements, fundamental for dynamic\nradiotherapy, the proposed system also allows for the calculation of both the\ntotal collected charge and the photocurrent generated by the detector.

Mobile applications consist of environments\nwith low computational resources and hence imply limitations in the design\ndecisions during the AI-enabled software engineering lifecycle that balance the\ntrade-off between the accuracy and the complexity of the mobile applications.\n  Objective: Our objective is to systematically assess the trade-off between\naccuracy and complexity when deploying complex AI models (e.g. neural networks)\nto mobile devices, which have an implicit resource limitation. We aim to cover\n(i) the impact of the design decisions on the achievement of high-accuracy and\nlow resource-consumption implementations; and (ii) the validation of profiling\ntools for systematically promoting greener AI.\n  Method: This confirmatory registered report consists of a plan to conduct an\nempirical study to quantify the implications of the design decisions on\nAI-enabled applications performance and to report experiences of the end-to-end\nAI-enabled software engineering lifecycle.

This study examines singlet\nexciton dynamics occurring within a typical LSC device. To do this, we use a\nrejection-free kinetic Monte Carlo method to predict diffusion lengths,\ndiffusion coefficients, substrate anisotropy, and average exciton lifetimes of\nperylene diimide (PDI) and tetracene based substrates in the low concentration\nscheme. \\textit{Ab initio} rate constants are computed using time-dependant\ndensity functional theory based methods.

Finally, a PDI-tetracene substrate is simulated for both\ndisordered and dipole-aligned chromophore configurations. In this multi-dopant\nsubstrate transport is predominantly mediated by PDI due to the asymmetry in\nthe transport rates between the two dyes considered. We conclude discussing the\nproperties of multi-dopant substrates and how they can impact the design of\nnext generation LSCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

Model-based fault detection and isolation\nmethods use system model to generate a set of residuals as the bases for fault\ndetection and isolation. However, in many complex systems it is not feasible to\ndevelop highly accurate models for the systems and to keep the models updated\nduring the system lifetime. Recently, data-driven solutions have received an\nimmense attention in the industries systems for several practical reasons.\nFirst, these methods do not require the initial investment and expertise for\ndeveloping accurate models. Moreover, it is possible to automatically update\nand retrain the diagnosers as the system or the environment change over time.\nFinally, unlike the model-based methods it is straight forward to combine time\nseries measurements such as pressure and voltage with other sources of\ninformation such as system operating hours to achieve a higher accuracy. In\nthis paper, we extend the traditional model-based fault detection and isolation\nconcepts such as residuals, and detectable and isolable faults to the\ndata-driven domain. We then propose an algorithm to automatically generate\nresiduals from the normal operating data. We present the performance of our\nproposed approach through a comparative case study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 03:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}
