Atmospheric simulations and\nsynthetic observables of target exoplanets are essential to prepare and\ninterpret these observations. Here we report the results of the first part of\nthe TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison (THAI) project, which\ncompares 3D numerical simulations performed with four state-of-the-art global\nclimate models (ExoCAM, LMD-Generic, ROCKE-3D, Unified Model) for the\npotentially habitable target TRAPPIST-1e. In this first part, we present the\nresults of dry atmospheric simulations. These simulations serve as a benchmark\nto test how radiative transfer, subgrid-scale mixing (dry turbulence and\nconvection), and large-scale dynamics impact the climate of TRAPPIST-1e and\nconsequently the transit spectroscopy signature as seen by JWST. To first\norder, the four models give results in good agreement. The intermodel spread in\nthe global mean surface temperature amounts to 7K (6K) for the N2-dominated\n(CO2-dominated) atmosphere. The radiative fluxes are also remarkably similar\n(intermodel variations less than 5%), from the surface (1 bar) up to\natmospheric pressures around 5 mbar. Moderate differences between the models\nappear in the atmospheric circulation pattern (winds) and the (stratospheric)\nthermal structure. These differences arise between the models from (1)\nlarge-scale dynamics, because TRAPPIST-1e lies at the tipping point between two\ndifferent circulation regimes (fast and Rhines rotators) in which the models\ncan be alternatively trapped, and (2) parameterizations used in the upper\natmosphere such as numerical damping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 16:03:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 17:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

Due to parameterization choices\nmade in GCMs, they can produce different results, even for the same planet.\nEmploying four widely-used exoplanetary GCMs -- ExoCAM, LMD-G, ROCKE-3D and the\nUM -- we continue the TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison by\nmodeling aquaplanet climates of TRAPPIST-1e with a moist atmosphere dominated\nby either nitrogen or carbon dioxide. Although the GCMs disagree on the details\nof the simulated regimes, they all predict a temperate climate with neither of\nthe two cases pushed out of the habitable state. Nevertheless, the inter-model\nspread in the global mean surface temperature is non-negligible: 14 K and 24 K\nin the nitrogen and carbon dioxide dominated case, respectively. We find\nsubstantial inter-model differences in moist variables, with the smallest\namount of clouds in LMD-Generic and the largest in ROCKE-3D. ExoCAM predicts\nthe warmest climate for both cases and thus has the highest water vapor content\nand the largest amount and variability of cloud condensate. The UM tends to\nproduce colder conditions, especially in the nitrogen-dominated case due to a\nstrong negative cloud radiative effect on the day side of TRAPPIST-1e. Our\nstudy highlights various biases of GCMs and emphasizes the importance of not\nrelying solely on one model to understand exoplanet climates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 16:04:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 16:59:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

Four GCMs have participated in\nTHAI so far: ExoCAM, LMD-Generic, ROCKE-3D and the UM.

For the\naquaplanet ones, using atmospheric data from any of the four GCMs would require\nat least 17 transits. This prediction corresponds to UM simulated data which\nproduces the lowest and thinnest clouds. Between 35-40% more clouds are\npredicted by ExoCAM or LMD-G due to higher thick terminator clouds. For the\nfirst time this work provides \"GCM uncertainty error bars\" of 35-40% that need\nto be considered in future analyses of transmission spectra.

The poor performance of\nreplanners in such problems is due to their all-outcome determinization.

Our model again finds that TPW is a viable mechanism\nfor the formation and present-day location of SP. We find that the initial\nimpact basin could have been located north of the present-day location, at\nlatitudes between 35 N and 50 N. The empty basin is constrained to be 2.5 -- 3\nkm deep, with enough N2 available to form at most a 1 -- 2 km thick ice sheet.\nLarger N2 inventories reorient too close to the anti-Charon point. After\nreaching the final location, the ice sheet undergoes short periods of\nsublimation and re-condensation on the order of ten meters of ice, due Pluto's\nvariable obliquity cycle, which drives short periods of reorientation of a few\nkm. The obliquity cycle also has a role in the onset of infilling; some initial\nbasin locations are only able to begin accumulating N2 ice at certain points\nduring the obliquity cycle. We also explore the sensitivity of the coupled\nmodel to albedo, initial obliquity, and Pluto's orbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 16:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-24"}

They help\nus to have a better understanding of the mechanism from multi-angle, and\ninspire us to propose some interesting generalizations. In the first proof, we\nrevisit the non-linear representation method and rephrase the argument with the\ninteraction eigenstates. In this picture, the phase mode (DM) can only have a\ntrilinear interaction with a derivative-squared acting on the radial mode when\nthe DM is on-shell. Thus, the DM-quark scattering generated by a mass mixing\nbetween the radial mode and the Higgs boson vanishes in the limit of\nzero-momentum transfer. Using the same method, we can easily generalize the\nmodel to an SO(N) model with general soft-breaking structures. In particular,\nwe study the soft-breaking cubic terms and identify those terms which preserve\nthe cancellation mechanism for the DM candidate. In our discussion of the\nsecond method, we find that the cancellation relies on the special structure of\nmass terms and interactions of the mediators. This condition can be\nstraightforwardly generalized to the vector-portal models. We provide two\nexamples of the vector-portal case where the first one is an SU(2)_L \\times\nU(1)_Y \\times U(1)_X model and the second one is an SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y\n\\times U(1)_(B-L) \\times U(1)_X model. In the first model, the vector mediators\nare the Z_nu boson and a new U(1)_X gauge boson X_nu, while in the second model\nthe mediators are the U(1)_(B-L) and U(1)_X gauge bosons. The cancellation\nmechanism works in both models when there are no generic kinetic mixing terms\nfor the gauge bosons. Once the generic kinetic mixing terms are included, the\nfirst model requires a fine-tuning of the mixing parameter to avoid the\nstringent direct detection bound, while the second model can naturally\ncircumvent it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 17:03:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 16:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Upon neglecting both\ntrigonal warping terms for the untwisted layers and the same sublattice hopping\nbetween all layers, the resulting models generalize several remarkable features\nof the chiral model of twisted bilayer graphene (CTBG). In particular, they\nexhibit a set of magic angles which are identical to those of CTBG at which a\npair of bands (i) are perfectly flat, (ii) have Chern numbers in the sublattice\nbasis given by $\\pm (n,-m)$ or $\\pm (n + m - 1, -1)$ depending on the stacking\nchirality, and (iii) satisfy the trace condition, saturating an inequality\nbetween the quantum metric and the Berry curvature, and thus realizing ideal\nquantum geometry. These are the first higher Chern bands that satisfy (iii)\nbeyond fine-tuned models or combinations of Landau levels. We show that ideal\nquantum geometry is directly related to the construction of fractional quantum\nHall model wavefunctions. We provide explicit analytic expressions for the flat\nband wavefunctions at the magic angle in terms of the CTBG wavefunctions. We\nalso show that the Berry curvature distribution in these models can be\ncontinuously tuned while maintaining perfect quantum geometry. Similar to the\nstudy of fractional Chern insulators in ideal $C = 1$ bands, these models pave\nthe way for investigating exotic topological phases in higher Chern bands for\nwhich no Landau level analog is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 17:35:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 20:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

The most accurate approaches are based on fully supervised learning\nmodels, which rely on a large amount of dense and high-resolution (HR)\nground-truth depth maps. However, in practice, color images are usually\ncaptured with much higher resolution than depth maps, leading to the\nresolution-mismatched effect. In this paper, we propose a novel\nweakly-supervised framework to train a monocular depth estimation network to\ngenerate HR depth maps with resolution-mismatched supervision, i.e., the inputs\nare HR color images and the ground-truth are low-resolution (LR) depth maps.\nThe proposed weakly supervised framework is composed of a sharing weight\nmonocular depth estimation network and a depth reconstruction network for\ndistillation. Specifically, for the monocular depth estimation network the\ninput color image is first downsampled to obtain its LR version with the same\nresolution as the ground-truth depth. Then, both HR and LR color images are fed\ninto the proposed monocular depth estimation network to obtain the\ncorresponding estimated depth maps. We introduce three losses to train the\nnetwork: 1) reconstruction loss between the estimated LR depth and the\nground-truth LR depth; 2) reconstruction loss between the downsampled estimated\nHR depth and the ground-truth LR depth; 3) consistency loss between the\nestimated LR depth and the downsampled estimated HR depth. In addition, we\ndesign a depth reconstruction network from depth to depth. Through distillation\nloss, features between two networks maintain the structural consistency in\naffinity space, and finally improving the estimation network performance.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance\nthan unsupervised and semi-supervised learning based schemes, and is\ncompetitive or even better compared to supervised ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 18:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

In\nthis work, we address current challenges in data-driven RUL prediction for\nrotating machinery.

They\nabsorb energy from a time-dependent external magnetic field and transfer it\ninto their environment. In the so-called superlocalization, the combination of\nan applied oscillating and a static magnetic field gradient provides even more\nfocused heating since for large enough static field the dissipation is\nconsiderably reduced. Similar effect was found in the deterministic study of\nthe rotating field combined with a static field gradient. Here we study\ntheoretically the influence of thermal effects on superlocalization and on\nheating efficiency. We demonstrate that when time-dependent steady state\nmotions of the magnetisation vector are present in the zero temperature limit,\nthen deterministic and stochastic results are very similar to each other. We\nalso show that when steady state motions are absent, the superlocalization is\nseverely reduced by thermal effects. Our most important finding is that in the\nlow frequency range ($\\omega \\to 0$) suitable for hyperthermia, the oscillating\napplied field is shown to result in two times larger intrinsic loss power and\nspecific absorption rate then the rotating one with identical superlocalization\nability which has importance in technical realisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 18:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

Using an\nevaluation framework which uses real, parametrizable malware, we develop a game\nthat is played by a defender against attackers with a suite of malware that is\nparameterized to be more aggressive and more stealthy. These results are\nevaluated under a framework of exponential utility according to their\nwillingness to accept risk.

However, the role of\nstationary versus non-stationary attributes is less explored: Stationary\nfeatures, which remain similar throughout the video, enable the prediction of\nvideo-level action classes. Non-stationary features, which represent temporally\nvarying attributes, are more beneficial for downstream tasks involving more\nfine-grained temporal understanding, such as action segmentation. We argue that\na single representation to capture both types of features is sub-optimal, and\npropose to decompose the representation space into stationary and\nnon-stationary features via contrastive learning from long and short views,\ni.e. long video sequences and their shorter sub-sequences. Stationary features\nare shared between the short and long views, while non-stationary features\naggregate the short views to match the corresponding long view.

We propose improvements in rollout allocation, the action\nexploration algorithm, and plan commitment. The first allocates a different\nnumber of rollouts depending on how many actions the agent has taken in an\nepisode. We find that rollouts are more valuable after some initial information\nis gained about the environment. Thus, a linear increase in the number of\nrollouts, i.e. allocating a fixed number at each step, is not appropriate for\nadaptive sampling tasks. The second alters which actions the agent chooses to\nexplore when building the planning tree. We find that by using knowledge of the\nnumber of rollouts allocated, the agent can more effectively choose actions to\nexplore. The third improvement is in determining how many actions the agent\nshould take from one plan. Typically, an agent will plan to take the first\naction from the planning tree and then call the planner again from the new\nstate. Using statistical techniques, we show that it is possible to greatly\nreduce the number of rollouts by increasing the number of actions taken from a\nsingle planning tree without affecting the agent's final reward. Finally, we\ndemonstrate experimentally, on simulated and real aquatic data from an\nunderwater robot, that these improvements can be combined, leading to better\nadaptive sampling.

However, highly accurate data sharing and low communication\noverhead is a big challenge for collective perception, especially when\nreal-time communication is required among connected and automated vehicles. In\nthis paper, we propose an efficient and effective keypoints-based deep feature\nfusion framework built on the 3D object detector PV-RCNN, called Fusion PV-RCNN\n(FPV-RCNN for short), for collective perception. We introduce a\nhigh-performance bounding box proposal matching module and a keypoints\nselection strategy to compress the CPM size and solve the multi-vehicle data\nfusion problem.

Oxygen crosses the placenta by diffusion and placental\npermeability to O$_2$ is high. Thus, the fetus receives adequate amounts, but\nvascular Po$_2$ is much lower than after birth. Studies of sustained fetal\nhypoxemia and acute 40-45% hemorrhage show that hypoxemia is not tolerated\nwhereas hemorrhage is. This suggests that if fetal Po$_2$ falls markedly, O$_2$\ndiffusion from blood to tissue is impaired. Uterine blood and umbilical blood\nflows/fetal weight fall progressively with advancing gestation. This results in\nfetal hypoxemia, an increase in Pco$_2$, and decrease in pH. This decreases\nfetal O$_2$ delivery, and in fetal lambs and horses there is a decrease in\nfetal O$_2$ consumption. The decrease in O$_2$ demands is linked to a decrease\nin fetal breathing and body movements and growth rate. The decrease in fetal\nmotility is due to an increase in fetal plasma PGE2 concentration, which begins\nat ~120 days GA in sheep and is due to the prepartum rise in fetal cortisol.\nAlso, adenosine administration to fetal lambs decreases fetal breathing and REM\nsleep and the plasma adenosine concentration increases in late gestation. The\nfetal plasma levels of neurosteroids, which suppress fetal motility, increase\nwith advancing gestation. The prepartum cortisol rise also inhibits fetal\ngrowth. In normal pregnancies, these mechanisms operate effectively to maintain\nan appropriate balance between fetal oxygen consumption and delivery. However,\nin pregnancies with either further reduce O$_2$ delivery or increase fetal\nO$_2$ demands, the mismatch between O$_2$ delivery and consumption may worsen\nleading to IUGR, hypoxic organ damage or stillbirth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

Additionally, split forms are examined as they enable the\ndevelopment of energy stability proofs. The first critical step proves, that in\ncurvilinear coordinates, the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) conservative and\nnon-conservative forms are inherently different--even under exact integration\nand analytically exact metric terms. This analysis demonstrates that the split\nform is essential to developing provably stable DG schemes on curvilinear\ncoordinates and motivates the construction of metric dependent ESFR correction\nfunctions in each element.

Unfortunately, studies of protests often lack\npanel data and cannot address how particular users change their behaviour over\ntime in line with the protest agenda. To this end, we analyze a new dataset of\nthe Facebook page EuroMaydan that was explicitly created to facilitate the\nprotest in Ukraine from November 2013 to February 2014. Moreover, our analysis\nfollows this page even after the end of the protest till June 2014. In total,\nthe dataset includes 26,631 posts and 1,470,593 comments that were generated by\n124,790 users during and after the protests. We use this panel data to test how\nparticular users switch between the two most popular languages of this page:\nUkrainian and Russian. Previous studies have puzzled with language behaviour\nduring the Ukrainian protest. Although researchers expected to see more\nUkrainian language due to national mobilization, studies discovered that\nUkrainian protesters frequently used Russian, especially after the end of the\nprotest. A hypothesis was suggested that protesters use language strategically\ndepending on circumstances (e.g., to maximize outreach). However, previous\nstudies relied on aggregated data and did not explore the within-subject\nvariation of language behaviour. Our study adds to this scholarship by adding a\nlongitudinal analysis of language behaviour. Considering the broader\ncontribution of this paper, we add to the literature on protests by validating\nprevious findings derived from surveys that activists change their behaviour to\nreflect prior preferences and situational goals rather than modify their\npreferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 20:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

Networks of interactions corresponding to these conditions\nare expected to share many edges, but also exhibit unique, condition-specific\nones. However, the degree of similarity among the networks from different\nconditions is generally unknown. Existing approaches for multivariate point\nprocesses do not take these structures into account and do not provide\ninference for jointly estimated networks. To address these needs, we propose a\njoint estimation procedure for networks of high-dimensional point processes\nthat incorporates easy-to-compute weights in order to data-adaptively encourage\nsimilarity between the estimated networks. We also propose a powerful\nhierarchical multiple testing procedure for edges of all estimated networks,\nwhich takes into account the data-driven similarity structure of the\nmulti-experiment networks.

Further, it is unclear how\nuniformity in a linguistic signal -- or lack thereof -- should be measured, and\nover which linguistic unit, e.g., the sentence or language level, this\nuniformity should hold. Here we investigate these facets of the UID hypothesis\nusing reading time and acceptability data. While our reading time results are\ngenerally consistent with previous work, they are also consistent with a weakly\nsuper-linear effect of surprisal, which would be compatible with UID's\npredictions. For acceptability judgments, we find clearer evidence that\nnon-uniformity in information density is predictive of lower acceptability. We\nthen explore multiple operationalizations of UID, motivated by different\ninterpretations of the original hypothesis, and analyze the scope over which\nthe pressure towards uniformity is exerted. The explanatory power of a subset\nof the proposed operationalizations suggests that the strongest trend may be a\nregression towards a mean surprisal across the language, rather than the\nphrase, sentence, or document -- a finding that supports a typical\ninterpretation of UID, namely that it is the byproduct of language users\nmaximizing the use of a (hypothetical) communication channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 20:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

However, extracted\ninterests can be inaccurate and become obsolete. Dynamic attributes, such as\nuser income changes, item price changes (etc.), change over time. Such dynamics\ncan intrinsically reflect the evolution of users' interests. We argue that\nmodeling such dynamic attributes can boost recommendation performance. However,\nproperly integrating them into user interest models is challenging since\nattribute dynamics can be diverse such as time-interval aware, periodic\npatterns (etc.), and they represent users' behaviors from different\nperspectives, which can happen asynchronously with interactions.

In the present paper, the effects of\nbackground magnetic field on the plasma emission process, which is believed to\nbe the main emission mechanism for solar coronal and interplanetary type III\nradio bursts, are investigated by means of the particle-in-cell simulation\nmethod. The effects of ambient magnetic field are systematically surveyed by\nvarying the ratio of plasma frequency to electron gyro-frequency. The present\nstudy shows that for a sufficiently strong ambient magnetic field, the\nwave-particle interaction processes lead to a highly field-aligned longitudinal\nmode excitation and anisotropic electron velocity distribution function,\naccompanied by a significantly enhanced plasma emission at the second harmonic\nplasma frequency. For such a case, the polarization of the harmonic emission is\nalmost entirely in the sense of extraordinary mode. On the other hand, for\nmoderate strengths of the ambient magnetic field, the interpretation of the\nsimulation result is less than clear. The underlying nonlinear mode coupling\nprocesses indicate that to properly understand and interpret the simulation\nresults require sophisticated analyses involving interactions among magnetized\nplasma normal modes including the two transverse modes of the magneto-active\nplasma, namely, extraordinary and ordinary modes, as well as\nelectron-cyclotron-whistler, plasma oscillation, and upper-hybrid modes.

An ideal PCN routing method needs to achieve 1) high\nscalability that can maintain low per-node memory and communication cost for\nlarge PCNs, 2) high resource utilization of payment channels, and 3) the\nprivacy of users. However, none of the existing PCN systems consider all these\nrequirements.

To meet SLO requirements, the state of\nthe art relies on hardware QoS support (e.g., Intel RDT) to allocate shared\nresources such as last-level caches and memory bandwidth for co-located\nlatency-critical applications. As a result, the number of latency-critical\napplications that can be deployed on a physical machine is bounded by the\nhardware allocation capability. Unfortunately, such hardware capability is very\nlimited. For example, Intel Xeon E5 v3 processors support at most four\npartitions for last-level caches, i.e., at most four applications can have\ndedicated resource allocation. This paper discusses the feasibility and\nunexplored challenges of providing SLO guarantees beyond the limits of hardware\ncapability. We present CoCo to show the feasibility and the benefits.

We define overparametrization as\nthe regime where the QNN has more than a critical number of parameters $M_c$\nthat allows it to explore all relevant directions in state space. Our main\nresults show that the dimension of the Lie algebra obtained from the generators\nof the QNN is an upper bound for $M_c$, and for the maximal rank that the\nquantum Fisher information and Hessian matrices can reach.

It is important to correctly size the buffer: make it too small,\nand packets are dropped unnecessarily and the link may be underutilized; make\nit too big, and packets may wait for a long time, and the router itself may be\nmore expensive to build. Despite its importance, there are few guidelines for\npicking the buffer size. The two most well-known rules only apply to long-lived\nTCP Reno flows; either for a network carrying a single TCP Reno flow (the\nbuffer size should equal the bandwidth-delay product, or $BDP$) or for a\nnetwork carrying $n$ TCP Reno flows (the buffer size should equal\n$BDP/\\sqrt{n}$). Since these rules were introduced, TCP Reno has been replaced\nby newer algorithms as the default congestion control algorithm in all major\noperating systems, yet little has been written about how the rules need to\nchange. This paper revisits both rules. For the single flow case, we generalize\nthe $BDP$ rule to account for changes to TCP, such as Proportional Rate\nReduction (PRR), and the introduction of new algorithms including Cubic and\nBBR. We find that buffers can be made 60-75% smaller for newer algorithms. For\nthe multiple flow case, we show that the square root of $n$ rule holds under a\nbroader set of assumptions than previously known, including for these new\ncongestion control algorithms. We also demonstrate situations where the square\nroot of $n$ rule does not hold, including for unfair flows and certain settings\nwith ECN. We validate our results by precisely measuring the time series of\nbuffer occupancy in a real network, and comparing it to the per-packet window\nsize.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 23:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

A dynamo that amplifies magnetic fields at scales $<$ the\ndriving scale of turbulence is known as the fluctuation dynamo. We study the\nproperties of the fluctuation dynamo in supersonic turbulent plasmas, which is\nof relevance to the ISM, structure formation, and lab experiments of\nlaser-plasma turbulence. Using simulations, we explore the properties of the\nexponentially growing and saturated state of the fluctuation dynamo for\nsubsonic and supersonic turbulence. We confirm that the fluctuation dynamo\nefficiency decreases with compressibility. We show that the fluctuation dynamo\ngenerated magnetic fields are spatially intermittent and the level of\nintermittency decreases as the field saturates. We find a stronger back\nreaction of the magnetic field on the velocity for the subsonic case as\ncompared to the supersonic case. Locally, we find that the level of alignment\nbetween vorticity and velocity, velocity and magnetic field, and current\ndensity and magnetic field in the saturated stage is enhanced in comparison to\nthe exponentially growing phase for the subsonic case, but only the current\ndensity and magnetic field alignment is enhanced for the supersonic case. We\nshow that both the magnetic field amplification (due to weaker stretching of\nfield lines) and diffusion decreases when the field saturates, but the\ndiffusion is enhanced relative to amplification. This occurs throughout the\nvolume in the subsonic turbulence, but primarily in the strong-field regions\nfor the supersonic case. This leads to the saturation of the fluctuation\ndynamo. Overall, both the amplification and diffusion of magnetic fields are\naffected and thus a drastic change in either of them is not required for the\nsaturation.

This formulation ignores the human body shape prior in 3D\nspace and inevitably causes implausible artifacts, especially when facing\nocclusion. To address this issue, we propose a lifting-and-projection framework\nto perform pose transfer in the 3D mesh space. The core of our framework is a\nforeground generation module, that consists of two novel networks: a\nlifting-and-projection network (LPNet) and an appearance detail compensating\nnetwork (ADCNet). To leverage the human body shape prior, LPNet exploits the\ntopological information of the body mesh to learn an expressive visual\nrepresentation for the target person in the 3D mesh space. To preserve texture\ndetails, ADCNet is further introduced to enhance the feature produced by LPNet\nwith the source foreground image. Such design of the foreground generation\nmodule enables the model to better handle difficult cases such as those with\nocclusions. Experiments on the iPER and Fashion datasets empirically\ndemonstrate that the proposed lifting-and-projection framework is effective and\noutperforms the existing image-to-image-based and mesh-based methods on human\npose transfer task in both self-transfer and cross-transfer settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 03:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

However,\nmost methods for measuring human driving styles require thresholds or labels to\nclassify the driving styles, and some require additional questionnaires for\ndrivers about their driving attitude. These limitations are not suitable for\ncreating a large virtual testing environment. Driving models (DMs) simulate\nhuman driving styles. Calibrating a DM makes the simulated driving behavior\ncloser to human-driving behavior, and enable the simulation of human-driving\ncars. Conventional DM-calibrating methods do not take into account that the\nparameters in a DM vary while driving.

However, they have little structure besides linearity, and\nare not amenable to tractable error-correction algorithms.\n  In this work, we prove a general derandomization result applicable to random\nlinear codes. Namely, in settings where the coding-theoretic property of\ninterest is \"local\" (in the sense of forbidding certain bad configurations\ninvolving few vectors -- code distance and list-decodability being notable\nexamples), one can replace random linear codes (RLCs) with a significantly\nderandomized variant with essentially no loss in parameters. Specifically,\ninstead of randomly sampling coordinates of the (long) Hadamard code (which is\nan equivalent way to describe RLCs), one can randomly sample coordinates of any\ncode with low bias. Over large alphabets, the low bias requirement can be\nweakened to just large distance. Furthermore, large distance suffices even with\na small alphabet in order to match the current best known bounds for RLC\nlist-decodability.\n  In particular, by virtue of our result, all current (and future)\nachievability bounds for list-decodability of random linear codes extend\nautomatically to random puncturings of any low-bias (or large alphabet)\n\"mother\" code. We also show that our punctured codes emulate the behavior of\nRLCs on stochastic channels, thus giving a derandomization of RLCs in the\ncontext of achieving Shannon capacity as well.

First of all, we devise a novel attention-based encoder-decoder\ntrip generator that can learn the correlations among POIs and generate\nwell-designed trips under given constraints. Another novelty of ANT relies on\nan adversarial learning strategy integrating with reinforcement learning to\nguide the trip generator to produce high-quality trips. For this purpose, we\nintroduce a discriminator, which distinguishes the generated trips from\nreal-life trips taken by users, to provide reward signals to optimize the\ngenerator. Moreover, we devise a novel pre-train schema based on learning from\ndemonstration, which speeds up the convergence to achieve a\nsufficient-and-efficient training process. Extensive experiments on four\nreal-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed\nANT framework, which demonstrates that ANT could remarkably outperform the\nstate-of-the-art baselines with short response time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 03:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

While several strategies for protecting against\nside-channel attacks exist, these often fail in practice due to unintended\ninteractions between values deep within the CPU. To detect and protect from\nside-channel attacks, several automated tools have recently been proposed; one\nof their common limitations is that they only support first-order leakage.\n  In this work, we present the first automated tool for detecting and\neliminating higher-order leakage from cryptographic implementations.

In particular, TLS losses can become the dominant\nloss mechanism in the few-photon and low temperature ($T$) regime. In this\nstudy, capacitively-coupled aluminum half-wavelength coplanar waveguide\nresonators are investigated. Surprisingly, the loss of the resonators was\nobserved to decrease with a lowering temperature at low excitation powers and\ntemperatures below the TLS saturation. This behavior is attributed to the\nreduction of the TLS resonant response bandwidth with decreasing temperature\nand power to below the detuning between the TLS and the resonant photon\nfrequency in a discrete ensemble of TLS. TLS fall out of resonance when their\nresponse bandwidths are smaller than their detunings from the resonance,\nreducing the resonant response and thus lowering the loss.

SAC works in an off-policy fashion where data are sampled\nuniformly from past experiences (stored in a buffer) using which parameters of\nthe policy and value function networks are updated. We propose certain crucial\nmodifications for boosting the performance of SAC and make it more sample\nefficient. In our proposed improved SAC, we firstly introduce a new\nprioritization scheme for selecting better samples from the experience replay\nbuffer. Secondly we use a mixture of the prioritized off-policy data with the\nlatest on-policy data for training the policy and the value function networks.\nWe compare our approach with the vanilla SAC and some recent variants of SAC\nand show that our approach outperforms the said algorithmic benchmarks.

Most KGE models have gained great success, especially on\nextrapolation scenarios.

However, most existing KGE works\nfocus on the design of delicate triple modeling function, which mainly tells us\nhow to measure the plausibility of observed triples, but offers limited\nexplanation of why the methods can extrapolate to unseen data, and what are the\nimportant factors to help KGE extrapolate. Therefore in this work, we attempt\nto study the KGE extrapolation of two problems: 1. How does KGE extrapolate to\nunseen data? 2.

In this\nwork, we observe that instead of asking the user to explicitly provide a\nbackground image, we may recover it from the input video itself. To this end,\nwe first propose a novel background restoration module (BRM) to recover the\nbackground image dynamically from the input video. BRM is extremely lightweight\nand can be easily integrated into existing matting models. By combining BRM\nwith a recent image matting model, MODNet, we then present MODNet-V for\nportrait video matting. Benefited from the strong background prior provided by\nBRM, MODNet-V has only 1/3 of the parameters of MODNet but achieves comparable\nor even better performances. Our design allows MODNet-V to be trained in an\nend-to-end manner on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Finally, we introduce a new\npatch refinement module (PRM) to adapt MODNet-V for high-resolution videos\nwhile keeping MODNet-V lightweight and fast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 09:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

However, commonly used poolings in\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as max-pooling, average-pooling, and\nstrided-convolution, are not shift-equivalent. Thus, the shift-equivalence of\nCNNs is destroyed when convolutions and poolings are stacked. Moreover,\nanti-aliasing is another essential property of poolings from the perspective of\nsignal processing. However, recent poolings are neither shift-equivalent nor\nanti-aliasing. To address this issue, we propose a new pooling method that is\nshift-equivalent and anti-aliasing, named frequency pooling. Frequency pooling\nfirst transforms the features into the frequency domain, and then removes the\nfrequency components beyond the Nyquist frequency. Finally, it transforms the\nfeatures back to the spatial domain. We prove that frequency pooling is\nshift-equivalent and anti-aliasing based on the property of Fourier transform\nand Nyquist frequency.

Most applications relevant to practitioners, such as Hill\nequations or diffusion equations, are hence intractable. In this paper, we\novercome these computational problems by proposing a variational solution to a\ngeneral class of non-linear and parabolic partial differential equation latent\nforce models. Further, we show that a neural operator approach can scale our\nmodel to thousands of instances, enabling fast, distributed computation.

However, to\ndate there have been relatively few direct comparisons of the halo model with\nmore accurate (but much more computationally expensive) cosmological\nsimulations. We test the accuracy of the halo model in reproducing the\nnon-linear matter power spectrum, P(k), when the main inputs of the halo model\n(specifically the matter density profiles, halo mass function, and linear bias)\nare taken directly from the BAHAMAS simulations and we assess how well the halo\nmodel reproduces P(k) from the same simulations. We show that the halo model\ngenerally reproduces P(k) in the deep non-linear regime (1-halo) to typically a\nfew percent accuracy, but struggles to reproduce (approx. 15% error) P(k) at\nintermediate scales of 0.1 < k [h/ Mpc] < 3 at z=0, marking the transition\nbetween the 1-halo and 2-halo terms. We show that the magnitude of this error\nis a strong function of the halo mass definition (through its effects on radial\nextent of haloes) and of redshift. Furthermore, we test the accuracy of the\nhalo model in recovering the relative impact of baryons on P(k). We show that\nthe systematic errors in recovering the absolute P(k) largely cancel when\nconsidering the relative impact of baryons. This suggests that the halo model\ncan make precise predictions for the baryonic suppression, offering a fast and\naccurate way to adjust collisionless matter power spectra for the presence of\nbaryons and associated processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 10:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 14:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

This idea is revisited using invariance\nequations and steady-state responses to provide a new time-domain\ncharacterization of least squares moment matching. The characterization, in\nturn, is then used to obtain a parameterized family of models achieving least\nsquares moment matching. The theory is illustrated by a worked-out numerical\nexample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 10:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

Where\ntraditional segmentation classifies customers based on coarse features such as\ndemographics, micro-segmentation depicts more nuanced differences between\nindividuals, bringing forth several advantages including the potential for\nimproved personalization in financial services. AI and representation learning\noffer a unique opportunity to solve the problem of micro-segmentation. Although\nubiquitous in many industries, the proliferation of AI in sensitive industries\nsuch as finance has become contingent on the explainability of deep models. We\nhad previously solved the micro-segmentation problem by extracting temporal\nfeatures from the state space of a recurrent neural network (RNN). However, due\nto the inherent opacity of RNNs our solution lacked an explanation. In this\nstudy, we address this issue by extracting a symbolic explanation for our model\nand providing an interpretation of our temporal features. For the explanation,\nwe use a linear regression model to reconstruct the features in the state space\nwith high fidelity. We show that our linear regression coefficients have not\nonly learned the rules used to recreate the features, but have also learned the\nrelationships that were not directly evident in the raw data. Finally, we\npropose a novel method to interpret the dynamics of the state space by using\nthe principles of inverse regression and dynamical systems to locate and label\na set of attractors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 10:32:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 09:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

All chance constraints are solved jointly and each one is\nassigned to an optimized violation rate. To highlight, the JCC problem with the\noptimized violation rates has been recognized to be NP-hard and challenging to\nbe solved. This paper proposes a novel evolutionary algorithm that successfully\ntackles the problem and reduces the solution conservativeness (i.e. operation\ncost) by around 50% comparing with the baseline Bonferroni Approximation.\nConsidering the imperfect solar power forecast, we construct three data-driven\nambiguity sets to model uncertain forecast error distributions. The solution is\nthus robust for any distribution in sets with the shared moment and shape\nassumptions. The proposed method is validated by robustness tests based on\nthose sets and firmly secures the solution robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 11:14:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 10:41:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 18:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

We derive in particular a lower\nbound of $2.8 k_BT$ per Shannon bit to write a bit in such a memory, a bound\ndistinct from Landauer's one.

In OTFS\nliterature, approximately constant channel gains for every group of samples\nwithin each OTFS block are assumed. This leads to limitations for OTFS on the\nmaximum Doppler frequency that it can tolerate. Additionally, presence of\ncyclic prefix (CP) in OTFS signal limits the flexibility in adjusting its\nparameters to improve its robustness against channel time variations.\nTherefore, in this paper, we study the possibility of removing the CP overhead\nfrom OTFS and breaking its Doppler limitations through multiple antenna\nprocessing in the large antenna regime. We asymptotically analyze the\nperformance of time-reversal maximum ratio combining (TR-MRC) for OTFS without\nCP. We show that doubly dispersive channel effects average out in the large\nantenna regime when the maximum Doppler shift is within OTFS limitations.\nHowever, for considerably large Doppler shifts exceeding OTFS limitations, a\nresidual Doppler effect remains.

In particular, due to the push towards\ndecentralisation of services towards the edge, it is likely that a significant\nshare of data generated by IoT devices will be needed by other (mobile) nodes\nnearby, while global Internet access will be limited only to a small fraction\nof data. In this context, opportunistic networking schemes can be adopted to\nbuild efficient content-centric protocols, through which data generated by IoT\ndevices (or by mobile nodes themselves) can be accessed by the other nodes\nnearby. In this paper, we propose MobCCN, which is an ICN-compliant protocol\nfor this heterogeneous environment. MobCCN is designed to implement the routing\nand forwarding mechanisms of the main ICN realisations, such as CCN. The\noriginal aspect of MobCCN is to implement an efficient opportunistic networking\nrouting scheme to populate the Forwarding Interest Base (FIB) tables of the\nnodes, in order to guide the propagation of Interest packets towards nodes that\nstore the required data. Specifically, MobCCN defines the utility of each node\nas a forwarder of Interest packets for a certain type of content, such that\nInterest packets can be propagated along a positive utility gradient, until\nreaching some node storing the data. We evaluate MobCCN against protocols\nrepresenting two possible endpoints of the spectrum, respectively in terms of\nminimising the data delivery delay and the resource consumption. Performance\nresults show that MobCCN is very effective and efficient, as it guarantees very\nhigh delivery rates and low delays, while keeping the total generated traffic\nat a reasonable level and also saving local resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 13:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

The aim of this paper is\nto characterize the station performance through commissioning observations at\nsix different frequencies (55, 70, 110, 160, 230 and 320 MHz) collected during\nits first year of activities. We describe the calibration procedure, present\nthe resulting all-sky images and their analysis, and discuss the station\ncalibratability and system stability. Using the difference imaging method, we\nalso derive estimates of the SKA1-Low sensitivity for the same frequencies, and\ncompare them to those obtained through electromagnetic simulations across the\nentire telescope bandwidth, finding good agreement (within $\\leq 13%$).\nMoreover, our estimates exceed the SKA1-Low requirements at all the considered\nfrequencies, by up to a factor of $\\sim$2.3. Our results are very promising and\nallow an initial validation of the AAVS2 prototype station performance, which\nis an important step towards the upcoming SKA-Low telescope construction and\nscience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 14:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

While much attention has been given to the analysis of\ncensored outcomes, contemporary focus has shifted to censored covariates, as\nwell. Missing data is often overcome using multiple imputation, which leverages\nthe entire dataset by replacing missing values with informed placeholders, and\nthis method can be modified for censored data by also incorporating partial\ninformation from censored values. One such modification involves replacing\ncensored covariates with their conditional means given other fully observed\ninformation, such as the censored value or additional covariates. So-called\nconditional mean imputation approaches were proposed for censored covariates in\nAtem et al. [2017], Atem et al.[2019a], and Atem et al. [2019b]. These methods\nare robust to additional parametric assumptions on the censored covariate and\nutilize all available data, which is appealing.

Herein, we derive the correct form of the conditional mean\nand demonstrate the impact of the incorrect formulas on the imputed values and\nstatistical inference. Under several settings considered, using an incorrect\nformula is seen to seriously bias parameter estimation in simple linear\nregression.

We analyze the error of this\nestimate in the $L^2(\\mu)$-norm, where $\\mu$ denotes the stationary\ndistribution of the underlying Markov chain. Our analysis imposes no\nassumptions on the transition operator of the Markov chain, but rather only\nconditions on the reward function and population-level kernel LSTD solutions.\nWe use empirical process theory techniques to derive a non-asymptotic upper\nbound on the error with explicit dependence on the eigenvalues of the\nassociated kernel operator, as well as the instance-dependent variance of the\nBellman residual error. In addition, we prove minimax lower bounds over\nsub-classes of MRPs, which shows that our rate is optimal in terms of the\nsample size $n$ and the effective horizon $H = (1 - \\gamma)^{-1}$. Whereas\nexisting worst-case theory predicts cubic scaling ($H^3$) in the effective\nhorizon, our theory reveals that there is in fact a much wider range of\nscalings, depending on the kernel, the stationary distribution, and the\nvariance of the Bellman residual error. Notably, it is only parametric and\nnear-parametric problems that can ever achieve the worst-case cubic scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 14:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

A particularly\npressing question is if there exists the lattice analogue of the Laughlin state\nin the 1/3-filled Chern flat band, dubbed as the Chern-Laughlin state. The\nanswer depends crucially on the form of the electron-electron interaction,\nwhich can generate various competing ground states such as the Laughlin,\nstripe/nematic, parafermion, and parton states. Unfortunately, it is difficult\nto precisely characterize the exact ground state as any of these candidate\nground states due to the lack of appropriate order parameters.

We show that prior prefetchers often lose their performance benefit\nover a wide range of workloads and system configurations due to their inherent\ninability to take multiple different types of program context and system-level\nfeedback information into account while prefetching. In this paper, we make a\ncase for designing a holistic prefetch algorithm that learns to prefetch using\nmultiple different types of program context and system-level feedback\ninformation inherent to its design.\n  To this end, we propose Pythia, which formulates the prefetcher as a\nreinforcement learning agent. For every demand request, Pythia observes\nmultiple different types of program context information to make a prefetch\ndecision. For every prefetch decision, Pythia receives a numerical reward that\nevaluates prefetch quality under the current memory bandwidth usage. Pythia\nuses this reward to reinforce the correlation between program context\ninformation and prefetch decision to generate highly accurate, timely, and\nsystem-aware prefetch requests in the future. Our extensive evaluations using\nsimulation and hardware synthesis show that Pythia outperforms multiple\nstate-of-the-art prefetchers over a wide range of workloads and system\nconfigurations, while incurring only 1.03% area overhead over a desktop-class\nprocessor and no software changes in workloads.

The postural balance of the human body is\nestimated through the projection of the body Center of Mass (CoM) to the\nsupport polygon (SP) representing the quasi-static Center of Pressure (CoP). In\nresponse to the interaction forces and the tracking of the human posture, the\nrobot can create assistive forces to restore balance in case of its loss.\nOtherwise, during normal stance or walking, it will follow the user with\nminimum/no opposing forces through the generation of coupled arm and base\nmovements. As the balance-restoring strategy, we propose two strategies and\nevaluate them in a laboratory setting on healthy human participants.\nQuantitative and qualitative results of a 12-subjects experiment are then\nillustrated and discussed, comparing the performances of the two strategies and\nthe overall system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 15:51:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 16:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

The novelty of our work lies in enforcing\ninterpretability to the embedding vectors by formally associating each of their\ndimensions to a choice alternative. Thus, our approach brings benefits much\nbeyond a simple parsimonious representation improvement over dummy encoding, as\nit provides behaviorally meaningful outputs that can be used in travel demand\nanalysis and policy decisions. Additionally, in contrast to previously\nsuggested ANN-based Discrete Choice Models (DCMs) that either sacrifice\ninterpretability for performance or are only partially interpretable, our\nmodels preserve interpretability of the utility coefficients for all the input\nvariables despite being based on ANN principles.

We believe this work gives a fundamental\nunderstanding of solid-gas reaction for high-crystallinity perovskite synthesis\ntowards perovskite solar cells with improved stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 02:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

We detect 127 sources, including\n15 new sources that have not previously been detected at any wavelength. 72\nsources are spatially resolved at 3 mm, with sizes from $\\sim$8 - 100 AU. We\nclassify 76 infrared-detected sources as foreground ONC disks and the remainder\nas embedded OMC1 disks. The two samples have similar disk sizes, but the OMC1\nsources have a dense and centrally concentrated spatial distribution,\nindicating they may constitute a spatially distinct subcluster. We find smaller\ndisk sizes and a lack of large (>75 AU) disks in both our samples compared to\nother nearby star-forming regions, indicating that environmental disk\ntruncation processes are significant. While photoevaporation from nearby\nmassive Trapezium stars may account for the smaller disks in the ONC, the\nembedded sources in OMC1 are hidden from this radiation and thus must truncated\nby some other mechanism, possibly dynamical truncation or accretion-driven\ncontraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 16:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

The utility of learning without forgetting (CF) is\ntwofold: first, the system can return to previously learned tasks after\nlearning something new. In addition, bootstrapping previous knowledge may allow\nfor faster learning of a novel task. Previous approaches to CF and\nbootstrapping are primarily based on modifying learning in the form of changing\nweights to tune the model to the current task, overwriting previously tuned\nweights from previous tasks.However, another critical factor that has been\nlargely overlooked is the initial network topology, or architecture. Here, we\nargue that the topology of biological brains likely evolved certain features\nthat are designed to achieve this kind of informational conservation. In\nparticular, we consider that the highly conserved property of modularity may\noffer a solution to weight-update learning methods that adheres to the learning\nwithout catastrophic forgetting and bootstrapping constraints.

There are two challenges with these\napproaches: (1) The verification of such systems is difficult and time\nconsuming. (2) These verified controllers are not able to adapt to frequent\nrequirements changes, which are typical in situations like autonomous driving.\nThis raises the question: how can trained and verified controllers, which have\ngone through expensive training and verification processes, be re-used to deal\nwith requirement changes?

Analogous representations are established for the\nfundamental properties of such processes, including the Wold-Cram\\'{e}r\ndecomposition and their covariance structure as well as explicit optimal linear\nforecasts based on a finite set of past observations. These results are\ngrounded on the principal determinant, that is a banded Hessenbergian\nrepresentation of a restriction of the Green function involved in the solution\nof the linear difference equation associated with TV-ARMA models, built up\nsolely of the autoregressive coefficients of the model. The $L_2$ convergence\nproperties of the model are a consequence of the absolute summability of the\naforementioned Hessenbergian representation, which is in line with the\nasymptotic stability and efficiency of such processes. The invertibility of the\nmodel is also a consequence of an analogous condition, but now the Green\nfunction is built up of the moving average coefficients. The structural\nasymmetry between constant and deterministically time-varying coefficient\nmodels, that is the backward and forward asymptotic efficiency differ in an\nessential manner, is formally demonstrated. An alternative approach to the\nHessenbergian solution representation is described by an equivalent procedure\nfor manipulating time-varying polynomials. The practical significance of the\ntheoretical results in this work is illustrated with an application to U.S.\ninflation data.

Here, from an alternative other than rigid magnet, we disclosed an\nunconventional way to generate endogenous magnetism and then construct magnetic\nmonopole through tuning liquid metal machine. Through theoretical\ninterpretation and conceptual experiments, we illustrated that when gallium\nbase liquid metal in solution rotates under actuation of an external electric\nfield, it forms an endogenous magnetic field inside which well explains the\nphenomenon that two such discrete metal droplets could easily fuse together,\nindicating their reciprocal attraction via N and S poles. Further, we conceived\nthat the self-driving liquid metal motor was also an endogenous magnet owning\nthe electromagnetic homology. When liquid metal in solution swallowed aluminum\ninside, it formed a spin motor and dynamically variable charge distribution\nwhich produced an endogenous magnetic field. This finding explains the\nphenomena that there often happened reflection collision and attraction fusion\nbetween running liquid metal motors which were just caused by the dynamic\nadjustment of their N and S polarities. Finally, we conceived that such\nendogenous magnet could lead to magnetic monopole and four technical routes\nwere suggested as: 1. Matching the interior flow field of liquid metal\nmachines; 2. Superposition between external electric effect and magnetic field;\n3. Composite construction between magnetic particles and liquid metal motor; 4.\nChemical ways such as via galvanic cell reaction. Overall, the fluidic\nendogenous magnet and the promising magnetic monopole it enabled may lead to\nunconventional magnetoelectric devices and applications in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 09:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}
