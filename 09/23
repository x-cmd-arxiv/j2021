The mere observation of high-energy cosmic rays could\nin principle rule out the existence of such scalar fields since any particle\nmoving faster than scalar perturbations would lose energy in the form of scalar\nwaves until it moves slower than those. We compute in detail the energy loss to\nscalar waves and find that it scales with the square of the ultra-violet (UV)\ncutoff frequency of the effective field theory (EFT) of gravity. For\ndark-energy-motivated EFTs, the UV cutoff can be low, in which case that energy\nloss could always be negligible. In contrast, if viewed as a covariant theory\nvalid at all scales or as an EFT valid at higher energies, perhaps even all the\nway up to the Planck scale, as may be the case if motivated by quantum-gravity\nperspectives, then the energy loss to scalar waves may diverge or become\ndramatically large.

Knockoff\nsamples are independent of their output given the observed variables and\nexchangeable with their counterpart variables without changing the underlying\ndistribution of the data.

Linear\napproximation and second-order cone programming (SOCP) are then used to derive\nthe six formats of the convex Mesh-BranchFlow model. The branch ampacity\nconstraints considering the shunt conductance and capacitance of the\ntransmission line $\\Pi$-model are derived. The key foundation of deriving the\nampacity constraints is the correct interpretation of the physical meaning of\nthe transmission line $\\Pi$-model. An exact linear expression of the ampacity\nconstraints of the power loss variable is derived. The applications of the\nMesh-BranchFlow model in deriving twelve formats of the exact optimal power\nflow (OPF) model and twelve formats of the approximate OPF model are formulated\nand analyzed. Using the Julia programming language, the extensive numerical\ninvestigations of all formats of the OPF models show the accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency of the Mesh-BranchFlow model.

In this\nstudy, we relax the rigid-lid assumption and impose surface drag, which allows\nthe barotropic mode to be excited in equatorial waves. In particular, a\npreviously developed set of linear, strict quasi-equilibrium tropospheric\nequations is coupled with a dry, passive stratosphere, and surface drag is\nadded to the troposphere momentum equations. Theoretical and numerical model\nanalysis is performed on the model in the limits of an inviscid surface coupled\nto a stratosphere, as well as a frictional surface under a rigid-lid. This\nstudy confirms previous research that shows the presence of a stratosphere\nstrongly shifts the growth rates of fast propagating equatorial waves to larger\nscales, reddening the equatorial power spectrum. The growth rates of modes that\nare slowly propagating and highly interactive with cloud-radiation are shown to\nbe negligibly affected by the presence of a stratosphere. Surface friction in\nthis model framework acts as purely a damping mechanism and increases the\npoleward extent of the equatorial waves through barotropic vorticity\ngeneration. Numerical solutions of the coupled troposphere-stratosphere model\nwith surface friction also show that the barotropic mode can be\ntropospherically trapped when excited by surface friction but in the presence\nof a highly stratified stratosphere. The superposition of phase-shifted\nbarotropic and first baroclinic modes is also shown to lead to an eastward\nvertical tilt in the dynamical fields of Kelvin-wave like modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 16:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

In recent years, cyber security user studies have been\nscrutinized for their reporting completeness, statistical reporting fidelity,\nstatistical reliability and biases.

We focus on the\nextent to which positive reports indicate relation true in reality, that is, a\nprobabilistic assessment.\n  Aim. This study aims at establishing the overall strength of evidence in\ncyber security user studies, with the dimensions -- Positive Predictive Value\n(PPV) and its complement False Positive Risk (FPR), -- Likelihood Ratio (LR),\nand -- Reverse-Bayesian Prior (RBP) for a fixed tolerated False Positive Risk.\n  Method. Based on $431$ coded statistical inferences in $146$ cyber security\nuser studies from a published SLR covering the years 2006-2016, we first\ncompute a simulation of the a posteriori false positive risk based on assumed\nprior and bias thresholds.

Ergo, informativeness is the prime attribute of document summary\ngenerated by an algorithm, and selecting sentences that capture the essence of\na document is the primary goal of extractive document summarization. In this\npaper, we employ Shannon entropy to capture informativeness of sentences.

We present an information theoretic interpretation of the computed\nentropy, which is the bedrock of the proposed E-Summ algorithm, an unsupervised\nmethod for extractive document summarization. The algorithm systematically\napplies information theoretic principle for selecting informative sentences\nfrom important topics in the document.

Existing Bayesian methods, being highly iterative, are\nexpensive to implement and often fail to accurately capture a model's true\nposterior because of their tendency to select only central moments. We propose\na fast single-shot uncertainty quantification framework where, instead of\nworking with the conventional Bayesian definition of model weight probability\ndensity function (PDF), we utilize physics inspired functional operators over\nthe projection of model weights in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to\nquantify their uncertainty at each model output. The RKHS projection of model\nweights yields a potential field based interpretation of model weight PDF which\nconsequently allows the definition of a functional operator, inspired by\nperturbation theory in physics, that performs a moment decomposition of the\nmodel weight PDF (the potential field) at a specific model output to quantify\nits uncertainty. We call this representation of the model weight PDF as the\nquantum information potential field (QIPF) of the weights. The extracted\nmoments from this approach automatically decompose the weight PDF in the local\nneighborhood of the specified model output and determine, with great\nsensitivity, the local heterogeneity of the weight PDF around a given\nprediction. These moments therefore provide sharper estimates of predictive\nuncertainty than central stochastic moments of Bayesian methods. Experiments\nevaluating the error detection capability of different uncertainty\nquantification methods on covariate shifted test data show our approach to be\nmore precise and better calibrated than baseline methods, while being faster to\ncompute.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 17:55:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 18:57:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 18:51:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 18:52:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:56:35 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 29 May 2022 22:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

The goal is to create a data structure in an initial\npreprocessing phase and use it for answering (multiple) queries. Previous work\nhas developed data structures that trade off space usage for answering time and\nhas proved conditional space lower bounds for queries of practical interest\nsuch as the path and triangle query. However, most of these results cater to\nonly those queries, lack a comprehensive framework, and are not generalizable.\nThe isolated treatment of these queries also fails to utilize the connections\nwith extensive research on related problems within the database community. The\nkey insight in this work is to exploit the formalism of relational algebra by\ncasting the problems as answering join queries over a relational database.\nUsing the notion of boolean {\\em adorned queries} and {\\em access patterns}, we\npropose a unified framework that captures several widely studied algorithmic\nproblems.

Second, we falsify two conjectures\nproposed in the existing literature that relates to the space-time lower bound\nfor path queries and triangle detection by proposing an unexpectedly better\nalgorithm. This result opens a new avenue for improving several algorithmic\nresults that have so far been assumed to be (conditionally) optimal. Finally,\nwe prove new conditional space-time lower bounds for star and path queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 17:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

Thus, to stay up-to-date the graph data needs to be updated\nfrequently. To utilize information from Knowledge Graphs, many state-of-the-art\nmachine learning approaches use embedding techniques. These techniques\ntypically compute an embedding, i.e., vector representations of the nodes as\ninput for the main machine learning algorithm. If a graph update occurs later\non -- specifically when nodes are added or removed -- the training has to be\ndone all over again. This is undesirable, because of the time it takes and also\nbecause downstream models which were trained with these embeddings have to be\nretrained if they change significantly. In this paper, we investigate embedding\nupdates that do not require full retraining and evaluate them in combination\nwith various embedding models on real dynamic Knowledge Graphs covering\nmultiple use cases. We study approaches that place newly appearing nodes\noptimally according to local information, but notice that this does not work\nwell. However, we find that if we continue the training of the old embedding,\ninterleaved with epochs during which we only optimize for the added and removed\nparts, we obtain good results in terms of typical metrics used in link\nprediction. This performance is obtained much faster than with a complete\nretraining and hence makes it possible to maintain embeddings for dynamic\nKnowledge Graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 17:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

To tackle this\nchallenge, Bayesian optimization, which conducts sequential design via a\nposterior distribution over the objective function, is a critical method used\nto find the global optimum of black-box functions. Kernel functions play an\nimportant role in shaping the posterior distribution of the estimated function.\nThe widely used kernel function, e.g., radial basis function (RBF), is very\nvulnerable and susceptible to outliers; the existence of outliers is causing\nits Gaussian process surrogate model to be sporadic.

The former is valued in\n$\\mathcal{H}^3(G_b, K(\\mathcal{C}))$, while the latter is valued in either\n$\\mathcal{H}^3(G_b,\\mathcal{A}/\\{1,\\psi\\})$ or $Z^2(G_b, \\mathbb{Z}_2)$\ndepending on additional details of the theory. $K(\\mathcal{C})$ is the Abelian\ngroup of functions from anyons to $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ phases obeying the fusion\nrules, $\\mathcal{A}$ is the Abelian group defined by fusion of Abelian anyons,\nand $\\psi$ is the fermion. When these obstructions vanish, we show that\ndistinct symmetry fractionalization patterns form a torsor over\n$\\mathcal{H}^2(G_b, \\mathcal{A}/\\{1,\\psi\\})$. We study a number of examples in\ndetail; in particular we provide a characterization of fermionic Kramers\ndegeneracy arising in symmetry class DIII within this general framework, and we\ndiscuss fractional quantum Hall and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid states\nof electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 17:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 22:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

In the present work, we report\nin situ observations of a multiscale, multi-type magnetopause reconnection in\nthe presence of low-energy ions using NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale data on\n11 September 2015. This study divides ions into cold and hot populations. The\nobservations can be interpreted as a secondary reconnection dominated by\nelectrons and cold ions located at the edge of an ion-scale reconnection. This\nanalysis demonstrates a dominant role of cold ions in the secondary\nreconnection without hot ions' response. Cold ions and electrons are\naccelerated and heated by the secondary process. The case study provides\nobservational evidence for the simultaneous operation of antiparallel and\ncomponent reconnection. Our results imply that the pre-accelerated and heated\ncold ions and electrons in the secondary reconnection may participate in the\nprimary ion-scale reconnection affecting the solar wind-magnetopause coupling\nand the complicated magnetic field topology affect the reconnection rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 18:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Next, we show that\nspecific trading strategies, such as splitting orders or conducting arbitrage\nnon aggressively, are further indicators of expertise that increase the\nprofitability of arbitrage. Most importantly, we exploit within-user (across\nhours and markets) variation and document that expert users make profits on\narbitrage by reacting quickly to plausible exogenous variations on the official\nexchange rates. We present further evidence that such differences are chiefly\ndue to a better ability of the latter in incorporating information, both on the\ntransactions costs and on the exchange rates volatility, eventually resulting\nin a better timing choice at small time scale intervals.

In this method, after partitioning numerical\nfeatures, frequent itemsets are extracted by the Apriori algorithm and then\nused as features to increase the CAD diagnosis accuracy. The proposed method\nconsists of two main phases. In the first phase, each patient is assigned a\nprofile based on age, gender, and medical condition, and then all numerical\nfeatures are discretized based on assigned profiles. All features then undergo\na binarization process to become ready for feature extraction by Apriori.

Performance comparisons conducted on this dataset showed that the proposed\nmethod outperforms all major alternative methods with 98.35% accuracy, 100%\nsensitivity, and 94.25% specificity.

In this paper we present a novel inferential\napproach for multivariate distributions, which combines the flexibility of vine\nconstructions with the advantages of Bayesian nonparametrics, not requiring the\nspecification of parametric families for each pair copula. Expressing\nmultivariate copulas using vines allows us to easily account for covariate\nspecifications driving the dependence between response variables.

So, to guarantee the\noptimality, a rigorous optimality analysis is performed by leveraging\nanalytical optimization. The analysis is divided into two cases: full\nmitigation of VU and partial attenuation of VU. For the former case, we\nanalytically solve the original program since the resultant VU is immediately\ndeducible. For the latter one, directly solving the problem becomes very hard.\nThus, we reformulate the program into an equivalent but more tractable form\nunder certain conditions, by which the analytical optimum can be finally\nderived.

We then highlight that CR\ntransport is a strong function of local plasma conditions in the multi-phase\ninterstellar medium (ISM), and may be diffusive due to turbulence in some\nregions and streaming due to self-confinement in others. A multi-phase\ncombination of scattering mechanisms can in principle reproduce the main trends\nin the proton spectrum and the boron-to-carbon ratio (B/C). However, models\nwith a combination of scattering by self-excited waves and fast-mode turbulence\nrequire significant fine-tuning due to fast-mode damping, unlike\nphenomenological models that assume undamped Kolmogorov turbulence. The\nassumption that fast modes follow a weak cascade is also not well justified\ntheoretically, as the weak cascade is suppressed by wave steepening and\nweak-shock dissipation even in subsonic turbulence. These issues suggest that\nthere may be a significant theoretical gap in our understanding of MHD\nturbulence. We discuss a few topics at the frontier of MHD turbulence theory\nthat bear on this (possible) gap and that may be relevant for CR scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 18:47:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 20:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

The competition between these pathways can lead to\nstructures that are programmed for one shape, yet fold incorrectly. To\ndisentangle the features that lead to misfolding, we introduce a model of\nself-folding origami that accounts for the finite stretching rigidity of the\norigami faces and allows the computation of energy landscapes that lead to\nmisfolding.

However,\nit is not feasible to learn and benchmark social navigation behaviors entirely\nin the real world, as learning is data-intensive, and it is challenging to make\nsafety guarantees during training. Therefore, simulation-based benchmarks that\nprovide abstractions for social navigation are required. A framework for these\nbenchmarks would need to support a wide variety of learning approaches, be\nextensible to the broad range of social navigation scenarios, and abstract away\nthe perception problem to focus on social navigation explicitly. While there\nhave been many proposed solutions, including high fidelity 3D simulators and\ngrid world approximations, no existing solution satisfies all of the\naforementioned properties for learning and evaluating social navigation\nbehaviors.

Further, we present benchmark\nresults that compare and contrast human-engineered and model-based learning\napproaches to a suite of off-the-shelf Learning from Demonstration (LfD) and\nReinforcement Learning (RL) approaches applied to social robot navigation.\nThese results demonstrate the data efficiency, task performance, social\ncompliance, and environment transfer capabilities for each of the policies\nevaluated to provide a solid grounding for future social navigation research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 19:58:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 18:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

For concentrated systems, however, the rate of exponential growth\ncontinues to scale with $N$. In relativistic self-gravitating systems, the rate\nof growth is almost independent of $N$. This effect, however, is only\nnoticeable when the system's mean velocity approaches the speed of light to\nwithin three orders of magnitude. The chaotic behavior of systems with more\nthan a dozen bodies for the usually adopted approximation of only solving the\npairwise interactions in the Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann equation of motion is\nqualitatively different than when the interaction terms (or cross terms) are\ntaken into account.

These scenarios force us to evaluate the trade-off between\ncollective norms and our own personal objectives. To create effective AI-human\nteams, we must equip AI agents with a model of how humans make trade-offs in\ncomplex, constrained environments. These agents will be able to mirror human\nbehavior or to draw human attention to situations where decision making could\nbe improved. To this end, we propose a novel inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL) method for learning implicit hard and soft constraints from\ndemonstrations, enabling agents to quickly adapt to new settings. In addition,\nlearning soft constraints over states, actions, and state features allows\nagents to transfer this knowledge to new domains that share similar aspects. We\nthen use the constraint learning method to implement a novel system\narchitecture that leverages a cognitive model of human decision making,\nmulti-alternative decision field theory (MDFT), to orchestrate competing\nobjectives. We evaluate the resulting agent on trajectory length, number of\nviolated constraints, and total reward, demonstrating that our agent\narchitecture is both general and achieves strong performance. Thus we are able\nto capture and replicate human-like trade-offs from demonstrations in\nenvironments when constraints are not explicit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 20:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-24"}

As an emerging technique for characterization, Spatial\nRepresentation Learning (SRL) uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn\nnon-linear embedded features of spatial data for characterization. However, SRL\nextracts features by internal layers of DNNs, and thus suffers from lacking\nsemantic labels. Texts of spatial entities, on the other hand, provide semantic\nunderstanding of latent feature labels, but is insensible to deep SRL models.\nHow can we teach a SRL model to discover appropriate topic labels in texts and\npair learned features with the labels? This paper formulates a new problem:\nfeature-topic pairing, and proposes a novel Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)\nbased deep learning framework. Specifically, we formulate the feature-topic\npairing problem into an automated alignment task between 1) a latent embedding\nfeature space and 2) a textual semantic topic space. We decompose the alignment\nof the two spaces into: 1) point-wise alignment, denoting the correlation\nbetween a topic distribution and an embedding vector; 2) pair-wise alignment,\ndenoting the consistency between a feature-feature similarity matrix and a\ntopic-topic similarity matrix. We design a PSO based solver to simultaneously\nselect an optimal set of topics and learn corresponding features based on the\nselected topics. We develop a closed loop algorithm to iterate between 1)\nminimizing losses of representation reconstruction and feature-topic alignment\nand 2) searching the best topics.

But unlike the\nintrinsic spin of electrons, the lattice vibration is rarely rotational. To\ninduce angular momentum, one needs to find a material that can accommodate a\ntwisted normal mode, two orthogonal modes or excitation of magnons. If\nexcitation is too strong, one may exceed the Lindemann limit, so the material\nmelts. Therefore these methods are not ideal. Here, we theoretically propose a\nnew route to phonon angular momentum in a molecular crystal $\\rm C_{60}$. We\nfind that a single laser pulse is able to inject a significant amount of\nangular momentum to $\\rm C_{60}$, and the momentum transfer is\nhelicity-dependent.

In most cases, specular reflection of host starlight\nfrom surface bodies of water -- referred to as ocean glint -- proves to be an\nimportant aspect of liquids that can enable detection of habitable conditions.\nHere, we propose that spectral principal component analysis (PCA) applied to\norbital phase-dependent observations of Earth-like exoplanets can provide a\nstraightforward means of detecting ocean glint and, thus, habitability. Using\nhigh-fidelity, orbit-resolved spectral models of Earth, and for instrument\ncapabilities applicable to proposed exo-Earth direct imaging concept missions,\nthe extreme reddening effect of crescent-phase ocean glint is demonstrated as\nthe primary spectral component that explains phase-dependent variability for\norbital inclinations spanning 60--90 degrees. At smaller orbital inclinations\nwhere more-extreme crescent phases cannot be accessed, glint can still\nsignificantly increase planetary brightness but reddening effects are less\npronounced and, as a result, glint is not plainly indicated by phase-dependent\nspectral PCA. Using instrument models for future exoplanet direct imaging\nmission concepts, we show that brightness enhancements due to glint could be\ndetected across a wide range of orbital inclinations with typical exposure\ntimes measured in hours to weeks, depending on system distance and mission\narchitecture.

The quadrotor dynamics, image dynamics, actuation constraints, and\nvisibility constraints are taken into account to handle quadrotor maneuvers\nwith high agility. Two main challenges of applying IBVS to agile drones are\nconsidered: (i) high sensitivity of depths to intense orientation changes, and\n(ii) conflict between the visual servoing objective and action objective due to\nthe underactuated nature. To deal with the first challenge, we parameterize a\nvisual feature by a bearing vector and a distance, by which the depth will no\nlonger be involved in the image dynamics. Meanwhile, we settle the conflict\nproblem by compensating for the rotation in the future visual servoing cost\nusing the predicted orientations of the quadrotor. Our approach in simulation\nshows that (i) it can work without any position information, (ii) it can\nachieve a maximum referebce speed of 9 m/s in trajectory tracking without\nlosing the target, and (iii) it can reach a landmark, e.g., a gate in drone\nracing, from varied initial configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 22:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-24"}

Many such systems are built, maintained, and improved by customer\nservice specialists, rather than dialog systems engineers and computer\nprogrammers. As conversations between people and machines become commonplace,\nit is critical to understand what is working, what is not, and what actions can\nbe taken to reduce the frequency of inappropriate system responses. These\nanalyses and recommendations need to be presented in terms that directly\nreflect the user experience rather than the internal dialog processing.\n  This paper introduces and explains the use of Actionable Conversational\nQuality Indicators (ACQIs), which are used both to recognize parts of dialogs\nthat can be improved, and to recommend how to improve them. This combines\nbenefits of previous approaches, some of which have focused on producing dialog\nquality scoring while others have sought to categorize the types of errors the\ndialog system is making.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of using ACQIs on LivePerson internal dialog\nsystems used in commercial customer service applications, and on the publicly\navailable CMU LEGOv2 conversational dataset (Raux et al. 2005). We report on\nthe annotation and analysis of conversational datasets showing which ACQIs are\nimportant to fix in various situations.\n  The annotated datasets are then used to build a predictive model which uses a\nturn-based vector embedding of the message texts and achieves an 79% weighted\naverage f1-measure at the task of finding the correct ACQI for a given\nconversation. We predict that if such a model worked perfectly, the range of\npotential improvement actions a bot-builder must consider at each turn could be\nreduced by an average of 81%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 22:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-24"}

The isolated AGN and AGN\nin pairs show similar distributions in their global stellar mass, star\nformation rate (SFR), and central [OIII] surface brightness. AGNs in pairs show\nradial profiles of increasing specific SFR and declining Dn4000 from center to\noutskirts, and no significant difference from the isolated AGNs. This is\nclearly different from star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in our pair sample, which\nshow enhanced central star formation, as reported before. AGNs in pairs have\nlower Balmer decrements at outer regions, possibly indicating less dust\nattenuation. Our findings suggest that AGNs likely follow an inside-out\nquenching and the merger impact on the star formation in AGNs is less prominent\nthan in SFGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 00:28:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 13:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

The\nretrieval step is especially difficult as typical evidence corpora have\n\\textit{millions} of documents, each of which may or may not have the correct\nanswer to the question. Very recently, dense models have replaced sparse\nmethods as the de facto retrieval method. Rather than focusing on lexical\noverlap to determine similarity, dense methods build an encoding function that\ncaptures semantic similarity by learning from a small collection of\nquestion-answer or question-context pairs. In this paper, we investigate dense\nretrieval models in the context of open-domain question answering across\ndifferent input distributions. To do this, first we introduce an entity-rich\nquestion answering dataset constructed from Wikidata facts and demonstrate\ndense models are unable to generalize to unseen input question distributions.\nSecond, we perform analyses aimed at better understanding the source of the\nproblem and propose new training techniques to improve out-of-domain\nperformance on a wide variety of datasets.

B {\\bf 98}, 094507 (2018); {\\bf 100}, 104513 (2019)], we construct the\ncoupled dual dynamics of macroscopic phase coherence and microscopic electronic\nfluids in cuprate superconductors. We prove that the developed dual dynamics\nprovides an efficient and simplified approach to formulate the dephasing\nprocess of macroscopic superconducting phase coherence, as well as its\ninfluence on microscopic electronic fluids (including gap, densities of\nsuperfluid and normal fluid, and in particular, the transport property to\ndetermine superconducting transition temperature $T_c$). We then present\ntheoretical description of the preformed Cooper pairs in pseudogap state. The\nkey origin of pseudogap state comes from the quantum effect of disorder, which\nexcites the macroscopic inhomogeneous phase fluctuation through Josephson\neffect. Influenced by this phase fluctuation, there exist normal fluid and\nviscous superfluid below $T_c$ in cuprate superconductors, in addition to\nconventional non-viscous superfluid. The normal fluid always emerges around\nnodal points even at zero temperature, whereas the viscous superfluid emerges\ndue to the friction between superfluid and normal fluid. Particularly, the\nnon-viscous superfluid gets suppressed when the phase fluctuation is enhanced\nby increasing temperature, until vanishes at $T_c$. Then, the system enters the\npseudogap state, showing the nonzero resistivity as well as the finite gap from\nthe viscous superfluid. By further increasing temperature to $T^{\\rm os}$, the\nviscous superfluid and hence gap vanish. An experimental scheme to distinguish\nthe densities of normal fluid as well as viscous and non-viscous superfluids is\nproposed. Finally, this theory is also applied to low-dimensional disordered\n$s$-wave superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 01:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 07:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

Differing from the perspective camera\nmodel (pin-hole model) that is commonly used for close-range and aerial\ncameras, the cubic rational polynomial camera (RPC) model is the mainstream\nmodel for push-broom linear-array satellite cameras. However, the homography\nwarping used in the prevailing learning based MVS methods is only applicable to\npin-hole cameras. In order to apply the SOTA learning based MVS technology to\nthe satellite MVS task for large-scale Earth surface reconstruction, RPC\nwarping should be considered. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a\nrigorous RPC warping module. The rational polynomial coefficients are recorded\nas a tensor, and the RPC warping is formulated as a series of tensor\ntransformations. Based on the RPC warping, we propose the deep learning based\nsatellite MVS (SatMVS) framework for large-scale and wide depth range Earth\nsurface reconstruction. We also introduce a large-scale satellite image dataset\nconsisting of 519 5120${\\times}$5120 images, which we call the TLC SatMVS\ndataset. The satellite images were acquired from a three-line camera (TLC) that\ncatches triple-view images simultaneously, forming a valuable supplement to the\nexisting open-source WorldView-3 datasets with single-scanline images.\nExperiments show that the proposed RPC warping module and the SatMVS framework\ncan achieve a superior reconstruction accuracy compared to the pin-hole fitting\nmethod and conventional MVS methods.

Following standard\npractice, we focus on graphs with maximum degree at most $\\Delta$ and aim for\ncolorings using a small number $f(\\Delta)$ of colors.\n  A recent breakthrough (Assadi, Chen, and Khanna; SODA~2019) shows that in the\nstandard, non-robust, streaming setting, $(\\Delta+1)$-colorings can be obtained\nwhile using only $\\widetilde{O}(n)$ space.

The cv also offers a dual\ninterpretation as the classical communication cost for zero-error channel\nsimulation using non-signaling resources. We first provide an entropic\ncharacterization of the cv as a generalized conditional min-entropy over the\ncone of separable operators. Additionally, the logarithm of a channel's cv is\nshown to be equivalent to its max-Holevo information, which can further be\nrelated to channel capacity. We evaluate the cv exactly for all qubit channels\nand the Werner-Holevo family of channels. While all classical channels are\nmultiplicative under tensor product, this is no longer true for quantum\nchannels in general. We provide a family of qutrit channels for which the cv is\nnon-multiplicative. On the other hand, we prove that any pair of qubit channels\nhave multiplicative cv when used in parallel.

The idea of\nquantum nonlinear spectroscopy was recently proposed to use quantum probes such\nas entangled photons to achieve sensitivities and resolutions beyond the\nclassical limits. It is shown that quantum sensing can extract arbitrary types\nand orders of correlations in a quantum system by first quantum-entangling a\nsensor and the object and then measuring the sensor. Quantum sensing has been\napplied to achieve nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of single atoms and the\nsecond-order correlation spectroscopy has been adopted to enhance the spectral\nresolution. However, quantum nonlinear spectroscopy (i.e., the measurement of\nhigher-order correlations) of single nuclear spins is still elusive. Here we\ndemonstrate the extraction of fourth-order correlations of single nuclear spins\nthat cannot be measured in conventional nonlinear spectroscopy, using\nsequential weak measurement via an atomic quantum sensor, namely, a\nnitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We show that the quantum nonlinear\nspectroscopy provides fingerprint features to identify different types of\nobjects, such as Gaussian noises, random-phased AC fields, and quantum spins,\nwhich would be indistinguishable in second-order correlations. The measured\nfourth-order correlation unambiguously differentiates a single nuclear spin and\na random-phased AC field. This work constitutes an initial step toward the\napplication of higher-order correlations to quantum sensing, to examining the\nquantum foundation (by, e.g., higher-order Leggett-Garg inequality), and to\nstudying quantum many-body physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 06:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

While the sparse landmarks have\nanatomically ground-truth correspondence, the dense vertex correspondences on\nmost facial regions are unknown. In this view, the current literatures commonly\nresult in reasonable but diverse solutions, which deviate from the optimum to\nthe 3D face dense registration problem. In this paper, we revisit dense\nregistration by a dimension-degraded problem, i.e. proportional segmentation of\na line, and employ an iterative dividing and diffusing method to reach the\nfinal solution uniquely. This method is then extended to 3D surface by\nformulating a local registration problem for dividing and a linear least-square\nproblem for diffusing, with constraints on fixed features. On this basis, we\nfurther propose a multi-resolution algorithm to accelerate the computational\nprocess.

Despite its smallness, it can be\nidentified to stem from two physically distinct mechanisms. On the one hand, a\nKerr nonlinearity of the dye medium yields a photon-photon contact interaction.\nOn the other hand, a heating of the dye medium leads to an additional\nthermo-optic interaction, which is both delayed and non-local. The latter turns\nout to represent the leading contribution to the effective interaction for the\ncurrent 2D experiments. Here we analyse theoretically how the effective\nphoton-photon interaction increases when the system dimension is reduced from\n2D to 1D. To this end, we consider an anisotropic harmonic trapping potential\nand determine via a variational approach how the properties of the photon\nBose-Einstein condensate in general, and both aforementioned interaction\nmechanisms in particular, change with increasing anisotropy. We find that the\nthermo-optic interaction strength increases at first linearly with the trap\naspect ratio and lateron saturates at a certain value of the trap aspect ratio.\nFurthermore, in the strong 1D limit the roles of both interactions get reversed\nas the thermo-optic interaction remains saturated and the contact Kerr\ninteraction becomes the leading interaction mechanism.

The gravitational permittivity mimics the dark matter phenomenology.\nOur covariant formulation of RG (CRG) belongs to the class of scalar-tensor\ntheories, where the scalar field $\\varphi$ has a self-interaction potential\n$\\mathcal{V}(\\varphi)=-\\Xi\\varphi$, with $\\Xi$ a normalization constant. We\nshow that the scalar field is twice the gravitational permittivity in the\nweak-field limit. Far from a spherical source of density $\\rho_s(r)$, the\ntransition between the Newtonian and the RG regime appears below the\nacceleration scale $a_\\Xi=(2\\Xi-8\\pi G\\rho/\\varphi)^{1/2}$, with\n$\\rho=\\rho_s+\\rho_\\mathrm{bg}$ and $\\rho_\\mathrm{bg}$ an isotropic and\nhomogeneous background. In the limit $2\\Xi\\gg 8\\pi G\\rho/\\varphi$, we obtain\n$a_\\Xi\\sim 10^{-10}$~m~s$^{-2}$. This acceleration is comparable to the\nacceleration $a_0$ originally introduced in Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND).\nFrom CRG, we also derive the modified Friedmann equations for an expanding,\nhomogeneous, and isotropic universe. We find that the same scalar field that\nmimics dark matter also drives the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Since\n$\\Xi$ plays a role roughly similar to the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ in\nthe standard model and has a comparable value, CRG suggests a natural\nexplanation of the known relation $a_0\\sim \\Lambda^{1/2}$. CRG thus appears to\ndescribe both the dynamics of cosmic structure and the expanding Universe with\na single scalar field, and falls within the family of models that unify the two\ndark sectors, highlighting a possible deep connection between phenomena\ncurrently attributed to dark matter and dark energy separately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 08:58:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2021 07:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

This brings\nsuch recurrent events to the limelight of attention in interdisciplinary\nresearch. A comprehensive review of recent progress is provided to capture\nrecent improvements in analyzing such very high-amplitude events from the point\nof view of dynamical systems and random walkers. We emphasize, in detail, the\nmechanisms responsible for the emergence of such events in complex systems.\nSeveral mechanisms that contribute to the occurrence of extreme events have\nbeen elaborated that investigate the sources of instabilities leading to them.\nIn addition, we discuss the prediction of extreme events from two different\ncontexts, using dynamical instabilities and data-based machine learning\nalgorithms. Tracking of instabilities in the phase space is not always feasible\nand precise knowledge of the dynamics of extreme events does not necessarily\nhelp in forecasting extreme events. Moreover, in most studies on\nhigh-dimensional systems, only a few degrees of freedom participate in extreme\nevents' formation. Thus, the notable inclusion of prediction through machine\nlearning is of enormous significance, particularly for those cases where the\ngoverning equations of the model are explicitly unavailable. Besides, random\nwalks on complex networks can represent several transport processes, and\nexceedances of the flux of walkers above a prescribed threshold may describe\nextreme events. We unveil the theoretical studies on random walkers with their\nenormous potential for applications in reducing extreme events. We cover the\npossible controlling strategies, which may be helpful to mitigate extreme\nevents in physical situations like traffic jams, heavy load of web requests,\ncompetition for shared resources, floods in the network of rivers, and many\nmore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 09:03:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 12:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

The oscillations are\nexcited by impulsive energy releases, such as low coronal eruptions. Typical\nperiods of the oscillations are from a few to several minutes, and are found to\nincrease linearly with the increase in the major radius of the oscillating\nloops. It clearly demonstrates that kink oscillations are natural modes of the\nloops, and can be described as standing fast magnetoacoustic waves with the\nwavelength determined by the length of the loop. Kink oscillations are observed\nin two different regimes. In the rapidly decaying regime, the apparent\ndisplacement amplitude reaches several minor radii of the loop. The damping\ntime which is about several oscillation periods decreases with the increase in\nthe oscillation amplitude, suggesting a nonlinear nature of the damping. In the\ndecayless regime, the amplitudes are smaller than a minor radius, and the\ndriver is still debated. The review summarises major findings obtained during\nthe last decade, and covers both observational and theoretical results.\nObservational results include creation and analysis of comprehensive catalogues\nof the oscillation events, and detection of kink oscillations with imaging and\nspectral instruments in the EUV and microwave bands. Theoretical results\ninclude various approaches to modelling in terms of the magnetohydrodynamic\nwave theory. Properties of kink oscillations are found to depend on parameters\nof the oscillating loop, such as the magnetic twist, stratification, steady\nflows, temperature variations and so on, which make kink oscillations a natural\nprobe of these parameters by the method of magnetohydrodynamic seismology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 09:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-24"}

Several machine learning-based NIDS have\nbeen proposed in recent years, but most of them were developed and evaluated\nunder the assumption that the training context is similar to the test context.\nIn real networks, this assumption is false, given the emergence of new attacks\nand variants of known attacks. To deal with this reality, the open set\nrecognition field, which is the most general task of recognizing classes not\nseen during training in any domain, began to gain importance in NIDS research.\nYet, existing solutions are often bounded to high temporal complexities and\nperformance bottlenecks. In this work, we propose an algorithm to be used in\nNIDS that performs open set recognition. Our proposal is an adaptation of the\nsingle-class Energy-based Flow Classifier (EFC), which proved to be an\nalgorithm with strong generalization capability and low computational cost. The\nnew version of EFC correctly classifies not only known attacks, but also\nunknown ones, and differs from other proposals from the literature by\npresenting a single layer with low temporal complexity. Our proposal was\nevaluated against well-established multi-class algorithms and as an open set\nclassifier.

The recent commercial trends show a\nrising number of farmers who directly sell their products and are interested in\nusing smart solutions for a continuous quality control of the product.\nCloud-based approaches for smart irrigation have been widely used in the recent\nyears. However, the network traffic, security and regulatory challenges, which\ncome hand in hand with sharing the crop data with third parties outside the\nedge of the network, lead strawberry farmers and data owners to rely on global\nclouds and potentially lose control over their data, which are usually\ntransferred to third party data centers.

In contrast, poorly designed\nDES can accelerate the degeneration of existing network infrastructure. Most\noptimisation models used to design grid-connected DES have oversimplified or\nexcluded constraints associated with alternating current (AC) power flow, as\nthe latter has been studied in a standalone class of models known as Optimal\nPower Flow (OPF). A small subset of models, labelled DES-OPF models, have\nattempted to combine these independent frameworks. However, the impacts of\nusing a DES-OPF framework on the resulting designs, as opposed to a\nconventional DES framework without AC power flow, have not been studied in\nprevious work.

Two test cases of varying scale are employed to test the frameworks\nand compare resulting designs. The practical feasibility of the designs is\nassessed, based on whether the designs can mitigate network violations and\nenergy wastage during standard operation. Results demonstrate that the baseline\nMILP underestimates total costs due to its inability to detect current and\nvoltage violations, resulting in a 37% increase for one case study when tested\nwith the DES-OPF framework.

We use high\nresolution Solar Orbiter proton velocity distribution function measurements,\ncomplemented by electron and magnetic field data, to analyze the association of\nmultiple proton populations and beams with magnetic reconnection during a\nperiod of slow Alfv\\'enic solar wind on 16 July 2020. Results. At least 6\nreconnecting current sheets with associated multiple proton populations and\nbeams, including a case of magnetic reconnection at a switchback boundary, are\nfound during this day. This represents 2% of the measured distribution\nfunctions. We discuss how this proportion may be underestimated, and how it may\ndepend on solar wind type and distance from the Sun. Conclusions. Although\nsuggesting a likely small contribution, but which remains to be quantitatively\nassessed, Solar Orbiter observations show that magnetic reconnection must be\nconsidered as one of the mechanisms that produce multiple proton populations\nand beams locally in the solar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 09:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

However, dealing with\nits multiscale nature in models of coupled fluid and biological dynamics is a\nformidable challenge. Advection by coherent structures, as those related to\nwinter convection and Langmuir circulation, is also recognized to play a role\nin the survival and localization of phytoplankton. In this work we revisit a\ntheoretically appealing model for phytoplankton vertical dynamics, and\nnumerically investigate how large-scale fluid motions affect the survival\nconditions and the spatial distribution of the biological population. For this\npurpose, and to work with realistic parameter values, we adopt a kinematic flow\nfield to account for the different spatial and temporal scales of turbulent\nmotions. The dynamics of the population density are described by an\nadvection-reaction-diffusion model with a spatially heterogeneous growth term\nproportional to sunlight availability. We explore the role of fluid transport\nby progressively increasing the complexity of the flow in terms of spatial and\ntemporal scales. We find that, due to the large-scale circulation,\nphytoplankton accumulates in downwelling regions and its growth is reduced,\nconfirming previous indications in slightly different conditions. We then\nexplain the observed phenomenology in terms of a plankton filament model.\nMoreover, by contrasting the results in our different flow cases, we show that\nthe large-scale coherent structures have an overwhelming importance. Indeed, we\nfind that smaller-scale motions only quite weakly affect the dynamics, without\naltering the general mechanism identified. Such results are relevant for\nparameterizations in numerical models of phytoplankton life cycles in realistic\noceanic flow conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 09:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

Expansions of this perturbation in a Taylor series, i.e.\nquantum alchemy, has been used in literature to assess millions of derivative\ncompounds at once rather than enumerating them in costly quantum chemistry\ncalculations. So far, it was unclear whether this series even converges for\nsmall molecules, whether it can be used for geometry relaxation and how strong\nthis perturbation may be to still obtain convergent numbers.

Nonetheless,\nthere is no consensus regarding the mechanism at the origin of these outflows,\nnor on the cause of the less-frequently observed monopolar outflows. We aim to\nidentify the origin of early massive protostellar outflows, focusing on the\ncombined effects of radiative transfer and magnetic fields in a turbulent\nmedium. We use four state-of-the-art radiation-magnetohydrodynamical\nsimulations following the collapse of massive 100 Msun pre-stellar cores with\nthe Ramses code. Turbulence is taken into account via initial velocity\ndispersion. We use a hybrid radiative transfer method and include ambipolar\ndiffusion. We find that turbulence delays the launching of outflows, which\nappear to be mainly driven by magnetohydrodynamical processes. Magnetic tower\nflow and the magneto-centrifugal acceleration contribute to the acceleration\nand the former operates on larger volumes than the latter. Our finest\nresolution, 5 AU, does not allow us to get converged results on\nmagneto-centrifugally accelerated outflows. Radiative acceleration takes place\nas well, dominates in the star vicinity, enlarges the outflow extent, and has\nno negative impact on the launching of magnetic outflows (up to M~17 Msun,\nL~1e5 Lsun). The associated opening angles (20-30 deg when magnetic fields\ndominate) suggest additional (de-)collimating effects to meet observational\nconstraints. Outflows are launched nearly perpendicular to the disk and are\nmisaligned with the initial core-scale magnetic fields, in agreement with\nseveral observational studies. In the most turbulent run, the outflow is\nmonopolar. We conclude that magnetic processes dominate the acceleration of\nmassive protostellar outflows up to ~17 Msun, against radiative processes.\nTurbulence perturbs the outflow launching and is a possible explanation for\nmonopolar outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 09:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

In this work, we explore a novel attack paradigm by\ninjecting faults during the training phase of a neural network in a way that\nthe resulting network can be attacked during deployment without the necessity\nof further faulting. In particular, we discuss attacks against ReLU activation\nfunctions that make it possible to generate a family of malicious inputs, which\nare called fooling inputs, to be used at inference time to induce controlled\nmisclassifications. Such malicious inputs are obtained by mathematically\nsolving a system of linear equations that would cause a particular behaviour on\nthe attacked activation functions, similar to the one induced in training\nthrough faulting. We call such attacks fooling backdoors as the fault attacks\nat the training phase inject backdoors into the network that allow an attacker\nto produce fooling inputs. We evaluate our approach against multi-layer\nperceptron networks and convolutional networks on a popular image\nclassification task obtaining high attack success rates (from 60% to 100%) and\nhigh classification confidence when as little as 25 neurons are attacked while\npreserving high accuracy on the originally intended classification task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 09:43:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 07:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

As a result, achieving a guaranteed improvement\non the joint policy where each agent acts individually remains an open\nchallenge.

To achieve this goal, high performance, but unverified controllers (e.g.\ndeep neural network, black-box controllers from third parties) are applied,\nwhich makes it very challenging to keep the overall CPS safe. By sandboxing\nthese controllers, we are not only able to use them but also to enforce safety\nproperties over the controlled physical systems at the same time.

Existing methods often address this\ntask in an indirect way, by casting it as a proposal-and-match or\nfusion-and-detection problem. Solving these surrogate problems often requires\nsophisticated label assignment during training and hand-crafted removal of\nnear-duplicate results. Meanwhile, existing works typically focus on sparse\nvideo grounding with a single sentence as input, which could result in\nambiguous localization due to its unclear description. In this paper, we tackle\na new problem of dense video grounding, by simultaneously localizing multiple\nmoments with a paragraph as input. From a perspective on video grounding as\nlanguage conditioned regression, we present an end-to-end parallel decoding\nparadigm by re-purposing a Transformer-alike architecture (PRVG). The key\ndesign in our PRVG is to use languages as queries, and directly regress the\nmoment boundaries based on language-modulated visual representations. Thanks to\nits simplicity in design, our PRVG framework can be applied in different\ntesting schemes (sparse or dense grounding) and allows for efficient inference\nwithout any post-processing technique. In addition, we devise a robust\nproposal-level attention loss to guide the training of PRVG, which is invariant\nto moment duration and contributes to model convergence.

Missing\nlabels are a ubiquitous phenomenon in extreme multi-label classification (XMC)\ntasks, such as matching Wikipedia articles to a small subset out of the\nhundreds of thousands of possible tags, where no human annotator can possibly\ncheck the validity of all the negative samples. For this reason,\npropensity-scored precision -- an unbiased estimate for precision-at-k under a\nknown noise model -- has become one of the standard metrics in XMC. Few methods\ntake this problem into account already during the training phase, and all are\nlimited to loss functions that can be decomposed into a sum of contributions\nfrom each individual label. A typical approach to training is to reduce the\nmultilabel problem into a series of binary or multiclass problems, and it has\nbeen shown that if the surrogate task should be consistent for optimizing\nrecall, the resulting loss function is not decomposable over labels. Therefore,\nthis paper derives the unique unbiased estimators for the different multilabel\nreductions, including the non-decomposable ones. These estimators suffer from\nincreased variance and may lead to ill-posed optimization problems, which we\naddress by switching to convex upper-bounds. The theoretical considerations are\nfurther supplemented by an experimental study showing that the switch to\nunbiased estimators significantly alters the bias-variance trade-off and may\nthus require stronger regularization, which in some cases can negate the\nbenefits of unbiased estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 10:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-24"}

For this purpose, an AL strategy queries annotations\nintelligently from annotators to train a high-performance classification model\nat a low annotation cost. Traditional AL strategies operate in an idealized\nframework. They assume a single, omniscient annotator who never gets tired and\ncharges uniformly regardless of query difficulty. However, in real-world\napplications, we often face human annotators, e.g., crowd or in-house workers,\nwho make annotation mistakes and can be reluctant to respond if tired or faced\nwith complex queries.

Our explicit finite-voltage first-principles calculations show\nthat the previously reported negative differential resistance (NDR)\ncurrent-bias voltage characteristics can be produced not only from the\ngating-induced mismatch between two graphene Dirac cones but from the\nbias-dependent energetic shift of defect levels. Specifically, for a carbon\natom substituted for a nitrogen atom (C$_N$) within inner hBN layers, the\nincrease of bias voltage is found to induce a self-consistent electron filling\nof in-gap C$_N$ states, which leads to changes in voltage drop profiles and\nsymmetric NDR characteristics. On the other hand, with a C$_N$ placed on outer\ninterfacial hBN layers, we find that due to the pinning of C$_N$ levels to\nnearby graphene states voltage drop profiles become bias-independent and NDR\npeaks disappear.

These remote services use their up-to-date\ninformation and global context (view) to help classify the files and instruct\ntheir agents to take a predetermined action (e.g., delete or quarantine). In\nthis study, we provide a security analysis of a specific form of communication\nbetween anti-malware agents and their services, which takes place entirely over\nthe insecure DNS protocol. These services, which we denote DNS anti-malware\nlist (DNSAML) services, affect the classification of files scanned by\nanti-malware agents, therefore potentially putting their consumers at risk due\nto known integrity and confidentiality flaws of the DNS protocol. By analyzing\na large-scale DNS traffic dataset made available to the authors by a well-known\nCDN provider, we identify anti-malware solutions that seem to make use of\nDNSAML services. We found that these solutions, deployed on almost three\nmillion machines worldwide, exchange hundreds of millions of DNS requests\ndaily. These requests are carrying sensitive file scan information, oftentimes\n- as we demonstrate - without any additional safeguards to compensate for the\ninsecurities of the DNS protocol. As a result, these anti-malware solutions\nthat use DNSAML are made vulnerable to DNS attacks. For instance, an attacker\ncapable of tampering with DNS queries, gains the ability to alter the\nclassification of scanned files, without presence on the scanning machine. We\nshowcase three attacks applicable to at least three anti-malware solutions that\ncould result in the disclosure of sensitive information and improper behavior\nof the anti-malware agent, such as ignoring detected threats. Finally, we\npropose and review a set of countermeasures for anti-malware solution providers\nto prevent the attacks stemming from the use of DNSAML services.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 12:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-24"}

The experiments employed particle shadow\nvelocimetry measurements to measure the flow in a column generated by a\nhomogeneous bubble swarm rising in water, for two different bubble diameters\n($2.7$ mm $\\&$ $3.9$ mm) and moderate gas volume fractions\n($0.26\\%\\sim1.31\\%$). The two velocity components were measured at\nhigh-resolution, and used to construct structure functions up to twelfth order\nfor separations spanning the small to large scales in the flow. Concerning the\nflow anisotropy, the velocity structure functions are found to differ for\nseparations in the vertical and horizontal directions of the flow, and the\ncases with smaller bubbles are the most anisotropic, with a dependence on void\nfraction. The degree of anisotropy is shown to increase as the order of the\nstructure functions is increased, showing that extreme events in the flow are\nthe most anisotropic. Our results show that the average energy transfer with\nthe horizontal velocity component is downscale, just as for the\nthree-dimensional single-phase turbulence. However, the energy transfer\nassociated with the vertical component of the fluid velocity is upscale. The\nprobability density functions of the velocity increments reveal that extreme\nvalues become more probable with decreasing Reynolds number, the opposite of\nthe behaviour in single-phase turbulence. We visualize those extreme events and\nfind that regions of intense small scale velocity increments occur near the\nturbulent/non-turbulent interface at the boundary of the bubble wake.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 13:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

The\nrecent realization of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators with tunable\nChern numbers introduces the channel degree of freedom to the dissipation-free\nchiral edge transport and makes the study of the quantum phase transition\nbetween two topological states under zero magnetic field possible. Here, we\nsynthesized the magnetic topological insulator (TI)/TI penta-layer\nheterostructures with different Cr doping concentrations in the middle magnetic\nTI layers using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). By performing transport\nmeasurements, we found a zero magnetic field quantum phase transition between\nthe C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states. In tuning the transition, the Hall resistance\nmonotonically decreases from h/e2 to h/2e2, concurrently, the longitudinal\nresistance exhibits a maximum at the critical point. Our results show that the\nratio between the Hall resistance and the longitudinal resistance is greater\nthan 1 at the critical point, which indicates that the original chiral edge\nchannel from the C = 1 QAH state coexists with the dissipative bulk conduction\nchannels. Subsequently, these bulk conduction channels appear to self-organize\nand form the second chiral edge channel in completing the plateau phase\ntransition. Our study will motivate further investigations of this novel Chern\nnumber change-induced quantum phase transition and advance the development of\nthe QAH chiral edge current-based electronic and spintronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 13:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

If the type\n(e.g. location or person) of a mentioned entity can be correctly predicted from\nthe context, it may increase the chance of selecting the right candidate by\nassigning low probability to the unlikely ones. This paper proposes\ncluster-based mention typing for named entity disambiguation. The aim of\nmention typing is to predict the type of a given mention based on its context.\nGenerally, manually curated type taxonomies such as Wikipedia categories are\nused. We introduce cluster-based mention typing, where named entities are\nclustered based on their contextual similarities and the cluster ids are\nassigned as types. The hyperlinked mentions and their context in Wikipedia are\nused in order to obtain these cluster-based types. Then, mention typing models\nare trained on these mentions, which have been labeled with their cluster-based\ntypes through distant supervision. At the named entity disambiguation phase,\nfirst the cluster-based types of a given mention are predicted and then, these\ntypes are used as features in a ranking model to select the best entity among\nthe candidates. We represent entities at multiple contextual levels and obtain\ndifferent clusterings (and thus typing models) based on each level. As each\nclustering breaks the entity space differently, mention typing based on each\nclustering discriminates the mention differently.

The differentiable nature of HALO is shown to improve the quality\nof the synthesized hands both in terms of physical plausibility and user\npreference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 14:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-24"}

Thus, an experimental probe\nto identify the characters of these featureless CI and DW states are urgently\nneeded. In this work, we theoretically study the correlated insulators and\ndensity-wave states at different integer and fractional fillings of the flat\nbands in magic-angle TBG based on extended unrestricted Hartree-Fock\ncalculations including the Coulomb screening effects from the remote bands. We\nfurther investigate the nonlinear optical response of the various correlated\nstates, and find that the nonlinear optical conductivities can be used to\nidentify the nature of these CI and DW states at most of the fillings.\nTherefore, we propose that nonlinear optical response can serve as a promising\nexperimental probe to unveil the nature of the CI and DW states observed in\nmagic-angle TBG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 15:31:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2022 16:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Thus, noise removal is a necessary step to draw conclusions from these\ndata, and it often becomes quite essential to construct dynamical models using\nthese data. We discuss a methodology to learn differential equation(s) using\nnoisy and sparsely sampled measurements. In our methodology, the main\ninnovation can be seen in of integration of deep neural networks with a\nclassical numerical integration method. Precisely, we aim at learning a neural\nnetwork that implicitly represents the data and an additional neural network\nthat models the vector fields of the dependent variables. We combine these two\nnetworks by enforcing the constraint that the data at the next time-steps can\nbe given by following a numerical integration scheme such as the fourth-order\nRunge-Kutta scheme. The proposed framework to learn a model predicting the\nvector field is highly effective under noisy measurements. The approach can\nhandle scenarios where dependent variables are not available at the same\ntemporal grid. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to\nlearning models using data obtained from various differential equations. The\nproposed approach provides a promising methodology to learn dynamic models,\nwhere the first-principle understanding remains opaque.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 15:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-24"}

Therefore, we propose an end-to-end semantic\nsegmentation-assisted scene completion network, including a 2D completion\nbranch and a 3D semantic segmentation branch.

In autonomous systems, the agents also need to mitigate\nsimilar behavior to continually learn the new object categories and adapt to\nnew environments. In most conventional deep neural networks, this is not\npossible due to the problem of catastrophic forgetting, where the newly gained\nknowledge overwrites existing representations. Furthermore, most\nstate-of-the-art models excel either in recognizing the objects or in grasp\nprediction, while both tasks use visual input. The combined architecture to\ntackle both tasks is very limited. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid model\narchitecture consists of a dynamically growing dual-memory recurrent neural\nnetwork (GDM) and an autoencoder to tackle object recognition and grasping\nsimultaneously. The autoencoder network is responsible to extract a compact\nrepresentation for a given object, which serves as input for the GDM learning,\nand is responsible to predict pixel-wise antipodal grasp configurations. The\nGDM part is designed to recognize the object in both instances and categories\nlevels. We address the problem of catastrophic forgetting using the intrinsic\nmemory replay, where the episodic memory periodically replays the neural\nactivation trajectories in the absence of external sensory information. To\nextensively evaluate the proposed model in a lifelong setting, we generate a\nsynthetic dataset due to lack of sequential 3D objects dataset.

Prediction performances not only depend on the structure and features of\nthe model, but also on its parametrization. Official databases are often biased\ndue to lag in reporting of cases, changing testing policy or incompleteness of\ndata. Moreover, model parametrization is time-dependent e.g. due to changing\nage-structures, new emerging virus variants, non-pharmaceutical interventions\nand ongoing vaccination programs. To cover these aspects, we develop a\nprincipled approach to parametrize SIR-type epidemiologic models of different\ncomplexities by embedding the model structure as a hidden layer into a general\nInput-Output Non-Linear Dynamical System (IO-NLDS). Non-explicitly modelled\nimpacts on the system are imposed as inputs of the system. Observable data are\ncoupled to hidden states of the model by appropriate data models considering\npossible biases of the data. We estimate model parameters including their\ntime-dependence by a Bayesian knowledge synthesis process considering parameter\nranges derived from external studies as prior information. We applied this\napproach on a SIR-type model and data of Germany and Saxony demonstrating good\nprediction performances. By our approach, we can estimate and compare for\nexample the relative effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and can\nprovide scenarios of the future course of the epidemic under specified\nconditions. Our method of parameter estimation can be translated to other data\nsets, i.e. other countries and other SIR-type models even for other disease\ncontexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 10:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

It is common belief that the initial condition is compatible\nwith the boundary condition if the initial condition fulfills the boundary\ncondition but this is not sufficient.

This arrangement allows idle\nmemories to be temporarily overwritten without being forgotten, in favour of\nnew memories utilised in the short-term. While embedded artificial intelligence\ncan greatly benefit from such functionality, a practical demonstration in\nhardware is still missing. Here, we show how the intrinsic properties of\nmetal-oxide volatile memristors emulate the hidden processes that support\nbiological palimpsest consolidation.

The synapses can also implement familiarity detection of previously\nforgotten memories. Crucially, palimpsest operation is achieved automatically\nand without the need for specialised instructions.

The\nconversion of must allows mapping of classes of objects with a higher\nLevel-Of-Detail (LOD) such as LOD3 and LOD4 which represent an urban city model\nin greater detail. A methodology of the conversion is developed and a prototype\nis implemented to validate the algorithms and the methods developed for this\nproject. The methods can be broadly categorized into three parts a) Extraction\nof geometric information; b) Segmentation of the model into various groups for\nsemantic mapping; c) Mapping of semantic information on the model. Topological\naspects are considered for the mesh segmentation to allow users to easily\nselect and map semantic information to the geometric model. The generated\nmodels can be used in a wide range of applications ranging from disaster\nmanagement to urban simulations such as rooftop solar panel installations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 06:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

This paper describes a new ASIC design of a coprocessor that\nrealizes process scheduling for mixed-criticality real-time systems. The\nsolution proposed in this paper uses Robust Earliest Deadline (RED) algorithm.\nDue to the on-chip implementation of the scheduler, all scheduler operations\nalways take two clock cycles to execute. The proposed solution was verified by\nsimulations that applied millions of random inputs. Chip area costs are\nevaluated by synthesis into ASIC using 28 nm TSMC technology. The proposed\nRED-based scheduler is compared with an existing EDF-based scheduler that\nsupports hard real-time processes only. Even though the RED-based scheduler\ncosts more chip area, it can handle any combinations of process criticalities,\nvariations of process execution times and deadlines, achieves higher CPU\nutilization and can be used for scheduling of non-real-time, soft real-time and\nhard real-time processes combined within one system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 13:17:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

The paper aims to analyze\nthese models across various domains. The goal of this work is to bring the\nrelevant literature, and ontology models under one umbrella, and perform a\nparametric comparative study. A systematic literature review methodology was\nadopted for an extensive literature selection. A random stratified sampling\ntechnique was used to select the models from the literature. The findings\nexplicate a comparative view of the narrative models across domains. The\ndifferences and similarities of knowledge representation across domains, in\ncase of narrative information models based on ontology was identified. There\nare significantly fewer studies that reviewed the ontology-based narrative\nmodels. This work goes a step further by evaluating the ontologies using the\nparameters from narrative components. This paper will explore the basic\nconcepts and top-level concepts in the models. Besides, this study provides a\ncomprehensive study of the narrative theories in the context of ongoing\nresearch.

Handwriting recognition is challenging\nbecause of the virtually infinite number of ways a person can write the same\nmessage. For this proposal we introduce Kazakh handwritten text recognition\nresearch, a comprehensive dataset of Kazakh handwritten texts is necessary.\nThis is particularly true given the lack of a dataset for handwritten Kazakh\ntext.
