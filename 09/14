Almost all existing video grounding\nmethods fall into two frameworks: 1) Top-down model: It predefines a set of\nsegment candidates and then conducts segment classification and regression. 2)\nBottom-up model: It directly predicts frame-wise probabilities of the\nreferential segment boundaries. However, all these methods are not end-to-end,\ni.e., they always rely on some time-consuming post-processing steps to refine\npredictions. To this end, we reformulate video grounding as a set prediction\ntask and propose a novel end-to-end multi-modal Transformer model, dubbed as\nGTR. Specifically, GTR has two encoders for video and language encoding, and a\ncross-modal decoder for grounding prediction. To facilitate the end-to-end\ntraining, we use a Cubic Embedding layer to transform the raw videos into a set\nof visual tokens. To better fuse these two modalities in the decoder, we design\na new Multi-head Cross-Modal Attention. The whole GTR is optimized via a\nMany-to-One matching loss. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive studies to\ninvestigate different model design choices. Extensive results on three\nbenchmarks have validated the superiority of GTR. All three typical GTR\nvariants achieve record-breaking performance on all datasets and metrics, with\nseveral times faster inference speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 16:01:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 09:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

A somewhat trivial example is the Schr\\\"odinger equation of a\nharmonic oscillator. The Noether charge for its particle number coincides with\nthe square norm of the wave function, and the energy eigenvalue is a Lagrange\nmultiplier for the condition that the wave function is properly normalized. A\nmore elaborate example is the Gross-Pitaevskii equation that models vortices in\na cold atom Bose-Einstein condensate. In an oblate, essentially two dimensional\nharmonic trap the energy minimum is a topologically protected timecrystalline\nvortex that rotates around the trap center. Additional examples are constructed\nusing coarse grained Hamiltonian models of closed molecular chains. When\nknotted, the topology of a chain can support a time crystal. As a physical\nexample, high precision all-atom molecular dynamics is used to analyze an\nisolated cyclopropane molecule. The simulation reveals that the molecular\nD$_{3h}$ symmetry becomes spontaneously broken. When the molecule is observed\nwith sufficiently long stroboscopic time steps it appears to rotate like a\nsimple Hamiltonian time crystal. When the length of the stroboscopic time step\nis decreased the rotational motion becomes increasingly ratcheting and\neventually it resembles the back-and-forth oscillations of Sisyphus dynamics.\nThe stroboscopic rotation is entirely due to atomic level oscillatory shape\nchanges, so that cyclopropane is an example of a molecule that can rotate\nwithout angular momentum.

This becomes a relevant topic if the semiclassical\nsector of a given quantum theory wants to be analysed. As a simple setup we\nconsider the toy model of a deparametrised system with one constraint that\ninvolves a fractional power of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian operator and\nwe discuss two approaches for finding suitable coherent states for this system.\nIn the first approach we consider Dirac quantisation and group averaging that\nhave been used by Ashtekar et. al. but only for integer powers of operators.\nOur generalisation to fractional powers yields in the case of the toy model a\nsuitable set of coherent states. The second approach is inspired by coherent\nstates based on a fractional Poisson distribution introduced by Laskin, which\nhowever turn out not to satisfy all properties to yield good semiclassical\nresults for the operators considered here and in particular do not satisfy a\nresolution of identity as claimed. Therefore, we present a generalisation of\nthe standard harmonic oscillator coherent states to states involving fractional\nlabels, which approximate the fractional operators in our toy model\nsemiclassically more accurately and satisfy a resolution of identity. In\naddition, motivated by the way the proof of the resolution of identity is\nperformed, we consider these kind of coherent states also for the polymerised\nharmonic oscillator and discuss their semiclassical properties\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 16:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

Large-scale labeled training data is\noften difficult to collect, especially for person identities. A natural\nquestion is whether a good person search model can be trained without the need\nof identity supervision. In this paper, we present a weakly supervised setting\nwhere only bounding box annotations are available.

Towards learning useful representations for recognition in the\nabsence of identity labels, we supervise the R-SiamNet with instance-level\nconsistency loss and cluster-level contrastive loss. For instance-level\nconsistency learning, the R-SiamNet is constrained to extract consistent\nfeatures from each person region with or without out-of-region context.

To this end, surface slabs were\nsubjected to different strain states (uniaxial, biaxial, shear, and a\ncombination of them) up to strains dictated by the mechanical stability limits\nindicated by phonon calculations. It was found that the adsorption energy\nfollowed the predictions of the d-band theory but -- surprisingly -- the\nvariations in the adsorption energy only depended on the area of the adsorption\nhole and not on the particular elastic strain tensor applied to achieve this\narea. The analysis of the electronic structure showed that the applied strains\ndid not modify the shape of Projected Density of State (PDOS) of the d-orbitals\nof the transition metals but only led to a shift in the energy levels.\nMoreover, the presence of the adsorbates on the surfaces led to negligible\nchanges in the PDOS. Thus, the adsorption energies were a function of the Fermi\nenergy which in turn was associated to the change of the area of the adsorption\nthrough a general linear law that was valid for all metals.

As a result, a VQA model trained solely on human-annotated\nexamples could easily over-fit specific question styles or image contents that\nare being asked, leaving the model largely ignorant about the sheer diversity\nof questions. Existing methods address this issue primarily by introducing an\nauxiliary task such as visual grounding, cycle consistency, or debiasing. In\nthis paper, we take a drastically different approach. We found that many of the\n\"unknowns\" to the learned VQA model are indeed \"known\" in the dataset\nimplicitly. For instance, questions asking about the same object in different\nimages are likely paraphrases; the number of detected or annotated objects in\nan image already provides the answer to the \"how many\" question, even if the\nquestion has not been annotated for that image.

Unfortunately, many GPU programming\nspecifications say almost nothing about relative forward progress guarantees\nbetween workgroups.

The\nspline perturbation model recovers a consistent primary mass distribution with\nprevious results, corroborating the existence of a peak at $35\\,M_\\odot$\n($>97\\%$ credibility) found with the \\textsc{Powerlaw+Peak} model. The peak\ncould be the result pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISNe). The\nspline perturbation model finds potential signs of additional features in the\nprimary mass distribution at lower masses similar to those previously reported\nby Tiwari and Fairhurst (2021). However, with fluctuations due to small number\nstatistics, the simpler \\textsc{Powerlaw+Peak} and \\textsc{BrokenPowerlaw}\nmodels are both still perfectly consistent with observations. Our\nsemi-parametric approach serves as a way to bridge the gap between parametric\nand non-parametric models to more accurately measure the BBH mass distribution.\nWith larger catalogs we will be able to use this model to resolve possible\nadditional features that could be used to perform cosmological measurements,\nand will build on our understanding of BBH formation, stellar evolution and\nnuclear astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 17:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 16:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

Prolonged conduction through the myocardium can occur with HF, and\na device-driven approach, termed cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), can\nimprove left ventricular (LV) myocardial conduction patterns. While a\nfunctional benefit of CRT has been demonstrated, a large proportion of HF\npatients (30-50%) receiving CRT do not show sufficient improvement. Moreover,\nidentifying HF patients that would benefit from CRT prospectively remains a\nclinical challenge. Accordingly, strategies to effectively predict those HF\npatients that would derive a functional benefit from CRT holds great medical\nand socio-economic importance. Thus, we used machine learning methods of\nclassifying HF patients, namely Cluster Analysis, Decision Trees, and\nArtificial neural networks, to develop predictive models of individual outcomes\nfollowing CRT. Clinical, functional, and biomarker data were collected in HF\npatients before and following CRT. A prospective 6-month endpoint of a\nreduction in LV volume was defined as a CRT response. Using this approach (418\nresponders, 412 non-responders), each with 56 parameters, we could classify HF\npatients based on their response to CRT with more than 95% success. We have\ndemonstrated that using machine learning approaches can identify HF patients\nwith a high probability of a positive CRT response (95% accuracy), and of equal\nimportance, identify those HF patients that would not derive a functional\nbenefit from CRT. Developing this approach into a clinical algorithm to assist\nin clinical decision-making regarding the use of CRT in HF patients would\npotentially improve outcomes and reduce health care costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 17:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

The resulting framework has several useful properties: We show that\nTERM can increase or decrease the influence of outliers, respectively, to\nenable fairness or robustness; has variance-reduction properties that can\nbenefit generalization; and can be viewed as a smooth approximation to the tail\nprobability of losses. Our work makes rigorous connections between TERM and\nrelated objectives, such as Value-at-Risk, Conditional Value-at-Risk, and\ndistributionally robust optimization (DRO). We develop batch and stochastic\nfirst-order optimization methods for solving TERM, provide convergence\nguarantees for the solvers, and show that the framework can be efficiently\nsolved relative to common alternatives. Finally, we demonstrate that TERM can\nbe used for a multitude of applications in machine learning, such as enforcing\nfairness between subgroups, mitigating the effect of outliers, and handling\nclass imbalance.

Our idea is to\nlearn a ROM for both these objects, which, unlike the solution, are well\napproximable in a linear reduced space. A ROM for the (untransformed) solution\nis then recovered via a recomposition. The transformed solution results from\ncomposing the solution with a spatial transform that aligns the spatial\ndiscontinuities. Furthermore, the de-transformer is the inverse of the spatial\ntransform and lets us recover a ROM for the solution. We consider an image\nregistration technique to compute the spatial transform, and to learn a ROM, we\nresort to the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) methodology.

Business users often make decisions to achieve key\nperformance indicators (KPIs) such as increasing customer retention or sales,\nor decreasing costs. To discover the relationship between data attributes\nhypothesized to be drivers and those corresponding to KPIs of interest,\nbusiness users currently need to perform lengthy exploratory analyses. This\ninvolves considering multitudes of combinations and scenarios and performing\nslicing, dicing, and transformations on the data accordingly, e.g., analyzing\ncustomer retention across quarters of the year or suggesting optimal media\nchannels across strata of customers. However, the increasing complexity of\ndatasets combined with the cognitive limitations of humans makes it challenging\nto carry over multiple hypotheses, even for simple datasets.

This circumstance suggests a need\nfor alternative learning approaches that do not require corresponding depth\nmeasurements. Indeed, self-supervised learning of depth estimation provides an\nincreasingly popular alternative. It is based on the idea that observed frames\ncan be synthesized from neighboring frames if accurate depth of the scene is\nknown - or in this case, estimated. We show empirically that - contrary to\ncommon belief - improvements in image synthesis do not necessitate improvement\nin depth estimation. Rather, optimizing for image synthesis can result in\ndiverging performance with respect to the main prediction objective - depth.

Most existing\nUDA methods focus on learning domain-invariant feature representation, either\nfrom the domain level or category level, using convolution neural networks\n(CNNs)-based frameworks. One fundamental problem for the category level based\nUDA is the production of pseudo labels for samples in target domain, which are\nusually too noisy for accurate domain alignment, inevitably compromising the\nUDA performance. With the success of Transformer in various tasks, we find that\nthe cross-attention in Transformer is robust to the noisy input pairs for\nbetter feature alignment, thus in this paper Transformer is adopted for the\nchallenging UDA task. Specifically, to generate accurate input pairs, we design\na two-way center-aware labeling algorithm to produce pseudo labels for target\nsamples.

Taking as input a variational principle at the global level, we\ndevelop a systematic formalism inducing consistent variational principles (and\nin particular, boundary actions) for the subregion $M$. This relies on a\npost-selection procedure on $\\Gamma$, which isolates the subsector of the\nglobal theory compatible with a general choice of gauge-invariant boundary\nconditions for the dynamics in $M$. Crucially, the latter relate the\nconfiguration fields on $\\Gamma$ to a dynamical frame field carrying\ninformation about the spacetime complement of $M$; as such, they may be\nequivalently interpreted as frame-dressed or relational observables.\nGenerically, the external frame field keeps an imprint on the ensuing dynamics\nfor subregion $M$, where it materializes itself as a local field on the\ntime-like boundary $\\Gamma$; in other words, an edge mode. We identify boundary\nsymmetries as frame reorientations and show that they divide into three types,\ndepending on the boundary conditions, that affect the physical status of the\nedge modes.

We find that baryons exactly follow the\nunderlying DM distribution only down to r~7 Mpc to the filament spines. At\nshorter distances (r<7 Mpc), the baryon fraction profile of filaments departs\nfrom the cosmic value $\\Omega_\\mathrm{b} / \\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$. While in the\nr~0.7-7 Mpc radial domain this departure is due to the radial accretion of the\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) towards the filament cores (creating an\nexcess of baryons with respect to the cosmic fraction), the cores of filaments\n(r<0.7 Mpc) show a clear baryon depletion instead. The analysis of the\nefficiency of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback events in filaments reveals\nthat they are potentially powerful enough to eject gas outside of the\ngravitational potential wells of filaments. We show that the large-scale\nenvironment (i.e. denser versus less dense, hotter versus colder regions) has a\nnon-negligible effect on the absolute values of the DM, gas, and stellar\ndensities around filaments. Nevertheless, the relative distribution of baryons\nwith respect to the underlying DM density field is found to be independent of\nthe filament population. Finally, we provide scaling relations between the gas\ndensity, temperature, and pressure for the different populations of cosmic\nfilaments. We compare these relations to those pertaining to clusters of\ngalaxies, and find that these cosmic structures occupy separate regions of the\ndensity-temperature and density-pressure planes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 21:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Through a\nset of simulations we quantify the completeness of our data in terms of $M_{\\rm\ndust}$, $L_{\\rm IR}$ and $\\langle U \\rangle$, and subsequently characterise the\ndistribution and evolution of these parameters with redshift. We focus on the\ndust-to-stellar mass ratio ($f_{\\rm dust}$), which we parametrise as a function\nof cosmic age, stellar mass, and specific star formation rate. The $f_{\\rm\ndust}$ is found to increase by a factor of 10 from $z=0$ to $z=2$ and appears\nto remain flat at higher$-z$, mirroring the evolution of the gas fraction. We\nalso find a growing fraction of warm to cold dust with increasing distance from\nthe main sequence, indicative of more intense interstellar radiation fields,\nhigher star formation efficiencies and more compact star forming regions for\nstarburst galaxies. Finally, we construct the dust mass functions (DMF) of\nstar-forming galaxies up to $z=1$ by transforming the stellar mass function to\nDMF through the scaling relations derived here. The evolution of $f_{\\rm dust}$\nand the recovered DMFs are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions\nof the Horizon-AGN and IllustrisTNG simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 18:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Nevertheless, the substantial challenge of\nincorporating disorder systematically into the semiclassical model persists,\nleading to quantitative inaccuracies and occasionally erroneous predictions for\nthe expectation values of physical observables. In the present work we provide\na general prescription for reformulating the semiclassical equations of motion\nfor carriers in disordered conductors by taking the quantum mechanical density\nmatrix as the starting point. We focus on external electric fields, without\nmagnetic fields, and spin-independent disorder. The density matrix approach\nallows averaging over impurity configurations, and the trace of the velocity\noperator with the disorder-averaged density matrix can be reinterpreted as the\nsemiclassical velocity weighted by the Boltzmann distribution function. Through\nthis rationale the well-known intrinsic group and anomalous velocities are\ntrivially recovered, while we demonstrate the existence of an extrinsic\ninterband velocity, namely a disorder correction to the semiclassical velocity\nof Bloch electrons, mediated by the interband matrix elements of the Berry\nconnection. A similar correction is present in the non-equilibrium expectation\nvalue of the spin operator, contributing to spin-orbit torques. To obtain\nagreement with diagrammatic approaches the scattering term in the Boltzmann\nequation is corrected to first order in the electric field, and the Boltzmann\nequation is solved up to sub-leading order in the disorder potential. Our\nprescription ensures all vertex corrections present in diagrammatic treatments\nare taken into account, and to illustrate this we discuss model cases in\ntopological insulators, including the anomalous Hall effect as well as\nspin-orbit torques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 18:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

We use the\nMolecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) data to constrain the\nelemental composition of the gas at the locations of potentially forming\nplanets. The elemental abundances are inferred by comparing source-specific\ngas-grain thermochemical models, with variable C/O ratios and small-grain\nabundances, from the DALI code with CO and C2H column densities derived from\nthe high-resolution observations of the disks of AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC\n480. Elevated C/O ratios (~2.0), even within the CO ice line, are necessary to\nmatch the inferred C2H column densities, over most of the pebble disk. Combined\nwith constraints on the CO abundances in these systems, this implies that both\nthe O/H and C/H ratios in the gas are substellar by a factor of 4-10, with the\nO/H depleted by a factor of 20-50, resulting in the high C/O ratios. This\nnecessitates that even within the CO ice line, most of the volatile carbon and\noxygen is still trapped on grains in the midplane. Planets accreting gas in the\ngaps of the AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480 disks will thus acquire very little\ncarbon and oxygen after reaching the pebble isolation mass. In the absence of\natmosphere-enriching events, these planets would thus have a strongly\nsubstellar O/H and C/H and superstellar C/O atmospheric composition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 18:00:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 18:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Our analysis employs $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O ($J$=2-1), (1-0), and\nC$^{17}$O (1-0) line observations of five protoplanetary disks. We retrieve CO\ngas density distributions, using three independent methods: (1) a\nthermo-chemical modeling framework based on the CO data, the broadband spectral\nenergy distribution, and the mm-continuum emission; (2) an empirical\ntemperature distribution based on optically thick CO lines; and (3) a direct\nfit to the C$^{17}$O hyperfine lines. Results from these methods generally show\nexcellent agreement. The CO gas column density profiles of the five disks show\nsignificant variations in the absolute value and the radial shape. Assuming a\ngas-to-dust mass ratio of 100, all five disks have a global CO-to-H$_2$\nabundance of 10-100 times lower than the ISM ratio. The CO gas distributions\nbetween 150-400 au match well with models of viscous disks, supporting the\nlong-standing theory. CO gas gaps appear to be correlated with continuum gap\nlocations, but some deep continuum gaps do not have corresponding CO gaps. The\nrelative depths of CO and dust gaps are generally consistent with predictions\nof planet-disk interactions, but some CO gaps are 5-10 times shallower than\npredictions based on dust gaps.

The developed controller compensates for the uncertainty in\nthe control input effectiveness caused by a pitch actuator fault, unmeasurable\nwind disturbance, and nonlinearity in the model. Wind turbines have multi-layer\nstructures such that the high-level structure is nonlinearly coupled through an\naggregation of the low-level control authorities. Hence, the control design is\ndivided into two stages. First, an $\\mathcal{L}_2$ controller is designed to\nattenuate the influence of wind disturbance fluctuations on the rotor speed.\nThen, in the low-level layer, a controller is designed using a proposed\nadaptation mechanism to compensate for actuator faults. The theoretical results\nshow that the closed-loop equilibrium point of the regulated rotor speed\ntracking error dynamics in the high level is finite-gain $\\mathcal{L}_2$\nstable, and the closed-loop error dynamics in the low level is globally\nasymptotically stable.

Two metrics, that could even be the same, could\nlook completely different in different coordinates. This is the gauge problem.\nThe general gauge problem is extremely subtle for non-compact spaces. Often it\ncan be avoided if one uses some additional structure of the particular\nsituation. However, in many problems there is no additional structure. Instead\nwe solve the gauge problem directly in great generality.\n  The techniques and ideas apply to many problems. We use them to solve a\nwell-known open problem in Ricci flow: Strong rigidity of cylinders. Strong\nrigidity is an illustration of a {\\it shrinker principle} that uniqueness\nradiates out from a compact set. It implies that if one tangent flow at a\nfuture singular point is a cylinder, then all tangent flows are.\n  We solve the gauge problem by solving a nonlinear system of PDEs. The PDE\nproduces a diffeomorphism that fixes an appropriate gauge in the spirit of the\nslice theorem for group actions. We then show optimal bounds for the\ndisplacement function of the diffeomorphism. Strong rigidity relies on gauge\nfixing and several other new ideas.

While distilling Bell pairs is the canonical setting,\nit is important to study the distillation of multipartite entangled states\nbecause these can be useful for realizing distributed algorithms on quantum\nnetworks. In this paper, we study the distillation of GHZ states using quantum\nerror correcting codes (QECCs). Using the stabilizer formalism, we begin by\nexplaining the QECC-based Bell pair distillation protocol in arXiv:0708.3699,\nwhich relies particularly on the transpose symmetry between Alice's and Bob's\nqubits in Bell states. Extending this idea, we show that, given $n$ GHZ states,\nperforming a matrix on Alice's qubits is equivalent to performing a \"stretched\"\nversion of the transpose of the matrix on the qubits of Bob and Charlie. We\ncall this mapping to the stretched version of the matrix the GHZ-map, and show\nthat it is an algebra homomorphism. Using this property, we show that Alice\nprojecting her qubits onto an $[[n,k]]$ stabilizer code implies the\nsimultaneous projection of Bob's and Charlie's qubits onto an induced\n$[[2n,k]]$ stabilizer code. Guided by this insight, we develop a GHZ\ndistillation protocol based on local operations and classical communication\nthat uses any stabilizer code. Inspired by stabilizer measurements on GHZ\nstates, we also develop a new algorithm to generate logical Pauli operators of\nany stabilizer code and use it in the protocol. Since quantum codes with finite\nrate and almost linear minimum distance have recently been discovered, this\npaper paves the way for high-rate high-output-fidelity GHZ distillation. We\nprovide simulation results on the $5$-qubit perfect code to emphasize the\nimportance of the placement of a certain local Clifford operation in the\nprotocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 18:32:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 06:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

One major obstacle stuck on the way to hardware agile development is\nthe considerably time-consuming process of accurate circuit quality evaluation.\nTo significantly expedite the circuit evaluation during the translation from\nbehavioral languages to circuit designs, we formulate it as a\nProgram-to-Circuit problem, aiming to exploit the representation power of graph\nneural networks (GNNs) by representing C/C++ programs as graphs. The goal of\nthis work is four-fold. First, we build a standard benchmark containing 40k\nC/C++ programs, each of which is translated to a circuit design with actual\nhardware quality metrics, aiming to facilitate the development of effective\nGNNs targeting this high-demand circuit design area. Second, 14\nstate-of-the-art GNN models are analyzed on the Program-to-Circuit problem. We\nidentify key design challenges of this problem, which should be carefully\nhandled but not yet solved by existing GNNs. The goal is to provide\ndomain-specific knowledge for designing GNNs with suitable inductive biases.\nThird, we discuss three sets of real-world benchmarks for GNN generalization\nevaluation, and analyze the performance gap between standard programs and the\nreal-case ones. The goal is to enable transfer learning from limited training\ndata to real-world large-scale circuit design problems. Fourth, the\nProgram-to-Circuit problem is a representative within the Program-to-X\nframework, a set of program-based analysis problems with various downstream\ntasks. The in-depth understanding of strength and weaknesses in applying GNNs\non Program-to-Circuit could largely benefit the entire family of Program-to-X.\nPioneering in this direction, we expect more GNN endeavors to revolutionize\nthis high-demand Program-to-Circuit problem and to enrich the expressiveness of\nGNNs on programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 19:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

A key challenge in these methods is to\nmaintain the bijectivity of the PolyCube deformation, thus reducing the\nrobustness of these algorithms. In this work, we present an interactive\npipeline for hex meshing that sidesteps this challenge by using a new\nrepresentation of PolyCubes as unions of cuboids.

We allow extensive user control over each stage, such as editing the\nvoxelized PolyCube, positioning surface vertices, and exploring the trade-off\namong competing quality metrics, while also providing automatic alternatives.\nWe validate our method on over one hundred shapes, including models that are\nchallenging for past PolyCube-based and frame-field-based methods.

Existing\nlearning-to-defer frameworks are not designed for sequential settings. That is,\nthey defer at every instance independently, based on immediate predictions,\nwhile ignoring the potential long-term impact of these interventions. As a\nresult, existing frameworks are myopic. Further, they do not defer adaptively,\nwhich is crucial when human interventions are costly. In this work, we propose\nSequential Learning-to-Defer (SLTD), a framework for learning-to-defer to a\ndomain expert in sequential decision-making settings. Contrary to existing\nliterature, we pose the problem of learning-to-defer as model-based\nreinforcement learning (RL) to i) account for long-term consequences of\nML-based actions using RL and ii) adaptively defer based on the dynamics\n(model-based). Our proposed framework determines whether to defer (at each time\nstep) by quantifying whether a deferral now will improve the value compared to\ndelaying deferral to the next time step. To quantify the improvement, we\naccount for potential future deferrals. As a result, we learn a pre-emptive\ndeferral policy (i.e. a policy that defers early if using the ML-based policy\ncould worsen long-term outcomes). Our deferral policy is adaptive to the\nnon-stationarity in the dynamics. We demonstrate that adaptive deferral via\nSLTD provides an improved trade-off between long-term outcomes and deferral\nfrequency on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data with non-stationary\ndynamics. Finally, we interpret the deferral decision by decomposing the\npropagated (long-term) uncertainty around the outcome, to justify the deferral\ndecision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 20:43:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 16:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

We incorporate physics driven domain specific\ninformation as a feature probability map and use the radon transform to\nhighlight features in specific orientations. The proposed framework has been\ntrained on130 Lung ultrasound (LUS) videos and 113 Wrist ultrasound (WUS)\nvideos and validated on 100 Lung ultrasound (LUS) videos and 58 Wrist\nultrasound (WUS) videos acquired from multiple centers across the globe. Images\nfrom both datasets were independently assessed by experts to identify\nclinically relevant features such as A-lines, B-lines and pleura from LUS and\nradial metaphysis, radial epiphysis and carpal bones from WUS videos. The key\npoints detected from both datasets showed high sensitivity (LUS = 99\\% , WUS =\n74\\%) in detecting the image landmarks identified by experts. Also, on\nemploying for classification of the given lung image into normal and abnormal\nclasses, the proposed approach, even with no prior training, achieved an\naverage accuracy of 97\\% and an average F1-score of 95\\% respectively on the\ntask of co-classification with 3 fold cross-validation. With the purely\nunsupervised nature of the proposed approach, we expect the key point detection\napproach to increase the applicability of ultrasound in various examination\nperformed in emergency and point of care.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 22:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Empirically, it has been\nshown that the fictitious discount factor helps reduce variance, and stationary\npolicies serve to save the per-iteration computational cost. Theoretically,\nhowever, there is no existing work on convergence analysis for algorithms with\nthis fictitious discount recipe. This paper takes the first step towards\nanalyzing these algorithms. It focuses on two vanilla policy gradient (VPG)\nvariants: the first being a widely used variant with discounted advantage\nestimations (DAE), the second with an additional fictitious discount factor in\nthe score functions of the policy gradient estimators. Non-asymptotic\nconvergence guarantees are established for both algorithms, and the additional\ndiscount factor is shown to reduce the bias introduced in DAE and thus improve\nthe algorithm convergence asymptotically. A key ingredient of our analysis is\nto connect three settings of Markov decision processes (MDPs): the\nfinite-time-horizon, the average reward and the discounted settings.

This helps users understand network classifications that\nare less intuitive and substantially improves user performance on a difficult\nfine-grained classification task of discriminating among different species of\nseagulls.\n  Realizing that an important missing piece is a reliable heatmap visualization\ntool, we have developed I-GOS and iGOS++ utilizing integrated gradients to\navoid local optima in heatmap generation, which improved the performance across\nall resolutions. During the development of those visualizations, we realized\nthat for a significant number of images, the classifier has multiple different\npaths to reach a confident prediction. This has lead to our recent development\nof structured attention graphs (SAGs), an approach that utilizes beam search to\nlocate multiple coarse heatmaps for a single image, and compactly visualizes a\nset of heatmaps by capturing how different combinations of image regions impact\nthe confidence of a classifier.\n  Through the research process, we have learned much about insights in building\ndeep network explanations, the existence and frequency of multiple\nexplanations, and various tricks of the trade that make explanations work. In\nthis paper, we attempt to share those insights and opinions with the readers\nwith the hope that some of them will be informative for future researchers on\nexplainable deep learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 23:39:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

The asymptotic\nstability to the target is proved. Secondly, the controller can adjust the\ntendency of actions in order to make it easier to manage the actions.

One option under consideration for a GSMT-ExAO\nwavefront sensor is a three-sided PWFS (3PWFS). The 3PWFS creates three copies\nof the telescope pupil for wavefront sensing, compared to the conventional\nfour-sided PWFS (4PWFS) which uses four pupils. The 3PWFS uses fewer detector\npixels than the 4PWFS and should therefore be less sensitive to read noise.\nHere we develop a mathematical formalism based on the diffraction theory\ndescription of the Foucault knife edge test that predicts the intensity pattern\nafter the PWFS. Our formalism allows us to calculate the intensity in the pupil\nimages formed by the PWFS in the presence of phase errors corresponding to\narbitrary Fourier modes. We then use the Object Oriented MATLAB Adaptive Optics\ntoolbox (OOMAO) to simulate an end-to-end model of an adaptive optics system\nusing a PWFS with modulation and compare the performance of the 3PWFS to the\n4PWFS. In the case of a low read noise detector, the Strehl ratios of the 3PWFS\nand 4PWFS are within 0.01. When we included higher read noise in the\nsimulation, we found a Strehl ratio gain of 0.036 for the 3PWFS using Raw\nIntensity over the 4PWFS using Slopes Maps at a stellar magnitude of 10. At the\nsame magnitude, the 4PWFS RI also outperformed the 4PWFS SM, but the gain was\nonly 0.012 Strehl. This is significant because 4PWFS using Slopes Maps is how\nthe PWFS is conventionally used for AO wavefront sensing. We have found that\nthe 3PWFS is a viable wavefront sensor that can fully reconstruct a wavefront\nand produce a stable closed-loop with correction comparable to that of a 4PWFS,\nwith modestly better performance for high read-noise detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 01:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

In this paper, we propose an Iterative Alignment\nNetwork (IA-Net) for TSG task, which iteratively interacts inter- and\nintra-modal features within multiple steps for more accurate grounding.\nSpecifically, during the iterative reasoning process, we pad multi-modal\nfeatures with learnable parameters to alleviate the nowhere-to-attend problem\nof non-matched frame-word pairs, and enhance the basic co-attention mechanism\nin a parallel manner. To further calibrate the misaligned attention caused by\neach reasoning step, we also devise a calibration module following each\nattention module to refine the alignment knowledge. With such iterative\nalignment scheme, our IA-Net can robustly capture the fine-grained relations\nbetween vision and language domains step-by-step for progressively reasoning\nthe temporal boundaries.

However, due to the\ncomplex nonlinear dynamics in quadrupedal robots and reward sparsity, it is\nstill difficult for RL to learn effective gaits from scratch, especially in\nchallenging tasks such as walking over the balance beam. To alleviate such\ndifficulty, we propose a novel RL-based approach that contains an evolutionary\nfoot trajectory generator. Unlike prior methods that use a fixed trajectory\ngenerator, the generator continually optimizes the shape of the output\ntrajectory for the given task, providing diversified motion priors to guide the\npolicy learning. The policy is trained with reinforcement learning to output\nresidual control signals that fit different gaits. We then optimize the\ntrajectory generator and policy network alternatively to stabilize the training\nand share the exploratory data to improve sample efficiency. As a result, our\napproach can solve a range of challenging tasks in simulation by learning from\nscratch, including walking on a balance beam and crawling through the cave. To\nfurther verify the effectiveness of our approach, we deploy the controller\nlearned in the simulation on a 12-DoF quadrupedal robot, and it can\nsuccessfully traverse challenging scenarios with efficient gaits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 02:51:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 12:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

We\nuse ALMA dust continuum observations of the Molecules with ALMA at\nPlanet-forming Scales (MAPS) disks and explore a large parameter space to\nconstrain the radial distribution of solid mass and maximum grain size in each\ndisk, including or excluding dust scattering. In the nonscattering model, the\ndust surface density and maximum grain size profiles decrease from the inner\ndisks to the outer disks, with local maxima at the bright ring locations, as\nexpected from dust trapping models. The inferred maximum grain sizes from the\ninner to outer disks decrease from ~1 cm to 1 mm. For IM Lup, HD 163296, and\nMWC 480 in the scattering model, two solutions are compatible with their\nobserved inner disk emission: one solution corresponding to a maximum grain\nsize of a few millimeters (similar to the nonscattering model), and the other\ncorresponding to a few hundred micrometer sizes. Based on the estimated Toomre\nparameter, only IM Lup -- which shows a prominent spiral morphology in\nmillimeter dust -- is found to be gravitationally unstable. The estimated\nmaximum Stokes number in all the disks lies between 0.01 and 0.3, and the\nestimated turbulence parameters in the rings of AS 209 and HD 163296 are close\nto the threshold where dust growth is limited by turbulent fragmentation.

This is particularly salient when there is limited\nsampling of key spectral features of a galaxy's spectral energy distribution\n(SED), such as for quiescent galaxies where the expected age-sensitive\nBalmer/4000 A break enter the $K$-band at $z>4$. With single filter sampling of\nthis spectral feature, degeneracies between SED models and redshift emerge. A\npotential solution to this comes from splitting the $K$-band into multiple\nfilters. We use simulations to show an optimal solution is to add two\nmedium-band filters, $K_\\mathrm{blue}$ ($\\lambda_\\mathrm{cen}$=2.06 $\\mu$m,\n$\\Delta\\lambda$=0.25 $\\mu$m) and $K_\\mathrm{red}$ ($\\lambda_\\mathrm{cen}$=2.31\n$\\mu$m, $\\Delta\\lambda$=0.27 $\\mu$m), that are complementary to the existing\n$K_\\mathrm{s}$ filter. We test the impact of the $K$-band filters with\nsimulated catalogues comprised of galaxies with varying ages and\nsignal-to-noise. The results suggest that the $K$-band filters do improve\nphotometric redshift constraints on $z>4$ quiescent galaxies, increasing\nprecision and reducing outliers by up to 90$\\%$. We find that the impact from\nthe $K$-band filters depends on the signal-to-noise, the redshift and the SED\nof the galaxy. The filters we designed were built and used to conduct a pilot\nof the FLAMINGOS-2 Extra-galactic Near-Infrared $K$-band Split (FENIKS) survey.\nWhile no new $z>4$ quiescent galaxies are identified in the limited area pilot,\nthe $K_\\mathrm{blue}$ and $K_\\mathrm{red}$ filters indicate strong Balmer/4000\nA breaks in existing candidates. Additionally we identify galaxies with strong\nnebular emission lines, for which the $K$-band filters increase photometric\nredshift precision and in some cases indicate extreme star-formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 04:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}

Recently, researchers have found that selecting \"hard\"\nrather than \"random\" negative samples would be beneficial for fine-tuning\npre-trained models on ranking tasks. However, it remains elusive how to\nleverage hard negative samples in a principled way. To address the\naforementioned issues, we propose a fine-tuning strategy for document ranking,\nnamely Self-Involvement Ranker (SIR), to dynamically select hard negative\nsamples to construct high-quality semantic space for training a high-quality\nranking model. Specifically, SIR consists of sequential compressors implemented\nwith pre-trained models. Front compressor selects hard negative samples for\nrear compressor. Moreover, SIR leverages supervisory signal to adaptively\nadjust semantic space of negative samples. Finally, supervisory signal in rear\ncompressor is computed based on condition probability and thus can control\nsample dynamic and further enhance the model performance. SIR is a lightweight\nand general framework for pre-trained models, which simplifies the ranking\nprocess in industry practice. We test our proposed solution on MS MARCO with\ndocument ranking setting, and the results show that SIR can significantly\nimprove the ranking performance of various pre-trained models.

The model outperforms the\nstate of the art on two datasets in terms of accuracy while reducing the\ncomputational complexity and, hence, the execution time. In particular, the\napproach, is able to predict a gesture almost 8 times faster than the most\naccurate competitor. Our performance evaluation in different scenarios\n(environments, angles, distances) shows that Tesla generalizes well and\nimproves the accuracy up to 20% in challenging scenarios like a through-wall\nsetting and sensing at extreme angles. Utilizing Tesla, we develop\nTesla-Rapture, a real-time implementation using a mmWave Radar on a Raspberry\nPI 4 and evaluate its accuracy and time-complexity. We also publish the source\ncode, the trained models, and the implementation of the model for embedded\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 05:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Thus, the formation location and thermal history of material in the\nsolar system is often studied by measuring its D/H ratio. This requires\nknowledge about the deuteration processes operating during the planet formation\nera. We aim to study these processes by radially resolving the DCN/HCN (at 0.3\"\nresolution) and N$_2$D$^+$/N$_2$H$^+$ (0.3 to 0.9\") column density ratios\ntoward the five protoplanetary disks observed by the Molecules with ALMA at\nPlanet-forming scales (MAPS) Large Program. DCN is detected in all five\nsources, with one newly reported detection. N$_2$D$^+$ is detected in four\nsources, two of which are newly reported detections. We derive column density\nprofiles that allow us to study the spatial variation of the DCN/HCN and\nN$_2$D$^+$/N$_2$H$^+$ ratios at high resolution. DCN/HCN varies considerably\nfor different parts of the disks, ranging from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-1}$. In\nparticular, the inner disk regions generally show significantly lower HCN\ndeuteration compared with the outer disk. In addition, our analysis confirms\nthat two deuterium fractionation channels are active, which can alter the D/H\nratio within the pool of organic molecules. N$_2$D$^+$ is found in the cold\nouter regions beyond $\\sim$50 au, with N$_2$D$^+$/N$_2$H$^+$ ranging between\n$10^{-2}$ and 1 across the disk sample. This is consistent with the theoretical\nexpectation that N$_2$H$^+$ deuteration proceeds via the low-temperature\nchannel only.

In this paper, we\nfollow the third research branch and present a data filtering method for\nopen-domain dialogues, which identifies untrustworthy samples from training\ndata with a quality measure that linearly combines seven dialogue attributes.\nThe attribute weights are obtained via Bayesian Optimization (BayesOpt) that\naims to optimize an objective function for dialogue generation iteratively on\nthe validation set.

We study this issue at hand from two perspectives:\nFirstly, we present a conceptual approach to integrate privacy into recommender\nsystem simulations, whose key elements are privacy agents. These agents can\nenhance users' profiles with different privacy preferences, e.g., their\ninclination to disclose data to the recommender system. Plus, they can protect\nusers' privacy by guarding all actions that could be a threat to privacy. For\nexample, agents can prohibit a user's privacy-threatening actions or apply\nprivacy-enhancing techniques, e.g., Differential Privacy, to make actions less\nthreatening. Secondly, we identify three critical topics for future research in\nprivacy-aware recommender system simulations: (i) How could we model users'\nprivacy preferences and protect users from performing any privacy-threatening\nactions? (ii) To what extent do privacy agents modify the users' document\npreferences? (iii) How do privacy preferences and privacy protections impact\nrecommendations and privacy of others? Our conceptual privacy-aware simulation\napproach makes it possible to investigate the impact of privacy preferences and\nprivacy protection on the micro-level, i.e., a single user, but also on the\nmacro-level, i.e., all recommender system users. With this work, we hope to\npresent perspectives on how privacy-aware simulations could be realized, such\nthat they enable researchers to study the dynamics of privacy within a\nrecommender system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 06:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

In\nparticular, we propose a modified version of the statistics pooling layer\n(initially introduced in the x-vector architecture) to give less weight to\nframes where the segmentation model predicts simultaneous speakers.\nFurthermore, we derive cannot-link constraints from the initial segmentation\nstep to prevent two local speakers from being wrongfully merged during the\nincremental clustering step. Finally, we show how the latency of the proposed\napproach can be adjusted between 500ms and 5s to match the requirements of a\nparticular use case, and we provide a systematic analysis of the influence of\nlatency on the overall performance (on AMI, DIHARD and VoxConverse).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 07:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Concurrent\ncontrol algorithms are used to eliminate some or all data anomalies at\ndifferent isolation levels to ensure data consistency. Isolation levels in the\ncurrent ANSI standard are defined by disallowing certain kinds of data\nanomalies. Yet, the definitions of data anomalies in the ANSI standard are\ncontroversial. On one hand, the definitions lack a mathematical formalization\nand cause ambiguous interpretations. On the other hand, the definitions are\nmade in a case-by-case manner and lead to a situation that even a senior DBA\ncould not have infallible knowledge of data anomalies, due to a lack of a full\nunderstanding of its nature. While revised definitions in existing literature\npropose various mathematical formalizations to correct the former argument, how\nto address the latter argument still remains an open problem. In this paper, we\npresent a general framework called Coo with the capability to systematically\ndefine data anomalies. Under this framework, we show that existing reported\ndata anomalies are only a small portion. While we theoretically prove that Coo\nis complete to mathematically formalize data anomalies, we employ a novel\nmethod to classify infinite data anomalies.

In this work, we\nfocus on enhancing the model's ability to defend gradient-based adversarial\nattack during the model's training process and propose two novel adversarial\ntraining approaches: (1) CARL narrows the original sample and its adversarial\nsample in the representation space while enlarging their distance from\ndifferent labeled samples.

Brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) are essential for the\ndiagnosis of neurological diseases. Recently, deep learning methods for\nunsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) have been proposed for the analysis of\nbrain MRI. These methods rely on healthy brain MRIs and eliminate the\nrequirement of pixel-wise annotated data compared to supervised deep learning.\nWhile a wide range of methods for UAD have been proposed, these methods are\nmostly 2D and only learn from MRI slices, disregarding that brain lesions are\ninherently 3D and the spatial context of MRI volumes remains unexploited.\n  Methods. We investigate whether using increased spatial context by using MRI\nvolumes combined with spatial erasing leads to improved unsupervised anomaly\nsegmentation performance compared to learning from slices. We evaluate and\ncompare 2D variational autoencoder (VAE) to their 3D counterpart, propose 3D\ninput erasing, and systemically study the impact of the data set size on the\nperformance.\n  Results. Using two publicly available segmentation data sets for evaluation,\n3D VAE outperform their 2D counterpart, highlighting the advantage of\nvolumetric context. Also, our 3D erasing methods allow for further performance\nimprovements. Our best performing 3D VAE with input erasing leads to an average\nDICE score of 31.40% compared to 25.76% for the 2D VAE.\n  Conclusions.

Since the data\ndistributions of the two domains are different, the model often performs poorly\non the target domain. Existing methods align the feature distributions of the\nsource and target domains and learn domain-invariant features to improve the\nperformance of the model. However, the features are usually aligned as a whole,\nand the domain adaptation task fails to serve the classification, which will\nignore the class information and lead to misalignment.In this paper, we\ninvestigate those features that should be used for domain alignment, introduce\nprior knowledge to extract foreground features to guide the domain adaptation\ntask for classification tasks, and perform alignment in the local structure of\nobjects. We propose a method called Foreground Object Structure Transfer(FOST).\nThe key to FOST is the new clustering based condition, which combines the\nrelative position relationship of foreground objects. Based on this conditions,\nFOST makes the data distribution of the same class more compact in geometry. In\npractice, since the label of the target domain is not available, we use the\nclustering information of the source domain to assign pseudo labels to the\ntarget domain samples, and then according to the source domain data prior\nknowledge guides those positive features to maximum the inter-class distance\nbetween different classes and mimimum the intra-class distance. Extensive\nexperimental results on various benchmarks ($i.e.$ ImageCLEF-DA, Office-31,\nOffice-Home, Visda-2017) under different domain adaptation settings prove that\nour FOST compares favorably against the existing state-of-the-art domain\nadaptation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 09:23:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 16:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

Measurements of very low frequency (VLF: 3-30kHz) radio waves that\nreflect at D-region altitudes provide a unique remote-sensing probe to\ninvestigate the D-region response to solar flare emissions. Here, using a\ncombination of VLF amplitude measurements at 24kHz together with X-ray\nobservations from the Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite (GOES)\nX-ray sensor, we present a large-scale statistical study of 334 solar flare\nevents and their impacts on the D-region over the past solar cycle.

While massive MIMO transceiver design typically relies on the\nconventional mean-square error (MSE) criterion, directly minimizing the symbol\nerror rate (SER) can lead to a superior performance. In this paper, we first\nmathematically formulate the problem of hybrid transceiver design under the\nminimum SER (MSER) optimization criterion and then develop a MSER-based\ngradient descent (GD) iterative algorithm to find the related stationary\npoints.

These regular events are essential to the empirical\ninspect-and-adapt cycle proposed by Agile methods. Scrum meetings face several\nchallenges, such as being perceived as boring, repetitive, or irrelevant,\nleading to decreased cooperation in teams and less successful projects. In an\nattempt to address these challenges, Agile practitioners have adopted teamwork,\ninnovation, and design techniques geared towards improving collaboration.\nAdditionally, they have developed their own activities to be used in Scrum\nmeetings, most notably for conducting retrospective and planning events. Design\nthinking incorporates non-designers and designers in design and\nconceptualization activities, including user research, ideation, or testing.\nAccordingly, the design thinking approach provides a process with different\nphases and accompanying techniques for each step. These design thinking\ntechniques can support shared understanding in teams and can improve\ncollaboration, creativity, and product understanding. For these reasons, design\nthinking techniques represent a worthwhile addition to the Scrum meeting\ntoolkit and can support Agile meetings in preventing or countering common\nmeeting challenges and achieving meeting goals. This chapter explores how\ntechniques from the design thinking toolkit can support Scrum meetings from a\ntheoretical and practical viewpoint. We analyze Scrum meetings' requirements,\ngoals, and challenges and link them to groups of techniques from the design\nthinking toolkit. In addition, we review interview and observational data from\ntwo previous studies with software development practitioners and derive\nconcrete examples. As a result, we present initial guidelines on integrating\ndesign thinking techniques into Scrum meetings to make them more engaging,\ncollaborative, and interactive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 10:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that\nliving beings learn to act to predicatively ensure homeostasis (allostasis). A\nclassical theory for such regulation is drive reduction, where a function of\nthe difference between the current and the optimal internal state. The recently\nintroduced homeostatic regulated reinforcement learning theory (HRRL), by\ndefining within the framework of reinforcement learning a reward function based\non the internal state of the agent, makes the link between the theories of\ndrive reduction and reinforcement learning. The HRRL makes it possible to\nexplain multiple eating disorders. However, the lack of continuous change in\nthe internal state of the agent with the discrete-time modeling has been so far\na key shortcoming of the HRRL theory. Here, we propose an extension of the\nhomeostatic reinforcement learning theory to a continuous environment in space\nand time, while maintaining the validity of the theoretical results and the\nbehaviors explained by the model in discrete time. Inspired by the\nself-regulating mechanisms abundantly present in biology, we also introduce a\nmodel for the dynamics of the agent internal state, requiring the agent to\ncontinuously take actions to maintain homeostasis. Based on the\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and function approximation with neural\nnetworks, we derive a numerical scheme allowing the agent to learn directly how\nits internal mechanism works, and to choose appropriate action policies via\nreinforcement learning and an appropriate exploration of the environment. Our\nnumerical experiments show that the agent does indeed learn to behave in a way\nthat is beneficial to its survival in the environment, making our framework\npromising for modeling animal dynamics and decision-making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 11:03:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

The latter provides robustness,\ne.g., if the simultaneous reconfiguration of a batch cannot be guaranteed.

While the data sources become valuable assets for enabling\nthe success of autonomous decision-making, they also lead to critical\nvulnerabilities in privacy and security. For example, data leakage can be\nexploited via querying and eavesdropping in the exploratory phase for black-box\nattacks against DL-based autonomous decision-making systems. To address this\nissue, in this work, we propose a novel data encryption method, called\nAdvEncryption, by exploiting the principle of adversarial attacks. Different\nfrom existing encryption technologies, the AdvEncryption method is not\ndeveloped to prevent attackers from exploiting the dataset. Instead, our\nproposed method aims to trap the attackers in a misleading feature distillation\nof the data. To achieve this goal, our AdvEncryption method consists of two\nessential components: 1) an adversarial attack-inspired encryption mechanism to\nencrypt the data with stealthy adversarial perturbation, and 2) a decryption\nmechanism that minimizes the impact of the perturbations on the effectiveness\nof autonomous decision making. In the performance evaluation section, we\nevaluate the performance of our proposed AdvEncryption method through case\nstudies considering different scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 12:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

This problem considers a metric space with $n$ nodes.\nRequests arrive at these nodes in an online fashion. The task is to match these\nrequests into sets of exactly $k$, such that the space and time cost of all\nmatched requests are minimized. The notion of the space cost requires a\ndefinition of an underlying metric space that gives distances of subsets of $k$\nelements. For $k>2$, the task of finding a suitable metric space is at the core\nof our problem: We show that for some known generalizations to $k=3$ points,\nsuch as the $2$-metric and the $D$-metric, there exists no competitive\nrandomized algorithm for the $3$-MPMD problem. The $G$-metrics are defined for\n3 points and allows for a competitive algorithm for the $3$-MPMD problem. For\n$k>3$ points, there exist two generalizations of the $G$-metrics known as $n$-\nand $K$-metrics. We show that neither the $n$-metrics nor the $K$-metrics can\nbe used for the $k$-MPMD problem.

Here we show how to bridge these\ndifferent formulations and propose a novel, direct, and regularized\nformulation.

We show how to transform\nthis problem into a single-level, regularized, and direct data-driven control\nformulation, where the regularizer accounts for the least-square data fitting\ncriterion. For this novel formulation we carry out a robustness and performance\nanalysis in presence of noisy data. Our proposed direct and regularized\nformulation is also amenable to be further blended with a\nrobust-stability-promoting regularizer.

(2) The main\ndifference between HDR images and LDR images is in under-/over-exposed areas,\nespecially those highlighted. Following this observation, we propose a\nluminance attention module with a two-stream structure for LANet to pay more\nattention to the under-/over-exposed areas.

To overcome this deficiency, we propose a\nglobal feature-oriented triple extraction model that makes full use of the\nmentioned two kinds of global associations.

In order to achieve the above tasks, we\npropose a novel hierarchical control architecture which decouples the curvature\nand center control of the trajectory. In particular, an outer loop stabilizes\nthe center by tuning the target curvature, and an inner loop tracks the\ncurvature using a feedforward/feedback controller enhanced by an\n$\\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive component. The hierarchical architecture is flexible\nbecause the inner loop is task-agnostic and adaptive to changes in tire-road\ninteraction, which allows the outer loop to be designed independent of\nlow-level dynamics, opening up the possibility of incorporating sophisticated\nplanning algorithms.

This paper proposes a new method with the aim to synthesize\ncontrollable emotional expressive speech and meanwhile maintain the target\nspeaker's identity in the cross-speaker emotion TTS task. The proposed method\nis a Tacotron2-based framework with emotion embedding as the conditioning\nvariable to provide emotion information. Two emotion disentangling modules are\ncontained in our method to 1) get speaker-irrelevant and emotion-discriminative\nembedding, and 2) explicitly constrain the emotion and speaker identity of\nsynthetic speech to be that as expected.

Our results\nallow us to uncover the presence of a singlet to triplet transition in one of\nthe redox states of the molecule, not detected by conventional charge transport\nmeasurements. This highlights the power of thermoelectric measurements which\ncan be used to determine the difference in configurational entropy between the\nredox states of a nanoscale system involved in conductance without any prior\nassumptions about its structure or microscopic dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 14:57:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

Among many goals of the financial time series\nanalysis, one is to construct a model that can extract the information of the\nfuture return out of the known historical stock data, such as stock price,\nfinancial news, and e.t.c. To design such a model, prior knowledge on how the\nfuture return is correlated with the historical stock prices is needed. In this\nwork, we focus on the issue: in what mode the future return is correlated with\nthe historical stock prices. We manually design several financial time series\nwhere the future return is correlated with the historical stock prices in\npre-designed modes, namely the curve-shape-feature (CSF) and the\nnon-curve-shape-feature (NCSF) modes. In the CSF mode, the future return can be\nextracted from the curve shapes of the historical stock prices. By applying\nvarious kinds of existing algorithms on those pre-designed time series and real\nfinancial time series, we show that: (1) the major information of the future\nreturn is not contained in the curve-shape features of historical stock prices.\nThat is, the future return is not mainly correlated with the historical stock\nprices in the CSF mode. (2) Various kinds of existing machine learning\nalgorithms are good at extracting the curveshape features in the historical\nstock prices and thus are inappropriate for financial time series analysis\nalthough they are successful in the image recognition and natural language\nprocessing.

Recently, iterative\napproaches have been proven to be effective for complex questions, by\nrecursively retrieving new evidence at each step. However, almost all existing\niterative approaches use predefined strategies, either applying the same\nretrieval function multiple times or fixing the order of different retrieval\nfunctions, which cannot fulfill the diverse requirements of various questions.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel adaptive information-seeking strategy for\nopen-domain question answering, namely AISO. Specifically, the whole retrieval\nand answer process is modeled as a partially observed Markov decision process,\nwhere three types of retrieval operations (e.g., BM25, DPR, and hyperlink) and\none answer operation are defined as actions. According to the learned policy,\nAISO could adaptively select a proper retrieval action to seek the missing\nevidence at each step, based on the collected evidence and the reformulated\nquery, or directly output the answer when the evidence set is sufficient for\nthe question. Experiments on SQuAD Open and HotpotQA fullwiki, which serve as\nsingle-hop and multi-hop open-domain QA benchmarks, show that AISO outperforms\nall baseline methods with predefined strategies in terms of both retrieval and\nanswer evaluations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 15:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

The novelty of the proposed approach is based on the Multivariate\nAsymmetric Laplace distribution which allows to jointly estimate the quantiles\nof the univariate conditional distributions of a multivariate response,\naccounting for possible correlation between the outcomes. Sources of unobserved\nheterogeneity and serial dependency due to repeated measures are modeled\nthrough the introduction of individual-specific, time-constant random\ncoefficients and time-varying parameters evolving over time with a Markovian\nstructure, respectively. The inferential approach is carried out through the\nconstruction of a suitable Expectation-Maximization algorithm without\nparametric assumptions on the random effects distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 15:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

The one being used here is particularly important, as it represents an\nexact meanfield limit of synaptically coupled quadratic integrate & fire\nneurons, a canonical model for type I excitability. In absence of synaptic\ndynamics, a periodic external current with a slow frequency {\\epsilon} can lead\nto burst-like dynamics. The firing patterns can be understood using techniques\nof singular perturbation theory, specifically slow-fast dissection. In the\nmodel with synaptic dynamics the separation of timescales leads to a variety of\nslow-fast phenomena and their role for bursting is rendered inordinately more\nintricate. Canards are one of the main slow-fast elements on the route to\nbursting. They describe trajectories evolving nearby otherwise repelling\nlocally invariant sets of the system and are found in the transition region\nfrom subthreshold dynamics to bursting. For values of the timescale separation\nnearby the singular limit {\\epsilon} = 0, we report peculiar jump-on canards,\nwhich block a continuous transition to bursting. In the biologically more\nplausible regime of {\\epsilon} this transition becomes continuous and bursts\nemerge via consecutive spike-adding transitions. The onset of bursting is of\ncomplex nature and involves mixed-type like torus canards, which form the very\nfirst spikes of the burst and revolve nearby fast-subsystem repelling limit\ncycles. We provide numerical evidence for the same mechanisms to be responsible\nfor the emergence of bursting in the quadratic integrate & fire network with\nplastic synapses. The main conclusions apply for the network, owing to the\nexactness of the meanfield limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 15:22:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Ultralow optical loss and the capability for dispersion\nengineering are essential, which necessitate the use of multi-mode waveguides.\nDespite that rich interaction among different spatial waveguide eigenmodes can\ngive rise to novel nonlinear phenomena, spatial mode interaction is typically\nundesired as it increases optical loss, perturbs local dispersion profile, and\nimpedes soliton formation. Adiabatic bends, such as Euler bends whose curvature\nvaries linearly with their path length, have been favoured to suppress spatial\nmode interaction. Adiabatic bends can essentially connect any two waveguide\nsegments with adiabatic mode conversion, thus efficiently avoid mode mixing due\nto mode mismatch. However, previous works lack quantitative measurement data\nand analysis to fairly evaluate the adiabaticity, and are not based on photonic\nintegrated circuits with tight optical confinement and optical losses of few\ndB/m.

Creep tests were performed at 900 {\\deg}C and 250 MPa and the\nresulting microstructures and defect configurations were characterized via\nelectron microscopy. The minimum creep rates differ by more than one order of\nmagnitude with changing Co/Ni ratio. An intermediate CoNi-base alloy exhibits\nthe overall highest creep strength. Several strengthening contributions like\nsolid solution strengthening of the $\\gamma$ phase, effective diffusion\ncoefficients or stacking fault energies were quantified. Precipitate shearing\nmechanisms differ significantly when the base element content is varied. While\nthe Ni-rich superalloys exhibit SISF and SESF shearing, the Co-rich alloys\ndevelop extended APBs when the $\\gamma^\\prime$ phase is cut. This is mainly\nattributed to a difference in planar fault energies, caused by a changing\nsegregation behavior. As result, it is assumed that the shearing resistivity\nand the occurring deformation mechanisms in the $\\gamma^\\prime$ phase are\ncrucial for the creep properties of the investigated alloy series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 15:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

Approaches for automatically reusing and\ngenerating simulation experiments can support modelers in conducting simulation\nstudies in a more systematic and effective manner. They rely on explicit\nexperiment specifications and, so far, on user interaction for initiating the\nreuse. Thereby, they are constrained to support the reuse of simulation\nexperiments in a specific setting. Our approach now goes one step further by\nautomatically identifying and adapting the experiments to be reused for a\nvariety of scenarios. To achieve this, we exploit provenance graphs of\nsimulation studies, which provide valuable information about the previous\nmodeling and experimenting activities, and contain meta-information about the\ndifferent entities that were used or produced during the simulation study. We\ndefine provenance patterns and associate them with a semantics, which allows us\nto interpret the different activities, and construct transformation rules for\nprovenance graphs.

Several deep learning-based detection models have been\ncreated. However, malicious users can evade deep detection models by\nmanipulating their behavior, rendering these models of little use. The\nvulnerability of such deep detection models against adversarial attacks is\nunknown. Here we create a novel adversarial attack model against deep user\nsequence embedding based classification models, which use the sequence of user\nposts to generate user embeddings and detect malicious users. In the attack,\nthe adversary generates a new post to fool the classifier. We propose a novel\nend-to-end Personalized Text Generation Attack model, called PETGEN, that\nsimultaneously reduces the efficacy of the detection model and generates posts\nthat have several key desirable properties. Specifically, PETGEN generates\nposts that are personalized to the user's writing style, have knowledge about a\ngiven target context, are aware of the user's historical posts on the target\ncontext, and encapsulate the user's recent topical interests. We conduct\nextensive experiments on two real-world datasets (Yelp and Wikipedia, both with\nground-truth of malicious users) to show that PETGEN significantly reduces the\nperformance of popular deep user sequence embedding-based classification\nmodels.

After a passenger is matched up with a driver by\nthe platform, both the passenger and the driver have the freedom to simply\naccept or cancel a ride with one click. Hence, accurately predicting whether a\npassenger-driver pair is a good match turns out to be crucial for ride-hailing\nplatforms to devise instant order assignments. However, since the users of\nride-hailing platforms consist of two parties, decision-making needs to\nsimultaneously account for the dynamics from both the driver and the passenger\nsides. This makes it more challenging than traditional online advertising\ntasks. Moreover, the amount of available data is severely imbalanced across\ndifferent cities, creating difficulties for training an accurate model for\nsmaller cities with scarce data. Though a sophisticated neural network\narchitecture can help improve the prediction accuracy under data scarcity, the\noverly complex design will impede the model's capacity of delivering timely\npredictions in a production environment. In the paper, to accurately predict\nthe MSR of passenger-driver, we propose the Multi-View model (MV) which\ncomprehensively learns the interactions among the dynamic features of the\npassenger, driver, trip order, as well as context. Regarding the data imbalance\nproblem, we further design the Knowledge Distillation framework (KD) to\nsupplement the model's predictive power for smaller cities using the knowledge\nfrom cities with denser data and also generate a simple model to support\nefficient deployment.

To this end, we propose a\nclassification-wise Pareto evolution approach for one-shot NAS, where an online\nclassifier is trained to predict the dominance relationship between the\ncandidate and constructed reference architectures, instead of using surrogates\nto fit the objective functions. The main contribution of this study is to\nchange supernet adaption into a Pareto classifier.

Our findings emphasise the needs that research attention in the MT\ncommunity should be shifted from short text generic translation to professional\nmachine translation and build large scale bilingual corpus for these specific\ndomains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 23:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

To obtain the p.d.f. and c.d.f. of such a\nfunction, we first derive the moment generating function of this weighted sum\nusing the partial fractions decomposition or the residue method. The results\ncover the sum of two and three weighted chi-squared random variables, which can\neasily be adapted to more general cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 07:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}
