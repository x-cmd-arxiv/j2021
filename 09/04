We provide the theoretical basis for the numerical inconsistency\nin the collocated finite volume equation discretization of the single-field\ntwo-phase momentum convection. The cause of the numerical inconsistency lies in\nthe way the cell-centered density is computed in the new time step\n($\\rho_c^{n+1}$). Specifically, if $\\rho_c^{n+1}$ is computed from the\napproximation of the fluid interface at $t^{n+1}$, and it is not computed by\nsolving a mass conservation equation (or its equivalent), the two-phase\nmomentum convection term will automatically be inconsistently discretized. We\nprovide the theoretical justification behind using the auxiliary mass\nconservation equation to stabilize flows with strong density ratios. The\nevaluation of the face-centered (mass flux) density we base on the fundamental\nprinciple of mass conservation, used to model the single-field density,\ncontrary to the use of different weighted averages of cell-centered\nsingle-field densities and alternative reconstructions of the mass flux density\nby other contemporary methods. Implicit discretization of the two-phase\nmomentum convection term is achieved, removing the CFL stability criterion.\nNumerical stability is demonstrated in terms of the relative $L_\\infty$\nvelocity error norm with realistic viscosity and strong surface tension forces.\nThe stabilization technique in the rhoLENT method is also applicable to other\ntwo-phase flow simulation methods that utilize the collocated unstructured\nFinite Volume Method to discretize single-field two-phase Navier-Stokes\nEquations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 16:08:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 15:32:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 15:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

To fix ideas we study the\ndynamics of two cellular automaton models, commonly used, rather\nin-distinctively, as the building blocks of large scale neuronal networks. One\nmodel, due to Greenberg \\& Hastings, (GH) can be described by evolution\nequations mimicking an integrate-and-fire process, while the other model, due\nto Kinouchi \\& Copelli, (KC) represents an abstract branching process, where a\nsingle active neuron activates a given number of postsynaptic neurons according\nto a prescribed \"activity\" branching ratio. Despite the apparent similarity\nbetween the local neuronal dynamics of the two models, it is shown that they\nexhibit very different collective dynamics as a function of the network\ntopology. The GH model shows qualitatively different dynamical regimes as the\nnetwork topology is varied, including transients to a ground (inactive) state,\ncontinuous and discontinuous dynamical phase transitions. In contrast, the KC\nmodel only exhibits a continuous phase transition, independently of the network\ntopology. These results highlight the importance of paying attention to the\nmicroscopic rules chosen to model the inter-neuronal interactions in large\nscale numerical simulations, in particular when the network topology is far\nfrom a mean field description. One such case is the extensive work being done\nin the context of the Human Connectome, where a wide variety of types of models\nare being used to understand the brain collective dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 16:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

Here, we study the crystalline and electronic\nstructure of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$(0001) using scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S), micro($\\mu$)-laser angle resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments further evidence the presence\nof cation (Mn-Bi) intermixing. Altogether, this affects the distribution of the\nMn atoms, which, inevitably, leads to a deviation of the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$\nmagnetic structure from that predicted for the ideal crystal structure. Our\ntransport measurements suggest that the degree of this deviation varies from\nsample to sample.

Also,\nwe find that weakly-supervised target language transfer yields competitive\nperformances against the generation-based target language transfer that\nrequires external translators and query generators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 17:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

The analysis of the clustered LiDAR data, and the associated\nSCADA and meteorological data, enables the study of the variability of the wake\nvelocity deficit, wake extent, and wake-added turbulence intensity for\ndifferent thrust coefficients of the turbine rotor and regimes of atmospheric\nstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 17:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

For time-independent\nsystems, an (often unique) steady state describes the average physics once all\nthe transient processes have faded out, but interesting quantum properties can\nemerge at intermediate timescales. Given a Lindblad master equation, these\nproperties are encoded in the spectrum of the Liouvillian whose\ndiagonalization, however, is a challenge even for small-size quantum systems.\nHere, we propose a new method to efficiently provide the Liouvillian spectral\ndecomposition. We call this method an Arnoldi-Lindblad time evolution, because\nit exploits the algebraic properties of the Liouvillian superoperator to\nefficiently construct a basis for the Arnoldi iteration problem. The advantage\nof our method is double: (i) It provides a faster-than-the-clock method to\nefficiently obtain the steady state, meaning that it produces the steady state\nthrough time evolution shorter than needed for the system to reach\nstationarity. (ii) It retrieves the low-lying spectral properties of the\nLiouvillian with a minimal overhead, allowing to determine both which quantum\nproperties emerge and for how long they can be observed in a system. This\nmethod is general and model-independent, and lends itself to the study of large\nsystems where the determination of the Liouvillian spectrum can be numerically\ndemanding but the time evolution of the density matrix is still doable. Our\nresults can be extended to time evolution with a time-dependent Liouvillian. In\nparticular, our method works for Floquet (i.e., periodically driven) systems,\nwhere it allows not only to construct the Floquet map for the slow-decaying\nprocesses, but also to retrieve the stroboscopic steady state and the\neigenspectrum of the Floquet map.

Language models have\nemerged as the prevalent choice of several natural language tasks due to the\nperformance boost offered by these models. However, in several domains, such as\nmedicine, the scarcity of labeled training data is a common issue. Also, these\nmodels may not work well in cases where class imbalance is prevalent. Active\nlearning may prove helpful in these cases to boost the performance with a\nlimited label budget. To this end, we propose a novel method using sampling\ntechniques based on submodular optimization and optimal transport for active\nlearning in language models, dubbed ALLWAS. We construct a sampling strategy\nbased on submodular optimization of the designed objective in the gradient\ndomain. Furthermore, to enable learning from few samples, we propose a novel\nstrategy for sampling from the Wasserstein barycenters.

This study is carried out\nby using the Monte Carlo simulations under the Metropolis algorithm. The\nmagnetic behaviors of the three nano-Heusler compounds have been studied and\ndiscussed.

Besides, the effect\nof the crystal field, the exchange coupling interactions and the external\nmagnetic field have been inspected on the magnetization of each nano-Heusler\ncompound Ru$_2$Mn$_X$ ($X$ = Nb, Ta or V).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 18:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

For networks that do not admit a polyhedral Lyapunov\nfunction, we investigate whether it is possible to enforce polyhedral\nstructural stability by applying a strong negative feedback on some pinned\nnodes: in terms of the Petri net, this is equivalent to turning pinned nodes\ninto black holes that clear any positive or negative incoming token. If such\nnodes are chosen so that the transformed Petri net has bounded discrete\ntrajectories, then there exists a stabilising pinning control: the biochemical\nnetwork becomes Lyapunov stable if a sufficiently strong local negative\nfeedback is applied to the pinned nodes. These results allow us to structurally\nidentify the critical nodes to be locally controlled so as to ensure the\nstability of the whole network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

These residual stresses within the\ncomposite material ultimately result in reduced durability and residual\ndeformations of the final product.

We establish that MoB2 is\na phonon-mediated superconductor but has little in common with MgB2 (Tc=40 K at\nzero pressure). MoB2 is a strongly metallic, three dimensional, multi-Fermi\nsurface material, becoming of additional interest because it displays a\nfrequency separation of Mo and B vibrations that mirrors that of metal\nsuperhydrides with Tc approaching room temperature. This separation, which is\nunusual in intermetallic compounds, allows an analysis separately for Mo and B\nproviding, amongst the other parameters essential for understanding phonon\ncoupling, the matrix elements for scattering by the individual atoms. Strong\ncoupling (lambda(Mo)=1.48) is provided by Mo (total lambda=1.67). A factor of\n15 weaker coupling to each B atom is compensated by that coupling being to mean\nhigh frequency modes around 85-90 meV (maximum of 140 meV), versus 18-20 meV\nfor Mo. As a result, B enhances Tc by 43% over the Mo-only value, to 33 K,\ncorresponding to the experimental value.

To contend with this challenge,\nwe propose and formalize the concept of similarity-based bucketization~(SBB).\nWith SBB, a client reveals a small amount of information to a database-holding\nserver so that it can generate a bucket of potentially similar items. The\nbucket is small enough for efficient application of privacy-preserving\nprotocols for similarity. To analyze the privacy risk of the revealed\ninformation, we introduce a framework for measuring an adversary's confidence\nin inferring a predicate about the client input correctly. We develop a\npractical SBB protocol for image content, and evaluate its client privacy\nguarantee with real-world social media data. We then combine SBB with various\nsimilarity protocols, showing that the combination with SBB provides a speedup\nof at least 29x on large-scale databases compared to that without, while\nretaining correctness of over 95%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 20:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 19:54:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 22:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 20:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

Consider a human teleoperating an\nassistive robot arm: as the human guides and corrects the arm's motion, the\nrobot gathers information about the human's desired task. But how does the\nhuman know what their robot has inferred? Today's approaches often focus on\nconveying intent: for instance, upon legible motions or gestures to indicate\nwhat the robot is planning. However, closing the loop on robot inference\nrequires more than just revealing the robot's current policy: the robot should\nalso display the alternatives it thinks are likely, and prompt the human\nteacher when additional guidance is necessary. In this paper we propose a\nmultimodal approach for communicating robot inference that combines both\npassive and active feedback. Specifically, we leverage information-rich\naugmented reality to passively visualize what the robot has inferred, and\nattention-grabbing haptic wristbands to actively prompt and direct the human's\nteaching. We apply our system to shared autonomy tasks where the robot must\ninfer the human's goal in real-time. Within this context, we integrate passive\nand active modalities into a single algorithmic framework that determines when\nand which type of feedback to provide. Combining both passive and active\nfeedback experimentally outperforms single modality baselines; during an\nin-person user study, we demonstrate that our integrated approach increases how\nefficiently humans teach the robot while simultaneously decreasing the amount\nof time humans spend interacting with the robot.

Second, we take advantage of features of the student history\nthat go beyond question-response pairs (e.g., features such as which video\nsegments the student watched, or skipped) as well as information about\nprerequisite structure in the curriculum. Third, we train multiple specialized\nSP models for different aspects of the curriculum (e.g., specializing in early\nversus later segments of the student history), then combine these specialized\nmodels to create a group prediction of the SP. Taken together, these\ninnovations yield an average AUC score across these four datasets of 0.808\ncompared to the previous best logistic regression approach score of 0.767, and\nalso outperforming state-of-the-art deep neural net approaches.

However,\nexisting attacks are often assessed using different SR models, recognition\ntasks and datasets, and only few adversarial defenses borrowed from computer\nvision are considered. Yet,these defenses have not been thoroughly evaluated\nagainst adaptive attacks. Thus, there is still a lack of quantitative\nunderstanding about the strengths and limitations of adversarial attacks and\ndefenses. More effective defenses are also required for securing SR systems. To\nbridge this gap, we present SEC4SR, the first platform enabling researchers to\nsystematically and comprehensively evaluate adversarial attacks and defenses in\nSR. SEC4SR incorporates 4 white-box and 2 black-box attacks, 24 defenses\nincluding our novel feature-level transformations. It also contains techniques\nfor mounting adaptive attacks. Using SEC4SR, we conduct thus far the\nlargest-scale empirical study on adversarial attacks and defenses in SR,\ninvolving 23 defenses, 15 attacks and 4 attack settings. Our study provides\nlots of useful findings that may advance future research: such as (1) all the\ntransformations slightly degrade accuracy on benign examples and their\neffectiveness vary with attacks; (2) most transformations become less effective\nunder adaptive attacks, but some transformations become more effective; (3) few\ntransformations combined with adversarial training yield stronger defenses over\nsome but not all attacks, while our feature-level transformation combined with\nadversarial training yields the strongest defense over all the attacks.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate capabilities and advantages of SEC4SR which\ncan benefit future research in SR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2021 02:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

To alleviate the communication burden,\nsign-based optimization algorithms have gained popularity recently in both\nindustrial and academic communities, which is shown to be closely related to\nadaptive gradient methods, such as Adam. Along this line, this paper\ninvestigates faster convergence for a variant of sign-based gradient descent,\ncalled scaled signGD, in three cases: 1) the objective function is strongly\nconvex; 2) the objective function is nonconvex but satisfies the\nPolyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality; 3) the gradient is stochastic, called\nscaled signGD in this case. For the first two cases, it can be shown that the\nscaled signGD converges at a linear rate. For case 3), the algorithm is shown\nto converge linearly to a neighborhood of the optimal value when a constant\nlearning rate is employed, and the algorithm converges at a rate of $O(1/k)$\nwhen using a diminishing learning rate, where $k$ is the iteration number. The\nresults are also extended to the distributed setting by majority vote in a\nparameter-server framework.

Different from traditional vision tasks, VEA is inherently\nmore challenging since it involves a much higher level of complexity and\nambiguity in human cognitive process. Most of the existing methods adopt deep\nlearning techniques to extract general features from the whole image,\ndisregarding the specific features evoked by various emotional stimuli.\nInspired by the \\textit{Stimuli-Organism-Response (S-O-R)} emotion model in\npsychological theory, we proposed a stimuli-aware VEA method consisting of\nthree stages, namely stimuli selection (S), feature extraction (O) and emotion\nprediction (R).

To the best of\nour knowledge, it is the first time to introduce stimuli selection process into\nVEA in an end-to-end network. Then, we design three specific networks, i.e.,\nGlobal-Net, Semantic-Net and Expression-Net, to extract distinct emotional\nfeatures from different stimuli simultaneously. Finally, benefiting from the\ninherent structure of Mikel's wheel, we design a novel hierarchical\ncross-entropy loss to distinguish hard false examples from easy ones in an\nemotion-specific manner.

The most important measurable\ncharacteristic of the flagellar motor is its torque versus angular speed\nrelationship in CCW or CW modes, which is found to be non-symmetrical with each\nother, and still, such a phenomenon is not clearly understood.Here, we explain\nthis asymmetry through a mechanistic model based on the detailed torque\nanalysis for the rotation of the motor and the revolutionary as well as\nspinning motion of the filament and bead. We find out that the asymmetry\nresults from the conformational changing of the hook due to rotational\nswitching, rather than any non-symmetric changes in the potential of mean force\ngenerated by the stator-rotor interactions. In CCW mode, when the hook remains\nbend and flexible, the revolution motion predominates and the restoring torque\nin this motion, originated due to drag, governs the shape of the torque-speed\ncurve. However, in CW mode, spinning motion dominates as the hook becomes\nstraight and rigid, and the linear torque-speed relation arises due to the\nrestoring torque for the drag corresponding to this motion. Our study indicates\nthe significant role of the hook's conformational change upon the biological\nfunctions of the motor and paves the way for further experimental exploration\non the structural origin of such asymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2021 08:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

To be robust\nin weather conditions, the usual way is to train network in data of given\nweather pattern or to fuse multiple sensors. We focus on a new possibility,\nthat is, to improve its resilience to weather interference through the\nnetwork's structural design. First, we propose a novel FPN structure called\nRiWFPN with a progressive top-down interaction and attention refinement module.\nRiWFPN can directly replace other FPN structures to improve the robustness of\nthe network in non-optimal weather conditions. Then we extend SOLOV2 to capture\ntemporal information in video to learn motion information, and propose a moving\nobject instance segmentation network with RiWFPN called RiWNet. Finally, in\norder to verify the effect of moving instance segmentation in different weather\ndisturbances, we propose a VKTTI-moving dataset which is a moving instance\nsegmentation dataset based on the VKTTI dataset, taking into account different\nweather scenes such as rain, fog, sunset, morning as well as overcast. The\nexperiment proves how RiWFPN improves the network's resilience to adverse\nweather effects compared to other FPN structures. We compare RiWNet to several\nother state-of-the-art methods in some challenging datasets, and RiWNet shows\nbetter performance especially under adverse weather conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2021 08:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

There are generally two difficulties in this\nbias estimation problem: one is the unknown target states which serve as the\nnuisance variables in the estimation problem, and the other is the highly\nnonlinear coordinate transformation between the local and global coordinate\nsystems of the sensors. In this paper, we focus on the 3-dimensional\nasynchronous multi-sensor scenario and propose a weighted nonlinear least\nsquares (NLS) formulation by assuming that there is a target moving with a\nnearly constant velocity. We propose two possible choices of the weighting\nmatrix in the NLS formulation, which correspond to classical NLS estimation and\nmaximum likelihood (ML) estimation, respectively. To address the intrinsic\nnonlinearity, we propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm for solving\nthe formulated problem, which alternately updates different kinds of bias\nestimates.

The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene mutation provides critical\ndiagnostic and prognostic value for glioma. It is of crucial significance to\nnon-invasively predict IDH mutation based on pre-treatment MRI. Machine\nlearning/deep learning models show reasonable performance in predicting IDH\nmutation using MRI. However, most models neglect the systematic brain\nalterations caused by tumor invasion, where widespread infiltration along white\nmatter tracts is a hallmark of glioma. Structural brain network provides an\neffective tool to characterize brain organisation, which could be captured by\nthe graph neural networks (GNN) to more accurately predict IDH mutation.\n  Here we propose a method to predict IDH mutation using GNN, based on the\nstructural brain network of patients.

Next, we employ autoencoders to extract the latent\nmulti-modal MRI features from the ROIs of edges and nodes in patients, to train\na GNN architecture for predicting IDH mutation. The results show that the\nproposed method outperforms the baseline models using the 3D-CNN and\n3D-DenseNet. In addition, model interpretation suggests its ability to identify\nthe tracts infiltrated by tumor, corresponding to clinical prior knowledge.

It is found that the\nentanglement of photon pairs over the Schmidt modes is one of the sources of\ndistinguishability. The distinguishability is quantified by the symmetric part\nof the internal state of $n$ pairs of photons, whose normalization $q_{2n}$ is\nthe probability that $2n$ photons interfere as indistinguishable. For two pairs\nof photons $q_{4}=(1+ 2\\mathbb{P} )/3$, where $\\mathbb{P} $ is the purity of\nthe squeezed states ($K=1/\\mathbb{P} $ is the Schmidt number).

In\nthis paper, we propose a multi-agent method for an arbitrary number of robots\nto follow the target in a socially-aware manner using only 2D laser scans. The\nmulti-agent following problem is tackled by utilizing the complementary\nstrengths of both reinforcement learning and potential field, in which the\nreinforcement learning part handles local interactions while navigating to the\ngoals assigned by the potential field. Specifically, with the help of laser\nscans in obstacle map representation, the learning-based policy can help the\nrobots avoid collisions with both static obstacles and dynamic obstacles like\npedestrians in advance, namely socially aware. While the formation control and\ngoal assignment for each robot is obtained from a target-centered potential\nfield constructed using aggregated state information from all the following\nrobots.

In an extensive experimental evaluation BuRR achieves\nspace overheads well below 1\\,\\% while being faster than most previously used\nretrieval data structures (typically with space overheads at least an order of\nmagnitude larger) and faster than classical Bloom filters (with space overhead\n$\\geq 44\\,\\%$). This efficiency, including favorable constants, stems from a\ncombination of simplicity, word parallelism, and high locality. We additionally\ndescribe homogeneous ribbon filter AMQs, which are even simpler and faster at\nthe price of slightly larger space overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2021 15:43:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2022 19:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

The reliability of the ensemble\nsystem is not degraded by SRDA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2021 10:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

As piezoresistive strain gauges are\naggressively being scaled down for applications in nanotechnology, it has\nbecome critical to investigate their physical attributes at different limits.\nHere, we describe an experimental approach for studying the piezoresistive\ngauge factor of a gold thin-film nanoresistor as a function of frequency. The\nnanoresistor is fabricated lithographically near the anchor of a nanomechanical\ndoubly-clamped beam resonator. As the resonator is driven to resonance in one\nof its normal modes, the nanoresistor is exposed to frequency-dependent strains\nof {$\\varepsilon \\lesssim 10^{-5}$} in the $4-36~\\rm MHz$ range. We calibrate\nthe strain using optical interferometry and measure the resistance changes\nusing a radio-frequency mix-down technique. The piezoresistive gauge factor\n$\\gamma$ of our lithographic gold nanoresistors is $\\gamma \\approx 3.6$ at 4\nMHz, in agreement with comparable macroscopic thin metal film resistors in\nprevious works. However, our $\\gamma$ values increase monotonically with\nfrequency and reach $\\gamma \\approx 15$ at 36 MHz. We discuss possible physics\nthat may give rise to this unexpected frequency dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 16:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

The relatedness between some of\nthese tasks provides useful learning signals to each other via Multi-Task\nLearning (MTL). However, due to the high heterogeneity of these tasks, few\nexisting works manage to jointly solve them in a unified framework. To tackle\nthis challenge, we develop a multi-relational graph based MTL model called\nHeterogeneous Multi-Task Graph Isomorphism Network (HMTGIN) which efficiently\nsolves heterogeneous CQA tasks. In each training forward pass, HMTGIN embeds\nthe input CQA forum graph by an extension of Graph Isomorphism Network and skip\nconnections. The embeddings are then shared across all task-specific output\nlayers to compute respective losses. Moreover, two cross-task constraints based\non the domain knowledge about tasks' relationships are used to regularize the\njoint learning. In the evaluation, the embeddings are shared among different\ntask-specific output layers to make corresponding predictions. To the best of\nour knowledge, HMTGIN is the first MTL model capable of tackling CQA tasks from\nthe aspect of multi-relational graphs. To evaluate HMTGIN's effectiveness, we\nbuild a novel large-scale multi-relational graph CQA dataset with over two\nmillion nodes from Stack Overflow. Extensive experiments show that: $(1)$\nHMTGIN is superior to all baselines on five tasks; $(2)$ The proposed MTL\nstrategy and cross-task constraints have substantial advantages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2021 03:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}
