Here we propose a\nmathematical model of spiking neuron network (SNN) demonstrating how a piece of\ninformation can be maintained as a robust activity pattern for several seconds\nthen completely disappear if no other stimuli come. Such short-term memory\ntraces are preserved due to the activation of astrocytes accompanying the SNN.\nThe astrocytes exhibit calcium transients at a time scale of seconds. These\ntransients further modulate the efficiency of synaptic transmission and, hence,\nthe firing rate of neighboring neurons at diverse timescales through\ngliotransmitter release. We show how such transients continuously encode\nfrequencies of neuronal discharges and provide robust short-term storage of\nanalogous information. This kind of short-term memory can keep operative\ninformation for seconds, then completely forget it to avoid overlapping with\nforthcoming patterns. The SNN is inter-connected with the astrocytic layer by\nlocal inter-cellular diffusive connections. The astrocytes are activated only\nwhen the neighboring neurons fire quite synchronously, e.g. when an information\npattern is loaded. For illustration, we took greyscale photos of people's faces\nwhere the grey level encoded the level of applied current stimulating the\nneurons. The astrocyte feedback modulates (facilitates) synaptic transmission\nby varying the frequency of neuronal firing. We show how arbitrary patterns can\nbe loaded, then stored for a certain interval of time, and retrieved if the\nappropriate clue pattern is applied to the input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 16:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

This has given rise to a wide variety of models for\nanalyzing population activity in relation to experimental variables, but direct\ntesting of many neural population hypotheses requires intervening in the system\nbased on current neural state, necessitating models capable of inferring neural\nstate online. Existing approaches, primarily based on dynamical systems,\nrequire strong parametric assumptions that are easily violated in the\nnoise-dominated regime and do not scale well to the thousands of data channels\nin modern experiments. To address this problem, we propose a method that\ncombines fast, stable dimensionality reduction with a soft tiling of the\nresulting neural manifold, allowing dynamics to be approximated as a\nprobability flow between tiles. This method can be fit efficiently using online\nexpectation maximization, scales to tens of thousands of tiles, and outperforms\nexisting methods when dynamics are noise-dominated or feature multi-modal\ntransition probabilities. The resulting model can be trained at kiloHertz data\nrates, produces accurate approximations of neural dynamics within minutes, and\ngenerates predictions on submillisecond time scales.

However, RL can be slow as it\nrequires repeated interaction with a simulation of the environment. In\nparticular, there are key system engineering bottlenecks when using RL in\ncomplex environments that feature multiple agents with high-dimensional state,\nobservation, or action spaces. We present WarpDrive, a flexible, lightweight,\nand easy-to-use open-source RL framework that implements end-to-end deep\nmulti-agent RL on a single GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), built on PyCUDA and\nPyTorch. Using the extreme parallelization capability of GPUs, WarpDrive\nenables orders-of-magnitude faster RL compared to common implementations that\nblend CPU simulations and GPU models. Our design runs simulations and the\nagents in each simulation in parallel. It eliminates data copying between CPU\nand GPU. It also uses a single simulation data store on the GPU that is safely\nupdated in-place. WarpDrive provides a lightweight Python interface and\nflexible environment wrappers that are easy to use and extend. Together, this\nallows the user to easily run thousands of concurrent multi-agent simulations\nand train on extremely large batches of experience. Through extensive\nexperiments, we verify that WarpDrive provides high-throughput and scales\nalmost linearly to many agents and parallel environments. For example,\nWarpDrive yields 2.9 million environment steps/second with 2000 environments\nand 1000 agents (at least 100x higher throughput compared to a CPU\nimplementation) in a benchmark Tag simulation. As such, WarpDrive is a fast and\nextensible multi-agent RL platform to significantly accelerate research and\ndevelopment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 16:59:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 23:47:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 19:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

In this paper, we propose an\nautomated technique for extracting and characterizing such regions. Starting\nwith a two-dimensional plot -- e.g., the values of the correlation integral,\ncalculated using the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm over a range of scales --\nwe create an ensemble of intervals by considering all possible combinations of\nendpoints, generating a distribution of slopes from least-squares fits weighted\nby the length of the fitting line and the inverse square of the fit error. The\nmode of this distribution gives an estimate of the slope of the scaling region\n(if it exists). The endpoints of the intervals that correspond to the mode\nprovide an estimate for the extent of that region. When there is no scaling\nregion, the distributions will be wide and the resulting error estimates for\nthe slope will be large.

The aim of this\nwork is to develop a standard procedure for OOF holography at the Effelsberg\ntelescope.

Based on the OOF holography method developed by\nNikolic et al.

Time delay lensing is a powerful tool to measure the Hubble constant\n$H_0$. In order to obtain an accurate estimate of $H_0$ from a sample of time\ndelay strong lenses, however, it is necessary to have a very good knowledge of\nthe mass structure of the lens galaxies. Strong lensing data on their own are\nnot sufficient to break the degeneracy between $H_0$ and the lens model\nparameters, on a single object basis.\n  Aims. The goal of this study is to determine whether it is possible to break\nthe $H_0$-lens structure degeneracy with the statistical combination of a large\nsample of time-delay lenses, relying purely on strong lensing data (that is,\nwith no stellar kinematics information).\n  Methods. I simulated a set of 100 lenses with doubly imaged quasars and\nrelated time delay measurements. I fitted these data with a Bayesian\nhierarchical method and a flexible model for the lens population, emulating the\nlens modelling step.\n  Results. The sample of 100 lenses, on its own, provides a measurement of\n$H_0$ with $3\\%$ precision, but with a $-4\\%$ bias. However, the addition of\nprior information on the lens structural parameters from a large sample of\nlenses with no time delays, such as that considered in Paper I, allows for a\n$1\\%$-level inference. Moreover, the 100 lenses allow for a $0.03$~dex\ncalibration of galaxy stellar masses, regardless of the level of prior\nknowledge of the Hubble constant.\n  Conclusions. Breaking the $H_0$-lens model degeneracy with lensing data alone\nis possible, but $1\\%$ measurements of $H_0$ require either a number of time\ndelay lenses much larger than 100, or the knowledge of the structural parameter\ndistribution of the lens population from a separate sample of lenses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 2021 21:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

After\ncarefully and consistently performing a series of data reduction tasks\nincluding host galaxy light subtraction, we present here the first detailed,\nspectroscopic population study of 16 optical/UV TDEs. We report a time lag\nbetween the peaks of the optical light-curves and the peak luminosity of\nH$\\alpha$ spanning between 7 - 45 days. If interpreted as light-echoes, these\nlags correspond to distances of 2 - 12 x 10$^{16}$ cm, one to two orders of\nmagnitudes larger than the estimated blackbody radii (R$_{\\rm BB}$) of the same\nTDEs and we discuss the possible origin of this surprisingly large discrepancy.\nWe also report time lags for the peak luminosity of He I $\\lambda$5876 line;\nsmaller than the ones of H$\\alpha$ for H TDEs and similar or larger for N III\nBowen TDEs. We report that N III Bowen TDEs have lower H$\\alpha$ velocity\nwidths compared to the rest of the TDEs in our sample and we also find that a\nstrong X-ray to optical ratio might imply weakening of the line widths.\nFurthermore, we study the evolution of line luminosities and ratios with\nrespect to their radii (R$_{\\rm BB}$) and temperatures (T$_{\\rm BB}$). We find\na linear relationship between H$\\alpha$ luminosity and the R$_{\\rm BB}$ and\npotentially an inverse power-law relation with T$_{\\rm BB}$ leading to weaker\nH$\\alpha$ emission for T$_{\\rm BB}$ $\\geq$ 25000 K. The He II/He I ratio\nbecomes large at the same temperatures possibly pointing to an ionization\neffect. The He II/H$\\alpha$ ratio becomes larger as the photospheric radius\nrecedes, implying a stratified photosphere where Helium lies deeper than\nHydrogen.

Contrary to previous studies, we find that halos\nare harder to detect when they are either behind or in front of the lens.\nFurthermore, we find that the perturbing effect of haloes increases with their\nconcentration: detectable haloes are systematically high-concentration haloes,\nand accounting for the scatter in the mass-concentration relation boosts the\nexpected number of detections by as much as an order of magnitude. Haloes have\nlower concentration for lower particle masses and this further suppresses the\nnumber of detectable haloes beyond the reduction arising from the lower halo\nabundances alone.

Because it does not require 3D scans, DensePose 3D can be used\nfor learning a wide range of articulated categories such as different animal\nspecies. The method learns, in an end-to-end fashion, a soft partition of a\ngiven category-specific 3D template mesh into rigid parts together with a\nmonocular reconstruction network that predicts the part motions such that they\nreproject correctly onto 2D DensePose-like surface annotations of the object.\nThe decomposition of the object into parts is regularized by expressing part\nassignments as a combination of the smooth eigenfunctions of the\nLaplace-Beltrami operator. We show significant improvements compared to\nstate-of-the-art non-rigid structure-from-motion baselines on both synthetic\nand real data on categories of humans and animals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 18:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

However, the\nfatality counts depend both on disease clinical severity and transmissibility,\nas more infected also lead to more deaths. Moreover, fatality counts (and\nrelated measures such as Case Fatality Rate) are dynamic quantities, as they\nappear with a delay to infections, while different geographic regions generally\nbelong to different points on the epidemics curve. Instead, we use\nepidemiological modeling to propose a disease severity measure, which accounts\nfor the underlying disease dynamics. The measure corresponds to the ratio of\npopulation averaged mortality and recovery rates (m/r). It is independent of\nthe disease transmission dynamics (i.e., the basic reproduction number) and has\na direct mechanistic interpretation. We use this measure to assess demographic,\nmedical, meteorological and environmental factors associated with the disease\nseverity. For this, we employ an ecological regression study design and analyze\ndifferent US states during the first disease outbreak. Principal Component\nAnalysis, followed by univariate and multivariate analyses based on machine\nlearning techniques, is used for selecting important predictors.

While SLR provide many benefits, they also present several problems with\npunctual solutions for some of them. However, two main problems still remain:\nthe high time-/effort-consumption nature of SLR and the lack of an effective\nimpact of SLR results in the industry, as initially expected for SLR. Aims: The\nmain goal of this paper is to introduce a new view - which we name\nSustainability of SLR - on how to deal with SLR aiming at reducing those\nproblems. Method: We analyzed six reference studies published in the last\ndecade to identify, group, and analyze the SLR problems and their\ninterconnections. Based on such analysis, we proposed the view of\nSustainability of SLR that intends to address these problems. Results: The\nproposed view encompasses three dimensions (social, economic, and technical)\nthat could become SLR more sustainable in the sense that the four major\nproblems and 31 barriers (i.e., possible causes for those problems) that we\nidentified could be mitigated.

Atmospheric studies of these planets\nhave shown that their transmission spectra are rich in metal lines, with some\nof these metals being ionised due to the extreme temperatures. Here, we use two\ntransit observations of WASP-76b obtained with the CARMENES spectrograph to\nstudy the atmosphere of this planet using high-resolution transmission\nspectroscopy. Taking advantage of the two channels and the coverage of the red\nand near-infrared wavelength ranges by CARMENES, we focus our analysis on the\nstudy of the CaII infrared triplet (IRT) at 8500A and the HeI triplet at\n10830A. We present the discovery of the CaII IRT at 7$\\sigma$ in the atmosphere\nof WASP-76b using the cross-correlation technique, which is consistent with\nprevious detections of the CaII H&K lines in the same planet, and with the\natmospheric studies of other ultra-hot Jupiters reported to date. The low mass\ndensity of the planet, and our calculations of the XUV irradiation received by\nthe exoplanet, show that this planet is a potential candidate to have a HeI\nevaporating envelope and, therefore, we performed further investigations\nfocussed on this aspect. The transmission spectrum around the HeI triplet shows\na broad and red-shifted absorption signal in both transit observations.\nHowever, due to the strong telluric contamination around the HeI lines and the\nrelatively low signal-to-noise ratio of the observations, we are not able to\nunambiguously conclude if the absorption is due to the presence of helium in\nthe atmosphere of WASP-76b, and we consider the result to be only an upper\nlimit. Finally, we revisit the transmission spectrum around other lines such as\nNaI, LiI, H$\\alpha$, and KI. The upper limits reported here for these lines are\nconsistent with previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 19:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Datasets and leaderboards, and in particular the MS MARCO\ndatasets, illustrate the dramatic improvements achieved by modern neural\nrankers. When compared with traditional test collections, the MS MARCO datasets\nemploy substantially more queries with substantially fewer known relevant items\nper query. Given the sparsity of these relevance labels, the MS MARCO\nleaderboards track improvements with mean reciprocal rank (MRR). In essence, a\nrelevant item is treated as the \"right answer\", with rankers scored on their\nability to place this item high in the ranking. In working with these sparse\nlabels, we have observed that the top items returned by a ranker often appear\nsuperior to judged relevant items. To test this observation, we employed\ncrowdsourced workers to make preference judgments between the top item returned\nby a modern neural ranking stack and a judged relevant item. The results\nsupport our observation. If we imagine a perfect ranker under MRR, with a score\nof 1 on all queries, our preference judgments indicate that a searcher would\nprefer the top result from a modern neural ranking stack more frequently than\nthe top result from the imaginary perfect ranker, making our neural ranker\n\"better than perfect\". To understand the implications for the leaderboard, we\npooled the top document from available runs near the top of the passage ranking\nleaderboard for over 500 queries. We employed crowdsourced workers to make\npreference judgments over these pools and re-evaluated the runs. Our results\nsupport our concerns that current MS MARCO datasets may no longer be able to\nrecognize genuine improvements in rankers.

It is therefore paramount to constrain the high-$z$ BHAD using\nindependent methods other than direct X-ray detections. The recently\nestablished relation between star formation rate and BH accretion rate among\nbulge-dominated galaxies provides such a chance, as it enables an estimate of\nthe BHAD from the star-formation histories (SFHs) of lower-redshift objects.\nUsing the CANDELS Lyman-$\\alpha$ Emission At Reionization (CLEAR) survey, we\nmodel the SFHs for a sample of 108 bulge-dominated galaxies at $z=$0.7-1.5, and\nfurther estimate the BHAD contributed by their high-$z$ progenitors.

Combined\nwith the recently demonstrated schemes of fast two-qubit gates and\nall-microwave qubit reset, it would substantially shorten the time required for\nerror correction and resetting ancilla qubits compared to a measurement-based\napproach and provide an error correction rate of $\\gtrsim1$~MHz with high\naccuracy for three-qubit bit- and phase-flip errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 21:44:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 11:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Statistical laws of\ninformation avalanches are found in previous studies to be not robust across\nsystems, and radically different processes are used to represent plausible\ndriving mechanisms for information propagation.

In this\npaper, we analyze a tissue growth model consisting of a single lineage of two\ncell types regulated by negative feedback signalling molecules that undergo\nspatial diffusion. By deriving the fixed points for the uniform steady states\nand carrying out linear stability analysis, phase diagrams are obtained\nanalytically for arbitrary parameters of the model. Two different generic\ngrowth modes are found: blow-up growth and final-state controlled growth which\nare governed by the non-trivial fixed point and the trivial fixed point\nrespectively, and can be sensitively switched by varying the negative feedback\nregulation on the proliferation of the stem cells. Analytic expressions for the\ncharacteristic time scales for these two growth modes are also derived.\nRemarkably, the trivial and non-trivial uniform steady states can coexist and a\nsharp transition occurs in the bistable regime as the relevant parameters are\nvaried. Furthermore, the bi-stable growth properties allows for the external\ncontrol to switch between these two growth modes. In addition, the condition\nfor an early accelerated growth followed by a retarded growth can be derived.\nThese analytical results are further verified by numerical simulations and\nprovide insights on the growth behavior of the tissue. Our results are also\ndiscussed in the light of possible realistic biological experiments and tissue\ngrowth control strategy. Furthermore, by external feedback control of the\nconcentration of regulatory molecules, it is possible to achieve a desired\ngrowth mode, as demonstrated with an analysis of boosted growth, catch-up\ngrowth and the design for the target of a linear growth dynamic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 00:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

The main idea is to request a user to\ntake a photo of the web browser with the domain name in the address bar as the\n2nd authentication factor. The web server side extracts the domain name\ninformation based on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and then determines\nif the user is visiting this website or a fake one, thus defeating the RTP\nattacks where an adversary must set up a fake website with a different domain.\nWe prototyped our system and evaluated its performance in various environments.\nThe results showed that PhotoAuth is an effective technique with good\nscalability. We also showed that compared to other 2FA systems, PhotoAuth has\nseveral advantages, especially no special hardware or software support is\nneeded on the client side except a phone, making it readily deployable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 00:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

In this paper, we\npropose an end-to-end model of Deep Dual Support Vector Data description based\nAutoencoder (Dual-SVDAE) for anomaly detection on attributed networks, which\nconsiders both the structure and attribute for attributed networks.\nSpecifically, Dual-SVDAE consists of a structure autoencoder and an attribute\nautoencoder to learn the latent representation of the node in the structure\nspace and attribute space respectively. Then, a dual-hypersphere learning\nmechanism is imposed on them to learn two hyperspheres of normal nodes from the\nstructure and attribute perspectives respectively. Moreover, to achieve joint\nlearning between the structure and attribute of the network, we fuse the\nstructure embedding and attribute embedding as the final input of the feature\ndecoder to generate the node attribute.

To address this problem, researchers have proposed\nmulti-model databases to support multiple data models in a uniform platform\nwith a single unified query language. However, since relational databases are\npredominant in the current market, it is expensive to replace them with others.\nBesides, due to the theories and technologies of RDBMSs having been enhanced\nover decades, it is hard to use few years to develop a multi-model database\nthat can be compared with existing RDBMSs in handling security, query\noptimization, transaction management, etc. In this paper, we reconsider\nemploying relational databases to store and query multi-model data.\nUnfortunately, the mismatch between the complexity of multi-model data\nstructure and the simplicity of flat relational tables makes this difficult.\nAgainst this challenge, we utilize the reinforcement learning (RL) method to\nlearn a relational schema by interacting with an RDBMS. Instead of using the\nclassic Q-learning algorithm, we propose a variant Q-learning algorithm, called\n\\textit{Double Q-tables}, to reduce the dimension of the original Q-table and\nimprove learning efficiency.

In particular, we propose an evaluation framework and\nmethodological baseline for a system in which each client is expected to learn\na growing set of classes and communicate knowledge of those classes efficiently\nwith other clients, such that, after knowledge merging, the clients should be\nable to accurately discriminate between classes in the superset of classes\nobserved by the set of clients. We compare a range of learning algorithms for\nthis problem and find that prototypical networks are a strong approach in that\nthey are robust to catastrophic forgetting while incorporating new information\nefficiently. Furthermore, we show that the online averaging of prototype\nvectors is effective for client model merging and requires only a small amount\nof communication overhead, memory, and update time per class with no\ngradient-based learning or hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, to put our\nresults in context, we find that a simple, prototypical network with four\nconvolutional layers significantly outperforms complex, state of the art\ncontinual learning algorithms, increasing the accuracy by over 22% after\nlearning 600 Omniglot classes and over 33% after learning 20 mini-ImageNet\nclasses incrementally. These results have important implications for federated\nreconnaissance and continual learning more generally by demonstrating that\ncommunicating feature vectors is an efficient, robust, and effective means for\ndistributed, continual learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 01:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

Most of previous FL approaches assume that\ndata on devices are fixed and stationary during the training process. However,\nthis assumption is unrealistic because these devices usually have varying\nsampling rates and different system configurations. In addition, the underlying\ndistribution of the device data can change dynamically over time, which is\nknown as concept drift. Concept drift makes the learning process complicated\nbecause of the inconsistency between existing and upcoming data. Traditional\nconcept drift handling techniques such as chunk based and ensemble\nlearning-based methods are not suitable in the federated learning frameworks\ndue to the heterogeneity of local devices. We propose a novel approach,\nFedConD, to detect and deal with the concept drift on local devices and\nminimize the effect on the performance of models in asynchronous FL. The drift\ndetection strategy is based on an adaptive mechanism which uses the historical\nperformance of the local models. The drift adaptation is realized by adjusting\nthe regularization parameter of objective function on each local device.\nAdditionally, we design a communication strategy on the server side to select\nlocal updates in a prudent fashion and speed up model convergence. Experimental\nevaluations on three evolving data streams and two image datasets show that\n\\model~detects and handles concept drift, and also reduces the overall\ncommunication cost compared to other baseline methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 02:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

While cooperative edge inference can overcome the limited sensing\ncapability of a single device, it substantially increases the communication\noverhead and may incur excessive latency. To enable low-latency cooperative\ninference, we propose a learning-based communication scheme that optimizes\nlocal feature extraction and distributed feature encoding in a task-oriented\nmanner, i.e., to remove data redundancy and transmit information that is\nessential for the downstream inference task rather than reconstructing the data\nsamples at the edge server.

After training offline, our controller can be activated once the\nspacecraft is within a pre-specified radius of the landing zone and at a\npre-specified altitude i.e., the base of an inverted cone with the tip at the\nlanding zone. We demonstrate empirically that our controller can successfully\nand safely land all trajectories initialized at the base of this cone while\nminimizing fuel consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 04:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

While the majority (the\nhead) classes have sufficient samples, the minority (the tail) classes can be\nunder-represented by a rather limited number of samples. Data pre-processing\nhas been shown to be very effective in dealing with such problems. On one hand,\ndata re-sampling is a common approach to tackling class imbalance. On the other\nhand, dimension reduction, which reduces the feature space, is a conventional\ntechnique for reducing noise and inconsistencies in a dataset. However, the\npossible synergy between feature selection and data re-sampling for\nhigh-performance imbalance classification has rarely been investigated before.\nTo address this issue, we carry out a comprehensive empirical study on the\njoint influence of feature selection and re-sampling on two-class imbalance\nclassification. Specifically, we study the performance of two opposite\npipelines for imbalance classification by applying feature selection before or\nafter data re-sampling. We conduct a large number of experiments, with a total\nof 9225 tests, on 52 publicly available datasets, using 9 feature selection\nmethods, 6 re-sampling approaches for class imbalance learning, and 3\nwell-known classification algorithms. Experimental results show that there is\nno constant winner between the two pipelines; thus both of them should be\nconsidered to derive the best performing model for imbalance classification. We\nfind that the performance of an imbalance classification model not only depends\non the classifier adopted and the ratio between the number of majority and\nminority samples, but also depends on the ratio between the number of samples\nand features. Overall, this study should provide new reference value for\nresearchers and practitioners in imbalance learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 06:01:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 16:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

In this work, we present an anchor-free approach to efficiently\ntackling this challenging task, by introducing the following dedicated designs.\nFirst, we select an anchor-free detector (i.e., FCOS) as the prototype of our\nframework.

Second, when\ndirectly accommodating this anchor-free detector for person search, there exist\nseveral major challenges in learning robust re-id features, which we summarize\nas the misalignment issues in different levels (i.e., scale, region, and task).\nTo address these issues, we propose an aligned feature aggregation module to\ngenerate more discriminative and robust feature embeddings.

Recently, the JED-SAD\nparadigm has been proposed for black hole X-ray binaries, aimed to address the\naccretion-ejection interplay in these systems. According to this model, the\naccretion flow is composed by an outer standard Shakura-Sunyaev disk (SAD) and\nan inner hot Jet Emitting Disk (JED). The JED produces both the hard X-ray\nemission, effectively playing the role of the hot corona, and the radio jets.\nIn this paper, we use the JED-SAD model to describe the evolution of the\naccretion flow in the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070 during its hard and\nhard-intermediate states. Contrarily to the previous applications of this\nmodel, the Compton reflection component has been taken into account. We use\neight broadband X-rays spectra, including NuSTAR, NICER and Swift data,\nproviding a total spectral coverage of 0.8-190 keV. The data were directly\nfitted with the JED-SAD model. Our results suggest that the optically thick\ndisk (i.e. the SAD) does not extend down to the ISCO in any of the considered\nepochs. In particular, as the system evolves towards the hard/intermediate\nstate, we find that the inner radius decreases from $\\sim$60 R$_{\\rm G}$ in the\nfirst observation down to $\\sim$30 R$_{\\rm G}$ in the last one. This trend is\naccompanied by an increase of the mass-accretion rate. In all hard-intermediate\nstate observations, two reflection components, characterized by different\nvalues of ionization, are required to adequately explain the data. These\ncomponents likely originate from different regions of the SAD. We show that a\nflared outer disk could, in principle, explain the double reflection component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 07:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

Then\n$R$ is said to be star regular if $|Star(T)|\\leq |Star(R)|$ for every overring\n$T$ of $R$. In this paper we introduce the notion of finitely star regular\ndomain as an integral domain $R$ such that $|StarFC(T)|\\leq |StarFC(R)|$ for\neach overring $T$ of $R$. First, we show that the notions of star regular and\nfinitely star regular domains are completely different and do not imply each\nother. Next, we extend/generalize well-known results on star regularity in\nNoetherian and Pr\\\"ufer contexts to finitely star regularity. Also we handle\nthe finite star regular domains issued from classical pullback constructions to\nconstruct finitely star regular domains that are not star regular and enriches\nthe literature with a such class of domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 07:41:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

Under UV\n(365 nm) excitation, cultured cells (LM2, IGROV-1, BGC-1, and 3T3-L1\nadipocytes) treated with PMS (5 ug/mL, 30 min) showed cytoplasmic granules with\nbright blue fluorescence, which correspond to lipid droplets labeled by the\nlipophilic methyl-phenazine. After formaldehyde fixation blue-fluorescing\ndroplets could be stained with oil red O. Interestingly, PMS-treated 3T3-L1\nadipocytes observed under UV excitation 24 h after labeling showed large lipid\ndroplets with a weak green emission within a diffuse pale blue-fluorescing\ncytoplasm, whereas a strong green emission was observed in small lipid\ndroplets. This fluorescence change from blue to green indicates that\nreoxidation of methyl-phenazine to PMS can occur. Regarding cell uptake and\nlabeling mechanisms, QSAR models predict that the hydrophilic PMS is not\nsignificantly membrane-permeant, so most PMS reduction is expected to be\nextracellular and associated with a plasma membrane NAD(P)H reductase. Once\nformed, the lipophilic and blue-fluorescing methyl-phenazine enters live cells\nand mainly accumulates in lipid droplets. Overall, the results reported here\nindicate that PMS is an excellent fluorescent probe to investigate labeling and\nredox dynamics of lipid droplets in cultured cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 08:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

However, due to significant\ntypological differences and contradictions between some languages, such models\nusually perform poorly on many languages and cross-lingual settings, which\nshows the difficulty of learning a single model to handle massive diverse\nlanguages well at the same time. To alleviate this issue, we present a new\nmultilingual pre-training pipeline. We propose to generate language\nrepresentation from multilingual pre-trained models and conduct linguistic\nanalysis to show that language representation similarity reflect linguistic\nsimilarity from multiple perspectives, including language family, geographical\nsprachbund, lexicostatistics and syntax. Then we cluster all the target\nlanguages into multiple groups and name each group as a representation\nsprachbund. Thus, languages in the same representation sprachbund are supposed\nto boost each other in both pre-training and fine-tuning as they share rich\nlinguistic similarity. We pre-train one multilingual model for each\nrepresentation sprachbund.

In the Bose-Hubbard model,\nthis non-adiabatic linear response is significant in the quantum critical\nregime where well-defined quasi-particles are absent.

Theoretical results showed the possibility that neutron capture\nelements were produced in the early Universe by two different sources: a\nfrequent s-process source hosted by rotating massive stars, and a rare\nr-process source hosted most likely by neutron star mergers. The two sources\nproduce barium with different isotopic compositions. Aims. We aim to\ninvestigate the lines of barium in two halo stars, HD 6268 and HD 4306. The\nspectra present an exquisite quality, both in terms of resolution (R > 100'000)\nand signal-to-noise (400). Due to hyperfine splitting (hfs) effects, barium\nlines are expected to show slightly different profiles depending on the barium\nisotopic fraction. Methods. We applied a standard local thermodynamic\nequilibrium synthesis of the barium lines. We compared the synthetic results\nassuming an s-process isotopic pattern or an r-process isotopic pattern for the\ntwo barium lines for each star that exhibited hfs. We also applied a\nmethodology, less dependent on the accuracy of the theoretical Ba hfs\nstructure, that transforms the lines of HD 4306 into those we would observe if\nits atmospheric parameter values (i.e. Teff, log g, micro- and\nmacro-turbulence, Vsin i, and Ba abundance) were the same as those of HD 6268.\nResults. With both methods, our results show that the barium lines with hfs\neffects of HD 4306 are in agreement with an s-process composition and the lines\nin HD 6268 have a different profile, which is most likely linked to the\npresence of an r-process isotopic pattern. Conclusions. Two lines of barium of\nHD 6268 and HD 4306 seem to confirm the theoretical expectation that both\nr-process events and also s-process contribution by rotating massive stars have\npolluted the ancient halo of our Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 09:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

We compare our proposed approach against\nstate-of-the-art methods and show its advantage in terms of accuracy and\nefficiency. In particular, prediction suffix trees, being variable-order Markov\nmodels, have the ability to capture long-term dependencies in a stream by\nremembering only those past sequences that are informative enough. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate the benefits, in terms of accuracy, of being\nable to capture such long-term dependencies. This is achieved by increasing the\norder of our model beyond what is possible with full-order Markov models that\nneed to perform an exhaustive enumeration of all possible past sequences of a\ngiven order. We also discuss extensively how CEF solutions should be best\nevaluated on the quality of their forecasts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 09:52:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

Before technology mapping, additional buffer and\nsplitter cells need to be inserted into AQFP circuits to fulfill two special\nconstraints: (1) Input signals to a logic gate need to arrive at the same time,\nthus shorter paths need to be delayed with buffers. (2) The output signal of a\nlogic gate has to be actively branched with splitters if it drives multiple\nfanouts. Buffers and splitters largely increase the area and delay in AQFP\ncircuits. Na\\\"ive buffer and splitter insertion and light-weight optimization\nusing retiming techniques have been used in related works, and it is not clear\nhow much space there is for further optimization. In this paper, we develop (a)\na linear-time algorithm to insert buffers and splitters irredundantly, and (b)\noptimization methods by scheduling and by moving groups of gates, called\nchunks, together. Experimental results show a reduction of up to 39% on buffer\nand splitter cost. Moreover, as the technology is still developing and\nassumptions on the physical constraints are not clear yet, we also discuss the\nimpacts of different assumptions with experimental results to motivate future\nresearch on AQFP register design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 10:10:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

An important use case is the discovery of\nleaks and inflows in pipe networks using a swarm of floating sensor nodes.\nWhile passively drifting along, the devices must track their individual\npositions so critical points can later be located. Since pipelines are often\nsituated in inaccessible places, large portions of the network can be shielded\nfrom radio and satellite signals, rendering conventional positioning systems\nineffective.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for assigning location estimates\nto recorded measurements once the sensor node leaves the inaccessible area and\ntransmits them via a gateway. The solution is range-free and makes use of a\npriori information about the target pipeline network. We further describe two\nextended variants of our algorithm which use data of encounters with other\nsensor nodes to improve accuracy. Finally, we evaluate all variants with\nrespect to various network topologies and different numbers of mobile nodes in\na simulation.

The key factor here is the coupling factor between\ntransmission line and qubit by which the quantum features of the system such as\ntransmon decay rate, energy dispersion, and related coherence time are\ncontrolled. To complete knowledge about the design, the system is quantum\nmechanically analyzed and the related Hamiltonian is derived.

For the former case, we develop a covert beamformer under the\nperfect covert constraint by applying semidefinite relaxation. For the later\ncase, the optimal decision threshold of Willie is derived, and we analyze the\nfalse alarm and the missed detection probabilities. Furthermore, we utilize the\nproperty of Kullback-Leibler divergence to develop the robust beamformer based\non a relaxation, S-Lemma and alternate iteration approach. Finally, the\nnumerical experiments evaluate the performance of the proposed covert\nbeamformer design and robust beamformer design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 12:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

With the absence of old task\nimages, they often assume that old knowledge is well preserved if the\nclassifier produces similar output on new images. In this paper, we find that\ntheir effectiveness largely depends on the nature of old classes: they work\nwell on classes that are easily distinguishable between each other but may fail\non more fine-grained ones, e.g., boy and girl. In spirit, such methods project\nnew data onto the feature space spanned by the weight vectors in the fully\nconnected layer, corresponding to old classes. The resulting projections would\nbe similar on fine-grained old classes, and as a consequence the new classifier\nwill gradually lose the discriminative ability on these classes. To address\nthis issue, we propose a memory-free generative replay strategy to preserve the\nfine-grained old classes characteristics by generating representative old\nimages directly from the old classifier and combined with new data for new\nclassifier training. To solve the homogenization problem of the generated\nsamples, we also propose a diversity loss that maximizes Kullback Leibler (KL)\ndivergence between generated samples.

Most existing sequential recommender models consider the next item\nprediction task as the training signal. Unfortunately, there are two essential\nchallenges for these methods: (1) the long-term preference is difficult to\ncapture, and (2) the supervision signal is too sparse to effectively train a\nmodel. In this paper, we propose a novel sequential recommendation framework to\novercome these challenges based on a memory augmented multi-instance\ncontrastive predictive coding scheme, denoted as MMInfoRec. The basic\ncontrastive predictive coding (CPC) serves as encoders of sequences and items.\nThe memory module is designed to augment the auto-regressive prediction in CPC\nto enable a flexible and general representation of the encoded preference,\nwhich can improve the ability to capture the long-term preference. For\neffective training of the MMInfoRec model, a novel multi-instance noise\ncontrastive estimation (MINCE) loss is proposed, using multiple positive\nsamples, which offers effective exploitation of samples inside a mini-batch.\nThe proposed MMInfoRec framework falls into the contrastive learning style,\nwithin which, however, a further finetuning step is not required given that its\ncontrastive training task is well aligned with the target recommendation task.\nWith extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, MMInfoRec can outperform\nthe state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 13:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 01:37:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 11:54:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

Since the first generation of multi-GeV\nrings, intense studies have been devoted to understanding the possible harmful\nmechanisms involved in transition crossing and to devise mitigation measures.\nNowadays, several circular particle accelerators are successfully operating\nacross transition and this process is well mastered.

While the original aim of\nsuch a proposal was multi-turn extraction from the CERN Proton Synchrotron to\nthe Super Proton Synchrotron, many more applications have been proposed and\nstudied in detail. In this paper, the two topics, i.e. transition crossing and\nstable resonances, have been brought together with the goal of providing a\nnovel and non-adiabatic approach to perform a clean transition crossing. The\nidea presented here is that by judiciously using sextupoles and octupoles it is\npossible to generate stable islands of the horizontal phase space. These\nislands represent a second closed orbit whose properties can be selected\nindependently of those of the standard, i.e. central, closed orbit.

The forward part\ngenerates the desired fusion result from the various observations; the backward\ndegeneration feedback part considers the imaging degradation process and\nregenerates the observations inversely from the fusion result.

Here we consider a framework borrowed from biology that involves\nmultiple interventions from different contexts (observations and experiments)\nin a single analysis. The method is called perturbation graphs. In gene\nregulatory networks, the induced change in one gene is measured on all other\ngenes in the analysis, thereby assessing possible causal relations. This is\nrepeated for each gene in the analysis. A perturbation graph leads to the\ncorrect set of causes (not necessarily direct causes). Subsequent pruning of\npaths in the graph (called transitive reduction) should reveal direct causes.\nWe show that transitive reduction will not in general lead to the correct\nunderlying graph. There is however a close relation with another method, called\ninvariant causal prediction. Invariant causal prediction can be considered as a\ngeneralisation of the perturbation graph method where including additional\nvariables (and so conditioning on those variables) does reveal direct causes,\nand thereby replacing transitive reduction. We explain the basic ideas of\nperturbation graphs, transitive reduction and invariant causal prediction and\ninvestigate their connections. We conclude that perturbation graphs provide a\npromising new tool for experimental designs in psychology, and combined with\ninvariant prediction make it possible to reveal direct causes instead of causal\npaths.

Nevertheless, beyond topological symmetry, one\nshould consider the fact that real-world networks are exposed to fluctuations\nor errors, as well as mistaken insertions or removals. Therefore, the resulting\napproximate symmetries remain hidden to standard symmetry analysis - fully\naccomplished by discrete algebra software. There have been a number of attempts\nto deal with approximate symmetries. In the present work we provide an\nalternative notion of these weaker symmetries, which we call\n`quasi-symmetries'. Differently from other definitions, quasi-symmetries remain\nfree to impose any invariance of a particular network property and they are\nobtained from the phase differences at the steady-state configuration of an\noscillatory dynamical model: the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model. The analysis of\nquasi-symmetries unveils otherwise hidden real-world networks attributes. On\nthe one hand, we provide a benchmark to determine whether a network has a more\ncomplex pattern than that of a random network with regard to quasi-symmetries,\nnamely, if it is structured into separate quasi-symmetric groups of nodes. On\nthe other hand, we define the `dual-network', a weighted network (and its\ncorresponding binnarized counterpart) that effectively encodes all the\ninformation of quasi-symmetries in the original network. The latter is a\npowerful instrument for obtaining worthwhile insights about node centrality\n(obtaining the nodes that are unique from that act as imitators with respect to\nthe others) and community detection ( quasi-symmetric groups of nodes).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 14:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

We therefore investigated implicit guidance\noffered by means of an agent's behavior. With this type of guidance, the agent\nacts in a way that makes it easy for the human to find an effective plan for a\ncollaborative task, and the human can then improve the plan. Since the human\nimproves their plan voluntarily, he or she maintains autonomy.

Amongst these parameters is the inclination\nof the system to the line of sight. Along with the GW detection, the afterglow\nmodelling provides the best constraint on the inclination to the line-of-sight\nand can improve the estimates of cosmological parameters e.g. the Hubble\nconstant, from GW-EM events. However, modelling of the afterglow depends on the\nassumed jet structure and, often overlooked, the effects of lateral spreading.\nHere we show how the inclusion of lateral spreading in the afterglow models can\naffect the estimated inclination of GW-EM events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 15:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

This\nstudy therefore aimed at comparing lumbar loads among different lifting styles\nusing a comprehensive state-of-the-art motion capture-driven musculoskeletal\nmodeling approach. Thirty healthy pain-free individuals were enrolled in this\nstudy and asked to repetitively lift a 15 kg-box by applying 1) a freestyle, 2)\na squat and 3) a stoop lifting technique. Whole-body kinematics were recorded\nusing an optical motion capture system and used to drive a full-body\nmusculoskeletal model including a detailed thoracolumbar spine. Compressive,\nshear and total loads were calculated based on a static optimization approach\nand expressed as factor body weight (BW). In addition, lumbar lordosis angles\nand total lifting time were calculated. All parameters were compared among the\nlifting styles using a repeated measures design. For all lumbar segments, stoop\nlifting showed significantly lower compressive and total loads (-0.3 to -1.0BW)\nwhen compared to freestyle and squat lifting. Stoop lifting produced higher\nshear loads (+0.1 to +0.8BW) in the segments T12/L1 to L4/L5, but lower loads\nin L5/S1 (-0.2 to -0.4BW). Peak compressive and total loads during squat\nlifting occurred approximately 30% earlier in the lifting cycle compared to\nstoop lifting.

This\ndiscretization gives rise to simple and insightful effective models for both\nradar sensing and communication, which result in simplified designs for the\nrelated estimation and detection problems. In particular, we design simple beam\ntracking, angle estimation, and power allocation schemes for radar sensing, by\nutilizing the special structure of the effective radar sensing matrix.\nMeanwhile, we provide a detailed analysis on the pair-wise error probability\n(PEP) for communication, which unveils the key conditions for both precoding\nand power allocation designs.

Furthermore, we notice that radar sensing and\ncommunication requires different power allocations.

For the\nlatter, the resultant aerodynamic forces based on a linear semi-analytical and\na CFD model are compared for the same effective angle of attack due to\nsinusoidal gust and motion. The methodology is first employed to verify the\nlinear behavior of a flat plate and then study the nonlinear behavior of two\nbridge decks. The results show that the linear superposition principle holds\nfor streamlined bridge decks with minimal shear layer instability. However,\nthis principle may not be valid for bluff bridge decks due to strong separation\nvortices that dictate the shear layer, which induces nonlinearity in the\naerodynamic forces manifested through amplitude difference in the first\nharmonic and emergence of higher-order harmonics. The outcome of this study\naims to provide a deeper understanding of the complex nonlinear fluid-structure\ninteraction occurring for bluff bodies subjected to motion and free-stream\ngusts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 15:39:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 15:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Inspired by the great\nsuccess of the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm in both vision and\nlanguage tasks, we argue that pre-training is one potential solution for\nobtaining a scalable model to 3D point cloud downstream tasks as well. In this\npaper, we, therefore, explore a new self-supervised learning method, called\nMixing and Disentangling (MD), for 3D point cloud representation learning. As\nthe name implies, we mix two input shapes and demand the model learning to\nseparate the inputs from the mixed shape. We leverage this reconstruction task\nas the pretext optimization objective for self-supervised learning. There are\ntwo primary advantages: 1) Compared to prevailing image datasets, eg, ImageNet,\npoint cloud datasets are de facto small. The mixing process can provide a much\nlarger online training sample pool. 2) On the other hand, the disentangling\nprocess motivates the model to mine the geometric prior knowledge, eg, key\npoints. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed pretext task, we build one\nbaseline network, which is composed of one encoder and one decoder. During\npre-training, we mix two original shapes and obtain the geometry-aware\nembedding from the encoder, then an instance-adaptive decoder is applied to\nrecover the original shapes from the embedding. Albeit simple, the pre-trained\nencoder can capture the key points of an unseen point cloud and surpasses the\nencoder trained from scratch on downstream tasks. The proposed method has\nimproved the empirical performance on both ModelNet-40 and ShapeNet-Part\ndatasets in terms of point cloud classification and segmentation tasks. We\nfurther conduct ablation studies to explore the effect of each component and\nverify the generalization of our proposed strategy by harnessing different\nbackbones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 15:52:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 03:03:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 07:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

Explainable AI (XAI) methods have been proposed to tackle this issue\nby producing human-interpretable representations of ML models which can help\nusers to gain confidence and build trust in the ML system. However, little work\nexplicitly investigates the role of explainability for safety assurance in the\ncontext of ML development. This paper identifies ways in which XAI methods can\ncontribute to safety assurance of ML-based systems. It then uses a concrete\nML-based clinical decision support system, concerning weaning of patients from\nmechanical ventilation, to demonstrate how XAI methods can be employed to\nproduce evidence to support safety assurance. The results are also represented\nin a safety argument to show where, and in what way, XAI methods can contribute\nto a safety case.

The role of these biased instances is then\nreduced during the training of the main model to enhance its robustness to\nout-of-distribution data. A common core assumption of these techniques is that\nthe main model handles biased instances similarly to the biased model, in that\nit will resort to biases whenever available. In this paper, we show that this\nassumption does not hold in general. We carry out a critical investigation on\ntwo well-known datasets in the domain, MNLI and FEVER, along with two biased\ninstance detection methods, partial-input and limited-capacity models. Our\nexperiments show that in around a third to a half of instances, the biased\nmodel is unable to predict the main model's behavior, highlighted by the\nsignificantly different parts of the input on which they base their decisions.\nBased on a manual validation, we also show that this estimate is highly in line\nwith human interpretation.

The majority of video domain adaptation algorithms are\nproposed for closed-set scenarios in which all the classes are shared among the\ndomains. In this work, we propose an open-set video domain adaptation approach\nto mitigate the domain discrepancy between the source and target data, allowing\nthe target data to contain additional classes that do not belong to the source\ndomain. Different from previous works, which only focus on improving accuracy\nfor shared classes, we aim to jointly enhance the alignment of shared classes\nand recognition of unknown samples. Towards this goal, class-conditional\nextreme value theory is applied to enhance the unknown recognition.\nSpecifically, the entropy values of target samples are modelled as generalised\nextreme value distributions, which allows separating unknown samples lying in\nthe tail of the distribution. To alleviate the negative transfer issue, weights\ncomputed by the distance from the sample entropy to the threshold are leveraged\nin adversarial learning in the sense that confident source and target samples\nare aligned, and unconfident samples are pushed away.

While\nWGAN-GP were initially developed to calculate the Wasserstein 1 distance\nbetween generated and real data, recent works (e.g. [23]) have provided\nempirical evidence that this does not occur, and have argued that WGAN-GP\nperform well not in spite of this issue, but because of it. In this paper we\nshow for the first time that WGAN-GP compute the minimum of a different optimal\ntransport problem, the so-called congested transport [7]. Congested transport\ndetermines the cost of moving one distribution to another under a transport\nmodel that penalizes congestion. For WGAN-GP, we find that the congestion\npenalty has a spatially varying component determined by the sampling strategy\nused in [12] which acts like a local speed limit, making congestion cost less\nin some regions than others. This aspect of the congested transport problem is\nnew, in that the congestion penalty turns out to be unbounded and depends on\nthe distributions to be transported, and so we provide the necessary\nmathematical proofs for this setting. One facet of our discovery is a formula\nconnecting the gradient of solutions to the optimization problem in WGAN-GP to\nthe time averaged momentum of the optimal mass flow. This is in contrast to the\ngradient of Kantorovich potentials for the Wasserstein 1 distance, which is\njust the normalized direction of flow. Based on this and other considerations,\nwe speculate on how our results explain the observed performance of WGAN-GP.\nBeyond applications to GANs, our theorems also point to the possibility of\napproximately solving large scale congested transport problems using neural\nnetwork techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 13:31:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 16:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

In this work, we address the electronic properties and\nelectron transport of circular and rectangular twisted graphene nanoribbon\n(tGN) and twisted heterostructure of graphene/boron-nitride nanoribbon\n(thG/BNN) channels by applying the tight-binding Hamiltonian for two regimes of\nsmall and large tAs. Analysis of band structure reveals that the circular tGNs\nfor small and large tAs have metallic behavior, while phase transition of metal\nto semiconductor occurs in rectangular case, sweeping small tAs to large ones.\nThis implies a different transport mechanism depending on the tAs disorder,\nwhiles the Klein paradox appears in the transmission and conductance of\ncircular tGNs. We distinguish that the local electron states of rectangular\ntGNs with large tAs create degenerate multiflat bands, supporting decoupling of\ntwo ribbons and high conductance state. However, coupled two Dirac electron\ngases for small tAs of rectangular channel cause Klein paradox due to their\nresonant scattering. We compute the Hall conductivity in both tGNs for wide\nrange of magnetic field. In circular tGNs the valance and conduction band\nenergy is quantized into electron/hole-like Landau level, while for rectangular\ntGNs with applied magnetic field the Hall conductivity shows complex behavior.\nMoreover, we provide a platform for quantum transport and Hall effect of\nthG/BNN, which host a vast nontrivial emergent electronic state. Our findings\nsuggest that circular/rectangular tGNs and thG/BNNs with new electron states of\nMoir\\'e pattern besides the Klein paradox suitable for switching of several\nnanochannel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 11:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

Unfortunately, they are still highly prone to different kinds of\nspoofing attacks such as voice conversion and speech synthesis, etc. In this\npaper, we propose a new method base on physiological-physical feature fusion to\ndeal with voice spoofing attacks. This method involves feature extraction, a\ndensely connected convolutional neural network with squeeze and excitation\nblock (SE-DenseNet), multi-scale residual neural network with squeeze and\nexcitation block (SE-Res2Net) and feature fusion strategies. We first\npre-trained a convolutional neural network using the speaker's voice and face\nin the video as surveillance signals. It can extract physiological features\nfrom speech. Then we use SE-DenseNet and SE-Res2Net to extract physical\nfeatures. Such a densely connection pattern has high parameter efficiency and\nsqueeze and excitation block can enhance the transmission of the feature.\nFinally, we integrate the two features into the SE-Densenet to identify the\nspoofing attacks. Experimental results on the ASVspoof 2019 data set show that\nour model is effective for voice spoofing detection.

In this paper, we\npresent a novel approach called You Only Hear Once (YOHO), which is inspired by\nthe YOLO algorithm popularly adopted in Computer Vision. We convert the\ndetection of acoustic boundaries into a regression problem instead of\nframe-based classification. This is done by having separate output neurons to\ndetect the presence of an audio class and predict its start and end points. The\nrelative improvement for F-measure of YOHO, compared to the state-of-the-art\nConvolutional Recurrent Neural Network, ranged from 1% to 6% across multiple\ndatasets for audio segmentation and sound event detection. As the output of\nYOHO is more end-to-end and has fewer neurons to predict, the speed of\ninference is at least 6 times faster than segmentation-by-classification.

To characterize the actual detection performance, we\npropose a method for the force detection sensitivity calibration of a levitated\nnanomechanical sensor based on the harmonic Coulomb force.

Machine learning models, in particular, hold\npromise for their ability to leverage patient clinical information and medical\nimages for prediction. However, most of the published COVID-19 prediction\nmodels thus far have little clinical utility due to methodological flaws and\nlack of appropriate validation. In this paper, we describe our methodology to\ndevelop and validate multi-modal models for COVID-19 mortality prediction using\nmulti-center patient data. The models for COVID-19 mortality prediction were\ndeveloped using retrospective data from Madrid, Spain (N=2547) and were\nexternally validated in patient cohorts from a community hospital in New\nJersey, USA (N=242) and an academic center in Seoul, Republic of Korea (N=336).\nThe models we developed performed differently across various clinical settings,\nunderscoring the need for a guided strategy when employing machine learning for\nclinical decision-making. We demonstrated that using features from both the\nstructured electronic health records and chest X-ray imaging data resulted in\nbetter 30-day-mortality prediction performance across all three datasets (areas\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curves: 0.85 (95% confidence\ninterval: 0.83-0.87), 0.76 (0.70-0.82), and 0.95 (0.92-0.98)). We discuss the\nrationale for the decisions made at every step in developing the models and\nhave made our code available to the research community. We employed the best\nmachine learning practices for clinical model development. Our goal is to\ncreate a toolkit that would assist investigators and organizations in building\nmulti-modal models for prediction, classification and/or optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 04:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

We apply radio-frequency (RF) microwaves in the sub-gigahertz\nfrequency range on a one-dimensional array of small Josephson junctions\nexhibiting distinct Coulomb blockade characteristics. We observed a gradual\nlifting of Coulomb blockade with increase in the microwave power which we\ninterpret is due to photon-assisted tunneling of Cooper pairs in the classical\n(multi-photon absorption) regime. We observe that, due to its high sensitivity\nto microwave power, the array is well-suited for in situ microwave detection\napplications in low temperature environments. A detailed analysis of the\ncharacteristics in the classical (multi-photon absorption) limit reveals that\nthe microwave amplitude is rescaled (renormalized), which we attribute to the\ndifference in dc and ac voltage response of the array. We proceed to rigorously\nconsider the origin of the aforementioned renormalization effect by considering\nthe effect of the electromagnetic environment of the Josephson junction on\napplied oscillating voltages. We theoretically demonstrate that its effect is\nsimply to renormalize the amplitude of oscillation in a predictable manner\ntraced to the physics of wave function renormalization (Lehmann weights)\nconsistent with circuit-QED. We also introduce Einstein's A and B coefficients\nfor small Josephson junctions, in a bid to relate the renormalization effect to\nthe modification of photon absorption and emission amplitudes. Such\nrenormalization implies that the sensitivity of the single junction and the\narray to oscillating electromagnetic fields (e.g. microwaves) is modulated and\ndepends on the environmental impedance. The renormalization effect can be\nexploited to configure `opaque', `translucent' or `transparent' quantum\ncircuits to microwaves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 14:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

In autonomous driving, the appearance of\nincomplete point clouds losing geometric and semantic information is inevitable\nowing to limitations of occlusion, sensor resolution, and viewing angle when\nthe Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) is applied. The emergence of incomplete\npoint clouds, especially incomplete vehicle point clouds, would lead to the\nreduction of the accuracy of autonomous driving vehicles in object detection,\ntraffic alert, and collision avoidance. Existing point cloud completion\nnetworks, such as Point Fractal Network (PF-Net), focus on the accuracy of\npoint cloud completion, without considering the efficiency of inference\nprocess, which makes it difficult for them to be deployed for vehicle point\ncloud repair in autonomous driving. To address the above problem, in this\npaper, we propose an efficient deep learning approach to repair incomplete\nvehicle point cloud accurately and efficiently in autonomous driving. In the\nproposed method, an efficient downsampling algorithm combining incremental\nsampling and one-time sampling is presented to improves the inference speed of\nthe PF-Net based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). To evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed method, a real dataset is used, and an autonomous\ndriving scene is created, where three incomplete vehicle point clouds with 5\ndifferent sizes are set for three autonomous driving situations. The improved\nPF-Net can achieve the speedups of over 19x with almost the same accuracy when\ncompared to the original PF-Net. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nimproved PF-Net can be applied to efficiently complete vehicle point clouds in\nautonomous driving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 08:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Our approach constitutes a\nTransformer network with a novel type of layers that combines: (i) local\nwinner-takes-all (LWTA) layers with stochastic winner sampling, instead of\nconventional ReLU layers, (ii) stochastic weights with posterior distributions\nestimated via variational inference, and (iii) a weight compression technique\nat inference time that exploits estimated posterior variance to perform\nmassive, almost lossless compression. We demonstrate that our approach can\nreach the currently best reported BLEU-4 score on the PHOENIX 2014T benchmark,\nbut without making use of glosses for model training, and with a memory\nfootprint reduced by more than 70%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 15:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 08:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

We use feature selection in combination with linear model\ncreation as a benchmark application and compare the results of optimization\nnetworks to ordinary least squares with optional elastic net regularization.\nBased on this example we justify the advantages of optimization networks by\nadapting the network to solve other machine learning problems. Finally,\noptimization analysis is presented, where optimal input values of a system have\nto be found to achieve desired output values. Optimization analysis can be\ndivided into three subproblems: model creation to describe the system, model\nselection to choose the most appropriate one and parameter optimization to\nobtain the input values. Therefore, optimization networks are an obvious choice\nfor handling optimization analysis tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 08:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}
