As a result, they\nare not reliable enough to be deployed in critical applications. Recent studies\ndemonstrate that GNNs could be easily fooled with adversarial perturbations,\nespecially structural perturbations. Such vulnerability is attributed to the\nexcessive dependence on the structure information to make predictions. To\nachieve better robustness, it is desirable to build the prediction of GNNs with\nmore comprehensive features. Graph data, in most cases, has two views of\ninformation, namely structure information and feature information. In this\npaper, we propose CoG, a simple yet effective co-training framework to combine\nthese two views for the purpose of robustness. CoG trains sub-models from the\nfeature view and the structure view independently and allows them to distill\nknowledge from each other by adding their most confident unlabeled data into\nthe training set. The orthogonality of these two views diversifies the\nsub-models, thus enhancing the robustness of their ensemble. We evaluate our\nframework on three popular datasets, and results show that CoG significantly\nimproves the robustness of graph models against adversarial attacks without\nsacrificing their performance on clean data.

We argue that\nthese dualities are counterparts and generalizations of the familiar\nquantum-quantum (QQ) dualities between pairs of integrable systems. One\nintegrable system from QQ dual pair belongs to the family of inhomogeneous XXZ\nspin chains, while the second to the Calogero-Moser-Ruijsenaars-Schneider\n(CM-RS) family. The wave functions of the Hamiltonian system from CM-RS family\nare known to be related to solutions to (q)KZ equations at the inhomogeneous\nspin chain side.

Such a scheme has two limitations: 1) Storing and running\nseveral networks for different tasks are expensive for typical robotic\nplatforms. 2) The intrinsic structure of separate outputs are ignored and\npotentially violated. To this end, we propose the first transformer\narchitecture that predicts 3D objects and layouts simultaneously, using point\ncloud inputs. Unlike existing methods that either estimate layout keypoints or\nedges, we directly parameterize room layout as a set of quads. As such, the\nproposed architecture is termed as P(oint)Q(uad)-Transformer. Along with the\nnovel quad representation, we propose a tailored physical constraint loss\nfunction that discourages object-layout interference.

A universe where this\ncondition persists forever has no localized excitations. Our own universe\nappears to be headed toward such a state. Within a few hundred times its\ncurrent age it will approach a state where our local group of galaxies sit in\nempty de Sitter space. Eventually, the local group collapse into a black hole,\nwhich evaporates. Localized excitations in de Sitter space are low entropy\nconstrained states of the vacuum ensemble. The origin of these constraints must\nbe in the early universe: the apparent horizon must expand after some initial\nperiod, in a constrained state that is the origin of all localized excitations\nin the universe. We argue that in global FRW coordinates, this corresponds to\nslow roll inflation that ends in a dilute gas of tiny black holes, with mass\ndetermined by the inflationary scale. We then review arguments that these black\nholes can account for the Hot Big Bang, baryogenesis, a distinctive pattern of\nCMB fluctuations, and possibly primordial black hole dark matter consisting of\nlarger black holes that survive until the matter dominated era. The more\ncomplicated question of whether these small black holes can evolve in a way\nthat is consistent with all observational constraints requires computer\nsimulations that have not yet been done.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2021 17:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

Then, we\noffer a framework of these solutions, called universal smart cities decision\nmaking, with three main sections of data capturing, data analysis, and decision\nmaking to optimize the smart mobility within smart cities. With this framework,\nwe elaborate on fundamental concepts of big data, machine learning, and deep\nleaning algorithms that have been applied to smart cities and discuss the role\nof these algorithms in decision making for smart mobility in smart cities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2021 18:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

Aims. We investigated the possible\ndifference in Ba abundance between the primordial (1P) and polluted (2P) stars\nin the Galactic globular cluster (GGC) 47 Tuc (NGC 104). For this, we obtained\nhomogeneous abundances of Fe, Na, and Ba in a sample of 261 red giant branch\n(RGB) stars which is the largest sample used for Na and Ba abundance analysis\nin any GGC so far. Methods. Abundances of Na and Ba were determined using\narchival GIRAFFE/VLT spectra and 1D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE)\nabundance analysis methodology. Results. Contrary to the finding of Gratton et\nal. (2013), we did not detect any significant Ba-Na correlation or 2P-1P Ba\nabundance difference in the sample of 261 RGB stars in 47 Tuc.

In classification tasks with a small number of\nclasses or binary detection (two classes) the amount of information transferred\nfrom the teacher to the student network is restricted, thus limiting the\nutility of knowledge distillation. Performance can be improved by leveraging\ninformation about possible subclasses within the available classes in the\nclassification task. To that end, we propose the so-called Subclass Knowledge\nDistillation (SKD) framework, which is the process of transferring the\nsubclasses' prediction knowledge from a large teacher model into a smaller\nstudent one. Through SKD, additional meaningful information which is not in the\nteacher's class logits but exists in subclasses (e.g., similarities inside\nclasses) will be conveyed to the student and boost its performance.\nMathematically, we measure how many extra information bits the teacher can\nprovide for the student via SKD framework. The framework developed is evaluated\nin clinical application, namely colorectal polyp binary classification. In this\napplication, clinician-provided annotations are used to define subclasses based\non the annotation label's variability in a curriculum style of learning. A\nlightweight, low complexity student trained with the proposed framework\nachieves an F1-score of 85.05%, an improvement of 2.14% and 1.49% gain over the\nstudent that trains without and with conventional knowledge distillation,\nrespectively. These results show that the extra subclasses' knowledge (i.e.,\n0.4656 label bits per training sample in our experiment) can provide more\ninformation about the teacher generalization, and therefore SKD can benefit\nfrom using more information to increase the student performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2021 19:04:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 18:13:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 16:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

If a reaction occurs upon\ncontact, the answer to this question boils down to the classic first-passage\ntime problem: find the time it takes the two molecules to meet. However, this\nis not always the case as molecules switch stochastically between reactive and\nnon-reactive states. The reaction is then said to be \"gated\" by the internal\nstates of the molecules involved which could have a dramatic influence on\nkinetics. A unified, continuous-time, approach to gated reactions on networks\nwas presented in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 018301, 2021]. Here, we build on this\nrecent advancement and develop an analogous discrete-time version of the\ntheory. Similar to continuous-time, we employ a renewal approach to show that\nthe gated reaction time can always be expressed in terms of the corresponding\nungated first-passage and return times; which yields formulas for the\ngenerating function of the gated reaction-time distribution and its\ncorresponding mean and variance. In cases where the mean reaction time\ndiverges, we show that the long-time asymptotics of the gated problem is\ninherited from its ungated counterpart. However, when molecules spend most of\ntheir time non-reactive, an interim regime of slower power-law decay emerges\nprior to the terminal asymptotics. The discretization of time also gives rise\nto resonances and anti-resonances, which were absent from the continuous time\npicture.

Exacerbating this problem is the fact that FL\nexecutions differ significantly from traditional ML with heterogeneous data\ncharacteristics across clients, involving more hyperparameters. In this work,\nwe show that the final test accuracy of FL is dramatically affected by the\nearly phase of the training process, i.e., FL exhibits critical learning\nperiods, in which small gradient errors can have irrecoverable impact on the\nfinal test accuracy. To further explain this phenomenon, we generalize the\ntrace of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to FL and define a new notion\ncalled FedFIM, a quantity reflecting the local curvature of each clients from\nthe beginning of the training in FL. Our findings suggest that the {\\em initial\nlearning phase} plays a critical role in understanding the FL performance.

The formula which I\nwill present uses the famous De-Polignac formula for the $p$-adic valuation of\nthe simple factorial.

In this paper, we propose a framework for implementing batched\ndata-driven evolutionary multi-objective optimization.

Although folded concave\npenalized $M$-estimation with strongly convex loss functions have been well\nstudied, the extant literature on quantile regression is relatively silent.

Recently, many studies have shown that FL is vulnerable to\nmembership inference attacks (MIAs) that can distinguish the training members\nof the given model from the non-members. However, existing MIAs ignore the\nsource of a training member, i.e., the information of which client owns the\ntraining member, while it is essential to explore source privacy in FL beyond\nmembership privacy of examples from all clients. The leakage of source\ninformation can lead to severe privacy issues. For example, identification of\nthe hospital contributing to the training of an FL model for COVID-19 pandemic\ncan render the owner of a data record from this hospital more prone to\ndiscrimination if the hospital is in a high risk region. In this paper, we\npropose a new inference attack called source inference attack (SIA), which can\nderive an optimal estimation of the source of a training member. Specifically,\nwe innovatively adopt the Bayesian perspective to demonstrate that an\nhonest-but-curious server can launch an SIA to steal non-trivial source\ninformation of the training members without violating the FL protocol. The\nserver leverages the prediction loss of local models on the training members to\nachieve the attack effectively and non-intrusively. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on one synthetic and five real datasets to evaluate the key factors\nin an SIA, and the results show the efficacy of the proposed source inference\nattack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 01:09:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

This paper addresses this challenge and proposes a\nprivacy-preserving federated learning framework for ML applications in the AMI.\nWe consider each smart meter as a federated edge device hosting an ML\napplication that exchanges information with a central aggregator or a data\nconcentrator, periodically. Instead of transferring the raw data sensed by the\nsmart meters, the ML model weights are transferred to the aggregator to\npreserve privacy. The aggregator processes these parameters to devise a robust\nML model that can be substituted at each edge device. We also discuss\nstrategies to enhance privacy and improve communication efficiency while\nsharing the ML model parameters, suited for relatively slow network connections\nin the AMI.

Although each of these\nprocesses, namely, magnetic reconnection and coronal condensation have been\nseparately reported, observations that show the whole process of filament\nformation are rare. In this Letter, we present the formation of a sigmoid via\nreconnection between two sets of coronal loops, and the subsequent formation of\na filament through cooling and condensation of plasma inside the newly formed\nsigmoid. On 2014 August 27, a set of loops in the active region 12151\nreconnected with another set of loops that are located to the east. A longer\ntwisted sigmoidal structure and a set of shorter lower-lying loops then formed.\nThe observations coincide well with the tether-cutting model. The newly formed\nsigmoid remains stable and does not erupt as a coronal mass ejection. From the\neastern endpoint, signatures of injection of material into the sigmoid (as\nbrightenings) are detected, which closely outline the features of increasing\nemission measure at these locations. This may indicate the chromospheric\nevaporation caused by reconnection, supplying heated plasma into the sigmoid.\nIn the sigmoid, thermal instability occurs, and rapid cooling and condensation\nof plasma take place, forming a filament. The condensations then flow\nbi-directionally to the filament endpoints.

Specifically, we first propose a\nspatial consistency regularization to focus on reliable and stable\nattribute-related regions. Based on the precise attribute locations, we further\npropose a semantic consistency regularization to extract intrinsic and\ndiscriminative semantic features.

For example, there is a very low correlation between\nhuman scores on fluency and data coverage for the task of structured data to\ntext generation. This suggests that the current recipe of proposing new\nautomatic evaluation metrics for NLG by showing that they correlate well with\nscores assigned by humans for a single criteria (overall quality) alone is\ninadequate. Indeed, our extensive study involving 25 automatic evaluation\nmetrics across 6 different tasks and 18 different evaluation criteria shows\nthat there is no single metric which correlates well with human scores on all\ndesirable criteria, for most NLG tasks.

This hinders\nthe practical use due to millions of items in real-world scenarios. Importance\nsampling is an effective approximation method, based on which the sampled\nsoftmax has been derived.

In this paper, we point out that hidden images, named as visual\nimpressions (VIs), can be explored from the text-only data to enhance dialogue\nunderstanding and help generate better responses. Besides, the semantic\ndependency between an dialogue post and its response is complicated, e.g., few\nword alignments and some topic transitions. Therefore, the visual impressions\nof them are not shared, and it is more reasonable to integrate the response\nvisual impressions (RVIs) into the decoder, rather than the post visual\nimpressions (PVIs).

Specifically,\nwe prove that, for matroid-rank valuations, there does not exist a truthful\nmechanism that is index oblivious, Pareto efficient, and maximin fair.\n  For establishing our results, we develop a characterization of truthful\nmechanisms for matroid-rank functions. This characterization in fact holds for\na broader class of valuations (specifically, holds for binary XOS functions)\nand might be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 09:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

Designed and trained from\ncertain statistical distributions of data, AI's deep neural networks (DNNs)\nremain vulnerable to deceptive inputs that violate a DNN's statistical,\npredictive assumptions. Before being fed into a neural network, however, most\nexisting adversarial examples cannot maintain malicious functionality when\napplied to an affine transformation. For practical purposes, maintaining that\nmalicious functionality serves as an important measure of the robustness of\nadversarial attacks. To help DNNs learn to defend themselves more thoroughly\nagainst attacks, we propose an affine-invariant adversarial attack, which can\nconsistently produce more robust adversarial examples over affine\ntransformations. For efficiency, we propose to disentangle current\naffine-transformation strategies from the Euclidean geometry coordinate plane\nwith its geometric translations, rotations and dilations; we reformulate the\nlatter two in polar coordinates.

The numerical results are compared with\nanalytical as well as with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solutions of\nthe Boltzmann equation. Convergence studies are performed for one-dimensional\nand two-dimensional test-cases. Several further test problems and applications\nillustrate the versatility of the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 09:49:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Compared to adversarial attacks on images,\nperturbations to skeletons are typically bounded to a lower dimension of\napproximately 100 per frame. This lower-dimensional setting makes it more\ndifficult to generate imperceptible perturbations. Existing attacks resolve\nthis by exploiting the temporal structure of the skeleton motion so that the\nperturbation dimension increases to thousands. In this paper, we show that\nadversarial attacks can be performed on skeleton-based action recognition\nmodels, even in a significantly low-dimensional setting without any temporal\nmanipulation. Specifically, we restrict the perturbations to the lengths of the\nskeleton's bones, which allows an adversary to manipulate only approximately 30\neffective dimensions.

Direct solar\nirradiance measurements are only available since 1978. Reconstructions of past\nvariability typically rely on sunspot data. These provide only indirect\ninformation on the facular and network regions, which are decisive contributors\nto irradiance variability on timescales of the solar cycle and longer. Our\nultimate goal is to reconstruct past solar irradiance variations using\nhistorical full-disc Ca II K observations to describe the facular contribution\nindependently of sunspot observations. Here, we develop the method and test it\nextensively by using modern CCD-based Ca II K observations and carry out\ninitial tests on two photographic archives. We employ carefully reduced and\ncalibrated Ca II K images from 13 datasets, such as those from the Meudon, Mt\nWilson, and Rome observatories. We convert them to unsigned magnetograms and\nthen use them as input to the adapted SATIRE model to reconstruct TSI\nvariations over the period 1978-2019, for which direct irradiance measurements\nare available. The reconstructed TSI from the analysed Ca II K archives agrees\nwell with direct TSI measurements and existing reconstructions. The model also\nreturns good results on data taken with different bandpasses and images with\nlow spatial resolution. Historical Ca II K archives suffer from numerous\ninconsistencies, but we show that these archives can still be used to\nreconstruct TSI with reasonable accuracy provided the observations are\naccurately processed. By using the unsigned magnetograms of the Sun\nreconstructed from high-quality Ca II K observations as input into the SATIRE\nmodel, we can reconstruct solar irradiance variations nearly as accurately as\nfrom directly recorded magnetograms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 10:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

To solve this\nproblem, it is proposed to use a digital twin, which will not only solve the\nproblem, but will also help to move to cloud production and the development of\nthe Industry 4.0 direction. Thus, a new problem arises - how to create digital\ntwins of products from polymer composite materials. The analysis makes it\npossible to conclude that the traditional methods of mathematical physics are\nnot suitable for the solution of this problem, since the twins obtained with\ntheir help do not have any properties of adaptability. To solve the problem, it\nis proposed to use deep neural networks one of the most powerful methods of\nmachine learning. This will make it possible to obtain digital twins of\nproducts made of polymer composite materials that can adapt to changes in the\nmodel, environmental conditions and adapt to changes in the indicators of\nsensors and transducers installed on the product.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 10:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

To this\nend, previous work either makes use of auxiliary data at parameter server to\nverify the received gradients (e.g., by computing validation error rate) or\nleverages statistic-based methods (e.g. median and Krum) to identify and remove\nmalicious gradients from Byzantine clients. In this paper, we remark that\nauxiliary data may not always be available in practice and focus on the\nstatistic-based approach. However, recent work on model poisoning attacks has\nshown that well-crafted attacks can circumvent most of median- and\ndistance-based statistical defense methods, making malicious gradients\nindistinguishable from honest ones.

The extracted basis functions are\nthen used to obtain the functional partial quantile regression components and\nestimate the final model. In our proposal, the functional forms of the\ndiscretely observed random variables are first constructed via a\nfinite-dimensional basis function expansion method. The functional partial\nquantile regression constructed using the functional random variables is\napproximated via the partial quantile regression constructed using the basis\nexpansion coefficients. The proposed method uses an iterative procedure to\nextract the partial quantile regression components. A Bayesian information\ncriterion is used to determine the optimum number of retained components. The\nproposed functional partial quantile regression model allows for more than one\nfunctional predictor in the model.

Unfortunately,\nmodern computing systems are not capable of handling large amounts of data\nefficiently. Major concepts and components (e.g., the virtual memory system)\nand predominant execution models (e.g., the processor-centric execution model)\nused in almost all computing systems are designed without having modern\napplications' overwhelming data demand in mind. As a result, accessing, moving,\nand processing large amounts of data faces important challenges in today's\nsystems, making data a first-class concern and a prime performance and energy\nbottleneck in such systems. This thesis studies the root cause of inefficiency\nin modern computing systems when handling modern applications' data demand, and\naims to fundamentally address such inefficiencies, with a focus on two\ndirections. First, we design SIMDRAM, an end-to-end processing-using-DRAM\nframework that aids the widespread adoption of processing-using-DRAM, a\ndata-centric computation paradigm that improves the overall performance and\nefficiency of the system when computing large amounts of data by minimizing the\ncost of data movement and enabling computation where the data resides. Second,\nwe introduce the Virtual Block Interface (VBI), a novel virtual memory\nframework that 1) eliminates the inefficiencies of the conventional virtual\nmemory frameworks when handling the high memory demand in modern applications,\nand 2) is built from the ground up to understand, convey, and exploit data\nproperties, to create opportunities for performance and efficiency\nimprovements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 11:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

WeakSTIL compresses\ntiles of a WSI using a feature extractor pre-trained with self-supervised\nlearning on unlabeled histopathology data and learns to predict precise sTIL%\nscores for each tile in the tumor bed by using a multiple instance learning\nregressor that only requires a weak WSI-level label. By requiring only a weak\nlabel, we overcome the large annotation efforts required to train currently\nexisting TIL detection methods. We show that WeakSTIL is at least as good as\nother TIL detection methods when predicting the WSI-level sTIL% score, reaching\na coefficient of determination of $0.45\\pm0.15$ when compared to scores\ngenerated by an expert pathologist, and an AUC of $0.89\\pm0.05$ when treating\nit as the clinically interesting sTIL-high vs sTIL-low classification task.\nAdditionally, we show that the intermediate tile-level predictions of WeakSTIL\nare highly interpretable, which suggests that WeakSTIL pays attention to latent\nfeatures related to the number of TILs and the tissue type.

Even though adaptivity\ncan improve the modelling of collective phenomena, it often complicates the\nanalysis of the corresponding mathematical models significantly. For\nnon-adaptive systems, a possible way to tackle this problem is by passing to\nso-called continuum or mean-field limits, which describe the system in the\nlimit of infinitely many nodes. Although fully adaptive network dynamic models\nhave been used a lot in recent years in applications, we are still lacking a\ndetailed mathematical theory for large-scale adaptive network limits. For\nexample, continuum limits for static or temporal networks are already\nestablished in the literature for certain models, yet the continuum limit of\nfully adaptive networks has been open so far. In this paper we introduce and\nrigorously justify continuum limits for sequences of adaptive Kuramoto-type\nnetwork models. The resulting integro-differential equations allow us to\nincorporate a large class of co-evolving graphs with high density. Furthermore,\nwe use a very general measure-theoretical framework in our proof for\nrepresenting the (infinite) graph limits, thereby also providing a structural\nbasis to tackle even larger classes of graph limits. As an application of our\ntheory, we consider the continuum limit of an adaptive Kuramoto model directly\nmotivated from neuroscience and studied by Berner et al.~in recent years using\nnumerical techniques and formal stability analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 12:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

These engines rely on algorithms\nthat learn to rank items so as to present an ordered list maximizing the\nprobability that it contains relevant item. The main challenge in the design of\nlearning-to-rank algorithms stems from the fact that queries often have\ndifferent meanings for different users. In absence of any contextual\ninformation about the query, one often has to adhere to the {\\it diversity}\nprinciple, i.e., to return a list covering the various possible topics or\nmeanings of the query. To formalize this learning-to-rank problem, we propose a\nnatural model where (i) items are categorized into topics, (ii) users find\nitems relevant only if they match the topic of their query, and (iii) the\nengine is not aware of the topic of an arriving query, nor of the frequency at\nwhich queries related to various topics arrive, nor of the topic-dependent\nclick-through-rates of the items. For this problem, we devise LDR (Learning\nDiverse Rankings), an algorithm that efficiently learns the optimal list based\non users' feedback only. We show that after $T$ queries, the regret of LDR\nscales as $O((N-L)\\log(T))$ where $N$ is the number of all items. We further\nestablish that this scaling cannot be improved, i.e., LDR is order optimal.\nFinally, using numerical experiments on both artificial and real-world data, we\nillustrate the superiority of LDR compared to existing learning-to-rank\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 12:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

Therefore, we propose a\nsimple, automatic, and novel idea that can scale for Tamil, Sinhala, English\nlanguages, and many documents along with parallel corpora. Since Tamil and\nSinhala are Low-Resource Languages, we improved the performance of Tesseract by\nemploying LSTM-based training on more than 20 legacy fonts to recognize printed\ncharacters in these languages. Especially, our model detects code-mixed text,\nnumbers, and special characters from the printed document. It is shown that\nthis approach can reduce the character-level error rate of Tesseract from 6.03\nto 2.61 for Tamil (-3.42% relative change) and 7.61 to 4.74 for Sinhala (-2.87%\nrelative change), as well as the word-level error rate from 39.68 to 20.61 for\nTamil (-19.07% relative change) and 35.04 to 26.58 for Sinhala (-8.46% relative\nchange) on the test set.

These scenarios cause traditional\nmonocular or stereo odometry to fail. While tracking motion with extra cameras\nshould theoretically prevent failures, it leads to additional complexity and\ncomputational burden. To overcome these challenges, we introduce two novel\nmethods to improve multi-camera feature tracking. First, instead of tracking\nfeatures separately in each camera, we track features continuously as they move\nfrom one camera to another. This increases accuracy and achieves a more compact\nfactor graph representation. Second, we select a fixed budget of tracked\nfeatures across the cameras to reduce back-end optimization time. We have found\nthat using a smaller set of informative features can maintain the same tracking\naccuracy. Our proposed method was extensively tested using a\nhardware-synchronized device consisting of an IMU and four cameras (a front\nstereo pair and two lateral) in scenarios including: an underground mine, large\nopen spaces, and building interiors with narrow stairs and corridors. Compared\nto stereo-only state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry methods, our approach\nreduces the drift rate, relative pose error, by up to 80% in translation and\n39% in rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 13:53:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 10:45:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 13:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

ResNet is built\nupon convolution layers which learn filters to capture local spatial patterns\nalong all the input, then generate feature maps that jointly encode the spatial\nand channel information. Unfortunately, all feature maps in a convolution layer\nare learnt independently (the convolution layer does not exploit the\ndependencies between feature maps) and locally. This problem has first been\ntackled in image processing. A channel attention mechanism, called\nsqueeze-and-excitation (SE), has recently been proposed in convolution layers\nand applied to speaker verification. This mechanism re-weights the information\nextracted across features maps. In this paper, we first propose an original\nqualitative study about the influence and the role of the SE mechanism applied\nto the speaker verification task at different stages of the ResNet, and then\nevaluate several SE architectures.

This series of papers aims at building a new formalism specifically\ntailored to study the impact of turbulence on the global modes of oscillation\nin solar-like stars. This first paper aims at deriving a linear wave equation\nthat directly and consistently contains the turbulence as an input to the\nmodel, and therefore naturally contains the information on the coupling between\nthe turbulence and the modes, through the stochasticity of the equations.\n  Methods. We use a Lagrangian stochastic model of turbulence based on\nProbability Density Function methods to describe the evolution of the\nproperties of individual fluid particles through stochastic differential\nequations. We then transcribe these stochastic differential equations from a\nLagrangian frame to an Eulerian frame, more adapted to the analysis of stellar\noscillations. We combine this method with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics,\nwhere all the mean fields appearing in the Lagrangian stochastic model are\nestimated directly from the set of fluid particles themselves, through the use\nof a weighting kernel function allowing to filter the particles present in any\ngiven vicinity. The resulting stochastic differential equations on Eulerian\nvariables are then linearised.\n  Results. We obtain a stochastic, linear wave equation governing the time\nevolution of the relevant wave variables, while at the same time containing the\neffect of turbulence. The wave equation generalises the classical, unperturbed\npropagation of acoustic waves in a stratified medium to a form that, by\nconstruction, accounts for the impact of turbulence on the mode in a consistent\nway. The effect of turbulence consists in a non-homogeneous forcing term,\nresponsible for the stochastic driving of the mode, and a stochastic\nperturbation to the homogeneous part of the wave equation, responsible for both\nthe damping of the mode and the modal surface effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 13:59:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 06:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach to Learn to Ground visual objects for visual dialog, which\nemploys a novel visual objects grounding mechanism where both prior and\nposterior distributions over visual objects are used to facilitate visual\nobjects grounding. Specifically, a posterior distribution over visual objects\nis inferred from both context (history and questions) and answers, and it\nensures the appropriate grounding of visual objects during the training\nprocess. Meanwhile, a prior distribution, which is inferred from context only,\nis used to approximate the posterior distribution so that appropriate visual\nobjects can be grounded even without answers during the inference process.\nExperimental results on the VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets demonstrate that our\napproach improves the previous strong models in both generative and\ndiscriminative settings by a significant margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 14:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 14:34:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 08:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

Coded caching originally introduced by Maddah-Ali and\nNiesen significantly speeds up communication efficiency by transmitting\nmulticast messages simultaneously useful to multiple users. Most prior works on\ncoded caching are based on the assumption that each user may request all\ncontent in the library. However, in many applications the users are interested\nonly in a limited set of content that depends on their location. Motivated by\nthese considerations, this paper formulates the coded caching problem for\nlocation-based content with edge cache nodes. The considered problem includes a\ncontent server with access to $N$ location-based files (e.g., High-Definition\nmaps), $K$ edge cache nodes located at different regions, and $K$ users (i.e.,\nvehicles) each of which is in the serving region of one cache node and can\nretrieve the cached content of this cache node with negligible cost. Depending\non the location, each user only requests a file from a location-dependent\nsubset of the library. The objective is to minimize the worst-case load. For\nthis novel coded caching problem, we propose a highly non-trivial converse\nbound under uncoded cache placement, which shows that a simple achievable\nscheme is optimal under uncoded cache placement. In addition, this achievable\nscheme is also proved to be generally order optimal within a factor of $3$.\nFinally, we extend the coded caching problem for location-based content to the\nmultiaccess coded caching topology originally proposed by Hachem et al., where\neach user is connected to $L$ nearest cache nodes. When $L \\geq 2$, we\ncharacterize the exact optimality on the worst-case load.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 14:50:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 17:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

We propose the use of several methods that\nprocess the two subtasks either separately or in a joint setting, and we\nevaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for solving the traffic\nevent detection problem. Experimental results indicate that the proposed\narchitectures achieve high performance scores (i.e., more than 95% in terms of\nF$_{1}$ score) on the constructed datasets for both of the subtasks (i.e., text\nclassification and slot filling) even in a transfer learning scenario.

This introduces implicit bias on the recommendation system,\nwhich is referred to as user feedback-loop bias in this paper. We propose a\nsystematic and dynamic way to correct such bias and to obtain more diverse and\nobjective recommendations by utilizing temporal rating information.\nSpecifically, our method includes a deep-learning component to learn each\nuser's dynamic rating history embedding for the estimation of the probability\ndistribution of the items that the user rates sequentially.

By analyzing\nheavier nuclei, $^{90}$ Zr and $^{132}$Sn, we confirm the same conclusions that\nwe have recently drawn for $^{48}$Ca: the inclusion of two particle - two hole\nconfigurations is very effective in our model for providing strengths which are\nsignificantly more quenched than in other theoretical models and, thus, in\nbetter agreement with the experimental measurements. This occurs because two\nparticle - two hole configurations have a density which strongly increases with\nthe excitation energy.

The gradient flow structure of its\ndeterministic counterpart, the thin-film equation, which encodes the balance\nbetween driving capillary and limiting viscous forces, provides the guidance\nfor the thermodynamically consistent introduction of fluctuations.

Here we show that replacing the highly restrictive assumptions of the\nquantization of energy levels in a system with the simpler, less restrictive\npostulate that there exists a threshold in order for energy to be released.\nWith this new postulate, the models of blackbody radiation is shown to be\nconsistent with the experiments. We also show, that the threshold condition\ncontributes to a localized vacuum energy which leads us to conclude that the\nuncertainty principle is a statistical effect. These conditions also naturally\nleads to the prediction that massive particles transition to an ordered state\nat low temperatures. In addition, we show that thermodynamic laws must be\nmodified to include two heat baths with temperatures: $T$ for dissipative\nenergy levels and $T_{V}$ ($\\gg T$) for localized vacuum energy. In total, we\nshow that our threshold postulate agrees with experimental observations of\nblackbody radiation, the uncertainty principle and quantum statistics without\nthe need of the invoking quantum weirdness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 03:56:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 16:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

The partition induces networks, called\nsubnetworks, that are \"smaller\" than the given CRN which, at this point, can be\ncalled parent network. A complex is called a common complex if it occurs in at\nleast two subnetworks in a decomposition. A decomposition is said to be\nincidence independent if the image of the incidence map of the parent network\nis the direct sum of the images of the subnetworks' incidence maps. It has been\nrecently discovered that the complex balanced equilibria of the parent network\nand its subnetworks are fundamentally connected in an incidence independent\ndecomposition. In this paper, we utilized the set of common complexes and a\ndeveloped criterion to investigate decomposition's incidence independence\nproperties. A framework was also developed to analyze decomposition classes\nwith similar structure and incidence independence properties. We identified\ndecomposition classes that can be characterized by their sets of common\ncomplexes and studied their incidence independence. Some of these decomposition\nclasses occur in some biological and chemical models. Finally, a sufficient\ncondition was obtained for the complex balancing of some power law kinetic\n(PLK) systems with incidence independent and complex balanced decompositions.\nThis condition led to a generalization of the Defficiency Zero Theorem for some\nPLK systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 01:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Agility, at\nthe core heart of business strategy, represents the ability to grow in a\ncompetitive environment of continuous and unpredictable changes with\ninformation systems perceived as one of its main enablers. In other words, to\nbe agile, organizations must be able to rely on agile enterprise information\nsystems/information technology (IT/IS). Since, the agility needs are not the\nsame among stakeholders, the objective of this research is to develop a\nconceptual model for the achievement and assessment of IT/IS agility from\nbalanced perspectives to support agile organizations. Several researches have\nindicated that the IT balanced scorecard (BSC) approach is an appropriate\ntechnique for evaluating IT performance. This paper provides a\nbalanced-scorecard based framework to evaluate the IS agility through four\nperspectives: business contribution, user orientation, operation excellence and\ninnovation and competitiveness. The proposed framework, called IS Agility BSC,\npropose a three layer structure for each of the four perspectives: mission, key\nsuccess factors, and agility evaluation criteria. According to this conceptual\nmodel, enterprise information systems agility is measured according to 14\nagility key success factors, over the four BSC Perspectives, using 42 agility\nevaluation criteria that are identified based on literature survey methodology.\nThis paper explores agility in the broader context of the enterprise\ninformation systems. The findings will provide, for both researchers and\npractitioners, a practical approach for achieving and measuring IS agility\nperformance to support organizations in attempt to become agile as a new\ncondition of surviving in the new business world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 14:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

Despite the potential for predictive analytics,\ntwo major barriers exist to their adoption in higher education: (a) the lack of\ndemocratization in deployment, and (b) the potential to exacerbate\ninequalities. Education researchers and policymakers encounter numerous\nchallenges in deploying predictive modeling in practice. These challenges\npresent in different steps of modeling including data preparation, model\ndevelopment, and evaluation. Nevertheless, each of these steps can introduce\nadditional bias to the system if not appropriately performed. Most large-scale\nand nationally representative education data sets suffer from a significant\nnumber of incomplete responses from the research participants. While many\neducation-related studies addressed the challenges of missing data, little is\nknown about the impact of handling missing values on the fairness of predictive\noutcomes in practice. In this paper, we set out to first assess the disparities\nin predictive modeling outcomes for college-student success, then investigate\nthe impact of imputation techniques on the model performance and fairness using\na commonly used set of metrics. We conduct a prospective evaluation to provide\na less biased estimation of future performance and fairness than an evaluation\nof historical data.

However, if the\ninjustice in society is addressed and consequently the upcoming batch of\nobservations is equalized, the model would be less biased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 05:08:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 19:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

Tailoring of geometric confinement\nallows for anomalous dispersion, which in particular enables the formation of\nmicrocombs which can be tuned into the dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) regime.\nDue to processes like soliton-induced dispersive wave generation, broadband DKS\ncombs are particularly sensitive to higher-order dispersion, which in turn is\nsensitive to the ring dimensions at the nanometer-level. For microrings\nexhibiting a rectangular cross section, the ring width and thickness are the\ntwo main control parameters to achieve the targeted dispersion. The former can\nbe easily varied through parameter variation within the lithography mask, yet\nthe latter is defined by the film thickness during growth of the starting\nmaterial stack, and can show a significant variation (few percent of the total\nthickness) over a single wafer. In this letter, we demonstrate that controlled\ndry-etching allows for fine tuning of the device layer (silicon nitride)\nthickness at the wafer level, allowing multi-project wafers targeting different\nwavelength bands, and post-fabrication trimming in air-clad ring devices. We\ndemonstrate that such dry etching does not significantly affect either the\nsilicon nitride surface roughness or the optical quality of the devices,\nthereby enabling fine tuning of the dispersion and the spectral shape of the\nresulting DKS states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 00:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

But these are often intrusive by\ndefinition, and amount to making unjustified assumptions about the data. The\ncontamination problem is also about recognizing the domains of discourses\ninvolved in this, specifying errors and reducing data intrusion relative to\nthem. In this research, weak quasi rough inclusion functions (wqRIFs) are\ngeneralized to general granular operator spaces with scope for limiting\ncontamination. New algebraic operations are defined over collections of such\nfunctions, and are studied by the present author. It is shown by her that the\nalgebras formed by the generalized wqRIFs are ordered hemirings with additional\noperators. By contrast, the generalized rough inclusion functions lack similar\nstructure. This potentially contributes to improving the selection (possibly\nautomatic) of such functions, training methods, and reducing contamination (and\ndata intrusion) in applications. The underlying framework and associated\nconcepts are explained in some detail, as they are relatively new.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2021 20:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}
