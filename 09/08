It is well-known in the streaming code\nliterature, that diagonally embedding codewords of a $[\\tau+1,\\tau+1-a]$\nMaximum Distance Separable (MDS) code within the packet stream, leads to\nrate-optimal streaming codes capable of recovering from $a$ arbitrary packet\nerasures, under a strict decoding delay constraint $\\tau$. Thus MDS codes are\ngeared towards the efficient handling of the worst-case scenario corresponding\nto the occurrence of $a$ erasures. In the present paper, we have an increased\nfocus on the efficient handling of the most-frequent erasure patterns. We study\nstreaming codes which in addition to recovering from $a>1$ arbitrary packet\nerasures under a decoding delay $\\tau$, have the ability to handle the more\ncommon occurrence of a single-packet erasure, while incurring smaller delay\n$r<\\tau$. We term these codes as $(a,\\tau,r)$ locally recoverable streaming\ncodes (LRSCs), since our single-erasure recovery requirement is similar to the\nrequirement of locality in a coded distributed storage system. We characterize\nthe maximum possible rate of an LRSC by presenting rate-optimal constructions\nfor all possible parameters $\\{a,\\tau,r\\}$. Although the rate-optimal LRSC\nconstruction provided in this paper requires large field size, the construction\nis explicit. It is also shown that our $(a,\\tau=a(r+1)-1,r)$ LRSC construction\nprovides the additional guarantee of recovery from the erasure of $h, 1 \\leq h\n\\leq a$, packets, with delay $h(r+1)-1$. The construction thus offers graceful\ndegradation in decoding delay with increasing number of erasures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 16:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

In this respect, superlubricity is known to appear upon formation of\na triboinduced transfer layer, originated by material transfer of graphene\nflakes from the graphitic substrate to the colloidal probe. It was suggested\nthat friction vanishes due to crystalline incommensurability at the sliding\ninterface thus formed. However several details are missing, including the roles\nof tribolayer roughness and of loading conditions. Hereafter we gain deeper\ninsight into the tribological response of micrometric silica beads sliding on\ngraphite under ambient conditions. We show that the tribotransferred flakes\nincrease interfacial roughness from tenths to several nanometers, in fact\ncausing a breakdown of adhesion and friction by one order of magnitude.\nFurthermore, they behave as protruding asperities dissipating mechanical energy\nvia atomic-scale stick-slip instabilities. Remarkably, such contact junctions\ncan undergo a load-driven transition from continuous superlubric sliding to\ndissipative stick-slip, that agrees with the single-asperity Prandtl-Tomlinson\nmodel. Our results indicate that friction at mesoscopic silica-graphite\njunctions depends on the specific energy landscape experienced by the\ntopographically-highest triboinduced nanoasperity.

We compute the magnetic field strength and\nthe resulting spin rate of giant planets, and find that these planets may\npossess dipole magnetic fields of either a few 10 G or a few 100 G; the former\nis the natural outcome of planetary growth and radius evolution, while the\nresulting spin rate cannot reproduce the observations. For the latter, a\nconsistent picture can be drawn, where strong magnetic fields induced by hot\nplanetary interiors lead both to magnetospheric accretion and to spin-down due\nto disk locking. We also compute the properties of circumplanetary disks in the\nvicinity of these planets, taking into account planetary magnetic fields. The\nresulting surface density becomes very low, compared with the canonical models,\nimplying the importance of radial movement of satellite-forming materials.

To fill this gap, we propose a novel adaptive variational Bayes\nframework, which can operate on a collection of models. The proposed framework\nfirst computes a variational posterior over each individual model separately\nand then combines them with certain weights to produce a variational posterior\nover the entire model. It turns out that this combined variational posterior is\nthe closest member to the posterior over the entire model in a predefined\nfamily of approximating distributions. We show that the adaptive variational\nBayes attains optimal contraction rates adaptively under very general\nconditions. In addition, we provide a methodology to maintain the tractability\nand adaptive optimality of the adaptive variational Bayes even in the presence\nof an enormous number of individual models, such as sparse models. We apply the\ngeneral results to several examples, including deep learning and sparse factor\nmodels, and derive new and adaptive inference results.

Unfortunately, despite eliminating the\nneed of text, the units used in GSLM discard most of the prosodic information.\nHence, GSLM fails to leverage prosody for better comprehension, and does not\ngenerate expressive speech. In this work, we present a prosody-aware generative\nspoken language model (pGSLM).

We devise a series of metrics for prosody modeling and generation,\nand re-use metrics from GSLM for content modeling.

Wireless\nnetworks-on-chips (WNoCs) are a candidate technology to improve inter-core\ncommunication on chips but current proposals are plagued by a dilemma: either\nthe received signal is weak, or it is significantly reverberated such that the\non-off-keying modulation speed must be throttled. Here, we overcome this vexing\nproblem by endowing the wireless on-chip environment with in situ\nprogrammability which allows us to shape the channel impulse response (CIR);\nthereby, we can impose a pulse-like CIR shape despite strong multipath\npropagation and without entailing a reduced received signal strength. First, we\ndesign and characterize a programmable metasurface suitable for integration in\nthe on-chip environment (\"on-chip reconfigurable intelligent surface\"). Second,\nwe optimize its configuration to equalize selected wireless on-chip channels\n\"over the air\". Third, by conducting a rigorous communication analysis, we\nevidence the feasibility of significantly higher modulation speeds with shaped\nCIRs.

In these settings, schedules often need to be adapted in\nreal-time by dispatching rules. Although substantial progress was made until\nthe '90s, the performance of these rules is still rather limited. The machine\nlearning literature is developing a variety of methods to improve them, but the\nresulting rules are difficult to interpret and do not generalise well for a\nwide range of settings. This paper is the first major attempt at combining\nmachine learning with domain problem reasoning for scheduling. The idea\nconsists of using the insights obtained with the latter to guide the empirical\nsearch of the former. Our hypothesis is that this guided empirical learning\nprocess should result in dispatching rules that are effective and interpretable\nand which generalise well to different instance classes. We test our approach\nin the classical dynamic job shop scheduling problem minimising tardiness,\nwhich is one of the most well-studied scheduling problems.

Numerical simulations of this\nprocess have been used to propose scalings of characteristic dust gap\nwidth/gap-ring distance with respect to planet mass. Applying such scalings to\nanalyze observed gap samples yields a continuous mass distribution for a rich\npopulation of hypothetical planets in the range of several Earth to Jupiter\nmasses. In contrast, the conventional core-accretion scenario of planet\nformation predicts a bi-modal mass function due to 1) the onset of runaway gas\naccretion above \\sim20 Earth masses and 2) suppression of accretion induced by\ngap opening. Here we examine the dust disk response to the tidal perturbation\nof eccentric planets as a possible resolution of this paradox. Based on\nsimulated gas and dust distributions, we show the gap-ring separation of\nNeptune-mass planets with small eccentricities might become comparable to that\ninduced by Saturn-mass planets on circular orbits. This degeneracy may\nobliterate the discrepancy between the theoretical bi-modal mass distribution\nand the observed continuous gap width distribution. Despite damping due to\nplanet-disk interaction, modest eccentricity may be sustained either in the\nouter regions of relatively thick disks or through resonant excitation among\nmultiple super Earths.

By focusing on the TLS cost, our second contribution is to exploit\nsparsity in the POP and propose a sparse semidefinite programming (SDP)\nrelaxation that is much smaller than the standard Lasserre's hierarchy while\npreserving empirical exactness, i.e., the SDP recovers the optimizer of the\nnonconvex POP with an optimality certificate.

We investigate this question by studying the type III radio bursts\nthat the nanoflares may produce on closed loops. The characteristic\nfrequency-drifts that type III bursts exhibit can be detected using a novel\napplication of the time-lag technique developed by Viall & Klimchuk (2012) even\nwhen there are multiple overlapping bursts. We present a simple numerical model\nthat simulates the expected radio emission from nanoflares in an active region\n(AR), which we use to test and calibrate the technique.

We also find that the\nsignature of bursts in the time-lag signal diminishes as: (1)the variety of\nparticipating loops within that range increases; (2)the occurrence rate of\nbursts increases; (3) the duration of bursts increases; and (4) the brightness\nof the bursts decreases relative to noise.

The spectrum is dominated by a\nnumber of broad emission features including the [FeII] at 1.644mu which is\nhighly asymmetric with a tilted top and a peak red-shifted by ~2,000km/s. In\ncomparison with 2-D non-LTE synthetic spectra computed from 3-D simulations of\noff-center delayed-detonation Chandrasekhar-mass white-dwarf(WD) models, we\nfind good agreement between the observed lines and the synthetic profiles, and\nare able to unravel the structure of the progenitor's envelope. We find that\nthe size and tilt of the [Fe II] 1.644mu-profile (in velocity space) is an\neffective way to determine the location of an off-center delayed-detonation\ntransition (DDT) and the viewing angle, and it requires a WD with a high\ncentral density of ~4E9$g/cm^3$. We also tentatively identify a stable Ni\nfeature around 1.9mu characterized by a `pot-belly' profile that is slightly\noffset with respect to the kinematic center. In the case of\nSN~2020qxp/ASASSN-20jq, we estimate that the location of the DDT is ~0.3M(WD)\noff-center, which gives rise to an asymmetric distribution of the underlying\nejecta. We also demonstrate that low-luminosity and high-density WD SNIa\nprogenitors exhibit a very strong overlap of Ca and 56Ni in physical space.\nThis results in the formation of a prevalent [Ca II] 0.73mu emission feature,\nwhich is sensitive to asymmetry effects.

This goal is formulated as satisfying two\nobjectives: maximizing utility for predicting a target attribute while\nsimultaneously being invariant (independent) to a known semantic attribute.\nSolutions to invariant representation learning (IRepL) problems lead to a\ntrade-off between utility and invariance when they are competing. While\nexisting works study bounds on this trade-off, two questions remain\noutstanding: 1) What is the exact trade-off between utility and invariance? and\n2) What are the encoders (mapping the data to a representation) that achieve\nthe trade-off, and how can we estimate it from training data? This paper\naddresses these questions for IRepLs in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces\n(RKHS)s. Under the assumption that the distribution of a low-dimensional\nprojection of high-dimensional data is approximately normal, we derive a\nclosed-form solution for the global optima of the underlying optimization\nproblem for encoders in RKHSs.

However, these methods overlook the fact that\nthe input image sequence includes not only the action of interest but\nbackground and irrelevant actions. This would induce recurrent units to\naccumulate unnecessary information for encoding features on the action of\ninterest. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel recurrent unit, named\nInformation Discrimination Unit (IDU), which explicitly discriminates the\ninformation relevancy between an ongoing action and others to decide whether to\naccumulate the input information. This enables learning more discriminative\nrepresentations for identifying an ongoing action. In this paper, we further\npresent a new recurrent unit, called Information Integration Unit (IIU), for\naction anticipation. Our IIU exploits the outputs from IDU as pseudo action\nlabels as well as RGB frames to learn enriched features of observed actions\neffectively.

However, two issues remain\nto be settled. The first is dense text case, which is easy to be neglected but\nquite practical. There may exist multiple instances in one proposal, which\nmakes it difficult for the mask head to distinguish different instances and\ndegrades the performance. In this work, we argue that the performance\ndegradation results from the learning confusion issue in the mask head. We\npropose to use an MLP decoder instead of the \"deconv-conv\" decoder in the mask\nhead, which alleviates the issue and promotes robustness significantly. And we\npropose instance-aware mask learning in which the mask head learns to predict\nthe shape of the whole instance rather than classify each pixel to text or\nnon-text. With instance-aware mask learning, the mask branch can learn\nseparated and compact masks. The second is that due to large variations in\nscale and aspect ratio, RPN needs complicated anchor settings, making it hard\nto maintain and transfer across different datasets. To settle this issue, we\npropose an adaptive label assignment in which all instances especially those\nwith extreme aspect ratios are guaranteed to be associated with enough anchors.\nEquipped with these components, the proposed method named MAYOR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks including DAST1500, MSRA-TD500,\nICDAR2015, CTW1500, and Total-Text.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 04:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

Quantum error correction is promising but requires an extensive\nnumber (e.g., over 1,000) of physical qubits to create one \"perfect\" qubit,\nexceeding the capacity of the existing quantum computers. This paper aims to\ntackle the noise issue from another angle: instead of creating perfect qubits\nfor general quantum algorithms, we investigate the potential to mitigate the\nnoise issue for dedicate algorithms. Specifically, this paper targets quantum\nneural network (QNN), and proposes to learn the errors in the training phase,\nso that the identified QNN model can be resilient to noise. As a result, the\nimplementation of QNN needs no or a small number of additional physical qubits,\nwhich is more realistic for the near-term quantum computers. To achieve this\ngoal, an application-specific compiler is essential: on the one hand, the error\ncannot be learned if the mapping from logical qubits to physical qubits exists\nrandomness; on the other hand, the compiler needs to be efficient so that the\nlengthy training procedure can be completed in a reasonable time. In this\npaper, we utilize the recent QNN framework, QuantumFlow, as a case study.\nExperimental results show that the proposed approach can optimize QNN models\nfor different errors in qubits, achieving up to 28% accuracy improvement\ncompared with the model obtained by the error-agnostic training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 04:43:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 20:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

With the rise of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), researchers have started to utilize machine learning models\nto forecast travel demand, which, in many cases, can produce higher prediction\naccuracy than statistical models. However, most existing machine-learning\nstudies used a global model to predict the demand and ignored the influence of\nspatial heterogeneity (i.e., the spatial variations in the impacts of\nexplanatory variables). Spatial heterogeneity can drive the parameter\nestimations varying over space; failing to consider the spatial variations may\nlimit the model's prediction performance. To account for spatial heterogeneity,\nthis study proposes a Clustering-aided Ensemble Method (CEM) to forecast the\nzone-to-zone (census-tract-to-census-tract) travel demand for ridesourcing\nservices.

Specifically, existing convergence proofs\nrequire that the measurement noise is a zero-mean i.i.d\\ sequence or a\nmartingale difference sequence. In the present paper, we permit biased\nmeasurements, that is, measurement noises that have nonzero conditional mean.\nAlso, all convergence results to date assume that the stochastic step sizes\nsatisfy a probabilistic analog of the well-known Robbins-Monro conditions. We\nreplace this assumption by a purely deterministic condition on the\nirreducibility of the underlying Markov processes.\n  As specific applications to Reinforcement Learning, we analyze the temporal\ndifference algorithm $TD(\\lambda)$ for value iteration, and the $Q$-learning\nalgorithm for finding the optimal action-value function. In both cases, we\nestablish the convergence of these algorithms, under milder conditions than in\nthe existing literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 06:06:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 15:27:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 16:44:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 08:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

A\nnew sequential optimization problem, referred to as Area Prioritized Power Flow\n(APPF), is formulated to model this prioritization. It is shown that compared\nto conventional power flow APPF not only leads to a fairer balance between the\ndispatch of active and reactive power from the IBRs and the synchronous\ngenerators, but also limits the impact of any contingency from spreading out\nbeyond its respective control area, thereby guaranteeing a better collective\ndynamic performance of the grid.

Another key parameter for\ntuning the attractive material properties is the species that terminate the\nsurfaces of the MX-layers. Although being an important parameter, experimental\nstudies on the bonding between the MX-layers and the termination species are\nfew and thus an interesting subject of investigation. Here we show that the\ntermination species fluorine (F) bonds to the Ti3C2-surface mainly through Ti\n3p - F 2p hybridization and that oxygen (O) bonds through Ti 3p - O 2p\nhybridization with a significant contribution of Ti 3d and Ti 4p. The study\nfurther shows that the Ti3C2-surface is not only terminated by F and O on the\nthreefold hollow face-centered-cubic (fcc) site. A significant amount of O sits\non a bridge site bonded to two Ti surface atoms on the Ti3C2-surface.

On the contrary, the comparison of the valence band intensity\ndistribution obtained through ultraviolet- and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\nwith computed spectra by density of states, weighed by matrix elements and\nsensitivity factors, reveals that OH cannot be considered as an inherent\ntermination species in Ti3C2Tx.

The results are evaluated on\nthe test subset solely, without any knowledge about the ground truth, yielding\nunbiased, overfit free and therefore relevant validation for robot localization\nbased on cameras, 3D laser or combination of both. However, as any sensor\nsetup, it requires prior calibration and rectified stereo images are provided,\nintroducing dependence on the default calibration parameters. Given that, a\nnatural question arises if a better set of calibration parameters can be found\nthat would yield higher odometry accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new\napproach for one shot calibration of the KITTI dataset multiple camera setup.\nThe approach yields better calibration parameters, both in the sense of lower\ncalibration reprojection errors and lower visual odometry error. We conducted\nexperiments where we show for three different odometry algorithms, namely\nSOFT2, ORB-SLAM2 and VISO2, that odometry accuracy is significantly improved\nwith the proposed calibration parameters. Moreover, our odometry, SOFT2, in\nconjunction with the proposed calibration method achieved the highest accuracy\non the official KITTI scoreboard with 0.53% translational and 0.0009 deg/m\nrotational error, outperforming even 3D laser-based methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 07:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

Empirical Bayes is attractive in such settings,\nbut standard parametric approaches rest on assumptions about the form of the\nprior distribution which can be hard to justify and which introduce unnecessary\ntuning parameters. We extend the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator\n(NPMLE) for Gaussian location mixture densities to allow for multivariate,\nheteroscedastic errors. NPMLEs estimate an arbitrary prior by solving an\ninfinite-dimensional, convex optimization problem; we show that this convex\noptimization problem can be tractably approximated by a finite-dimensional\nversion. We introduce a dual mixture density whose modes contain the atoms of\nevery NPMLE, and we leverage the dual both to show non-uniqueness in\nmultivariate settings as well as to construct explicit bounds on the support of\nthe NPMLE.\n  The empirical Bayes posterior means based on an NPMLE have low regret,\nmeaning they closely target the oracle posterior means one would compute with\nthe true prior in hand. We prove an oracle inequality implying that the\nempirical Bayes estimator performs at nearly the optimal level (up to\nlogarithmic factors) for denoising without prior knowledge.

In this\npaper, we extend X-ray reverberation studies into the super-Eddington accretion\nregime, focusing on investigating the lags in the Fe K{\\alpha} line region. We\nfind that the coronal photons are mostly reflected by the fast and optically\nthick winds launched from super-Eddington accretion flow, and this funnel-like\nreflection geometry produces lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra with unique\ncharacteristics. The lag-frequency spectra exhibits a step-function like\ndecline near the first zero-crossing point.

The second component is a representation learning\nthat guarantees three properties: 1) domain-transferability by prototype\ntriplet loss, 2) discriminant by conditional maximum mean discrepancy loss, and\n3) completeness by multi-view reconstruction loss. Particularly, we propose a\ndomain translator and align the heterogeneous data to the estimated class\nprototypes (i.e., class centers) in a hyper-sphere manifold. Experiments on\ncross-site severity assessment of COVID-19 from CT images show that the\nproposed method can effectively tackle the imbalanced learning problem and\noutperform recent DA approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 07:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

Due to the ultra-low transmission power and long transmission\nduration, LPWAN devices inevitably suffer from high power Cross Technology\nInterference (CTI), such as interference from Wi-Fi, coexisting in the same\nspectrum. To alleviate this issue, this paper introduces the Partial Symbol\nRecovery (PSR) scheme for improving the CTI resilience of LPWAN. We verify our\nidea on LoRa, a widely adopted LPWAN technique, as a proof of concept. At the\nPHY layer, although CTI has much higher power, its duration is relatively\nshorter compared with LoRa symbols, leaving part of a LoRa symbol uncorrupted.\nMoreover, due to its high redundancy, LoRa chips within a symbol are highly\ncorrelated. This opens the possibility of detecting a LoRa symbol with only\npart of the chips. By examining the unique frequency patterns in LoRa symbols\nwith time-frequency analysis, our design effectively detects the clean LoRa\nchips that are free of CTI. This enables PSR to only rely on clean LoRa chips\nfor successfully recovering from communication failures. We evaluate our PSR\ndesign with real-world testbeds, including SX1280 LoRa chips and USRP B210,\nunder Wi-Fi interference in various scenarios. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our design offers reliable packet recovery performance,\nsuccessfully boosting the LoRa packet reception ratio from 45.2% to 82.2% with\na performance gain of 1.8 times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 08:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

When producing the translation\nequivalent of the small cat, speakers of German or Dutch select the\ngender-marked determiner at a relatively early stage of production. Speakers of\nFrench or Italian postpone the encoding of a determiner or adjective until the\nphonological form of the noun is available. Hence, even though the words are\nproduced in the same order (e.g., die kleine Katze in German, le petit chat in\nFrench), they are not planned in the same order and might require different\namounts of advanced planning prior to production onset. This distinction\nbetween early and late selection languages was proposed to account for the\nobservation that speakers of Germanic and Slavic languages, but not of Romance\nlanguages, are slower to name pictures in the context of a distractor word of a\ndifferent gender. Meta-analyses are conducted to provide the first direct test\nof this cross-linguistic difference and to test a prediction of the late\nselection hypothesis. They confirm the existence of the gender congruency\neffect in German/Slavic languages and its absence in Romance languages when\ntarget and distractor words are presented simultaneously. They do not allow\nconfirming the hypothesis that in the latter languages, a similar effect\nemerges when the presentation of the distractor is delayed. Overall, these\nanalyses confirm the cross-linguistic difference but show that the evidence\navailable to date is not sufficient to confirm or reject the late selection\nhypothesis as an explanation of this difference.

Investigating how the morphology of\nthe jet's synchrotron emission depends on the magnetic nature of the jet's\nrelativistic plasma is fundamental to the comparison between numerical\nsimulations and the observed polarization of relativistic jets. Through the use\nof 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) jet simulations (computed using\nthe PLUTO code) we study how the jet's synchrotron emission depends upon the\nmorphology of the jet's magnetic field structure. Through the application of\npolarized radiative transfer and ray-tracing (via the RADMC-3D code) we create\nsynthetic radio maps of the jet's total intensity as well as the linearly and\ncircularly polarized intensity for each jet simulation. In particular, we\ncreate synthetic ray-traced images of the jet's polarized synchrotron emission\nwhen the jet carries a predominantly poloidal, helical, and toroidal magnetic\nfield. We also explore several scaling relations in which the underlying\nelectron power-law distribution is set proportional to: (i) the jet's thermal\nplasma density, (ii) the jet's internal energy density, and (iii) the jet's\nmagnetic energy density. We find that: (i) the jet emission is edge brightened\nwhen the magnetic field is toroidal in nature and spine brightened when the\nmagnetic field is poloidal in nature, (ii) the circularly polarized emission\nexhibits both negative and positive signs for the toroidal magnetic field\nmorphology at an inclination of 45{\\deg} as well as 5{\\deg}, and (iii) the\nrelativistic jet's emission is largely independent of different emission\nscaling relations when the ambient medium is excluded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 09:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

The study contributes to further our understanding\nof the discrepancies between existing numerical and experimental BARC data. In\na first part, rounded LE corners with small curvature radii are considered.\nResults show that a small amount of rounding does not lead to abrupt changes of\nthe mean fields, but that the effects increase with the curvature radius. The\nshear layer separates from the rounded LE at a lower angle, which reduces the\nsize of the main recirculating region over the cylinder side. In contrast, the\nlongitudinal size of the recirculating region behind the trailing edge (TE)\nincreases, as the TE shear layer is accelerated. The effect of the curvature\nradii on the turbulent kinetic energy and on its production, dissipation and\ntransport are addressed. The present results should be contrasted with the\nrecent work of Rocchio et al, JWEIA 2020, who found via implicit Large-Eddy\nSimulations at larger Reynolds numbers than even a small curvature radius leads\nto significant changes of the mean flow.\n  In a second part, the LE corners are fully sharp and the exact analytical\nsolution of the Stokes problem in the neighborhood of the corner is used to\nlocally restore the solution accuracy degraded by the singularity. Changes in\nthe mean flow reveal that the analytical correction leads to streamlines that\nbetter follow the corners. The flow separates from the LE with a lower angle,\nresulting in a slightly smaller recirculating region. The corner-correction\napproach is valuable in general, and is expected to help developing\nhigh-quality numerical simulations at the high Reynolds numbers typical of the\nexperiments with reasonable meshing requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 09:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

In contrast,\nbiological neural networks (BNNs) can adapt to various new tasks by continually\nupdating the neural connections based on the inputs, which is aligned with the\nparadigm of learning effective learning rules in addition to static parameters,\ne.g., meta-learning. Among various biologically inspired learning rules,\nHebbian plasticity updates the neural network weights using local signals\nwithout the guide of an explicit target function, thus enabling an agent to\nlearn automatically without human efforts. However, typical plastic ANNs using\na large amount of meta-parameters violate the nature of the genomics bottleneck\nand potentially deteriorate the generalization capacity. This work proposes a\nnew learning paradigm decomposing those connection-dependent plasticity rules\ninto neuron-dependent rules thus accommodating $\\Theta(n^2)$ learnable\nparameters with only $\\Theta(n)$ meta-parameters.

Contrastive Learning (CL) is\none of the most popular paradigms to address this challenge, which trains GNNs\nby discriminating positive and negative node pairs. Despite the success of\nrecent CL methods, there are still two under-explored problems. First, how to\nreduce the semantic error introduced by random topology based data\naugmentations. Traditional CL defines positive and negative node pairs via the\nnode-level topological proximity, which is solely based on the graph topology\nregardless of the semantic information of node attributes, and thus some\nsemantically similar nodes could be wrongly treated as negative pairs. Second,\nhow to effectively model the multiplexity of the real-world graphs, where nodes\nare connected by various relations and each relation could form a homogeneous\ngraph layer. To solve these problems, we propose a novel multiplex\nheterogeneous graph prototypical contrastive leaning (X-GOAL) framework to\nextract node embeddings. X-GOAL is comprised of two components: the GOAL\nframework, which learns node embeddings for each homogeneous graph layer, and\nan alignment regularization, which jointly models different layers by aligning\nlayer-specific node embeddings. Specifically, the GOAL framework captures the\nnode-level information by a succinct graph transformation technique, and\ncaptures the cluster-level information by pulling nodes within the same\nsemantic cluster closer in the embedding space.

In such a\nmonocular setup, dense depth is obtained with either additional input from one\nor several expensive LiDARs, e.g., with 64 beams, or camera-only methods, which\nsuffer from scale-ambiguity and infinite-depth problems. In this paper, we\npropose a new alternative of densely estimating metric depth by combining a\nmonocular camera with a light-weight LiDAR, e.g., with 4 beams, typical of\ntoday's automotive-grade mass-produced laser scanners. Inspired by recent\nself-supervised methods, we introduce a novel framework, called LiDARTouch, to\nestimate dense depth maps from monocular images with the help of ``touches'' of\nLiDAR, i.e., without the need for dense ground-truth depth. In our setup, the\nminimal LiDAR input contributes on three different levels: as an additional\nmodel's input, in a self-supervised LiDAR reconstruction objective function,\nand to estimate changes of pose (a key component of self-supervised depth\nestimation architectures). Our LiDARTouch framework achieves new state of the\nart in self-supervised depth estimation on the KITTI dataset, thus supporting\nour choices of integrating the very sparse LiDAR signal with other visual\nfeatures. Moreover, we show that the use of a few-beam LiDAR alleviates scale\nambiguity and infinite-depth issues that camera-only methods suffer from.

Here, we investigate how drifting and\nevaporating pebbles that enrich the gas phase of the disk influence the\nchemical composition of growing and migrating gas giants. To achieve this goal,\nwe perform semi analytical 1D models of protoplanetary disks including viscous\nevolution, pebble drift and evaporation to simulate the growth of planets from\nplanetary embryos to Jupiter mass objects by the accretion of pebbles and gas\nwhile they migrate through the disk. The gas phase of the protoplanetary disk\nis enriched due to the evaporation of inward drifting pebbles crossing\nevaporation lines, leading to the accretion of large amounts of volatiles into\nthe planetary atmosphere. As a consequence, gas accreting planets are enriched\nin volatiles (C, O, N) compared to refractories (e.g., Mg, Si, Fe) by up to a\nfactor of 100, depending on the chemical species, its exact abundance and\nvolatility as well as the disk's viscosity. A simplified model for the\nformation of Jupiter reveals that its nitrogen content can be explained by\ninward diffusing nitrogen rich vapor, implying that Jupiter does not need to\nform close to the N2 evaporation front as indicated by previous simulations.\nHowever, our model predicts a too low oxygen abundance for Jupiter, implying\neither Jupiter's migration across the water ice line or an additional accretion\nof solids into the atmosphere, which can also increase Jupiter's carbon\nabundance. The accretion of solids will increase the refractory to volatile\nratio in planetary atmospheres substantially.

The Delay-And-Sum (DAS)\nalgorithm forms images using the main path on which reflected signals travel\nback to the transducers. In some applications, different insonification paths\ncan be considered, for instance by placing the transducers at different\nlocations or if strong reflectors inside the medium are known a-priori. These\ndifferent modes give rise to multiple DAS images reflecting different geometric\ninformation about the scatterers and the challenge is to either fuse them into\none image or to directly extract higher-level information regarding the\nmaterials of the medium, e.g., a segmentation map. Traditional image fusion\ntechniques typically use ad-hoc combinations of pre-defined image transforms,\npooling operations and thresholding. In this work, we propose a deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) architecture that directly maps all available data to a\nsegmentation map while explicitly incorporating the DAS image formation for the\ndifferent insonification paths as network layers.

However, as the production complexity increases, the cognitive\nresources demand and mental workload could compromise the operator's\nperformance and the efficiency of the shop floor workplace. State-of-the-art\nmethods in cognitive science work offline and/or involve bulky equipment hardly\ndeployable in industrial settings. This paper presents a novel method for\nonline assessment of cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly, by\ndetecting patterns in human motion directly from the input images of a stereo\ncamera. Head pose estimation and skeleton tracking are exploited to investigate\nthe workers' attention and assess hyperactivity and unforeseen movements. Pilot\nexperiments suggest that our factor assessment tool provides significant\ninsights into workers' mental workload, even confirmed by correlations with\nphysiological and performance measurements. According to data gathered in this\nstudy, a vision-based cognitive load assessment has the potential to be\nintegrated into the development of mechatronic systems for improving cognitive\nergonomics in manufacturing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 13:19:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 07:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

In the presence of\ncompeting events, various statistical estimands have been suggested for\ndefining the causal effect of treatment on the event of interest. Depending on\nthe estimand, the competing events are either accommodated or eliminated,\nresulting in causal effects with different interpretation. The former approach\ncaptures the total effect of treatment on the event of interest while the\nlatter approach captures the direct effect of treatment on the event of\ninterest that is not mediated by the competing event. Separable effects have\nalso been defined for settings where the treatment effect can be partitioned\ninto its effect on the event of interest and its effect on the competing event\nthrough different causal pathways. We outline various causal effects that may\nbe of interest in the presence of competing events, including total, direct and\nseparable effects, and describe how to obtain estimates using regression\nstandardisation with the Stata command standsurv. Regression standardisation is\napplied by obtaining the average of individual estimates across all individuals\nin a study population after fitting a survival model. With standsurv several\ncontrasts of interest can be calculated including differences, ratios and other\nuser-defined functions. Confidence intervals can also be obtained using the\ndelta method.

However, the dominant process in the release of these\nCOMs from the icy grains - where they predominately form - to the gas phase is\nstill an open question. We investigate the origin of COM emission in a\nprotostellar source, CygX-N30, through high-angular-resolution interferometric\nobservations over a continuous broad frequency range. We used 32 GHz\nSubmillimeter Array observations with continuous frequency coverage from 329 to\n361 GHz at an angular resolution of ~1\" to do a line survey and obtain a\nchemical inventory of the source. The line emission was used to determine\ncolumn densities and excitation temperatures for the COMs. We mapped out the\nintensity distribution of the different species and identified approximately\n400 lines that can be attributed to 29 different molecular species and their\nisotopologues. We find that the molecular peak emission is along a linear\ngradient, coinciding with the axis of red- and blueshifted H2CO and CS\nemission. Chemical differentiation is detected along this gradient, with the\nO-bearing molecular species peaking towards one component of the system and the\nN- and S-bearing species peaking towards the other. The inferred column\ndensities and excitation temperatures are compared to other sources where COMs\nare abundant. The origin of the observed COM emission is probably a combination\nof the young stellar sources along with accretion of infalling material onto a\ndisc-like structure surrounding a young protostar. The low D/H ratio observed\n(<0.1%) likely reflects a pre-stellar phase where COMs formed on the ices at\nwarm temperatures (~ 30 K), with inefficient deuterium fractionation. The\nobservations and results presented here demonstrate the importance of good\nfrequency coverage and high angular resolution when disentangling the origin of\nCOM emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 13:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

Many DA approaches aim at expanding the\nsupport of the empirical data distribution by generating new sentence pairs\nthat contain infrequent words, thus making it closer to the true data\ndistribution of parallel sentences. In this paper, we propose to follow a\ncompletely different approach and present a multi-task DA approach in which we\ngenerate new sentence pairs with transformations, such as reversing the order\nof the target sentence, which produce unfluent target sentences. During\ntraining, these augmented sentences are used as auxiliary tasks in a multi-task\nframework with the aim of providing new contexts where the target prefix is not\ninformative enough to predict the next word. This strengthens the encoder and\nforces the decoder to pay more attention to the source representations of the\nencoder. Experiments carried out on six low-resource translation tasks show\nconsistent improvements over the baseline and over DA methods aiming at\nextending the support of the empirical data distribution. The systems trained\nwith our approach rely more on the source tokens, are more robust against\ndomain shift and suffer less hallucinations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 13:39:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

Within the scope of this paper, the overall concept of a novel\nsimulation-based toolchain for the development and testing of ADS-equipped\nvehicles in urban environments is presented.

Based on derived requirements, a thorough explanation of\ndifferent modules constituting the toolchain is given, showing first results\nand identified research gaps, respectively.

We additionally derive [O III]+H$\\beta$\nequivalent widths (that fall in the observed K band) by including nebular\nemission in the SED fitting. After removing foreground contaminants, we report\nthe discovery of 11 new candidate LyC leakers, with absolute LyC escape\nfractions, $f_{\\rm{esc}}$ in the range $0.14-0.85$. From non-detections, we\nplace $1\\sigma$ upper limits of $f_{\\rm{esc}}<0.12$, where the Lyman-break\nselected galaxies have $f_{\\rm{esc}} < 0.11$ and `blindly' discovered galaxies\nwith no prior photometric selection have $f_{\\rm{esc}}<0.13$. We find a\nslightly higher $1\\sigma$ limit of $f_{\\rm{esc}}<0.20$ for extreme emission\nline galaxies with rest-frame [O III]+H$\\beta$ equivalent widths $>300$A. For\ncandidate LyC leakers, we find a weak negative correlation between\n$f_{\\rm{esc}}$ and galaxy stellar masses, no correlation between $f_{\\rm{esc}}$\nspecific star-formation rates (sSFRs) and a positive correlation between\n$f_{\\rm{esc}}$ and EW$_0$([O III]+H$\\beta$). The weak/no correlations between\nstellar mass and sSFRs may be explained by misaligned viewing angles and/or\nnon-coincident timescales of starburst activity and periods of high\n$f_{\\rm{esc}}$. Alternatively, escaping radiation may predominantly occur in\nhighly localised star-forming regions, or $f_{\\rm{esc}}$ measurements may be\nimpacted by stochasticity of the intervening neutral medium, obscuring any\nglobal trends with galaxy properties.

Despite the tremendous accomplishments of machine\nlearning and deep learning methods, many challenges still remain. In\nparticular, the performance of machine learning methods is often severely\naffected in case of diverse data, usually associated with smaller data sets or\ndata related to areas of study where the size of the data sets is constrained\nby the complexity and/or high cost of experiments. Moreover, data with limited\nlabeled samples is a challenge to most learning approaches. In this paper, the\naforementioned challenges are addressed by integrating graph-based frameworks,\nmultiscale structure, modified and adapted optimization procedures and\nsemi-supervised techniques. This results in two innovative multiscale Laplacian\nlearning (MLL) approaches for machine learning tasks, such as data\nclassification, and for tackling diverse data, data with limited samples and\nsmaller data sets. The first approach, called multikernel manifold learning\n(MML), integrates manifold learning with multikernel information and solves a\nregularization problem consisting of a loss function and a warped kernel\nregularizer using multiscale graph Laplacians. The second approach, called the\nmultiscale MBO (MMBO) method, introduces multiscale Laplacians to a\nmodification of the famous classical Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme, and\nmakes use of fast solvers for finding the approximations to the extremal\neigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. We demonstrate the performance of our\nmethods experimentally on a variety of data sets, such as biological, text and\nimage data, and compare them favorably to existing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 15:25:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

Our\nprocedure considers quantile-based cross-spectral features and consists of\nthree stages: (i) each element is characterized by a vector of proper estimates\nof the quantile cross-spectral densities, (ii) principal component analysis is\ncarried out to capture the main differences reducing the effects of the noise,\nand (iii) the squared Euclidean distance between the first retained principal\ncomponents is used to perform clustering through the standard fuzzy C-means and\nfuzzy C-medoids algorithms.

It\nis shown that a previously-used averaged height concept is an acceptable\napproximation. From the one-dimensional model, a friction factor and the\ncorresponding Poiseuille number are derived. Unlike the rigid duct case, the\nPoiseuille number for a compliant duct is not constant but varies in the\nstreamwise direction. Compliance can increase the Poiseuille number by a factor\nof up to four. The model for finite flow inertia is obtained by assuming a\nparabolic vertical variation of the streamwise velocity. To satisfy the\ndisplacement constraints along the edges of the channel, weak tension is\nintroduced in the streamwise direction to regularize the\nWinkler-foundation-like model. Matched asymptotic solutions of the regularized\nmodel are derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 15:53:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 17:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

Stochastic Gradient\nDescent (SGD) is a first order iterative optimizer that updates the gradient\nuniformly for all parameters. This uniform update may not be suitable across\nthe entire training phase. A rudimentary solution for this is to employ a\nfine-tuned learning rate scheduler which decreases learning rate as a function\nof iteration. To eliminate the dependency of learning rate schedulers, adaptive\ngradient optimizers such as AdaGrad, AdaDelta, RMSProp, Adam employ a\nparameter-wise scaling term for learning rate which is a function of the\ngradient itself. We propose Tom (Trend over Momentum) optimizer, which is a\nnovel variant of Adam that takes into account of the trend which is observed\nfor the gradients in the loss landscape traversed by the neural network.

Therefore, the major objective of the present\nwork is to develop a novel approach based on long short-term memory (LSTM) for\nthe forecast of inflows. Real-time inflow forecast, in other words, daily\ninflow at the reservoir helps in efficient operation of water resources.

Under normal circumstances, it is impossible to analyze the\nconvergence of R-SRG algorithm alone. The main reason is that the conditional\nexpectation of the descending direction is a biased estimation. However, in\nthis paper, we consider linear combination of three descent directions on\nRiemannian manifolds as the new descent direction (i.e., R-SRG, R-SVRG and\nR-SGD) and the parameters are time-varying. At first, we propose a Riemannian\nstochastic hybrid gradient(R-SHG) algorithm with adaptive parameters. The\nalgorithm gets a global convergence analysis with a decaying step size.

The existing behavior models not only\nfail to capture the information propagation within the individual's social\nnetwork, but also they do not incorporate the impact of such word-of-mouth\n(WOM) dissemination on the consumer's risk preferences. Moreover, even\ncutting-edge forecasting models rely on crude/synthetic consumer behavior\nmodels. We propose a general framework to forecast the adoption of novel\nproducts by developing a new consumer behavior model and integrating it into a\npopulation-level agent-based model. Specifically, we extend the hybrid choice\nmodel to estimate consumer behavior, which incorporates social network effects\nand interplay between WOM and risk aversion. The calibrated consumer behavior\nmodel and synthetic population are passed through the agent-based model for\nforecasting the product market share. We apply the proposed framework to\nforecast the adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in Nashville, USA. The\nconsumer behavior model is calibrated with a stated preference survey data of\n1,495 Nashville residents. The output of the agent-based model provides the\neffect of the purchase price, post-purchase satisfaction, and safety\nmeasures/regulations on the forecasted AV market share. With an annual AV price\nreduction of 5% at the initial purchase price of $40,000 and 90% of satisfied\nadopters, AVs are forecasted to attain around 85% market share in thirty years.\nThese findings are crucial for policymakers to develop infrastructure plans and\nmanufacturers to conduct an after-sales cost-benefit analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 01:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

At the core of our approach is the\nRoute Advisor for Disaster-Affected Regions (RADAR) framework that operates on\nhigh-level algebraic representations of the region, modelled as a\ncyber-physical system (cps) where resource distribution is carried out over an\ninfrastructure connecting physical geographical locations. The\nSatisfiable-Modulo Theories (SMT) and graph-theoretic algorithms used by the\nframework supports disaster management decision-making during response and\npreparedness phases. We demonstrate our approach on a case study in disaster\nmanagement and describe scenarios to illustrate the usefulness of RADAR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 02:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}
