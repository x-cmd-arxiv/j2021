Riblets are such kinds\nof bio-inspired surface patterns which are seen on Sharks. Their geometric\nproperties induce secondary flows resulting in lower drag, allowing Sharks to\nachieve such high speeds. Secondary flows are broadly subcategorized into\nPrandtls first and second kind; the secondary flows induced by riblets belong\nprimarily to Prandtls second kind. These secondary flows have been proven to\ndelay the boundary layer separation by reducing momentum losses. This paper\naims to optimize the use of these bio-inspired patterns on an airfoil. By\napplying the ribletted surface on an airfoil, the boundary layer separation can\nbe delayed, thus leading to a reduction in drag and increasing the critical\nangle of attack. Specific geometric properties such as the height and the\nwavelength of the riblets are varied to find the most optimal design. The\ndesign framework couples the optimization algorithm, computational fluid\ndynamics, and post-processing analysis. An Invasive Weed Model is implemented\nfor optimization due to its commendable performance in converging close to\nglobal optima. The optimization process is initialized by generating a\npopulation of riblet profiles with randomly distributed geometry parameters.\nThese profiles are then evolved over generations with the objective to minimize\nthe drag, which is computed through Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations\nconducted on OpenFOAM.

We\ndefine structural entropy of a causal model in terms of its description\ncomplexity measured by the logarithmic growth rate, measured in bits, of all\ndirected acyclic graphs (DAGs), parameterized by the edge density d. Structural\nentropy yields non-intuitive predictions. If we randomly sample a DAG from the\nspace of all models, in the range d = (0, 1/8), almost surely the model is a\ntwo-layer DAG! Semantic entropy quantifies the reduction in entropy where edges\nare removed by causal intervention. Semantic causal entropy is defined as the\nf-divergence between the observational distribution and the interventional\ndistribution P', where a subset S of edges are intervened on to determine their\ncausal influence. We compare the decomposability properties of semantic entropy\nfor different choices of f-divergences, including KL-divergence, squared\nHellinger distance, and total variation distance. We apply our framework to\ngeneralize a recently popular bipartite experimental design for studying causal\ninference on large datasets, where interventions are carried out on one set of\nvariables (e.g., power plants, items in an online store), but outcomes are\nmeasured on a disjoint set of variables (residents near power plants, or\nshoppers).

As edge density increases, a sequence of phase\ntransitions occur over disjoint intervals of d, with deeper DAG architectures\nemerging for larger values of d.

Demand response aggregation and load control will enable\ngreater grid stability and greater penetration of renewable energies into the\ngrid. The present work fits this context in supporting charging optimization\nfor EV in parking premises assuming a incumbent high penetration of EVs in the\nsystem. We propose a methodology to predict an estimation of the parking\nduration in shared parking premises with the objective of estimating the energy\nrequirement of a specific parking lot, evaluate optimal EVs charging schedule\nand integrate the scheduling into a smart controller.

The amplitude\nestimation algorithms were used to estimate the inner product of randomly\nchosen four-dimensional unit vectors, and were based on the maximum likelihood\nestimation (MLE) and the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) techniques.\nSignificant improvements in accuracy were observed for the MLE based approach\nwhen deeper quantum circuits were taken into account, including circuits with\nmore than ninety two-qubit gates and depth sixty, achieving a mean additive\nestimation error on the order of $10^{-2}$. The CRT based approach was found to\nprovide accurate estimates for many of the data points but was less robust\nagainst noise on average. Last, we analyze two more amplitude estimation\nalgorithms that take into account the specifics of the hardware noise to\nfurther improve the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 16:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

While advances have been made, existing methods suffer from\none or more of the following shortcomings: (1) failure to take relationships\nbetween time series into consideration for discovering regimes in multiple time\nseries; (2) lack of an effective approach that models time-dependent behaviors\nexhibited by series; (3) difficulties in handling data discontinuities which\nmay be informative. Most of the existing methods are unable to handle all of\nthese three issues in a unified framework.

However, the\nunderstanding of power grid resilience still stays on the conceptual level\nmostly or focuses on particular components, yielding no actionable results or\nrevealing few insights on the system level. This study provides a\nquantitatively measurable definition of power grid resilience, using a\nstatistical model inspired by patterns observed from data and domain knowledge.\nWe analyze a large-scale quarter-hourly historical electricity customer outage\ndata and the corresponding weather records, and draw connections between the\nmodel and industry resilience practice.

In order to\nfacilitate the incorporation of the influence functional into a multisite\nframework (MS-TNPI), we combine a matrix product state (MPS) decomposition of\nthe reduced density tensor of the system along the sites with a corresponding\ntensor network representation of the time axis to construct an efficient 2D\ntensor network. The 2D MS-TNPI network, when contracted, yields the\ntime-dependent reduced density tensor of the extended system as an MPS. The\nalgorithm presented is independent of the system Hamiltonian. We outline an\niteration scheme to take the simulation beyond the non-Markovian memory\nintroduced by solvents. Applications to spin chains coupled to local harmonic\nbaths are presented; we consider the Ising, XXZ and the Heisenberg models,\ndemonstrating that the presence of local environments can often dissipate the\nentanglement between the sites. We discuss three factors causing the system to\ntransition from a coherent oscillatory dynamics to a fully incoherent dynamics.\nThe MS-TNPI method is useful for studying a variety of extended quantum systems\ncoupled with solvents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 17:55:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2021 16:33:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2021 14:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

In this work we explore the thermal signatures of dense CSM\ninteraction, when the CSM density profile is truncated at some outer radius.\nCSM with optical depth $>c/v$ (where $v$ is the shock velocity) will produce\nprimarily $\\sim$blackbody optical/UV emission whereas lower optical-depth CSM\nwill power bremsstrahlung X-ray emission. Focusing on the latter, we derive\nlight-curves and spectra of the resulting X-ray transients, that include a\ndetailed treatment of Comptonization.

Such low mass diffuse objects in a group\nenvironment are easily disrupted and are expected to show evidence of tidal\ndistortions. In this work we present deep new imaging of the NGC1052 group,\nobtained with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, to test this hypothesis. We find\nthat both galaxies show strong position angle twists and are significantly more\nelongated at their outskirts than in their interiors. The group's central\nmassive elliptical NGC1052 is the most likely source of these tidal\ndisturbances. The observed distortions imply that the galaxies have a low total\nmass or are very close to NGC1052. Considering constraints on the galaxies'\nrelative distances, we infer that the dark matter halo masses of these galaxies\ncannot be much greater than their stellar masses. Calculating pericenters from\nthe distortions, we find that the galaxies are on highly elliptical orbits,\nwith a ratio of pericenter to present-day radius Rperi/R0~0.1 if the galaxies\nare dark matter-free and Rperi/R0~0.01 if they have a normal dark halo.

However, as compared to dependency grammars, constituency\ngrammars do not provide a straightforward way to incorporate visual information\nwithout enforcing language-specific heuristics. In this paper, we propose an\nunsupervised grammar induction model that leverages word concreteness and a\nstructural vision-based heuristic to jointly learn constituency-structure and\ndependency-structure grammars. Our experiments find that concreteness is a\nstrong indicator for learning dependency grammars, improving the direct\nattachment score (DAS) by over 50\\% as compared to state-of-the-art models\ntrained on pure text.

The proposed Encrypted Data Processing (EDAP)\narchitecture accomplishes confidentiality, authenticity, and freshness of the\nkey-based cryptographic data protection by adopting data encryption with a\nmulti-level key protection scheme. It guarantees that the user data is visible\nonly in non-privileged mode to a designated program trusted by the data owner\non a designated hardware, thus protecting the data from an untrusted hardware,\nhypervisor, OS, or other users' applications. The cryptographic keys and\nprotocols used for achieving these confidential computing requirements are\ndescribed in a use case example. Encrypting and decrypting data in an\nEDAP-enabled processor can lead to performance degradation as it adds cycle\ntime to the overall execution.

In this paper, we focus on such target\ntracking problems in adversarial environments, where attacks or failures may\ndeactivate robots' sensors and communications. In contrast to the previous\nworks that consider no attacks or sensing attacks only, we formalize the first\nrobust multi-robot tracking framework that accounts for any fixed numbers of\nworst-case sensing and communication attacks. To secure against such attacks,\nwe design the first robust planning algorithm, named Robust Active Target\nTracking (RATT), which approximates the communication attacks to equivalent\nsensing attacks and then optimizes against the approximated and original\nsensing attacks. We show that RATT provides provable suboptimality bounds on\nthe tracking quality for any non-decreasing objective function. Our analysis\nutilizes the notations of curvature for set functions introduced in\ncombinatorial optimization. In addition, RATT runs in polynomial time and\nterminates with the same running time as state-of-the-art algorithms for\n(non-robust) target tracking. Finally, we evaluate RATT with both qualitative\nand quantitative simulations across various scenarios. In the evaluations, RATT\nexhibits a tracking quality that is near-optimal and superior to varying\nnon-robust heuristics. We also demonstrate RATT's superiority and robustness\nagainst varying attack models (e.g., worst-case and bounded rational attacks).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 20:48:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

The goal is to sequentially choose actions for arms so as to maximize\nthe expected value of the cumulative rewards collected.

The coarse velocity field can be simulated\nwith a low computational cost and provides global information to regularize the\nill-posedness of the learning problem, which is usually caused by the use of\nlocal geometries due to the computational resource constraints.

However, task-specific finetuning is\nprone to overfitting due to the lack of enough training examples. To alleviate\nthis issue, we propose a new finetuning approach based on contrastive learning\nthat reuses unlabelled examples from the base domain in the form of\ndistractors.

They have\nbeen the gold standard for drawing causal inference and provide excellent\ninternal validity. However, they have also been criticized for questionable\nexternal validity, in the sense that the conclusion may not generalize well to\na larger population. The randomized survey experiment is a design tool that can\nhelp mitigate this concern, by randomly selecting the experimental units from\nthe target population of interest. However, as pointed out by Morgan and Rubin\n(2012), chance imbalances often exist in covariate distributions between\ndifferent treatment groups even under completely randomized experiments. Not\nsurprisingly, such covariate imbalances also occur in randomized survey\nexperiments. Furthermore, the covariate imbalances happen not only between\ndifferent treatment groups, but also between the sampled experimental units and\nthe overall population of interest. In this paper, we propose a two-stage\nrerandomization design that can actively avoid undesirable covariate imbalances\nat both the sampling and treatment assignment stages. We further develop\nasymptotic theory for rerandomized survey experiments, demonstrating that\nrerandomization provides better covariate balance, more precise treatment\neffect estimators, and shorter large-sample confidence intervals. We also\npropose covariate adjustment to deal with remaining covariate imbalances after\nrerandomization, showing that it can further improve both the sampling and\nestimated precision.

Its problems regarding the transaction fees and long\nvalidation times are addressed through an innovative concept called the\nLightning Network (LN) which works on top of Bitcoin by leveraging off-chain\ntransactions. This made Bitcoin an attractive micro-payment solution that can\nalso be used within certain IoT applications (e.g., toll payments) since it\neliminates the need for traditional centralized payment systems. Nevertheless,\nit is not possible to run LN and Bitcoin on resource-constrained IoT devices\ndue to their storage, memory, and processing requirements. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose an efficient and secure protocol that enables an IoT device\nto use LN's functions through a gateway LN node even if it is not trusted. The\nidea is to involve the IoT device only in signing operations, which is possible\nby replacing LN's original 2-of-2 multisignature channels with 3-of-3\nmultisignature channels. Once the gateway is delegated to open a channel for\nthe IoT device in a secure manner, our protocol enforces the gateway to request\nthe IoT device's cryptographic signature for all further operations on the\nchannel such as sending payments or closing the channel. LN's Bitcoin\ntransactions are revised to incorporate the 3-of-3 multisignature channels. In\naddition, we propose other changes to protect the IoT device's funds from\ngetting stolen in possible revoked state broadcast attempts. We evaluated the\nproposed protocol using a Raspberry Pi considering a toll payment scenario. Our\nresults show that timely payments can be sent and the computational and\ncommunication delays associated with the protocol are negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 04:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

More data are required to gain a more complete\nunderstanding of these effects. Purpose: To test the theoretical models of\nparton transport and hadron formation, we compared their predictions for the\nnuclear and kinematic dependence of pion production in nuclei. Methods: We have\nmeasured charged-pion production in semi-inclusive DIS off D, C, Fe, and Pb\nusing the CLAS detector and the CEBAF 5.014 GeV electron beam. We report\nresults on the nuclear-to-deuterium multiplicity ratio for $\\pi^{+}$ and\n$\\pi^{-}$ as a function of energy transfer, four-momentum transfer, and pion\nenergy fraction or transverse momentum - the first three-dimensional study of\nits kind. Results: The $\\pi^{+}$ multiplicity ratio is found to depend strongly\non the pion fractional energy $z$, and reaches minimum values of $0.67\\pm0.03$,\n$0.43\\pm0.02$, and $0.27\\pm0.01$ for the C, Fe, and Pb targets, respectively.\nThe $z$ dependences of the multiplicity ratios for $\\pi^{+}$ and $\\pi^{-}$ are\nequal within uncertainties for C and Fe targets but show differences at the\nlevel of 10$\\%$ for the Pb-target data.

However, voice assistants are shown to be vulnerable to the FakeWake\nphenomena, whereby they are inadvertently triggered by innocent-sounding fuzzy\nwords. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the FakeWake\nphenomena from three aspects. To start with, we design the first fuzzy word\ngenerator to automatically and efficiently produce fuzzy words instead of\nsearching through a swarm of audio materials. We manage to generate 965 fuzzy\nwords covering 8 most popular English and Chinese smart speakers. To explain\nthe causes underlying the FakeWake phenomena, we construct an interpretable\ntree-based decision model, which reveals phonetic features that contribute to\nfalse acceptance of fuzzy words by wake-up word detectors. Finally, we propose\nremedies to mitigate the effect of FakeWake. The results show that the\nstrengthened models are not only resilient to fuzzy words but also achieve\nbetter overall performance on original training datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 04:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

Leveraging these\nchallenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation model training\nmore effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists of two new\ndesigns. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple slightly\ndifferent decoders (i.e., using different up-sampling strategies). The\nstatistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the\nmodel's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, we\napply a novel mutual consistency constraint between one decoder's probability\noutput and other decoders' soft pseudo labels.

However, applying DP\nwithout analyzing the utility, privacy, and security requirements can affect\nthe data utility as well as help the attacker to conduct integrity attacks\n(e.g., False Data Injection(FDI)) leveraging the differentially private data.\nExisting anomaly-detection-based defense strategies against data integrity\nattacks in DP-based smart grids fail to minimize the attack impact while\nmaximizing data privacy and utility. To address this challenge, it is\nnontrivial to apply a defensive approach during the design process. In this\npaper, we formulate and develop the defense strategy as a part of the design\nprocess to investigate data privacy, security, and utility in a DP-based smart\ngrid network. We have proposed a provable relationship among the DP-parameters\nthat enables the defender to design a fault-tolerant system against FDI\nattacks. To experimentally evaluate and prove the effectiveness of our proposed\ndesign approach, we have simulated the FDI attack in a DP-based grid. The\nevaluation indicates that the attack impact can be minimized if the designer\ncalibrates the privacy level according to the proposed correlation of the\nDP-parameters to design the grid network. Moreover, we analyze the feasibility\nof the DP mechanism and QoS of the smart grid network in an adversarial\nsetting. Our analysis suggests that the DP mechanism is feasible over existing\nprivacy-preserving mechanisms in the smart grid domain.

The presented\nmethods address a wide range of representations for uncertain predictions\nincluding both Gaussian and non-Gaussian mixture models to predict both agent\npositions and control inputs conditioned on the scene contexts. We show that\nthe problem of risk assessment when Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) of agent\npositions are learned can be solved rapidly to arbitrary levels of accuracy\nwith existing numerical methods. To address the problem of risk assessment for\nnon-Gaussian mixture models of agent position, we propose finding upper bounds\non risk using nonlinear Chebyshev's Inequality and sums-of-squares (SOS)\nprogramming; they are both of interest as the former is much faster while the\nlatter can be arbitrarily tight. These approaches only require higher order\nstatistical moments of agent positions to determine upper bounds on risk. To\nperform risk assessment when models are learned for agent control inputs as\nopposed to positions, we propagate the moments of uncertain control inputs\nthrough the nonlinear motion dynamics to obtain the exact moments of uncertain\nposition over the planning horizon. To this end, we construct deterministic\nlinear dynamical systems that govern the exact time evolution of the moments of\nuncertain position in the presence of uncertain control inputs.

Moreover, we find that the halos\nat $z=10$ are preferentially aligned with the middle eigendirection of the\ntidal tensor with an excess probability of 15 percent.

Mass cascade is local,\ntwo-way, and asymmetric in mass space. Halos inherit/pass their mass from/to\nhalos of similar size.

Since the ground truth labels are not allowed, we design\na pseudo target based on the prior constraints of the RPM formulation to\napproximate the ground truth label, which effectively converts the unsupervised\nlearning strategy into a supervised one. However, the correct answer is wrongly\nlabelled by the pseudo target, and thus the noisy contrast will lead to\ninaccurate model training.

The parametrisation method of invariant manifolds is used\nand adapted to the case of mechanical systems expressed in the physical basis,\nso that the technique is directly applicable to problems discretised by the\nfinite element method. Two nonlinear mappings, respectively related to\ndisplacement and velocity, are introduced, and the link between the two is made\nexplicit at arbitrary order of expansion. The same development is performed on\nthe reduced-order dynamics which is computed at generic order following the\ndifferent styles of parametrisation. More specifically, three different styles\nare introduced and commented: the graph style, the complex normal form style\nand the real normal form style. These developments allow making better\nconnections with earlier works using these parametrisation methods. The\ntechnique is then applied to three different examples. A clamped-clamped arch\nwith increasing curvature is first used to show an example of a system with a\nsoftening behaviour turning to hardening at larger amplitudes, which can be\nreplicated with a single mode reduction. Secondly, the case of a cantilever\nbeam is investigated. It is shown that the invariant manifold of the first mode\nshows a folding point at large amplitudes which is not connected to an internal\nresonance. This exemplifies the failure of the graph style due to the folding\npoint, whereas the normal form style is able to pass over the folding.

Large DM-galaxy offsets can occur in minor mergers, especially\nwith frequent self-interactions. The subhalo tends to dissolve quickly for\nthese cases.

HD141569 is the only known pre-main sequence star characterized\nby a hybrid disk. Observations probed the outer-disk structure showing a\ncomplex system of rings and interferometric observations attempted to\ncharacterize its inner 5 au region, but derived limited constraints. The goal\nof this work was to explore with new high-resolution interferometric\nobservations the properties of the dust and gas in the internal regions of\nHD141569. We observed HD141569 on mas scales with GRAVITY/VLTI in the\nnear-infrared at low and high spectral resolution.

We analyzed the\nhigh spectral resolution quantities to investigate the properties of the\nBr-Gamma line emitting region. Thanks to the combination of three different\nepochs, GRAVITY resolves the inner dusty disk in the K band. Data modeling\nshows that an IR excess of about 6% is spatially resolved and that the origin\nof this emission is confined in a ring of material located at a radius of 1 au\nfrom the star with a width smaller than 0.3 au. The MCMax modeling suggests\nthat this emission could originate from a small amount of QHPs, while large\nsilicate grain models cannot reproduce at the same time the observational\nconstraints on the properties of near-IR and mid-IR fluxes. The differential\nphases in the Br-Gamma line clearly show an S-shape that can be best reproduced\nwitha gas disk in Keplerian rotation, confined within 0.09 au. This is also\nhinted at by the double-peaked Br-Gamma emission line shape. The modeling of\nthe continuum and gas emission shows that the inclination and position angle of\nthese two components are consistent with a system showing relatively coplanar\nrings on all scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 10:20:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 08:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

Nonetheless, the\navailability of CPT and complete exploitation of dosimetric advantages are\nstill limited by high facility costs and technological challenges. There are\nextensive ongoing efforts to improve upon these, which will lead to greater\naccessibility, superior delivery, and therefore better treatment outcomes.\nSeveral of these aspects can be addressed by developments to the beam delivery\nsystem (BDS) which determine the overall shaping and timing capabilities to\nprovide high quality treatments. Modern delivery techniques are necessary but\nare limited by extended treatment times. The energy layer switching time (ELST)\nis a limiting constraint of the BDS and a determinant of the beam delivery time\n(BDT), along with the accelerator and other factors. This review evaluates the\ndelivery process in detail, presenting the limitations and developments for the\nBDS and related accelerator technology, toward decreasing the BDT. As extended\nBDT impacts motion and has dosimetric implications for treatment, we discuss\navenues to minimise the ELST and overview the clinical benefits and feasibility\nof a large energy acceptance BDS. These developments support the possibility of\ndelivering advanced methodologies such as volumetric rescanning, FLASH and arc\ntherapy and can further reduce costs given a faster delivery for a greater\nrange of treatment indications. Further work to realise multi-ion, image guided\nand adaptive therapies is also discussed. In this review we examine how\nincreased treatment efficiency and efficacy could be achieved with an improved\nBDS and how this could lead to faster and higher quality treatments for the\nfuture of CPT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 10:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

Hence, investors (asset\nmanagers and asset owners) who wanted to incorporate these issues started to\nassess companies based on how they handle such topics. For this assessment,\ninvestors rely on specialized rating agencies that issue ratings along the\nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) dimensions. Such ratings allow them\nto make investment decisions in favor of sustainability. However, rating\nagencies base their analysis on subjective assessment of sustainability\nreports, not provided by every company. Furthermore, due to human labor\ninvolved, rating agencies are currently facing the challenge to scale up the\ncoverage in a timely manner.\n  In order to alleviate these challenges and contribute to the overall goal of\nsupporting sustainability, we propose a heterogeneous ensemble model to predict\nESG ratings using fundamental data. This model is based on feedforward neural\nnetwork, CatBoost and XGBoost ensemble members. Given the public availability\nof fundamental data, the proposed method would allow cost-efficient and\nscalable creation of initial ESG ratings (also for companies without\nsustainability reporting).

In the case\nof the metric ruling, the individuals interact with the neighbours within a\ncertain metric distance; in contrast, in the topological ruling, interaction is\nconfined within a number of fixed nearest neighbours. Here, we explore how the\nrange of interaction versus the number of fixed interacting neighbours affects\nthe dynamics of flocking in an unbounded space, as observed in natural\nscenarios. Our study reveals the existence of a certain threshold value of the\ninteraction radius in the case of metric ruling and a threshold number of\ninteracting neighbours for the topological ruling to reach an ordered state.\nInterestingly, our analysis shows that topological interaction is more\neffective in bringing the order in the group, as observed in field studies.

Recent work has introduced methods for post-hoc\nconfidence calibration for classification as well as for object detection to\naddress this issue. Especially in safety critical applications, it is crucial\nto obtain a reliable self-assessment of a model. But what if the calibration\nmethod itself is uncertain, e.g., due to an insufficient knowledge base?\n  We introduce Bayesian confidence calibration - a framework to obtain\ncalibrated confidence estimates in conjunction with an uncertainty of the\ncalibration method. Commonly, Bayesian neural networks (BNN) are used to\nindicate a network's uncertainty about a certain prediction. BNNs are\ninterpreted as neural networks that use distributions instead of weights for\ninference. We transfer this idea of using distributions to confidence\ncalibration. For this purpose, we use stochastic variational inference to build\na calibration mapping that outputs a probability distribution rather than a\nsingle calibrated estimate. Using this approach, we achieve state-of-the-art\ncalibration performance for object detection calibration. Finally, we show that\nthis additional type of uncertainty can be used as a sufficient criterion for\ncovariate shift detection.

It is hence important to study the\nGCNN transferability: the capacity of the network to have approximately the\nsame repercussion on different graphs that represent the same phenomenon.\nTransferability ensures that GCNNs trained on certain graphs generalize if the\ngraphs in the test set represent the same phenomena as the graphs in the\ntraining set. In this paper, we consider a model of transferability based on\ngraphon analysis. Graphons are limit objects of graphs, and, in the graph\nparadigm, two graphs represent the same phenomenon if both approximate the same\ngraphon.

These parameters are based on the\nnatural Stokes $Q$ and $U$ quadrant pattern produced by circumstellar\nscattering. They provide a simple test of the deviations of the disk geometry\nfrom axisymmetry and can be used to constrain the scattering phase function for\noptically thin disks without detailed model fitting of disk images. The\nparameters are easy to derive from observations and model calculations and are\ntherefore well suited to systematic studies of the dust scattering in\ncircumstellar disks.\n  It is shown for models of optically thin and rotationally symmetric debris\ndisks that the quadrant parameters normalized to the integrated azimuthal\npolarization or quadrant ratios like $Q_{000}/Q_{180}$ depend only on the disk\ninclination $i$ and the polarized scattering phase function of the dust, and\nthey do not depend on the radial distribution of the scattering emissivity.\nBecause $i$ is usually well known for resolved disk, we can derive the shape of\nthe phase function for the sampled scattering angle range.

To\nbuild on the reviews, both for future research and industry practice, they need\nto be of high quality. Objective: To assess the quality of SLRs in software\nengineering, we put forward an appraisal instrument for SLRs. The instrument is\nintended for use by appraisers of reviews, but authors may also use it as a\nchecklist when designing and documenting their reviews. Method: A\nwell-established appraisal instrument from research in healthcare was used as a\nstarting point to develop a quality assessment instrument. It is adapted to\nsoftware engineering using guidelines, checklists, and experiences from\nsoftware engineering. As a validation step, the first version was reviewed by\nfour external experts on SLRs in software engineering and updated based on\ntheir feedback. Results: The outcome of the research is an appraisal instrument\nfor the quality assessment of SLRs in software engineering. The instrument\nintends to support the appraiser in assessing the quality of an SLR. The\ninstrument includes 16 items with different options to capture the quality. The\nitem is assessed on a two or three-grade scale, depending on the item. The\ninstrument also supports consolidating the items into groups, which are then\nused to assess the overall quality of a systematic literature review.\nConclusion: It is concluded that the presented instrument may be helpful\nsupport for an appraiser in assessing the quality of SLRs in software\nengineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 12:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

We thus propose Channel\nRandomisation as a novel data augmentation method for restricting neural\nnetworks to learn encoding of \"colour irregularity\" whilst predicting\nchannel-randomised images to ultimately build reliable fruit-monitoring robots\nidentifying atypical fruit qualities. Our experiments show that (1) this\ncolour-based alternative can better learn representations for consistently\naccurate identification of fruit anomalies in various fruit species, and also,\n(2) unlike other methods, the validation accuracy can be utilised as a\ncriterion for early stopping of training in practice due to positive\ncorrelation between the performance in the self-supervised\ncolour-differentiation task and the subsequent detection rate of actual\nanomalous fruits.

In order to resist the \"multiplicative fading\"\neffect, RIS is more likely to develop into extremely large-scale RIS (XL-RIS)\nfor future 6G communications. Beam training is an effective way to acquire\nchannel state information (CSI) for the XL-RIS assisted system. Existing beam\ntraining schemes rely on the far-field codebook, which is designed based on the\nfar-field channel model. However, due to the large aperture of XL-RIS, the user\nis more likely to be in the near-field region of XL-RIS. The far-field codebook\nmismatches the near-field channel model. Thus, the existing far-field beam\ntraining scheme will cause severe performance loss in the XL-RIS assisted\nnear-field communications. To solve this problem, we propose the efficient\nnear-field beam training schemes by designing the near-field codebook to match\nthe near-field channel model. Specifically, we firstly design the near-field\ncodebook by considering the near-field cascaded array steering vector of\nXL-RIS. Then, the optimal codeword for XL-RIS is obtained by the exhausted\ntraining procedure between the XL-RIS and the user. In order to reduce the beam\ntraining overhead, we further design a hierarchical near-field codebook and\npropose the corresponding hierarchical near-field beam training scheme, where\ndifferent levels of sub-codebooks are searched in turn with reduced codebook\nsize. Simulation results show the two proposed near-field beam training schemes\nboth perform better than the existing far-field beam training scheme.\nParticulary, the hierarchical near-field beam training scheme can greatly\nreduce the beam training overhead with acceptable performance loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 12:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

This activity becomes even much\nmore challenging in Software Product Line (SPL) systems due to variability of\nfailures. These unexpected behaviors are induced by variability faults which\ncan only be exposed under some combinations of system features. The interaction\namong these features causes the failures of the system. Although localizing\nbugs in single-system engineering has been studied in-depth, variability fault\nlocalization in SPL systems still remains mostly unexplored. In this article,\nwe present VarCop, a novel and effective variability fault localization\napproach. For an SPL system failed by variability bugs, VarCop isolates\nsuspicious code statements by analyzing the overall test results of the sampled\nproducts and their source code. The isolated suspicious statements are the\nstatements related to the interaction among the features which are necessary\nfor the visibility of the bugs in the system. The suspiciousness of each\nisolated statement is assessed based on both the overall test results of the\nproducts containing the statement as well as the detailed results of the test\ncases executed by the statement in these products. On a large dataset of buggy\nSPL systems, empirical evaluation shows that VarCop significantly improves two\nstate-of-the-art fault localization techniques by 33% and 50% in ranking the\nincorrect statements in the systems containing a single bug each. In about\ntwo-thirds of the cases, VarCop ranks the buggy statements at the top-3\npositions in the resulting lists.

When these are fixed, a timetable is determined and based on the\ntimetable, the vehicle and crew schedules are optimized. After each step,\npassenger routes are adapted to model the behavior of the passengers as\nrealistically as possible. It has been mentioned in many publications that such\na sequential process is sub-optimal, and integrated approaches, mainly\nheuristics, are under consideration. Sequential planning is not only common in\npublic transportation planning but also in many other applied problems, among\nothers in supply chain management, or in organizing hospitals efficiently.\n  The contribution of this paper hence is two-fold: on the one hand, we develop\nan integrated integer programming formulation for the three planning stages\nline planning, (periodic) timetabling, and vehicle scheduling which also\nincludes the integrated optimization of the passenger routes. This gives us an\nexact formulation rewriting the sequential approach as an integrated problem.\nWe discuss properties of the integrated formulation and apply it experimentally\nto data sets from the LinTim library.\n  On the other hand, we propose a mathematical formulation for general\nsequential processes which can be used to build integrated formulations. For\ncomparing sequential processes with their integrated counterparts we analyze\nthe price of sequentiality, i.e., the ratio between the solution obtained by\nthe sequential process and an integrated solution. We also experiment with\ndifferent possibilities for partial integration of a subset of the sequential\nproblems and again illustrate our results using the case of public\ntransportation. The obtained results may be useful for other sequential\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 13:14:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 10:46:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

The mainstream detectors describe rotating objects\nusing a five-parament or eight-parament representations, which suffer from\nrepresentation ambiguity for orientated object definition. In this paper, we\npropose a novel representation method based on area ratio of parallelogram,\ncalled ARP. Specifically, ARP regresses the minimum bounding rectangle of the\noriented object and three area ratios. Three area ratios include the area ratio\nof a directed object to the smallest circumscribed rectangle and two\nparallelograms to the minimum circumscribed rectangle. It simplifies offset\nlearning and eliminates the issue of angular periodicity or label point\nsequences for oriented objects. To further remedy the confusion issue of nearly\nhorizontal objects, the area ratio between the object and its minimal\ncircumscribed rectangle is employed to guide the selection of horizontal or\noriented detection for each object. Moreover, the rotated efficient\nIntersection over Union (R-EIoU) loss with horizontal bounding box and three\narea ratios are designed to optimize the bounding box regression for rotating\nobjects.

However, the wake dynamics and aerodynamic\nperformance of such hybrid airfoil configuration has not been thoroughly\ninvestigated. In this paper, direct numerical simulations of two-dimensional\nflows over hybrid airfoils comprised of NACA 0012 leading sections with\npiezocomposite trailing control surfaces are performed at a fixed Reynolds\nnumber of 1000. The effects of length and camber of the trailing control\nsurface on the laminar aerodynamic characteristics are studied over a wide\nrange of angle of attack. It is shown that the flow behind the airfoil exhibits\ndifferent features, including steady flow, periodic vortex shedding, and\nquasi-periodic vortex shedding for different configurations. The transition\nbetween these wake states occurs at slightly smaller angles of attack compared\nto the nominal NACA 0012 airfoil. While the drag coefficient remains close to\neach other at a fixed angle of attack, the lift coefficient of the hybrid\nairfoil is positively affected by the length and camber of the trailing control\nsurface. The mechanism of lift generation is examined by surface pressure\ndistributions and a force element analysis. It is revealed that with increased\ncamber of the trailing control surface, the flow on both the suction and\npressure sides of the airfoil are modified in a beneficial way to enhance lift.\nIncreasing the length ratio only significantly modifies the flow near the aft\nsection on the pressure side. The results herein provide a laminar aerodynamic\ncharacterization of hybrid airfoils with trailing control surfaces, and could\npotentially aid the design of control techniques for next-generation small\nunmanned aerial vehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 14:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

MOR is vital to reduce\nthe dimension of the problem in order to lower the enormous computational\ncomplexity of for instance sampling methods in high dimensions. In particular,\na new type of Gramian-based MOR approach is proposed in this paper that can be\nused in very general settings. The considered Gramians are constructed to\nidentify dominant subspaces of the stochastic system as pointed out in this\nwork. Moreover, they can be computed via Lyapunov equations. However,\ncovariance information of the underlying systems enters these equations which\nis not directly available. Therefore, efficient sampling based methods relying\non variance reduction techniques are established to derive the required\ncovariances and hence the Gramians. Alternatively, an ansatz to compute the\nGramians by deterministic approximations of covariance functions is\ninvestigated. An error bound for the studied MOR methods is proved yielding an\na-priori criterion for the choice of the reduced system dimension. This bound\nis new and beneficial even in the deterministic case.

Physical experiments or detailed simulations that accurately\ncapture the behavior of the system are regarded as high-fidelity models with\nlow model uncertainty, however, they are expensive to run. On the other hand,\nsimplified physical experiments or numerical models are seen as low-fidelity\nmodels that are cheaper to evaluate. Although low-fidelity models are often not\nsuitable for direct use in reliability analysis due to their low accuracy, they\ncan offer information about the trend of the high-fidelity model thus providing\nthe opportunity to explore the design space at a low cost. This study presents\na new approach called adaptive multi-fidelity Gaussian process for reliability\nanalysis (AMGPRA). Contrary to selecting training points and information\nsources in two separate stages as done in state-of-the-art mfEGRA method, the\nproposed approach finds the optimal training point and information source\nsimultaneously using the novel collective learning function (CLF). CLF is able\nto assess the global impact of a candidate training point from an information\nsource and it accommodates any learning function that satisfies a certain\nprofile. In this context, CLF provides a new direction for quantifying the\nimpact of new training points and can be easily extended with new learning\nfunctions to adapt to different reliability problems. The performance of the\nproposed method is demonstrated by three mathematical examples and one\nengineering problem concerning the wind reliability of transmission towers. It\nis shown that the proposed method achieves similar or higher accuracy with\nreduced computational costs compared to state-of-the-art single and\nmulti-fidelity methods.

Until recently, networks of interventions with rare events were\nanalyzed using the inverse-variance NMA approach. However, when events are rare\nthe normal approximation made by this model can be poor and effect estimates\nare potentially biased. Other methods for the synthesis of such data are the\nrecent extension of the Mantel-Haenszel approach to NMA or the use of the\nnon-central hypergeometric distribution. In this article, we suggest a new\ncommon-effect NMA approach that can be applied even in networks of\ninterventions with extremely low or even zero number of events without\nrequiring study exclusion or arbitrary imputations. Our method is based on the\nimplementation of the penalized likelihood function proposed by Firth for bias\nreduction of the maximum likelihood estimate to the logistic expression of the\nNMA model. A limitation of our method is that heterogeneity cannot be taken\ninto account as an additive parameter as in most meta-analytical models.\nHowever, we account for heterogeneity by incorporating a multiplicative\noverdispersion term using a two-stage approach. We show through simulations\nthat our method performs consistently well across all tested scenarios and most\noften results in smaller bias than other available methods.

Methods: In this prospective\nobservational single cohort study on living donor liver transplant surgery, we\nextracted the waveform morphological evolution from the ABP data with the\nunsupervised manifold learning waveform analysis.

Most of the existing contrastive learning methods employ\npre-defined view generation methods, e.g., node drop or edge perturbation,\nwhich usually cannot adapt to input data or preserve the original semantic\nstructures well. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named\nAutomated Graph Contrastive Learning (AutoGCL) in this paper. Specifically,\nAutoGCL employs a set of learnable graph view generators orchestrated by an\nauto augmentation strategy, where every graph view generator learns a\nprobability distribution of graphs conditioned by the input. While the graph\nview generators in AutoGCL preserve the most representative structures of the\noriginal graph in generation of every contrastive sample, the auto augmentation\nlearns policies to introduce adequate augmentation variances in the whole\ncontrastive learning procedure. Furthermore, AutoGCL adopts a joint training\nstrategy to train the learnable view generators, the graph encoder, and the\nclassifier in an end-to-end manner, resulting in topological heterogeneity yet\nsemantic similarity in the generation of contrastive samples. Extensive\nexperiments on semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer\nlearning demonstrate the superiority of our AutoGCL framework over the\nstate-of-the-arts in graph contrastive learning. In addition, the visualization\nresults further confirm that the learnable view generators can deliver more\ncompact and semantically meaningful contrastive samples compared against the\nexisting view generation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 15:34:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2022 15:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

In the present work, we compared single and multitask\nlearning approaches to predict the changes in ADAS-Cog scores based on\nT1-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In contrast to most\nmachine learning-based prediction methods ADAS-Cog changes, we stratified the\nsubjects based on their baseline diagnoses and evaluated the prediction\nperformances in each group. Our experiments indicated a positive relationship\nbetween the predicted and observed ADAS-Cog score changes in each diagnostic\ngroup, suggesting that T1-weighted MRI has a predictive value for evaluating\ncognitive decline in the entire AD continuum.

In summary, this study demonstrated that ADAS-Cog change could\nbe, to some extent, predicted based on anatomical MRI.

However, there exists an issue when leveraging vision transformer\ninto 2D+3D facial expression recognition (FER), i.e., ViT training needs mass\ndata. Nonetheless, the number of samples in public 2D+3D FER datasets is far\nfrom sufficient for evaluation. How to utilize the ViT pre-trained on RGB\nimages to handle 2D+3D data becomes a challenge. To solve this problem, we\npropose a robust lightweight pure transformer-based network for multimodal\n2D+3D FER, namely MFEViT. For narrowing the gap between RGB and multimodal\ndata, we devise an alternative fusion strategy, which replaces each of the\nthree channels of an RGB image with the depth-map channel and fuses them before\nfeeding them into the transformer encoder. Moreover, the designed sample\nfiltering module adds several subclasses for each expression and move the noisy\nsamples to their corresponding subclasses, thus eliminating their disturbance\non the network during the training stage.

One example is the transparent wings of insects from\nthe order Hemiptera: fluorescence emission has so far not been reported in any\nof the 3,000 described species of the superfamily Cicadoidea. The phenomenon\nhas however been investigated in several butterfly and moth species, in which\nthe coloured wing scales are known to embed fluorophores such as papiliochrome\nII.

These fluorescent behaviours were\noptically characterised by one- and multi-photon microscopy and spectrometry,\nallowing us to infer the symmetry of the material as well as the biological\nrole of the fluorophores in the visual perception of insects and to explain the\nhigh absorption by the material in the range 300-400~nm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 14:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

Throughout this pandemic, public health authorities have monitored the\nresults of diagnostic testing to identify hotspots of transmission. Such\ninformation can help reduce or block transmission paths of COVID-19 and help\ninfected patients receive early treatment. However, most current schemes of\ntest site allocation have been based on experience or convenience, often\nresulting in low efficiency and non-optimal allocation. In addition, the\nhistorical sociodemographic patterns of populations within cities can result in\nmeasurable inequities in access to testing between various racial and income\ngroups. To address these pressing issues, we propose a novel test site\nallocation scheme to (a) maximize population coverage, (b) minimize prediction\nuncertainties associated with projections of outbreak trajectories, and (c)\nreduce inequities in access. We illustrate our approach with case studies\ncomparing our allocation scheme with recorded allocation of testing sites in\nGeorgia, revealing increases in both population coverage and improvements in\nequity of access over current practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 03:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

We use Neural Machine Translation\n(NMT) as an intermediate step to first obtain translations of the task-specific\ntext data. We then train LMs on the 1-best and N-best translations and study\nways to improve on such a baseline LM. We develop a procedure to derive word\nconfusion networks from NMT beam search graphs and evaluate LMs trained on\nthese confusion networks. With experiments on the WMT20 chat translation task\ndataset, we demonstrate that NMT confusion networks can help to reduce the\nperplexity of both n-gram and recurrent neural network LMs compared to those\ntrained only on N-best translations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 10:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

Among others, this\nmakes it possible to distill high-quality word vectors from pre-trained\nlanguage models. However, it is currently unclear to what extent it is possible\nto distill relation embeddings, i.e. vectors that characterize the relationship\nbetween two words. Such relation embeddings are appealing because they can, in\nprinciple, encode relational knowledge in a more fine-grained way than is\npossible with knowledge graphs. To obtain relation embeddings from a\npre-trained language model, we encode word pairs using a (manually or\nautomatically generated) prompt, and we fine-tune the language model such that\nrelationally similar word pairs yield similar output vectors. We find that the\nresulting relation embeddings are highly competitive on analogy (unsupervised)\nand relation classification (supervised) benchmarks, even without any\ntask-specific fine-tuning.

Continuum methods can be used\nto capture complexities neglected by terramechanics models without the\ncomputational expense of discrete element methods. Constitutive models and\nnumerical solvers are the two primary aspects of the continuum methods. The\nviscoplastic size-dependent non-local granular fluidity (NGF) constitutive\nmodel has successfully provided a quantitative description of experimental\nflows in many different configurations in literature. This research develops a\nnumerical approach, within a hyperelasticity framework, for implementing the\ndynamical form of NGF in three-dimensional material point method (3D MPM, an\nappropriate numerical solver for granular flow modeling). This approach is\nthermodynamically consistent to conserve energy, and the dynamical form\nincludes the nonlocal effect of flow cessation. Excavation data, both\nquantitative measurements and qualitative visualization, are collected\nexperimentally via our robotic equipment to evaluate the model with respect to\nthe flow geometry as well as interaction forces. The results are further\ncompared with the results from a recent modified plastic Drucker-Prager\nconstitutive model, and in other configurations including wheel-soil\ninteractions, a gravity-driven silo, and Taylor-Couette flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 01:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

Alexandroff spaces yield a\ndirectional topological space: the topology is defined by a unique minimal\nbasis defined by an open set for each variable x, specified as the intersection\nof all open sets containing x. Alexandroff spaces induce a (reflexive,\ntransitive) preorder. Alexandroff spaces satisfying the Kolmogorov T0\nseparation criterion, where open sets distinguish variables, converts the\npreordering into a partial ordering. Our approach broadly is to construct a\ntopological representation of posets from data, and then use the poset\nrepresentation to build a conventional DAG causal model. We illustrate our\nframework by showing how it unifies disparate algorithms and case studies\nproposed previously. Topology plays two key roles in causal discovery. First,\ntopological separability constraints on datasets have been used in several\nprevious approaches to infer causal structure from observations and\ninterventions. Second, a diverse range ofgraphical models used to represent\ncausal structures can be represented in a unified way in terms of a topological\nrepresentation of the induced poset structure.
