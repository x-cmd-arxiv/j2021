To evaluate whether these shifts are\nnegatively impacting biodiversity processes, it is critical to monitor the\nstatus, trends, and effects of environmental variables on entire communities.\nHowever, modeling the dynamics of multiple species simultaneously can require\nlarge amounts of diverse data, and few modeling approaches exist to\nsimultaneously provide species and community level inferences. We present an\n\"integrated community occupancy model\" (ICOM) that unites principles of data\nintegration and hierarchical community modeling in a single framework to\nprovide inferences on species-specific and community occurrence dynamics using\nmultiple data sources. We use simulations to compare the ICOM to previously\ndeveloped hierarchical community occupancy models and single species integrated\ndistribution models.

Simulations reveal that integrating multiple data sources in the ICOM\nincreased precision and accuracy of species and community level inferences\ncompared to single data source models, although benefits of integration were\ndependent on data source quality (e.g., amount of replication). Compared to\nsingle species models, the ICOM yielded more precise species-level estimates.\nWithin our case study, the ICOM had the highest out-of-sample predictive\nperformance compared to single species models and models that used only a\nsubset of the three data sources. The ICOM offers an attractive approach to\nestimate species and biodiversity dynamics, which is additionally valuable to\ninform management objectives of both individual species and their broader\ncommunities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2021 16:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

This\nwork shows that there are two distinct ways of eliminating these errors so that\nthe trajectory of a charged particle in a constant magnetic field is exactly on\nthe cyclotron orbit.

Within\nthis setting, the majority of popular DG methods aim to jointly learn the\nrepresentation and the labeling functions by minimizing a well-known upper\nbound for the classification risk in the unseen domain. In practice, however,\nmethods based on this theoretical upper bound ignore a term that cannot be\ndirectly optimized due to its dual dependence on both the representation\nmapping and the unknown optimal labeling function in the unseen domain. To\nbridge this gap between theory and practice, we introduce a new upper bound\nthat is free of terms having such dual dependence, resulting in a fully\noptimizable risk upper bound for the unseen domain. Our derivation leverages\nclassical and recent transport inequalities that link optimal transport metrics\nwith information-theoretic measures. Compared to previous bounds, our bound\nintroduces two new terms: (i) the Wasserstein-2 barycenter term that aligns\ndistributions between domains, and (ii) the reconstruction loss term that\nassesses the quality of representation in reconstructing the original data.\nBased on this new upper bound, we propose a novel DG algorithm named\nWasserstein Barycenter Auto-Encoder (WBAE) that simultaneously minimizes the\nclassification loss, the barycenter loss, and the reconstruction loss.\nNumerical results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art DG algorithms on several datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2021 16:57:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:38:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 01:08:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 03:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 05:17:46 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 21 May 2023 21:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

We can think of them as idealized, infinite-mass subsystems which\ndecouple from the rest of the system.

A\nfundamental physical theory should take this fact seriously. In this paper, we\nfurther develop a symmetry-inspired approach to describe physics from the\nperspective of quantum reference frames. We find a unifying framework allowing\nus to systematically derive a broad class of perspective dependent descriptions\nand the transformations between them. Working with a translational-invariant\ntoy model of three free particles, we discover that the introduction of\nrelative coordinates leads to a Hamiltonian structure with two non-commuting\nconstraints. This structure can be said to contain all observer-perspectives at\nonce, while the redundancies prevent an immediate operational interpretation.\nWe show that the operationally meaningful perspective dependent descriptions\nare given by Darboux coordinates on the constraint surface and that reference\nframe transformations correspond to reparametrizations of the constraint\nsurface. We conclude by constructing a quantum perspective neutral structure,\nvia which we can derive and change perspective dependent descriptions without\nreferring to the classical theory.

However,\nit is well known that identification and estimation of causal peer effects are\nchallenging in observational studies for two reasons. The first is the\nidentification challenge due to unmeasured network confounding, for example,\nhomophily bias and contextual confounding. The second issue is network\ndependence of observations, which one must take into account for valid\nstatistical inference. Negative control variables, also known as placebo\nvariables, have been widely used in observational studies including peer effect\nanalysis over networks, although they have been used primarily for bias\ndetection. In this article, we establish a formal framework which leverages a\npair of negative control outcome and exposure variables (double negative\ncontrols) to nonparametrically identify causal peer effects in the presence of\nunmeasured network confounding. We then propose a generalized method of moments\nestimator for causal peer effects, and establish its consistency and asymptotic\nnormality under an assumption about $\\psi$-network dependence. Finally, we\nprovide a network heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent variance\nestimator.

The 2019 Lok Sabha election saw a massive spike in the\nusage of online social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp;\nwith every major political party launching its own organized social media\ncampaigns. In 2014, Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) took one step ahead in\norganizing the campaign by launching its app - NaMo App. We focus our research\non Twitter and NaMo App during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and CAA protests.\nTwitter is a platform where every individual can express their views and is not\nbiased.

The mass gaps of these quantum chains are\nobtained from the largest root of a characteristic polynomial.

For question answering\n(QA), the current state-of-the-art pre-trained models typically need\nfine-tuning on tens of thousands of examples to obtain good results.

To\naddress this, we propose a simple fine-tuning framework that leverages\npre-trained text-to-text models and is directly aligned with their pre-training\nframework. Specifically, we construct the input as a concatenation of the\nquestion, a mask token representing the answer span and a context. Given this\ninput, the model is fine-tuned using the same objective as that of its\npre-training objective. Through experimental studies on various few-shot\nconfigurations, we show that this formulation leads to significant gains on\nmultiple QA benchmarks (an absolute gain of 34.2 F1 points on average when\nthere are only 16 training examples).

We establish closed-form risk formulas that explain\nthe effect of network parameters (e.g., Laplacian eigen-spectrum, time delay),\nnoise statistics, and systemic event sets onto the cascading failures. Our\nfindings can be applied to the design of robust platoons to lower the cascading\nrisk.

Past work has shown\nthat recurrent neural networks (RNNs) struggle to generalize on held-out\nalgorithmic or syntactic patterns without supervision or some inductive bias.\nTo remedy this, many papers have explored augmenting RNNs with various\ndifferentiable stacks, by analogy with finite automata and pushdown automata\n(PDAs). In this paper, we improve the performance of our recently proposed\nNondeterministic Stack RNN (NS-RNN), which uses a differentiable data structure\nthat simulates a nondeterministic PDA, with two important changes. First, the\nmodel now assigns unnormalized positive weights instead of probabilities to\nstack actions, and we provide an analysis of why this improves training.\nSecond, the model can directly observe the state of the underlying PDA. Our\nmodel achieves lower cross-entropy than all previous stack RNNs on five\ncontext-free language modeling tasks (within 0.05 nats of the\ninformation-theoretic lower bound), including a task on which the NS-RNN\npreviously failed to outperform a deterministic stack RNN baseline.

Finally, we show that the mean value extension result\nin [1] for computing propagated sets can also be extended to compute the\nupdated set when the observation function is nonlinear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2021 07:38:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

The TOVE for equilibrium of relativistic stars in general\nrelativity can in turn be derived by various methods: from the energy-momentum\nconservation constraint on the Einstein equations applied to a spherically\nsymmetric perfect fluid/gas; via a constrained optimization method on the mass\nand nucleon number; via a maximum entropy variational method for a sphere of\nself-gravitating perfect fluid/gas or radiation.

Our strategy\nelaborates on Deligne-Elkik's intersection bundles, and a refined Chern-Simons\ntheory which parallels the use of Bott-Chern classes in Arakelov geometry. In\nthe context of moduli spaces, we are confronted with flat relative connections\non families of Riemann surfaces. To be able to rely on the functorial approach,\nwe prove canonical extension results to global connections, inspired by the\ndeformation theory of harmonic maps in non-abelian Hodge theory.\n  The relative complex Chern-Simons bundle $\\mathcal{L}_{CS}$ is then defined\nas a functorial direct image of the second Chern class on the relative moduli\nspace of flat vector bundles.

However,\nexisting works focus on OoD algorithms, such as invariant risk minimization,\ndomain generalization, or stable learning, without considering the influence of\ndeep model architectures on OoD generalization, which may lead to sub-optimal\nperformance. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods search for architecture\nbased on its performance on the training data, which may result in poor\ngeneralization for OoD tasks. In this work, we propose robust Neural\nArchitecture Search for OoD generalization (NAS-OoD), which optimizes the\narchitecture with respect to its performance on generated OoD data by gradient\ndescent. Specifically, a data generator is learned to synthesize OoD data by\nmaximizing losses computed by different neural architectures, while the goal\nfor architecture search is to find the optimal architecture parameters that\nminimize the synthetic OoD data losses. The data generator and the neural\narchitecture are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner, and the minimax\ntraining process effectively discovers robust architectures that generalize\nwell for different distribution shifts. Extensive experimental results show\nthat NAS-OoD achieves superior performance on various OoD generalization\nbenchmarks with deep models having a much fewer number of parameters. In\naddition, on a real industry dataset, the proposed NAS-OoD method reduces the\nerror rate by more than 70% compared with the state-of-the-art method,\ndemonstrating the proposed method's practicality for real applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2021 10:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

The dominant\nframework for unsupervised learning in biology is Hebb's principle, but how\nHebbian learning could break such symmetries is a longstanding biophysical\nriddle. Theoretical studies agree that this should require inputs to visual\ncortex to invert the relative magnitude of their correlations at long\ndistances. Empirical measurements have searched in vain for such an inversion,\nand report the opposite to be true. We formally approach the question through\nthe hermitianization of a multi-layer model, which maps it into a problem of\nzero-temperature phase transitions. In the emerging phase diagram, both\nsymmetries break spontaneously as long as (1) recurrent interactions are\nsufficiently long-range and (2) Hebbian competition is duly accounted for. The\nrelevant mechanism for symmetry breaking is competition among connections\nsprouting from the same afferent cell. Such competition, and not the structure\nof the inputs, is capable of triggering the broken-symmetry phase required by\nimage processing. We provide analytic predictions on the relative magnitudes of\nthe relevant length-scales needed for this novel mechanism to occur. These\nresults reconcile experimental observations to the Hebbian paradigm, shed light\non a new mechanism for visual cortex development, and contribute to our growing\nunderstanding of the relationship between learning and symmetry breaking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2021 12:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

To sustain the long-term operation of an\nFL ecosystem, it is important to attract high quality data owners with\nappropriate incentive schemes. As an important building block of such incentive\nschemes, it is essential to fairly evaluate participants' contribution to the\nperformance of the final FL model without exposing their private data. Shapley\nValue (SV)-based techniques have been widely adopted to provide fair evaluation\nof FL participant contributions. However, existing approaches incur significant\ncomputation costs, making them difficult to apply in practice. In this paper,\nwe propose the Guided Truncation Gradient Shapley (GTG-Shapley) approach to\naddress this challenge. It reconstructs FL models from gradient updates for SV\ncalculation instead of repeatedly training with different combinations of FL\nparticipants. In addition, we design a guided Monte Carlo sampling approach\ncombined with within-round and between-round truncation to further reduce the\nnumber of model reconstructions and evaluations required, through extensive\nexperiments under diverse realistic data distribution settings. The results\ndemonstrate that GTG-Shapley can closely approximate actual Shapley values,\nwhile significantly increasing computational efficiency compared to the state\nof the art, especially under non-i.i.d. settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2021 12:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Recently, it has been\nstudied on the heterogeneous graph, which contains multiple types of nodes and\nedges, posing great challenges for modeling the high-order relationship between\nnodes. With the surge of graph embedding mechanism, it has also been adopted to\ncommunity detection. A remarkable group of works use the meta-path to capture\nthe high-order relationship between nodes and embed them into nodes' embedding\nto facilitate community detection. However, defining meaningful meta-paths\nrequires much domain knowledge, which largely limits their applications,\nespecially on schema-rich heterogeneous graphs like knowledge graphs.

By\nmaximizing the expectation of the co-occurrence of nodes connected by context\npaths, the model can learn the nodes' embeddings that both well preserve the\nhigh-order relationship between nodes and are helpful for community detection.\nExtensive experimental results on four real-world datasets show that CP-GNN\noutperforms the state-of-the-art community detection methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2021 12:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Objective: Our goal is to understand how specific\nconditionals are interpreted by readers who work with requirements. Method: We\nconduct a descriptive survey with 104 RE practitioners and ask how they\ninterpret 12 different conditional clauses.

Thus, the computation of\nmatrix-vector products in the variational minimization problem may be very\ntime-consuming, particularly if the parallel computation of the matrix-vector\nproduct requires a high degree of communication between processing elements.\nHence, we introduce a well-known numerical approximation method, called the\nfast multipole method (FMM), to speed up the matrix-vector multiplications in\ndata assimilation.
