Given data with individual covariates,\ntreatment assignments and outcomes, researchers can search for the optimal\nindividualized treatment rule (ITR) that maximizes the expected outcome.\nExisting methods typically require initial estimation of some nuisance models.\nThe double robustness property that can protect from misspecification of either\nthe treatment-free effect or the propensity score has been widely advocated.\nHowever, when model misspecification exists, a doubly robust estimate can be\nconsistent but may suffer from downgraded efficiency. Other than potential\nmisspecified nuisance models, most existing methods do not account for the\npotential problem when the variance of outcome is heterogeneous among\ncovariates and treatment.

Rerandomization, a design that rerandomizes the treatment\nassignment until a prespecified covariate balance criterion is met, has\nrecently got attention due to its easy implementation, improved covariate\nbalance and more efficient inference. Researchers have then suggested to use\nthe treatment assignments that minimize the covariate imbalance, namely the\noptimally balanced design. This has caused again the long-time controversy\nbetween two philosophies for designing experiments: randomization versus\noptimal and thus almost deterministic designs. Existing literature argued that\nrerandomization with overly balanced observed covariates can lead to highly\nimbalanced unobserved covariates, making it vulnerable to model\nmisspecification. On the contrary, rerandomization with properly balanced\ncovariates can provide robust inference for treatment effects while sacrificing\nsome efficiency compared to the ideally optimal design. In this paper, we show\nit is possible that, by making the covariate imbalance diminishing at a proper\nrate as the sample size increases, rerandomization can achieve its ideally\noptimal precision that one can expect with perfectly balanced covariates, while\nstill maintaining its robustness. We further investigate conditions on the\nnumber of covariates for achieving the desired optimality. Our results rely on\na more delicate asymptotic analysis for rerandomization.

At low\ntemperatures and for $H \\perp c$, the field-dependent magnetization and AC\nsusceptibility data evidence a metamagnetic transition at $H^+ = 5$~T, which is\nabsent for $H \\parallel c$.

The proposed Bayesian\nhierarchical model incorporates splines to estimate reproduction numbers\nflexibly over time while adjusting for varying effective infection fatality\nrates. The approach also provides estimates of dark figures regarding\nundetected infections over time. Results for Germany illustrate that estimated\nreproduction numbers based on death counts are often similar to classical\nestimates based on confirmed cases. However, considering death counts proves to\nbe more robust against shifts in testing policies: during the second wave of\ninfections, classical estimation of the reproduction number suggests a\nflattening/ decreasing trend of infections following the \"lockdown light\" in\nNovember 2020, while our results indicate that true numbers of infections\ncontinued to rise until the \"second lockdown\" in December 2020. This\nobservation is associated with more stringent testing criteria introduced\nconcurrently with the \"lockdown light\", which is reflected in subsequently\nincreasing dark figures of infections estimated by our model. These findings\nillustrate that the retrospective viewpoint can provide additional insights\nregarding the course of the pandemic.

Further, the CSA localization model family which includes BMN-CSA, was\npart of the second-placed submission at the 2021 ActivityNet action\nlocalization challenge. Our attention mechanism outperforms prior\nself-attention modules such as the squeeze-and-excitation in action detection\ntask. We also observe that our attention mechanism is complementary to such\nself-attention modules in that performance improvements are seen when both are\nused together.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 17:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Here we study if\npolytropes are also able to explain the stellar mass distribution within\ngalaxies. We develop a code to fit surface density profiles using polytropes\nprojected in the plane of the sky (propols). Sersic profiles are known to be\ngood proxies for the global shapes of galaxies and we find that, ignoring\ncentral cores, propols and Sersic profiles are indistinguishable within\nobservational errors (within 5 % over 5 orders of magnitude in surface\ndensity). The range of physically meaningful polytropes yields Sersic indexes\nbetween 0.4 and 6. The code has been systematically applied to ~750 galaxies\nwith carefully measured mass density profiles and including all morphological\ntypes and stellar masses (7 < log (Mstar/Msun) < 12). The propol fits are\nsystematically better than Sersic profiles when log(Mstar/Msun) < 9 and\nsystematically worst when log(Mstar/Msun) > 10. Although with large scatter,\nthe observed polytropic indexes increase with increasing mass and tend to\ncluster around m=5. For the most massive galaxies, propols are very good at\nreproducing their central parts, but they do not handle well cores and\noutskirts altogether. Polytropes are self-gravitating systems in thermal\nmeta-equilibrium as defined by the Tsallis entropy. Thus, the above results are\ncompatible with the principle of maximum Tsallis entropy dictating the internal\nstructure in dwarf galaxies and in the central region of massive galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 17:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Since event cameras are robust to\nthese challenging conditions, they have great potential to increase the\nreliability of robot vision. However, event-based vision has been held back by\nthe shortage of labeled datasets due to the novelty of event cameras. To\novercome this drawback, we propose a task transfer method to train models\ndirectly with labeled images and unlabeled event data. Compared to previous\napproaches, (i) our method transfers from single images to events instead of\nhigh frame rate videos, and (ii) does not rely on paired sensor data. To\nachieve this, we leverage the generative event model to split event features\ninto content and motion features. This split enables efficient matching between\nlatent spaces for events and images, which is crucial for successful task\ntransfer. Thus, our approach unlocks the vast amount of existing image datasets\nfor the training of event-based neural networks.

We find that more than 50% of our sample show an\nenhancement in H{\\alpha} over UV, suggesting recent bursts in star formation on\ntime scales of a few, to tens of megayears. We investigate these sources and\nfind that they are typically low-mass disky galaxies with normal sizes.

This type of methods includes a summarizer and a\ndiscriminator. The summarized video from the summarizer will be assumed as the\nfinal output, only if the video reconstructed from this summary cannot be\ndiscriminated from the original one by the discriminator. The primary problems\nof this GAN based methods are two folds. First, the summarized video in this\nway is a subset of original video with low redundancy and contains high\npriority events/entities. This summarization criterion is not enough. Second,\nthe training of the GAN framework is not stable. This paper proposes a novel\nEntity relationship Aware video summarization method (ERA) to address the above\nproblems. To be more specific, we introduce an Adversarial Spatio Temporal\nnetwork to construct the relationship among entities, which we think should\nalso be given high priority in the summarization. The GAN training problem is\nsolved by introducing the Wasserstein GAN and two newly proposed video\npatch/score sum losses. In addition, the score sum loss can also relieve the\nmodel sensitivity to the varying video lengths, which is an inherent problem\nfor most current video analysis tasks. Our method substantially lifts the\nperformance on the target benchmark datasets and exceeds the current\nleaderboard Rank 1 state of the art CSNet (2.1% F1 score increase on TVSum and\n3.1% F1 score increase on SumMe). We hope our straightforward yet effective\napproach will shed some light on the future research of unsupervised video\nsummarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 17:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

The common origin of these two effects\nallows us to probe the gravitomagnetic signal via their cross-correlations. In\nthis paper, we explore the possibility of detecting the gravitomagnetic field\nin $\\Lambda$CDM by cross-correlating the weak-lensing convergence field with\nthe CMB temperature map, which is imprinted with the kSZ signal. This approach\nallows us to extract the gravitomagnetic effect because the cross correlation\nbetween the standard Newtonian contribution to the weak-lensing convergence\nfield, $\\kappa_\\Phi$, and the kSZ effect is expected to vanish. We study the\ncross correlations with a suite of large-volume Newtonian $N$-body simulations\nand a small-volume, high-resolution, general-relativistic counterpart.

The ongoing ESA mission Gaia has already\ncollected its nominal 5 yr of mission data and might operate up to 10 yr.\n  Aims: Using detailed simulations, we estimate the number of BDs that could be\ndiscovered by Gaia astrometry, radial velocity, and photometric transits around\nmain sequence (V) and subgiants (IV) FGK host stars for a 5 and 10-yr mission.\n  Methods: Using a robust $\\Delta \\chi^2$ statistic we analyse the BD companion\ndetectability from the Besan\\c{c}on Galaxy population synthesis model\ncomplemented by Gaia DR2 data for the bright end, using the latest Gaia\nperformance and scanning law, and literature-based BD-parameter distributions.\n  Results: We report here reliable detection numbers ($\\Delta \\chi^2$>50) for a\n5-yr [10-yr] mission. Astrometry alone yields 28,000-42,000 [45,000-55,000]\ndetections out to several hundred pc [>kiloparsec], with the majority around G\nmagnitude 14-15 [14-16] and P>200 d.

Previous interpretations\nhave focused on continued injection by a central engine as the source of energy\nfor radio emission. We show that continuous energy injection is unnecessary;\nthe radio data can be explained by a single ejection of plasma that supplies\nall the energy needed. To support this assertion, we analyze the synchrotron\nself-absorbed spectra in terms of the equipartition model. Similar to previous\nanalyses, we find that the energy in the radio-emitting region increases\napproximately $\\propto t^{0.7}$ and the lengthscale of this region grows\n$\\propto t$ at a rate $\\simeq0.06c$. This event resembles the earliest stage of\na supernova remnant: because the ejected mass is much greater than the shocked\nexternal mass, its velocity remains unchanged, while the energy in shocked gas\ngrows with time. The radio-emitting material gains energy from the outflow, not\ncontinuing energy injection by the central object. Although energy injection\nfrom an accreting BH cannot be completely excluded, the energy injection rate\nis very different from the fallback luminosity, and maintaining constant\noutflow velocity requires fine-tuning demanding further physical explanation.\nIf the neutrino association is real, the energy injection needed is much\ngreater than for the radio emission, suggesting that the detected neutrino did\nnot arise from the radio-emitting region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 16:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

The Planes of Satellite Galaxies issue is maybe the best-known\nexample, with a rich field of research literature and an ongoing, controversial\ndebate on how much of a challenge it poses to the LCDM model of cosmology.\nAnother type of correlation, the apparent excess of close pairs of dwarf\ngalaxies, has received considerably less attention despite its reported tension\nwith LCDM expectations. With the expansion of proper motion measurements,\nlargely driven by Gaia, other peculiar phase-space correlations were uncovered\namong the Milky Way satellites. Examples are the tangential velocity excess of\nsatellites compared to cosmological expectations, and the unexpected preference\nof satellites to be close to pericenter. At the same time, other kinds of\ncorrelations have been found to be more in line with cosmological expectations,\nspecifically lopsided satellite galaxy systems and the accretion of groups of\nsatellite galaxies. The latter has mostly been studied in cosmological\nsimulations thus far, but offers the potential to address some of the other\nissues by providing a way to produce correlations among the orbits of a group's\nsatellite galaxy members.

Nonetheless, it\nrepresents a crucial stage for our understanding of the Universe, and in\nparticular of the conditions leading to the formation of key molecules (e.g.\nwater) on comets and planets. Herschel observations demonstrated that stars\nform out of gaseous filamentary structures in which the main constituent is\nmolecular hydrogen (H$_2$). Depending on its nuclear spin H$_2$ can be found in\ntwo forms: `ortho' with parallel spins and `para' where the spins are\nanti-parallel. The relative ratio among these isomers, i.e. the ortho-to-para\nratio (OPR), plays a crucial role in a variety of processes related to the\nthermodynamics of star-forming gas and to the fundamental chemistry affecting\nthe deuteration of water in molecular clouds, commonly used to determine the\norigin of water in Solar System's bodies.

For positive energy density in the\nscalar and fluid, each classical solution has a singularity and expands to\ninfinite volume. When quantising we view the cosmological dynamics in\nrelational terms, using one degree of freedom as a clock for the others. Three\nnatural candidates for this clock are the volume, a time variable conjugate to\nthe perfect fluid, and the scalar field. We have previously shown that\nrequiring unitary evolution in the \"fluid\" time leads to a boundary condition\nat the singularity and generic singularity resolution, while in the volume time\nsemiclassical states follow the classical singular trajectories. Here we\nanalyse the third option of using the scalar field as a clock, finding further\ndramatic differences to the previous cases: the boundary condition arising from\nunitarity is now at infinity. Rather than singularity resolution, this theory\nfeatures a quantum recollapse of the universe at large volume, as was shown in\na similar context by Paw{\\l}owski and Ashtekar. We illustrate the properties of\nthe theory analytically and numerically, showing that the ways in which the\ndifferent quantum theories do or do not depart from classical behaviour\ndirectly arise from demanding unitarity with respect to different clocks.

Present\ntheoretical models suffer from large uncertainties and degeneracies, for\nexample, between the fraction of accreting sources and their characteristic\naccretion rate. In recent work we showed that Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)\nclustering represents a powerful tool to break degeneracies when analysed in\nterms of mean BH mass, and that AGN bias at fixed stellar mass is largely\nindependent of most of the input parameters, such as the AGN duty cycle and the\nmean scaling between BH mass and host galaxy stellar mass. In this paper we\ntake advantage of our improved semi-empirical methodology and recent clustering\ndata derived from large AGN samples at $z \\sim 1.2$, demonstrate that the AGN\nbias as a function of host galaxy stellar mass is a crucial diagnostic of the\nBH--galaxy connection, and is highly dependent on the scatter around the BH\nmass--galaxy mass scaling relation and on the relative fraction of satellite\nand central active BHs. Current data at $z \\sim 1.2$ favour relatively high\nvalues of AGN in satellites, pointing to a major role of disc instabilities in\ntriggering AGN, unless a high minimum host halo mass is assumed.

We present high-resolution ALMA Band 7\nobservations of eight X-ray selected AGN at z~2 from the SUPER sample,\ntargeting the rest-frame ~260 um continuum at ~2 kpc (0.2'') resolution. We\ndetected 6 out of 8 targets with S/N>10 in the ALMA maps, with continuum flux\ndensities F = 0.27-2.58 mJy and FIR half-light radii Re = 0.8-2.1 kpc. The FIR\nRe of our sample are comparable to other AGN and star-forming galaxies at a\nsimilar redshift from the literature. However, we find that the mean FIR size\nin X-ray AGN (Re = 1.16+/- 0.11 kpc) is slightly smaller than in non-AGN (Re =\n1.69+/-0.13 kpc). From SED fitting, we find that the main contribution to the\n260 um flux density is dust heated by star formation, with < 4% contribution\nfrom AGN-heated dust and < 1% from synchrotron emission. The majority of our\nsample show different morphologies for the FIR (mostly due to reprocessed\nstellar emission) and the ionised gas emission (H$\\alpha$ and [OIII], mostly\ndue to AGN emission). This could be due to the different locations of dust and\nionised gas, the different sources of the emission (stars and AGN), or the\neffect of dust obscuration. We are unable to identify any residual H$\\alpha$\nemission, above that dominated by AGN, that could be attributed to star\nformation. Under the assumption that the FIR emission is a reliable tracer of\nobscured star formation, we find that the obscured star formation activity in\nthese AGN host galaxies is not clearly affected by the ionised outflows.\nHowever, we cannot rule out that star formation suppression is happening on\nsmaller spatial scales than the ones we probe with our observations (< 2 kpc)\nor on different timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 18:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

An Euler obstructed pairing channel\nmust have pairing nodes on the pairing-relevant Fermi surfaces, and the total\nwinding number of the pairing nodes is determined by the sum or difference of\nthe Euler numbers on the Fermi surfaces. In particular, we find that when the\nnormal state is time-reversal invariant and the pairing is weak, a\nsufficiently-dominant Euler obstructed pairing channel with zero total momentum\nleads to nodal superconductivity. If the Fermi surface splitting is small, the\nresultant nodal superconductor hosts hinge Majorana zero modes.

However, the quality of crowdsourcing image\nannotations cannot be guaranteed, and incompleteness and incorrectness are two\nmajor concerns for crowdsourcing annotations. To address such concerns, we have\na rethinking of crowdsourcing annotations: Our simple hypothesis is that if the\nannotators only partially annotate multi-label images with salient labels they\nare confident in, there will be fewer annotation errors and annotators will\nspend less time on uncertain labels.

In response, this paper proposes\nGraph-based Surrogate Models (GSMs) for trusses. The GSM can accurately predict\ndisplacement fields from static loads given the structure's geometry as input,\nenabling training across multiple parametrizations.

Examples from causal inference are Inverse\nProbability Weighting, Marginal Structural Models and Structural Nested Models.\nTo estimate treatment effects from observational data, these methods posit a\n(pooled) logistic regression model for the treatment and/or censoring\nprobabilities and estimate these first. These methods are all based on unbiased\nestimating equations. First, we provide a general formula for the variance of\nthe parameter of interest psi when the nuisance parameter theta is estimated in\na first step, using the Partition Inverse Formula. Then, we present 4 results\nfor estimators psi-hat based on unbiased estimating equations including a\nnuisance parameter theta which is estimated by solving (partial) score\nequations, if psi does not depend on theta. This regularly happens in causal\ninference if theta describes the treatment probabilities, in settings with\nmissing data where theta describes the missingness probabilities, and settings\nwith measurement error where theta describes the measurement error\ndistribution. 1. Counter-intuitively, the limiting variance of psi-hat is\ntypically smaller when theta is estimated, compared to if a known theta were\nplugged in. 2. If estimating theta is ignored, the resulting sandwich estimator\nfor the variance of psi-hat is conservative. 3. A consistent estimator for the\nvariance of psi-hat can provide results fast: no bootstrap. 4. If psi-hat with\nthe true theta plugged in is efficient, the limiting variance of psi-hat does\nnot depend on whether theta is estimated.

Although drones can\noperate in an autonomous mode, keeping inspectors in the loop is critical for\ncomplex tasks in bridge inspection. Therefore, inspectors need to develop the\nskill and confidence to operate drones in their jobs. This paper presents the\ndesign and development of a virtual reality-based training and assessment\nsystem for inspectors assisted by a drone in bridge inspection. The system is\ncomposed of four integrated modules: a simulated bridge inspection developed in\nUnity, an interface that allows a trainee to operate the drone in simulation\nusing a remote controller, data monitoring and analysis to provide real-time,\nin-task feedback to trainees to assist their learning, and a post-study\nassessment supporting personalized training. The paper also conducts a\nproof-of-concept pilot study to illustrate the functionality of this system.\nThe study demonstrated that TASBID, as a tool for the early-stage training, can\nobjectively identify the training needs of individuals in detail and, further,\nhelp them develop the skill and confidence in collaborating with a drone in\nbridge inspection. The system has built a modeling and analysis platform for\nexploring advanced solutions to the human-drone cooperative inspection of civil\ninfrastructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 19:29:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 19:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 23:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

The problem setting differs from those of the existing\nmethods for IE. First, the extraction can be carried out from long texts to\nlarge tables with complex structures. Second, the extraction is entirely\ndata-driven, and there is no need to explicitly define the schemas. As far as\nwe know, there has been no previous work that studies the problem. In this\nwork, we formalize text-to-table as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) problem.\nWe first employ a seq2seq model fine-tuned from a pre-trained language model to\nperform the task. We also develop a new method within the seq2seq approach,\nexploiting two additional techniques in table generation: table constraint and\ntable relation embeddings. We consider text-to-table as an inverse problem of\nthe well-studied table-to-text, and make use of four existing table-to-text\ndatasets in our experiments on text-to-table. Experimental results show that\nthe vanilla seq2seq model can outperform the baseline methods of using relation\nextraction and named entity extraction.

The computer vision (CV)-based crash anticipation\nin the near-crash phase is receiving growing attention. The ability to perceive\nfatal crash risks earlier is also critical because it will improve the\nreliability of crash anticipation. Yet, annotated image data for training a\nreliable AI model for the early visual perception of crash risks are not\nabundant. The Fatality Analysis Reporting System contains big data of fatal\ncrashes. It is a reliable data source for learning the relationship between\ndriving scene characteristics and fatal crashes to compensate for the\nlimitation of CV. Therefore, this paper develops a data analytics model, named\nscenario-wise, Spatio-temporal attention guidance, from fatal crash report\ndata, which can estimate the relevance of detected objects to fatal crashes\nfrom their environment and context information. First, the paper identifies\nfive sparse variables that allow for decomposing the 5-year fatal crash dataset\nto develop scenario-wise attention guidance. Then, exploratory analysis of\nlocation- and time-related variables of the crash report data suggests reducing\nfatal crashes to spatially defined groups. The group's temporal pattern is an\nindicator of the similarity of fatal crashes in the group. Hierarchical\nclustering and K-means clustering merge the spatially defined groups into six\nclusters according to the similarity of their temporal patterns. After that,\nassociation rule mining discovers the statistical relationship between the\ntemporal information of driving scenes with crash features, for each cluster.\nThe paper shows how the developed attention guidance supports the design and\nimplementation of a preliminary CV model that can identify objects of a\npossibility to involve in fatal crashes from their environment and context\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 19:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

The former approaches typically employ\n2-D image analysis/understanding or 3-D point cloud modeling and segmentation\nalgorithms to detect road potholes from vision sensor data. The latter\napproaches generally address road pothole detection using convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) in an end-to-end manner. However, road potholes are not\nnecessarily ubiquitous and it is challenging to prepare a large well-annotated\ndataset for CNN training. In this regard, while computer vision-based methods\nwere the mainstream research trend in the past decade, machine learning-based\nmethods were merely discussed. Recently, we published the first stereo\nvision-based road pothole detection dataset and a novel disparity\ntransformation algorithm, whereby the damaged and undamaged road areas can be\nhighly distinguished. However, there are no benchmarks currently available for\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) CNNs trained using either disparity images or\ntransformed disparity images. Therefore, in this paper, we first discuss the\nSoTA CNNs designed for semantic segmentation and evaluate their performance for\nroad pothole detection with extensive experiments. Additionally, inspired by\ngraph neural network (GNN), we propose a novel CNN layer, referred to as graph\nattention layer (GAL), which can be easily deployed in any existing CNN to\noptimize image feature representations for semantic segmentation. Our\nexperiments compare GAL-DeepLabv3+, our best-performing implementation, with\nnine SoTA CNNs on three modalities of training data: RGB images, disparity\nimages, and transformed disparity images.

To\nformalize this task, we introduce the \"data selection\" problem: finding a\nlower-dimensional statistic - such as a subset of variables - that is well fit\nby a given parametric model of interest. A fully Bayesian approach to data\nselection would be to parametrically model the value of the statistic,\nnonparametrically model the remaining \"background\" components of the data, and\nperform standard Bayesian model selection for the choice of statistic. However,\nfitting a nonparametric model to high-dimensional data tends to be highly\ninefficient, statistically and computationally. We propose a novel score for\nperforming both data selection and model selection, the \"Stein volume\ncriterion\", that takes the form of a generalized marginal likelihood with a\nkernelized Stein discrepancy in place of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The\nStein volume criterion does not require one to fit or even specify a\nnonparametric background model, making it straightforward to compute - in many\ncases it is as simple as fitting the parametric model of interest with an\nalternative objective function. We prove that the Stein volume criterion is\nconsistent for both data selection and model selection, and we establish\nconsistency and asymptotic normality (Bernstein-von Mises) of the corresponding\ngeneralized posterior on parameters.

The bootstrapping step is also the major\nefficiency bottleneck in current FHE schemes. A promising direction towards\nimproving concrete efficiency is to exploit the bootstrapping process to\nperform useful computation while reducing the noise at the same time.\n  We show a bootstrapping algorithm, which embeds a lookup table and evaluates\narbitrary functions of the plaintext while reducing the noise. Depending on the\nchoice of parameters, the resulting homomorphic encryption scheme may be either\nan exact FHE or homomorphic encryption for approximate arithmetic. Since we can\nevaluate arbitrary functions over the plaintext space, we can use the natural\nhomomorphism of Regev encryption to compute affine functions without\nbootstrapping almost for free. Consequently, our algorithms are particularly\nsuitable for circuits with many additions and scalar multiplication gates. We\nachieve record speeds for such circuits. For example, in the exact FHE setting,\nwe achieve a speedup of a factor of over 3000x over state-of-the-art methods.\nEffectively, we bring the evaluation time from weeks or days down to a few\nhours or minutes. Furthermore, we note that the speedup gets more significant\nwith the size of the affine function.\n  We provide a tight error analysis and show several parameter sets for our\nbootstrapping.

One of the possible ways to\nidentify the mass ordering is through the observation of the modulations that\nappear in the spectrum when neutrinos travel through the Earth before they\narrive at the detector. These features in the neutrino spectrum depend on two\nfactors, the average neutrino energies, and the difference between the primary\nneutrino fluxes of electron and other flavors produced inside the supernova.\nHowever, recent studies indicate that the Earth matter effect for CCSN\nneutrinos is expected to be rather small and difficult to be observed by\ncurrently operating or planned neutrino detectors mainly because of the\nsimilarity of average energies and fluxes between electron and other flavors of\nneutrinos, unless the distance to CCSN is significantly smaller than the\ntypically expected one, $\\sim 10$ kpc.

Jitter\nreduction is required by some real-time applications; beyond this, dampers have\nthe potential to solve the burstiness cascade problem of deterministic networks\nin a scalable way, as they can be stateless. Dampers exist in several variants:\nsome apply only to earliest-deadline-first schedulers, whereas others can be\nassociated with any packet schedulers; some enforce FIFO ordering whereas some\nothers do not. Existing analyses of dampers are specific to some\nimplementations and some network configurations; also, they assume ideal,\nnon-realistic clocks.

It is\ncurrently estimated that the smart speaker adoption rate has exceeded 35% in\nthe US adult population. Manufacturers have integrated speaker identification\ntechnology, which attempts to determine the identity of the person speaking, to\nprovide personalized services to different members of the same family. Speaker\nidentification can also play an important role in controlling how the smart\nspeaker is used. For example, it is not critical to correctly identify the user\nwhen playing music. However, when reading the user's email out loud, it is\ncritical to correctly verify the speaker that making the request is the\nauthorized user. Speaker verification systems, which authenticate the speaker\nidentity, are therefore needed as a gatekeeper to protect against various\nspoofing attacks that aim to impersonate the enrolled user.

Here we demonstrate that large-area\nmonocrystalline gold flakes, an atomically-flat low-loss substrate for image\npolaritons, provide a platform for precise near-field measurement of the\ncomplex propagation constant of polaritons in van der Waals crystals. As a\ntopical example, we measure propagation loss of the image phonon-polaritons in\nhexagonal boron nitride, revealing that their normalized propagation length\nexhibits a parabolic spectral dependency. Further, we show that image\nphonon-polaritons exhibit up to a twice lower normalized propagation loss,\nwhile being 2.4 times more compressed compared to the case of dielectric\nsubstrate.

The visual differences presented to the face have a significant effect\non the recognition capabilities of the kinship systems. We argue that\naggregating multiple visual knowledge can better describe the characteristics\nof the subject for precise kinship identification. Typically, the age-invariant\nfeatures can represent more natural facial details. Such age-related\ntransformations are essential for face recognition due to the biological\neffects of aging. However, the existing methods mainly focus on employing the\nsingle-view image features for kinship identification, while more meaningful\nvisual properties such as race and age are directly ignored in the feature\nlearning step. To this end, we propose a novel deep collaborative multi-modal\nlearning (DCML) to integrate the underlying information presented in facial\nproperties in an adaptive manner to strengthen the facial details for effective\nunsupervised kinship verification. Specifically, we construct a well-designed\nadaptive feature fusion mechanism, which can jointly leverage the complementary\nproperties from different visual perspectives to produce composite features and\ndraw greater attention to the most informative components of spatial feature\nmaps. Particularly, an adaptive weighting strategy is developed based on a\nnovel attention mechanism, which can enhance the dependencies between different\nproperties by decreasing the information redundancy in channels in a\nself-adaptive manner. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method,\nextensive experimental evaluations conducted on four widely-used datasets show\nthat our DCML method is always superior to some state-of-the-art kinship\nverification methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 01:34:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

In contrast, we propose a simple approach to\nexploit unlabeled data accompanying the few-shot task for improving few-shot\nperformance. Firstly, we propose a Dependency Maximization method based on the\nHilbert-Schmidt norm of the cross-covariance operator, which maximizes the\nstatistical dependency between the embedded feature of those unlabeled data and\ntheir label predictions, together with the supervised loss over the support\nset. We then use the obtained model to infer the pseudo-labels for those\nunlabeled data.

However, the deployment of IP\nmulticast services over the Internet has not been as rapid as expected and\nneeded. Excepting the fatal defects in designing IPv4 address structure.\nAnother main reason that contributes to this slow deployment is the lack of\ncarrier-grade multicast-enabled switches and routers that can be as to scale as\ntheir unicast counterparts. Implementing a high-performance switch/router\nrelies on a polynomial-time group membership query algorithm within the Packet\nForwarding Engines (PFEs) to determine whether or not a packet is forwarded\nthrough an egress. Among these, Bloom filter (BF)-based and Residue Number\nSystem (RNS)-based are being considered as two representations of the\nmembership query algorithms. However, both approaches suffer from some fatal\nweaknesses such as space and time inefficiencies, especially for a\ncarrier-grade PFE with high port-density features.

The simulation results\nindicate that the P3FA can significantly improve space efficiencies under\nspecific lower egress-diversities conditions.

The general setting consists of two phases: (1) Pre-train a\nfeature extraction model (FEM) with base data (has large amounts of labeled\nsamples). (2) Use the FEM to extract the features of novel data (with few\nlabeled samples and totally different categories from base data), then classify\nthem with the to-be-designed classifier. The adaptability of pre-trained FEM to\nnovel data determines the accuracy of novel features, thereby affecting the\nfinal classification performances. To this end, how to appraise the pre-trained\nFEM is the most crucial focus in the FSC community. It sounds like traditional\nClass Activate Mapping (CAM) based methods can achieve this by overlaying\nweighted feature maps. However, due to the particularity of FSC (e.g., there is\nno backpropagation when using the pre-trained FEM to extract novel features),\nwe cannot activate the feature map with the novel classes. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a simple, flexible method, dubbed as Class-Irrelevant\nMapping (CIM). Specifically, first, we introduce dictionary learning theory and\nview the channels of the feature map as the bases in a dictionary. Then we\nutilize the feature map to fit the feature vector of an image to achieve the\ncorresponding channel weights. Finally, we overlap the weighted feature map for\nvisualization to appraise the ability of pre-trained FEM on novel data. For\nfair use of CIM in evaluating different models, we propose a new measurement\nindex, called Feature Localization Accuracy (FLA). In experiments, we first\ncompare our CIM with CAM in regular tasks and achieve outstanding performances.\nNext, we use our CIM to appraise several classical FSC frameworks without\nconsidering the classification results and discuss them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 03:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

While the\norbital parameters of BaBb and AB are relatively well constrained, this is not\nthe case for AaAb. A full characterisation of this quadruple system can provide\ninsights on the formation of such a complex system.\n  The goal of this work is to determine the orbit of the AaAb subsystem and\nrefine the orbital solution of BaBb using multi-epoch interferometric\nobservations with the VLTI/PIONIER and radial velocities.\n  The PIONIER observations provide relative astrometric positions and flux\nratios for both AaAa and BaBb subsystems.

We confirmed the polar configuration of the\ncircumbinary disk around BaBb.

We discuss the lack of a disk around AaAb, which can be\nexplained by the larger X-ray luminosity of AaAb, promoting faster\nphoto-evaporation of the disk.

To remedy this issue, a new\nunsupervised hashing paradigm is further proposed based on the mutual\ninformation (MI) maximization principle. Specifically, the method first\nconstructs appropriate global and local codes from the documents and then seeks\nto maximize their mutual information.

Motivated by the emergence of collective behavior from complex\ncellular systems, we build systems that feed each sensory input from the\nenvironment into distinct, but identical neural networks, each with no fixed\nrelationship with one another.

Moreover, the system can still perform its task even if the ordering of\nits inputs is randomly permuted several times during an episode.

While potential sensitivity\nof simulation outputs to each single parameter is undoubted, one critical\nquestion is that to which class of parameters such numerical models are most\nsensitive when estimating evacuation times? The question is of significance\ngiven that available data and resources for calibration are limited and\npriorities often need to be made. Methods: Here, we employ a simulation model\nof evacuation comprised of multiple integrated layers. After providing an\noverview of the calibration procedure for key parameters, we perform extensive\nsensitivity analyses in complex simulated spaces with large crowds to answer\nthe above question. Findings: Our analyses showed that, once parameters are\ncontrasted on a consistent and comparable scale, estimates of simulated\nevacuation time are, by far margins, most sensitive to the value of mechanical\nmovement parameters at locomotion layer, those that determine the discharge\nrate at bottlenecks. The next most critical set of parameters were those that\ndetermine the rate of direction choice adaptation followed by those that\ndetermine the effect of inter-individual interactions on direction choices.\nConclusions: These results suggest that, in order to produce realistic\nevacuation times using simulation, the most critical aspect is, by far,\nperfecting the simulated flowrates at bottlenecks. Implications: This\nhighlights the crucial need for furthering the accuracy of existing empirical\nestimates for exit capacity; and developing more rigorous calibration methods\nfor parameters that determine flowrates at bottlenecks. If a model does not\nproduce bottleneck flowrates accurately, efforts to refine other aspects of\nsimulation might be in vain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 06:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

The MTGR allows the simple estimation of the masses\nof stars from their effective temperatures and surface gravities. It can be\nused for solar metallicity and can be rescaled for any metallicity within -1.00\n< [Fe/H] < 0.7. The effect of alpha-enhanced compositions can also be\nconsidered with the help of correction terms.\n  It is aimed to develop an MTGR that can estimate the masses of main-sequence\nstars from their atmospheric parameters. One advantage of an MTGR over the\nclassical mass-luminosity relations is that its mass estimation is based on\nparameters that can be obtained by purely spectroscopic methods and, therefore,\nthe interstellar extinction or reddening do not have to be known. The use of\nsurface gravity ($g$) also relates an MTGR with stellar evolution and provides\na more reliable mass estimation.\n  A synthetical MTGR is obtained from theoretical isochrones using a\nLevenberg-Marquardt chi-square minimization algorithm. The validity of the MTGR\nis then checked by testing over 278 binary components with precise absolute\nmasses. Very good agreement has been obtained between the absolute masses of\n278 binary star components and their masses estimated from the MTGR. A\nmathematical expression is also given to calculate the propagated uncertainties\nof the MTGR masses.\n  For the typical uncertainties in atmospheric parameters and metallicity, the\ntypical uncertainties in the masses estimated from the MTGR mostly remain\naround 5-9%. The fact that this uncertainty level is only on average about\nthree times as large as that of the absolute masses indicates that the MTGR is\na very powerful tool for stellar mass estimation. A computer code, mtgr.pro,\nwritten in GDL/IDL is also provided for the relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 06:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

In practice, though, specific\ninterventions consume resources with finite capacity. For example, in a loan\norigination process, an intervention may consist of preparing an alternative\nloan offer to increase the applicant's chances of taking a loan. This\nintervention requires a certain amount of time from a credit officer, and thus,\nit is not possible to trigger this intervention in all cases. This paper\nproposes a prescriptive process monitoring technique that triggers\ninterventions to optimize a cost function under fixed resource constraints. The\nproposed technique relies on predictive modeling to identify cases that are\nlikely to lead to a negative outcome, in combination with causal inference to\nestimate the effect of an intervention on the outcome of the case. These\noutputs are then used to allocate resources to interventions to maximize a cost\nfunction.

It is still not clear yet\nwhat controls the spectral evolution of these objects from the hard to the soft\nstates and then back to the hard states at the end of the outburst, tracing the\nwell-known hysteresis cycle in the hardness-intensity diagram. Moreover, the\nlink between the spectral states and the presence/absence of radio emission is\nstill highly debated. In a series of papers, we developed a model composed of a\ntruncated outer standard accretion disk (SAD, from the solution of Shakura and\nSunyaev) and an inner jet emitting disk (JED). In this paradigm, the JED plays\nthe role of the hot corona while simultaneously explaining the presence of a\nradio jet. Our goal is to apply for the first time direct fitting procedures of\nthe JED-SAD model to the hard states of four outbursts of GX 339-4 observed\nduring the 2000-2010 decade by RXTE, combined with simultaneous or quasi\nsimultaneous ATCA observations. We built JED-SAD model tables usable in Xspec\nas well as a reflection model table based on the Xillver model. We apply our\nmodel to the 452 hard state observations obtained with RXTE/PCA. We were able\nto correctly fit the X-ray spectra and simultaneously reproduce the radio flux.\nWe show that the functional dependency of the radio emission on the model\nparameters (mainly the accretion rate and the transition radius between the JED\nand the SAD) is similar between all the rising phases of the different\noutbursts of GX 339-4. But it is significantly different from the functional\ndependency obtained in the decaying phases. This result strongly suggests a\nchange in the radiative and/or dynamical properties of the ejection between the\nbeginning and the end of the outburst. We discuss possible scenarios that could\nexplain these differences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 06:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

The eruptive prominence experiences a slow-rise and\nfast-rise phase, while the line-of-sight motions of the prominence plasma could\nbe divided into three periods: two hours before the fast-rise phase, opposite\nDoppler shifts are found at the two sides of the prominence axis;then, red\nshifts dominate the prominence gradually; in the fast-rise phase, the\nprominence gets to be blue-shifted. During the second period, a faint component\nappears in Mg II k window with a narrow line width and a large red shift. A\nfaint region is also found in AIA 304-angstrom images along the prominence\nspine, and the faint region gets darker during the expansion of the spine. We\npropose that the opposite Doppler shifts in the first period are a feature of\nthe polar crown prominence that we studied. The red shifts in the second period\nare possibly due to mass drainage during the elevation of the prominence spine,\nwhich could accelerate the eruption in return. The blue shifts in the third\nperiod are due to that the prominence erupts toward the observer.

Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of Fishr for out-of-distribution generalization. Notably,\nFishr improves the state of the art on the DomainBed benchmark and performs\nconsistently better than Empirical Risk Minimization.

A proper estimate of the chromospheric magnetic fields is believed\nto improve modelling of both active region and coronal mass ejection evolution.\nAims. We investigate the similarity between the chromospheric magnetic field\ninferred from observations and the field obtained from a magnetohydrostatic\n(MHS) extrapolation. Methods. Based Fe i 6173 {\\AA} and Ca ii 8542 {\\AA}\nobservations of NOAA active region 12723, we employed the spatially-regularised\nweak-field approximation (WFA) to derive the vector magnetic field in the\nchromosphere from Ca ii, as well as non-LTE inversions of Fe i and Ca ii to\ninfer a model atmosphere for selected regions. Milne-Eddington inversions of Fe\ni serve as photospheric boundary for the MHS model that delivers the\nthree-dimensional field, gas pressure and density. Results. For the\nline-of-sight component, the MHS chromospheric field generally agrees with the\nnon-LTE inversions and WFA, but tends to be weaker than those when larger in\nmagnitude than 300 G. The observationally inferred transverse component is\nstronger, especially in magnetically weaker regions, yet the qualitative\ndistribution with height is similar to the MHS results. For either field\ncomponent the MHS chromospheric field lacks the fine structure derived from the\ninversions. Furthermore, the MHS model does not recover the magnetic imprint\nfrom a set of high fibrils connecting the main polarities. Conclusions. The MHS\nextrapolation and WFA provide a qualitatively similar chromospheric field,\nwhere the azimuth of the former is better aligned with Ca ii 8542 {\\AA} fibrils\nthan that of the WFA, especially outside strong-field concentrations. The\namount of structure as well as the transverse field strengths are\nunderestimated by the MHS extrapolation.

These can be\nthe forcing and boundary conditions, the representation of orography, the\naccuracy of the numerical schemes determining the evolution of humidity and\ntemperature, but large contributions are due to the parametrization of\nmicrophysics and the parametrization of processes in the surface and boundary\nlayers. These schemes typically contain several tunable parameters that are\neither not physical or only crudely known, leading to model errors.\nTraditionally, the numerical values of these model parameters are chosen by\nmanual model tuning. More objectively, they can be estimated from observations\nby the augmented state approach during the data assimilation. Alternatively, in\nthis work, we look at the problem of parameter estimation through an artificial\nintelligence lens by training two types of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to\nestimate several parameters of the one-dimensional modified shallow-water model\nas a function of the observations or analysis of the atmospheric state. Through\nperfect model experiments, we show that Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and\nBayesian approximations of point estimate neural networks (NNs) are able to\nestimate model parameters and their relevant statistics. The estimation of\nparameters combined with data assimilation for the state decreases the initial\nstate errors even when assimilating sparse and noisy observations. The\nsensitivity to the number of ensemble members, observation coverage, and neural\nnetwork size is shown. Additionally, we use the method of layer-wise relevance\npropagation to gain insight into how the ANNs are learning and discover that\nthey naturally select only a few gridpoints that are subject to strong winds\nand rain to make their predictions of chosen parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 09:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

One of their key features is autoscaling, which\nautomatically adjusts cloud resources (compute, memory, storage) in order to\nadapt to the demands of applications. However, the scope of cloud autoscaling\nis limited to the datacenter hosting the cloud and it doesn't apply uniformly\nto the allocation of network resources. In I/O-constrained or data-in-motion\nuse cases this can lead to severe performance degradation for the application.\nFor example, when the load on a cloud service increases and the Wide Area\nNetwork (WAN) connecting the datacenter to the Internet becomes saturated, the\napplication flows experience an increase in delay and loss. In many cases this\nis dealt with overprovisioning network capacity, which introduces additional\ncosts and inefficiencies.\n  On the other hand, thanks to the concept of \"Network as Code\", the WAN\nexposes a set of APIs that can be used to dynamically allocate and de-allocate\ncapacity on-demand. In this paper we propose extending the concept of cloud\nautoscaling into the network to address this limitation. This way, applications\nrunning in the cloud can communicate their networking requirements, like\nbandwidth or traffic profile, to a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller\nor Network as a Service (NaaS) platform. Moreover, we aim to define the\nconcepts of vertical and horizontal autoscaling applied to networking.

However, without the paired data as the supervision,\nlearning a SID network is challenging. Moreover, simply using existing unpaired\nlearning methods (e.g., unpaired adversarial learning and cycle-consistency\nconstraints) in the SID task is insufficient to learn the underlying\nrelationship from rainy inputs to clean outputs as there exists significant\ndomain gap between the rainy and clean images. In this paper, we develop an\neffective unpaired SID adversarial framework which explores mutual properties\nof the unpaired exemplars by a dual contrastive learning manner in a deep\nfeature space, named as DCD-GAN. The proposed method mainly consists of two\ncooperative branches: Bidirectional Translation Branch (BTB) and Contrastive\nGuidance Branch (CGB). Specifically, BTB exploits full advantage of the\ncirculatory architecture of adversarial consistency to generate abundant\nexemplar pairs and excavates latent feature distributions between two domains\nby equipping it with bidirectional mapping. Simultaneously, CGB implicitly\nconstrains the embeddings of different exemplars in the deep feature space by\nencouraging the similar feature distributions closer while pushing the\ndissimilar further away, in order to better facilitate rain removal and help\nimage restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs\nfavorably against existing unpaired deraining approaches on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, and generates comparable results against several\nfully-supervised or semi-supervised models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 10:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 10:08:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 05:22:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 05:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

However, when used in\nvideo inpainting that requires fine-grained representation, existed method\nstill suffers from yielding blurry edges in detail due to the hard patch\nsplitting. Here we aim to tackle this problem by proposing FuseFormer, a\nTransformer model designed for video inpainting via fine-grained feature fusion\nbased on novel Soft Split and Soft Composition operations. The soft split\ndivides feature map into many patches with given overlapping interval. On the\ncontrary, the soft composition operates by stitching different patches into a\nwhole feature map where pixels in overlapping regions are summed up. These two\nmodules are first used in tokenization before Transformer layers and\nde-tokenization after Transformer layers, for effective mapping between tokens\nand features. Therefore, sub-patch level information interaction is enabled for\nmore effective feature propagation between neighboring patches, resulting in\nsynthesizing vivid content for hole regions in videos. Moreover, in FuseFormer,\nwe elaborately insert the soft composition and soft split into the feed-forward\nnetwork, enabling the 1D linear layers to have the capability of modelling 2D\nstructure. And, the sub-patch level feature fusion ability is further enhanced.\nIn both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our proposed FuseFormer\nsurpasses state-of-the-art methods.

Though social media provide platforms for expressing\nnews and views, it is hard to control the quality of posts due to the sheer\nvolumes of posts on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Misinformation and\nrumours have lasting effects on society, as they tend to influence people's\nopinions and also may motivate people to act irrationally. It is therefore very\nimportant to detect and remove rumours from these platforms. The only way to\nprevent the spread of rumours is through automatic detection and classification\nof social media posts. Our focus in this paper is the Twitter social medium, as\nit is relatively easy to collect data from Twitter. The majority of previous\nstudies used supervised learning approaches to classify rumours on Twitter.\nThese approaches rely on feature extraction to obtain both content and context\nfeatures from the text of tweets to distinguish rumours and non-rumours.\nManually extracting features however is time-consuming considering the volume\nof tweets. We propose a novel approach to deal with this problem by utilising\nsentence embedding using BERT to identify rumours on Twitter, rather than the\nusual feature extraction techniques. We use sentence embedding using BERT to\nrepresent each tweet's sentences into a vector according to the contextual\nmeaning of the tweet. We classify those vectors into rumours or non-rumours by\nusing various supervised learning techniques. Our BERT based models improved\nthe accuracy by approximately 10% as compared to previous methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 10:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

Polarization measurements of the GRB prompt emission have long\nbeen theorized to be able to answer most of these questions. The POLAR detector\nwas a dedicated GRB polarimeter developed by a Swiss, Chinese and Polish\ncollaboration. The instrument was launched, together with the second Chinese\nSpace Lab, the Tiangong-2, in September 2016 after which it took 6 months of\nscientific data. During this period POLAR detected 55 GRBs as well as several\npulsars. From the analysis of the GRB polarization catalog we see that the\nprompt emission is lowly polarized or fully unpolarized. There is, however, the\ncaveat that within single pulses there are strong hints of an evolving\npolarization angle which washes out the polarization degree in the time\nintegrated analysis. Building on the success of the POLAR mission, the POLAR-2\ninstrument is currently under development. POLAR-2 is a Swiss, Chinese, Polish\nand German collaboration and was recently approved for launch in 2024. Thanks\nto its large sensitivity POLAR-2 will produce polarization measurements of at\nleast 50 GRBs per year with a precision equal or higher than the best results\npublished by POLAR. POLAR-2 thereby aims to make the prompt polarization a\nstandard observable and produce catalogs of the gamma-ray polarization of GRBs.\nHere we will present an overview of the POLAR mission and all its scientific\nmeasurement results. Additionally, we will present an overview of the future\nPOLAR-2 mission, and how it will answer some of the questions raised by the\nPOLAR results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 10:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

A fundamental part of such systems is\nthe sandbox that provides an instrumented and isolated environment (virtualized\nor emulated) for any user to upload and run unknown artifacts and identify\npotentially malicious behaviors. The provided API and the wealth of information\ninthe reports produced by these services have also helped attackers test the\nefficacy of numerous techniques to make malware hard to detect.The most common\ntechnique used by malware for evading the analysis system is to monitor the\nexecution environment, detect the presence of any debugging artifacts, and hide\nits malicious behavior if needed. This is usually achieved by looking for\nsignals suggesting that the execution environment does not belong to a the\nnative machine, such as specific memory patterns or behavioral traits of\ncertain CPU instructions.\n  In this paper, we show how an attacker can evade detection on such online\nservices by incorporating a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm into a malware\nsample. Specifically, we leverage the asymptotic behavior of the computational\ncost of PoW algorithms when they run on some classes of hardware platforms to\neffectively detect a non bare-metal environment of the malware sandbox\nanalyzer. To prove the validity of this intuition, we design and implement the\nPOW-HOW framework, a tool to automatically implement sandbox detection\nstrategies and embed a test evasion program into an arbitrary malware sample.\nOur empirical evaluation shows that the proposed evasion technique is durable,\nhard to fingerprint, and reduces existing malware detection rate by a factor of\n10.

It mainly utilizes\ntwo schemes: sample reweighting and feature matching. While the first scheme\nallocates different weights to individual samples, the second scheme matches\nthe feature of two domains using global structural statistics. The two schemes\nare complementary with each other, which are expected to jointly work for\nrobust domain adaptation. Several methods combine the two schemes, but the\nunderlying relationship of samples is insufficiently analyzed due to the\nneglect of the hierarchy of samples and the geometric properties between\nsamples. To better combine the advantages of the two schemes, we propose a\nGrassmannian graph-attentional landmark selection (GGLS) framework for domain\nadaptation. GGLS presents a landmark selection scheme using attention-induced\nneighbors of the graphical structure of samples and performs distribution\nadaptation and knowledge adaptation over Grassmann manifold. the former treats\nthe landmarks of each sample differently, and the latter avoids feature\ndistortion and achieves better geometric properties.

Second, the former does not\nallow any assumption about the context when locally reasoning about a module\nwhile the latter allows rich assumptions.

Mitigating concept drift is an essential part of operationalizing\nmachine learning models in general, but is of particular importance in\nnetworking's highly dynamic deployment environments. In this paper, we first\ncharacterize concept drift in a large cellular network for a major metropolitan\narea in the United States. We find that concept drift occurs across many\nimportant key performance indicators (KPIs), independently of the model,\ntraining set size, and time interval -- thus necessitating practical approaches\nto detect, explain, and mitigate it. We then show that frequent model\nretraining with newly available data is not sufficient to mitigate concept\ndrift, and can even degrade model accuracy further. Finally, we develop a new\nmethodology for concept drift mitigation, Local Error Approximation of Features\n(LEAF). LEAF works by detecting drift; explaining the features and time\nintervals that contribute the most to drift; and mitigates it using forgetting\nand over-sampling. We evaluate LEAF against industry-standard mitigation\napproaches (notably, periodic retraining) with more than four years of cellular\nKPI data.

On the other hand, also the\nclass of processes featured by the detection of a single forward object in\nlepton-proton collision offers the opportunity to develop intriguing\nphenomenological studies. In particular, the exclusive leptoproduction of light\nvector mesons, $\\rho$ and $\\phi$, is exhaustively investigated. In this\ncontext, the study of helicity-dependent observables allows us to discriminate\namong several unintegrated gluon distribution models, whose original definition\nnaturally encodes the BFKL-equation evolution dynamics. This kind of parton\ndensity allows us to get access to the hadronic structure at small-$x$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 12:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

The samples were made under various conditions. Photoelectric\npolarization of samples due to the Dember effect has been registered. The\nsignal was recorded under the conditions of a space charge limited current. The\nspace charge resulting from the capture of electrons and holes creates a static\nelectric field that prevents diffusion of released charge carriers. The current\nregistration in the external circuit stops, despite the continuation of\nphotoexcitation. This effect was used as a fact of measuring the photocurrent\nin the sample volume instead of the parasitic current that is not associated\nwith the sample. The screen has been chosen to prevent the influence of a\nspurious signal. It has been found that charge carriers are released when\nexcited in the spectral absorption range of localized states of silica. Based\non the Dember effect, the sign of the photoelectric response shows the type of\ncharge carriers - an electron or a hole is mobile. Thus, a sample containing\naluminum without alkali ions gives a negative signal, which indicates the\ndiffusion of electrons at 290 K, since aluminum is an effective hole trap. An\noxygen-deficient sample at 290 K provides a positive signal indicating the\ndiffusion of holes, because the center of oxygen deficiency is an effective\nelectron trap.

Dust production in high-redshift galaxies could be\ndominated by stellar production or by accretion (dust growth) in the\ninterstellar medium. Previous studies have shown that these two dust sources\npredict different grain size distributions, which lead to significantly\ndifferent extinction curves. In this paper, we investigate how the difference\nin the extinction curves affects the dust attenuation properties of galaxies by\nperforming radiative transfer calculations. To examine the major effects of the\ndust--stars distribution geometry, we adopt two representative cases in\nspherical symmetry: the well-mixed geometry (stars and dust are homogeneously\nmixed) and the two-layer geometry (young stars are more concentrated in the\ncentre). In both cases, we confirm that the attenuation curve can be\ndrastically steepened by scattering and by different optical depths between\nyoung and old stellar populations, and can be flattened by the existence of\nunobscured stellar populations. We can reproduce similar attenuation curves\neven with very different extinction curves. Thus, we conclude that it is\ndifficult to distinguish the dust sources only with attenuation curves.\nHowever, if we include information on dust emission and plot the IRX (infrared\nexcess)--$\\beta$ (ultraviolet spectral slope) relation, different dust sources\npredict different positions in the IRX--$\\beta$ diagram. A larger $\\beta$ is\npreferred under a similar IRX if dust growth is the dominant dust source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 13:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

Instead of training an end-to-end RL\nmodel, a novel policy gradient approach with TD3 backbone is proposed to learn\nthe racket strokes based on the predicted state of the ball at the hitting\ntime. In the experiments, we show that the proposed approach significantly\noutperforms the existing RL methods in simulation. Furthermore, to cross the\ndomain from simulation to reality, we adopt an efficient retraining method and\ntest it in three real scenarios. The resulting success rate is 98% and the\ndistance error is around 24.9 cm. The total training time is about 1.5 hours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 14:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 14:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

In the hypothesis that the scale of new physics is considerably\nhigher than the energies probed at colliders, we can parametrise modified\ninteractions induced by BSM effects among SM particles in a model-independent\nframework, the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Searches for\nindirect evidence of new physics are conceptually different from the direct\nones that have characterised the first part of the LHC program, and both\nexperimental and phenomenological studies are needed in order to maximise the\nchances of uncovering a BSM signal. In this thesis, several phenomenological\naspects of the SMEFT are discussed, both at present and future colliders. A\ncharacteristic feature of modified interactions is that they can induce\nunitarity violating effects which can be exploited to gain sensitivity. In this\ndirection, a thorough study of the top quark electroweak sector will be\npresented, focusing on 2 to 2 scatterings and their embeddings in physical\nprocesses at colliders. This analysis allows us to identify several final\nstates that have a good potential to explore the SMEFT parameter space and that\ncould be particularly relevant in a global analysis. One of the key features of\nthe SMEFT is indeed that deviations from the SM interactions are correlated and\nglobal interpretations are therefore of fundamental importance. A combined\ninterpretation of the Higgs, top and diboson data from the LHC is here\npresented and the interplay between the various datasets discussed. Finally,\nthe physics potential of a futuristic muon collider will be analysed, focusing\nin particular on the prospects to determine the Higgs self-interactions, a task\nthat is arduous even in proposed 100 TeV proton colliders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 14:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

To address this, different solutions have\nbeen proposed that build execution schedules in an energy-efficient manner.\nIssue time prediction processors are one such solution that use data-flow\ndependencies and predefined instruction latencies to predict issue times of\nrepeated instructions. In this work, we aim to improve their accuracy, and\nconsequently their performance, in an energy efficient way. We accomplish this\nby taking advantage of two key observations. First, memory accesses often take\nadditional time to arrive than the static, predefined access latency that is\nused to describe these systems. Second, we find that these memory access delays\noften repeat across iterations of the same code. This, in turn, allows us to\npredict the arrival time of these accesses.\n  In this work, we introduce a new processor microarchitecture, that replaces a\ncomplex reservation-station-based scheduler with an efficient, scalable\nalternative. Our proposed scheduling technique tracks real-time delays of loads\nto accurately predict instruction issue times, and uses a reordering mechanism\nto prioritize instructions based on that prediction, achieving\nclose-to-out-of-order processor performance. To accomplish this in an\nenergy-efficient manner we introduce: (1) an instruction delay learning\nmechanism that monitors repeated load instructions and learns their latest\ndelay, (2) an issue time predictor that uses learned delays and data-flow\ndependencies to predict instruction issue times and (3) priority queues that\nreorder instructions based on their issue time prediction.

Since such effects may be found in\nvarious types of macroscopic oscillators, we consider the application of the LG\napproach to the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and also to more\ngeneral bound systems, using a single dichotomic variable $Q$ given by the sign\nof the oscillator position. We present a simple method to calculate the\ntemporal correlation functions appearing in the LG inequalities for any bound\nsystem for which the eigenspectrum is (exactly or numerically) known. We apply\nthis result to the quantum harmonic oscillator for a variety of experimentally\naccessible states, namely energy eigenstates, and superpositions thereof. For\nthe subspace of states spanned by only the ground state and first excited\nstate, we readily find substantial regions of parameter space in which the LG\ninequalities at two, three and four times can each be independently violated or\nsatisfied. We also find that the violations persist, although are reduced, when\nthe sign function defining $Q$ is smeared to reflect experimental imprecision.\nFor higher energy eigenstates, we find that LG violations diminish, showing the\nexpected classicalization. With a $Q$ defined using a more general type of\nposition coarse graining, we find two-time LG violations even in the ground\nstate. We also show that two-time LG violations in a gaussian state are readily\nfound if the dichotomic variable at one of the times is taken to be the parity\noperator. To demonstrate the versatility of the approach, we repeat much of the\nLG analysis for the Morse potential, finding qualitatively similar physical\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 14:27:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 13:01:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 17:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

One of the key\ncharacteristic of SNSPDs is their detection rate, which is typically higher\nthan other types of free-running single-photondetectors. The maximum achievable\nrate is limited by the detector recovery time after a detection, which itself\nis linked to the superconducting material properties and to the geometry of the\nmeandered SNSPD. Arrays of detectors biased individually can be used to solve\nthis issue, but this approach significantly increases both the thermal load in\nthe cryo-stat and the need for time processing of the many signals, and this\nscales unfavorably with a large number of detectors. One potential scalable\napproach to increase the detection rate of individual detectors further is\nbased on parallelizing smaller meander sections. In this way, a single\ndetection temporarily disables only one subsection of the whole active area,\nthereby leaving the overall detection efficiency mostly unaffected. In practice\nhowever, cross-talk between parallel nanowires typically leads to latching,\nwhich prevents high detection rates. Here we show how this problem can be\navoided through a careful design of the whole SNSPD structure. Using the same\nelectronic readout as with conventional SNSPDs and a single coaxial line, we\ndemonstrate detection rates over 200 MHz without any latching, and a\nfibre-coupled SDE as high as 77%, and more than 50% average SDE per photon at\n50 MHz detection rate under continuous wave illumination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 14:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

We show that the EOMs used in the projector splitting\nintegrator (PSI) and the invariant EOMs approaches are two special cases of\nthis family obtained from different choices for the dynamic gauge condition,\nwith the invariant EOMs making use of a choice that introduces potentially\nunbounded operators into the EOMs. As a consequence, all arguments for the\nexistence of parallelizable integration schemes for the invariant EOMs can also\nbe applied to the PSI EOMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 14:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

To alleviate such bottlenecks, we propose to utilize edge computing by\nequipping edge nodes that are close to cameras with computing resources (e.g.\ncloudlets). A cloudlet, with limited computing resources as compared to TMC,\nprovides limited video processing capabilities. In this paper, we focus on two\ncommon traffic monitoring tasks, congestion detection, and speed detection, and\npropose a two-tier edge computing based model that takes into account of both\nthe limited computing capability in cloudlets and the unstable network\ncondition to the TMC. Our solution utilizes two algorithms for each task, one\nimplemented at the edge and the other one at the TMC, which are designed with\nthe consideration of different computing resources. While the TMC provides\nstrong computation power, the video quality it receives depends on the\nunderlying network conditions. On the other hand, the edge processes very\nhigh-quality video but with limited computing resources. Our model captures\nthis trade-off. We evaluate the performance of the proposed two-tier model as\nwell as the traffic monitoring algorithms via test-bed experiments under\ndifferent weather as well as network conditions and show that our proposed\nhybrid edge-cloud solution outperforms both the cloud-only and edge-only\nsolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 15:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

In general, these parameter estimations from different methods show good\nagreement, and the stellar parameter values are consistent with those of\nAPOGEE. We use the $Gaia$ DR2 RV data to calculate a median RV zero point\n(RVZP) for each spectrograph exposure by exposure, and the RVZP-corrected RVs\nagree well with the APOGEE data. The stellar evolutionary and spectroscopic\nmasses are estimated based on the stellar parameters, multi-band magnitudes,\ndistances and extinction values. Finally, we construct a binary catalog\nincluding about 2700 candidates by analyzing their light curves, fitting the RV\ndata, calculating the binarity parameters from med-resolution spectra, and\ncross-matching the spatially resolved binary catalog from $Gaia$ EDR3.

Here we develop a general theory of the\nelectron band structure for such commensurate and incommensurate bilayer carbon\nstructures within the tight binding approximation. To model the band structure\nof commensurate twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG), we apply the classic zone\nfolding theory. The latter leads us to the construction of TBLG Hamiltonians in\nthe basis of shifted Bloch wave functions (SBWF), which, in contrast to the\nusual Bloch functions, have the wave vector q shifted by a set of vectors Q_i.\nThe dimension of the considered Hamiltonians is equal to 4T, where the factor T\nis a number of vertices Q_i of the folded reciprocal space falling into the\noriginal first Brillouin zone of any of the layers.

In this setting, the possibility to efficiently\nsample at random (with a known distribution, e.g., uniformly) within, or to\nefficiently enumerate (possibly in a uniformly random order) scenarios among\nthose satisfying the given constraints is a key enabler for the viability of\nthe verification process, e.g., via simulation-based statistical model\nchecking.

To that end, this paper\nproposes generating a single-target abundance mineral map for DLM, where the\ngenerated map can further be used as a guide for the selection or avoidance of\na field survey. For that, a stochastic cancellation-based methodology was used\nto generate a site-specific endemic signature for the mineral in concern to\nreduce the inclusive nature otherwise present in DLM. Furthermore, a soil pixel\nalignment strategy to visualize the relative purity level of the target mineral\nhas been introduced in the proposed work. Then, for the method validation,\nmapping of limestone deposits in the Jaffna peninsula of Sri Lanka was\nconducted as the case study using satellite-based spectral imaging as the\ninput. It was observed that despite the low signal-to-noise ratio of the input\nhyperspectral data the proposed methodology was able to robustly extract the\nrich information contained in the input data. Further, a field survey was\nconducted to collect soil samples of four sites chosen by the proposed DLM from\nthe Jaffna peninsula as an algorithm validation and to demonstrate the\napplication of the proposed solution. The proposed abundance threshold of 0.1\ncoincided with the industrial standard X-ray diffraction (XRD) threshold of 5%\nfor the mineral presence. The results of the XRD test validated the use of the\nalgorithm in the selection of sites to be surveyed, hence could avoid\nconducting a costly field survey on the assumption of the existence of a\nmineral.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 16:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

Sampling the system at maximum\nfrequency results in the detection of events of interest with minimum delay but\nincurs higher energy costs due to the communication and processing of redundant\nsamples. On the other hand, lower sampling frequency results in higher delay in\ndetecting the event, thus increasing the idle energy usage and degrading the\nquality of experience. We quantify this trade-off as a weighted function\nbetween the number of samples and the sampling interval. We solve the\nminimisation problem for exponential and Rayleigh distributions, for the random\ntime to the event of interest. We prove the convexity of the objective\nfunctions by using novel techniques, which can be of independent interest\nelsewhere. We argue that adding an initial offset to the periodic sampling can\nfurther reduce the energy consumption and jointly compute the optimum offset\nand sampling interval. We apply our framework to two practically relevant\napplications and show energy savings of up to 36% when compared to an existing\nperiodic scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 10:55:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Deep learning inspired Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a proficient\ntechnique that outperforms traditional machine translation. Performing\nmachine-aided translation on Indic languages has always been a challenging task\nconsidering their rich and diverse grammar. The neural machine translation has\nshown quality results compared to the traditional machine translation\napproaches. The fully automatic machine translation becomes problematic when it\ncomes to low-resourced languages, especially with Sanskrit. This paper presents\nattention mechanism based neural machine translation by selectively focusing on\na particular part of language sentences during translation. The work shows the\nconstruction of Sanskrit to Hindi bilingual parallel corpus with nearly 10K\nsamples and having 178,000 tokens. The neural translation model equipped with\nan attention mechanism has been trained on Sanskrit to Hindi parallel corpus.\nThe approach has shown the significance of attention mechanisms to overcome\nlong-term dependencies, primarily associated with low resources Indic\nlanguages. The paper shows the attention plots on testing data to demonstrate\nthe alignment between source and translated words. For the evaluation of the\ntranslated sentences, manual score based human evaluation and automatic\nevaluation metric based techniques have been adopted.
