Network solutions are tuned meticulously for each task, and\ndesigns that can robustly resolve queries end up in high demand. As the\ncommercial value of accurate and performant machine learning models increases,\nso too does the demand to protect neural architectures as confidential\ninvestments. We explore the vulnerability of neural networks deployed as black\nboxes across accelerated hardware through electromagnetic side channels. We\nexamine the magnetic flux emanating from a graphics processing unit's power\ncable, as acquired by a cheap $3 induction sensor, and find that this signal\nbetrays the detailed topology and hyperparameters of a black-box neural network\nmodel. The attack acquires the magnetic signal for one query with unknown input\nvalues, but known input dimensions. The network reconstruction is possible due\nto the modular layer sequence in which deep neural networks are evaluated. We\nfind that each layer component's evaluation produces an identifiable magnetic\nsignal signature, from which layer topology, width, function type, and sequence\norder can be inferred using a suitably trained classifier and a joint\nconsistency optimization based on integer programming. We study the extent to\nwhich network specifications can be recovered, and consider metrics for\ncomparing network similarity. We demonstrate the potential accuracy of this\nside channel attack in recovering the details for a broad range of network\narchitectures, including random designs. We consider applications that may\nexploit this novel side channel exposure, such as adversarial transfer attacks.\nIn response, we discuss countermeasures to protect against our method and other\nsimilar snooping techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 16:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

A disentangled decomposition is\ninterpretable, and can be transferred to a variety of tasks including\ngenerative modeling, design optimization, and probabilistic reduced order\nmodelling. A major emphasis of this work is to characterize disentanglement\nusing VAEs while minimally modifying the classic VAE loss function (i.e. the\nEvidence Lower Bound) to maintain high reconstruction accuracy. The loss\nlandscape is characterized by over-regularized local minima which surround\ndesirable solutions. We illustrate comparisons between disentangled and\nentangled representations by juxtaposing learned latent distributions and the\ntrue generative factors in a model porous flow problem. Hierarchical priors are\nshown to facilitate the learning of disentangled representations. The\nregularization loss is unaffected by latent rotation when training with\nrotationally-invariant priors, and thus learning non-rotationally-invariant\npriors aids in capturing the properties of generative factors, improving\ndisentanglement.

While input noise lends itself to modeling biophysical noise\nprocesses, the phenomenological escape noise is mathematically more tractable.\nUsing the level-crossing theory for differentiable Gaussian processes, we\nderive an approximate mapping between colored input noise and escape noise in\nleaky integrate-and-fire neurons. This mapping requires the first-passage-time\n(FPT) density of an overdamped Brownian particle driven by colored noise with\nrespect to an arbitrarily moving boundary. Starting from the Wiener-Rice series\nfor the FPT density, we apply the second-order decoupling approximation of\nStratonovich to the case of moving boundaries and derive a simplified\nhazard-rate representation that is local in time and numerically efficient.\nThis simplification requires the calculation of the non-stationary\nauto-correlation function of the level-crossing process: For exponentially\ncorrelated input noise (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process), we obtain an exact formula\nfor the zero-lag auto-correlation as a function of noise parameters, mean\nmembrane potential and its speed, as well as an exponential approximation of\nthe full auto-correlation function. The theory well predicts the FPT and\ninterspike interval densities as well as the population activities obtained\nfrom simulations with time-dependent stimulus or boundary.

Our framework allows exploring different algorithms\nand their mappings on several accelerator cost models. Union also includes a\nplug-and-play library of accelerator cost models and mappers which can easily\nbe extended. The algorithms and accelerator cost models are connected via a\nnovel mapping abstraction that captures the map space of spatial accelerators\nwhich can be systematically pruned based on constraints from the hardware,\nworkload, and mapper.

So an algorithm that computes a policy for a human to\nexecute ought to consider these effects in its computations. An optimal Markov\nDecision Process (MDP) policy that is poorly executed (because of a human\nagent) maybe much worse than another policy that is suboptimal in the MDP, but\nconsiders the human-agent's execution behavior. In this paper we consider two\nproblems that arise from state uncertainty; these are erroneous\nstate-inference, and extra-sensing actions that a person might take as a result\nof their uncertainty. We present a framework to model the human agent's\nbehavior with respect to state uncertainty, and can be used to compute MDP\npolicies that accounts for these problems.

This can\nbe a non-trivial process -- if not done carefully, the algorithm might either\nviolate differential privacy or have low utility.\n  In this paper, we present DPGen, a program synthesizer that takes in\nnon-private code (without any noise) and automatically synthesizes its\ndifferentially private version (with carefully calibrated noise). Under the\nhood, DPGen uses novel algorithms to automatically generate a sketch program\nwith candidate locations for noise, and then optimize privacy proof and noise\nscales simultaneously on the sketch program. Moreover, DPGen can synthesize\nsophisticated mechanisms that adaptively process queries until a specified\nprivacy budget is exhausted.

The difficulty of the assessment of the data/model agreement\nis twofold. First of all, the observed and predicted counts are binned in three\ndimensions (two spatial dimensions and one energy dimension) and comparing two\n3D maps is not straightforward. Secondly, gamma-ray source spectra generally\ndecrease with energy as the inverse of the energy square.

ASASSN-17jz was discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for\nSupernovae (ASAS-SN) in the galaxy SDSS J171955.84+414049.4 on UT 2017 July 27\nat a redshift of $z=0.1641$. The transient peaked at an absolute $B$-band\nmagnitude of $M_{B,{\\rm peak}}=-22.81$, corresponding to a bolometric\nluminosity of $L_{\\rm bol,peak}=8.3\\times10^{44}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, and exhibited\nlate-time ultraviolet emission that was still ongoing in our latest\nobservations. Integrating the full light curve gives a total emitted energy of\n$E_{\\rm tot}=(1.36\\pm0.08)\\times10^{52}$~erg, with\n$(0.80\\pm0.02)\\times10^{52}$~erg of this emitted within 200 days of peak light.\nThis late-time ultraviolet emission is accompanied by increasing X-ray emission\nthat becomes softer as it brightens. ASASSN-17jz exhibited a large number of\nspectral emission lines most commonly seen in active galactic nuclei (AGNs)\nwith little evidence of evolution. It also showed transient Balmer features\nwhich became fainter and broader over time, and are still being detected\n$>1000$ days after peak brightness. We consider various physical scenarios for\nthe origin of the transient, including supernovae (SNe), tidal disruption\nevents (TDEs), AGN outbursts, and ANTs. We find that the most likely\nexplanation is that ASASSN-17jz was an SN~IIn occurring in or near the disk of\nan existing AGN, and that the late-time emission is caused by the AGN\ntransitioning to a more active state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 21:40:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 01:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Probing their evolution is therefore crucial for\ninvestigating possible links to other species of isolated NSs, such as the\nX-ray dim NSs (XDINSs) and rotating radio transients (RRATs). Here we\ninvestigate the spin evolution of magnetars. Two avenues of evolution are\nconsidered: one with exponentially decaying B-fields, the other with sub- and\nsuper-exponential decay. Using Monte Carlo methods, we synthesize magnetar\npopulations using different input distributions and physical parameters, such\nas for the initial spin period, its time derivative and the B-field decay\ntimescale. Additionally, we introduce a fade-away procedure that can account\nfor the fading of old magnetars, and we briefly discuss the effect of alignment\nof the B-field and spin axes. Imposing the Galactic core-collapse supernova\nrate of ~20 kyr^-1 as a strict upper limit on the magnetar birthrate and\ncomparing the synthetic populations to the observed one using both manual and\nautomatic optimization algorithms for our input parameter study, we find that\nthe B-field must decay exponentially or super-exponentially with a\ncharacteristic decay timescale of 0.5-10 kyr (with a best value of ~4 kyr). In\naddition, the initial spin period must be less than 2 sec. If these constraints\nare kept, we conclude that there are multiple choices of input physics that can\nreproduce the observed magnetar population reasonably well.

Counterfactual explanations offer a contrastive case, i.e., they\nattempt to find the smallest modification to the feature values of an instance\nthat changes the prediction of the ML model on that instance to a predefined\noutput. Prior techniques for generating CF explanations suffer from two major\nlimitations: (i) they generate CF explanations by solving separate\ntime-intensive optimization problems for every single input instance (which\nslows their running time); and (ii) they are post-hoc methods which are\ndesigned for use with proprietary black-box ML models - as a result, their\nprocedure for generating CF explanations is uninformed by the training\nprocedure of the black-box ML model, which leads to misalignment of objectives\nbetween model predictions and explanations. These two limitations result in\nsignificant shortcomings in the quality of the generated CF explanations.\nCounterNet, on the other hand, integrates both prediction and explanation in\nthe same framework, which enables the optimization of the CF explanation\ngeneration only once together with the predictive model.

Bayesian optimization provides a framework which\nallows us to build surrogate models based on sequential samples drawn from the\nfunction and find the optimum. Tuning algorithmic parameters to optimize the\nperformance of large, complicated \"black-box\" application codes is a specific\nimportant application, which aims at finding the optima of black-box functions.\nWithin the Bayesian optimization framework, the Gaussian process model produces\nsmooth or continuous sample paths. However, the black-box function in the\ntuning problem is often non-smooth. This difficult tuning problem is worsened\nby the fact that we usually have limited sequential samples from the black-box\nfunction.

These approximations\ntypically use a line of singularity solutions to represent the flow. These\nsingularities can be difficult to implement numerically because they diverge at\ntheir origin. Hence people have regularized these singularities to overcome\nthis issue. This regularization blurs the force over a small blob therefore\nremoving the divergent behaviour. However it is unclear how best to regularize\nthe singularities to minimize errors. In this paper we investigate if a line of\nregularized Stokeslets can describe the flow around a slender body. This is\nachieved by comparing the asymptotic behaviour of the flow from the line of\nregularized Stokeslets with the results from slender-body theory. We find that\nthe flow far from the body can be captured if the regularization parameter is\nproportional to the radius of the slender body. This is consistent with what is\nassumed in numerical simulations and provides a choice for the proportionality\nconstant. However more stringent requirements must be placed on the\nregularization blob to capture the near field flow outside a slender body. This\ninability to replicate the local behaviour indicates that many regularizations\ncannot satisfy the non-slip boundary conditions on the bodies surface to\nleading order, with one of the most commonly used regularizations showing an\nangular dependency of velocity along any cross section.

A\nsimple fix is proposed, and our evaluation results demonstrate that the\nproposed fix effectively helps OptChain overcome the shortcoming and\nsignificantly improve the system performance under a special workload. The\nauthors of OptChain made some revisions to the algorithm description after\nnoticing our work. Their updated algorithm does not exhibit the shortcoming\nunder the workloads employed by this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 02:14:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 19:59:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 20:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

I conclude that none of the nebulous companions\nwas ever sighted more than once and that, contrary to his belief, Schmidt\nobserved unrelated objects on the four consecutive mornings. Each nebulous\ncompanion is proposed to have been triggered by a fragment at most a few tens\nof meters across, released from the comet's nucleus after perihelion and seen\nonly because it happened to be caught in the brief terminal outburst, when its\nmass was suddenly shattered into a cloud of mostly microscopic debris due\npossibly to rotational bursting triggered by sublimation torques. The\nfragment's motion was affected by a strong outgassing-driven nongravitational\nacceleration with a significant out-of-plane component. Although fragmentation\nevents were common, only a small fraction of nebulous companions was detected\nbecause of their transient nature. The observed brightness of the nebulous\ncompanions is proposed to have been due mainly to C2 emissions, with a\ncontribution from scattering of sunlight by the microscopic dust. By their\nnature, the fragments responsible for the nebulous companions bear a strong\nresemblance to the dwarf Kreutz sungrazers detected with the coronagraphs\naboard the SOHO space probe.

Using just convolution neural networks (ConvNets) for\nthis problem is not effective as it is inefficient at capturing distant\ndependencies between road segments in the image which is essential to extract\nroad connectivity. To this end, we propose a Spatial and Interaction Space\nGraph Reasoning (SPIN) module which when plugged into a ConvNet performs\nreasoning over graphs constructed on spatial and interaction spaces projected\nfrom the feature maps. Reasoning over spatial space extracts dependencies\nbetween different spatial regions and other contextual information. Reasoning\nover a projected interaction space helps in appropriate delineation of roads\nfrom other topographies present in the image.

It is because the\nabrupt hit of the bounds gives rise to unrealisable jerks and even infeasible\nsolutions. This paper proposes the mixed control, which blends the single-axis\nmodel predictive control (MPC) and proportional derivate (PD) control for the\nwhole-body compliance to overcome these deficiencies. The MPC predicts the\ndistances between the bounds and the control target of the critical tasks, and\nit provides smooth and feasible solutions by prediction and optimisation in\nadvance. However, applying MPC will inevitably increase the computation time.\nTherefore, to achieve a 500 Hz servo rate, the PD controllers still regulate\nother tasks to save computation resources. Also, we use a more efficient null\nspace projection (NSP) whole-body controller instead of the HQP and distribute\nthe single-axis MPCs into four CPU cores for parallel computation.

In the IID dataset distribution setting, we provide the\ntheoretical convergence guarantees of Basil, demonstrating its linear\nconvergence rate.

They are\nseemingly incompatible: the vast majority of operations in depthwise separable\nCNNs are in pointwise convolutional layers, but pointwise layers use 1x1\nkernels, which do not benefit from frequency transformation. This paper unifies\nthese two ideas by transforming the activations, not the kernels. Our key\ninsights are that 1) pointwise convolutions commute with frequency\ntransformation and thus can be computed in the frequency domain without\nmodification, 2) each channel within a given layer has a different level of\nsensitivity to frequency domain pruning, and 3) each channel's sensitivity to\nfrequency pruning is approximately monotonic with respect to frequency. We\nleverage this knowledge by proposing a new technique which wraps each pointwise\nlayer in a discrete cosine transform (DCT) which is truncated to selectively\nprune coefficients above a given threshold as per the needs of each channel. To\nlearn which frequencies should be pruned from which channels, we introduce a\nnovel learned parameter which specifies each channel's pruning threshold. We\nadd a new regularization term which incentivizes the model to decrease the\nnumber of retained frequencies while still maintaining task accuracy. Unlike\nweight pruning techniques which rely on sparse operators, our contiguous\nfrequency band pruning results in fully dense computation. We apply our\ntechnique to MobileNetV2 and in the process reduce computation time by 22% and\nincur <1% accuracy degradation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 04:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

Survival prediction is a major concern for NPC patients, as it\nprovides early prognostic information to plan treatments. Recently, deep\nsurvival models based on deep learning have demonstrated the potential to\noutperform traditional radiomics-based survival prediction models. Deep\nsurvival models usually use image patches covering the whole target regions\n(e.g., nasopharynx for NPC) or containing only segmented tumor regions as the\ninput.

When the characteristics are of practical interest are only a\nsubset of full covariate, non-parametric estimation is often desirable; but few\nmethods are available due to the computational difficult. Existing\nnon-parametric methods such as the inverse probability weighting methods have\nlimitations that hinder their use in many practical settings where the values\nof propensity scores are close to 0 or 1. We propose the propensity score\nregression (PSR) that allows the non-parametric estimation of the heterogeneous\ntreatment effects in a wide context. PSR includes two non-parametric\nregressions in turn, where it first regresses on the propensity scores together\nwith the characteristics of interest, to obtain an intermediate estimate; and\nthen, regress the intermediate estimates on the characteristics of interest\nonly. By including propensity scores as regressors in the non-parametric\nmanner, PSR is capable of substantially easing the computational difficulty\nwhile remain (locally) insensitive to any value of propensity scores. We\npresent several appealing properties of PSR, including the consistency and\nasymptotical normality, and in particular the existence of an explicit variance\nestimator, from which the analytical behaviour of PSR and its precision can be\nassessed. Simulation studies indicate that PSR outperform existing methods in\nvarying settings with extreme values of propensity scores.

In this paper, we consider a generalized model of\nconventional physical layer security, referred to as hierarchical information\naccessibility (HIA). A main feature of the HIA model is that a network has a\nhierarchy in information accessibility, wherein decoding feasibility is\ndetermined by a priority of users. Under this HIA model, we formulate a sum\nsecrecy rate maximization problem with regard to precoding vectors. This\nproblem is challenging since multiple non-smooth functions are involved into\nthe secrecy rate to fulfill the HIA conditions and also the problem is\nnon-convex. To address the challenges, we approximate the minimum function by\nusing the LogSumExp technique, thereafter obtain the first-order optimality\ncondition. One key observation is that the derived condition is cast as a\nfunctional eigenvalue problem, where the eigenvalue is equivalent to the\napproximated objective function of the formulated problem. Accordingly, we show\nthat finding a principal eigenvector is equivalent to finding a local optimal\nsolution. To this end, we develop a novel method called generalized power\niteration for HIA (GPI-HIA).

The assembly histories and annular\nprofiles show statistically significant differences so that higher star\nformation rates characterize regions in tidally perturbed galaxies. These\nregions underwent a more intense (re)activation of SF in the last 1 Gyr.\nVarying shapes of the annular profiles also reflect fluctuations between\nsuppression and (re)activation of SF.

For a user-given satisfaction value on this probability, we\nidentify the noise regimes for which an estimated partition is noise robust;\nthat is, it is PAC core-stable in both noisy and noise-free games. We obtain\nsimilar robustness results when the estimated partition is not PAC core-stable.\nThese noise regimes correspond to the level sets of the agreement probability\nfunction and are non-convex sets. Moreover, an important fact is that the\nprediction probability can be high even if high noise values occur with a high\nprobability. Further, for a class of top-responsive hedonic games, we obtain\nthe bounds on the extra noisy samples required to get noise robustness with a\nuser-given satisfaction value.\n  We completely solve the noise robustness problem of a $2$ agent hedonic game.\nIn particular, we obtain the prediction probability function for l=2 and l=3\nnoise support cases. For l=2, the prediction probability is convex in noise\nprobability, but the noise robust regime is non-convex. Its minimum value,\ncalled the safety value, is 0.62; so, below 0.62, the noise robust regime is\nthe entire probability simplex. However, for l \\geq 3, the prediction\nprobability is non-convex; so, the safety value is the global minima of a\nnon-convex function and is computationally hard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 06:13:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 09:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

We define a macrostate $M$ by specifying the fraction of\nparticles in rectangular boxes $\\Delta x \\Delta v$ of the single particle\nposition-velocity space $\\{x,v\\}$. We verify that when the number of particles\nis large the Boltzmann entropy, $S_B(t)$, of a typical microstate of a\nnonequilibrium ensemble coincides with the Gibbs entropy of the coarse-grained\ntime-evolved one-particle distribution associated with this ensemble. $S_B(t)$\napproaches its maximum possible value for the dynamical evolution of the given\ninitial state. The rate of approach depends on the size of $\\Delta v$ in the\ndefinition of the macrostate, going to zero at any fixed time $t$ when $\\Delta\nv \\to 0$.

Building on the properties of the\neigenvectors of the covariance matrices, we are able to find the optimal\nresponse of the RISs in closed form, bypassing the need for brute-force\noptimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 06:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

FGVC aims at\nclassifying objects from the same species (very similar categories), while the\nUltra-FGVC targets at more challenging problems of classifying images at an\nultra-fine granularity where even human experts may fail to identify the visual\ndifference. The challenges for Ultra-FGVC mainly comes from two aspects: one is\nthat the Ultra-FGVC often arises overfitting problems due to the lack of\ntraining samples; and another lies in that the inter-class variance among\nimages is much smaller than normal FGVC tasks, which makes it difficult to\nlearn discriminative features for each class. To solve these challenges, a\nmask-guided feature extraction and feature augmentation method is proposed in\nthis paper to extract discriminative and informative regions of images which\nare then used to augment the original feature map. The advantage of the\nproposed method is that the feature detection and extraction model only\nrequires a small amount of target region samples with bounding boxes for\ntraining, then it can automatically locate the target area for a large number\nof images in the dataset at a high detection accuracy.

Prior work has\nmainly focused on analyzing the performance of these surfaces using computer\nsimulations or lab-level prototypes. To draw accurate insights about the actual\nperformance of these systems, this paper develops an RIS proof-of-concept\nprototype and extensively evaluates its potential gains in the field and under\nrealistic wireless communication settings. In particular, a 160-element\nreconfigurable surface, operating at a 5.8GHz band, is first designed,\nfabricated, and accurately measured in the anechoic chamber. This surface is\nthen integrated into a wireless communication system and the beamforming gains,\npath-loss, and coverage improvements are evaluated in realistic outdoor\ncommunication scenarios. When both the transmitter and receiver employ\ndirectional antennas and with 5m and 10m distances between the transmitter-RIS\nand RIS-receiver, the developed RIS achieves $15$-$20$dB gain in the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a range of $\\pm60^\\circ$ beamforming angles. In\nterms of coverage, and considering a far-field experiment with a blockage\nbetween a base station and a grid of mobile users and with an average distance\nof $35m$ between base station (BS) and the user (through the RIS), the RIS\nprovides an average SNR improvement of $6$dB (max $8$dB) within an area $>\n75$m$^2$. Thanks to the scalable RIS design, these SNR gains can be directly\nincreased with larger RIS areas. For example, a 1,600-element RIS with the same\ndesign is expected to provide around $26$dB SNR gain for a similar deployment.\nThese results, among others, draw useful insights into the design and\nperformance of RIS systems and provide an important proof for their potential\ngains in real-world far-field wireless communication environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 07:21:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

We quantify these concepts, giving numerical values to\ninconsistency and unavailability. Recognizing that network partitioning is not\nan all-or-nothing proposition, we replace the P in CAP with L, a numerical\nmeasure of apparent latency, and derive the CAL theorem, an algebraic relation\nbetween inconsistency, unavailability, and apparent latency. This relation\nshows that if latency becomes unbounded (e.g., the network becomes\npartitioned), then one of inconsistency and unavailability must also become\nunbounded, and hence the CAP theorem is a special case of the CAL theorem. We\ndescribe two distributed coordination mechanisms, which we have implemented as\nan extension of the Lingua Franca coordination language, that support arbitrary\ntradeoffs between consistency and availability as apparent latency varies. With\ncentralized coordination, inconsistency remains bounded by a chosen numerical\nvalue at the cost that unavailability becomes unbounded under network\npartitioning.

Deep learning generative models can be used to denoise these images and\nin turn improve radiomics' reproducibility and performance. However, most\ngenerative models are trained on paired data, which can be difficult or\nimpossible to collect. In this article, we investigate the possibility of\ndenoising low dose CTs using cycle generative adversarial networks (GANs) to\nimprove radiomics reproducibility and performance based on unpaired datasets.\nTwo cycle GANs were trained: 1) from paired data, by simulating low dose CTs\n(i.e., introducing noise) from high dose CTs; and 2) from unpaired real low\ndose CTs. To accelerate convergence, during GAN training, a slice-paired\ntraining strategy was introduced. The trained GANs were applied to three\nscenarios: 1) improving radiomics reproducibility in simulated low dose CT\nimages and 2) same-day repeat low dose CTs (RIDER dataset) and 3) improving\nradiomics performance in survival prediction. Cycle GAN results were compared\nwith a conditional GAN (CGAN) and an encoder-decoder network (EDN) trained on\nsimulated paired data.The cycle GAN trained on simulated data improved\nconcordance correlation coefficients (CCC) of radiomic features from 0.87 to\n0.93 on simulated noise CT and from 0.89 to 0.92 on RIDER dataset, as well\nimproving the AUC of survival prediction from 0.52 to 0.59.

To complement existing\nquantitative studies on literature recommendation, we present qualitative study\nresults that report on users' perceptions for two contrasting recommendation\nclasses: (1) link-based recommendation represented by the Co-Citation Proximity\n(CPA) approach, and (2) text-based recommendation represented by Lucene's\nMoreLikeThis (MLT) algorithm. The empirical data analyzed in our study with\ntwenty users and a diverse set of 40 Wikipedia articles indicate a noticeable\ndifference between text- and link-based recommendation generation approaches\nalong several key dimensions. The text-based MLT method receives higher\nsatisfaction ratings in terms of user-perceived similarity of recommended\narticles. In contrast, the CPA approach receives higher satisfaction scores in\nterms of diversity and serendipity of recommendations. We conclude that users\nof literature recommendation systems can benefit most from hybrid approaches\nthat combine both link- and text-based approaches, where the user's information\nneeds and preferences should control the weighting for the approaches used.

As a result, it is likely to cause\nsevere inconsistent style expressions, like `the salad is rude`. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose a novel transductive learning approach in this paper, based\non a retrieval-based context-aware style representation. Specifically, an\nattentional encoder-decoder with a retriever framework is utilized. It involves\ntop-K relevant sentences in the target style in the transfer process. In this\nway, we can learn a context-aware style embedding to alleviate the above\ninconsistency problem. In this paper, both sparse (BM25) and dense retrieval\nfunctions (MIPS) are used, and two objective functions are designed to\nfacilitate joint learning.

Our\nmain contribution is to propose a model-driven learning technique that exploits\nthe structure of the optimal downlink beamforming to design an effective hybrid\nlearning strategy with the aim to maximize the sum rate performance.

Such interconversions depend upon whether the\nincident hybridly vectorial light pulse carries vortex phase or not in a single\nhigh numerical aperture geometry. For the case of the absence of vortex phase,\nwe find that it enables orbit angular momentum-carrying transverse component\nfields, and the resultant orbit angular momentum embedded within focused light\nfields remains constantly revolving as time elapses, which indicates that the\ncontrollable spin-to-orbit conversion occurs. By contrast, it is revealed that\nhybridly polarized vectorial-vortex light pulses allow access to the locally\nexcited circular polarization at the focus, and this induced local circular\npolarization is independent of ultrafast varying time, whereas the resulting\nspin angular momentum density components experience the alternation between the\nappearance and annihilation over time, thus giving rise to the tunable\norbit-to-local-spin conversion.

A common example is school choice, where a matching\nmechanism uses student and school preferences to assign students to schools. In\nsuch settings, forming preferences is both difficult and critical. Prior work\nhas suggested various prediction mechanisms that help agents make decisions\nabout their preferences. Although often deployed together, these matching and\nprediction mechanisms are almost always analyzed separately. The present work\nshows that at the intersection of the two lies a previously unexplored type of\nstrategic behavior: agents returning to the market (e.g., schools) can attack\nfuture predictions by interacting short-term non-optimally with their matches.\nHere, we first introduce this type of strategic behavior, which we call an\n`adversarial interaction attack'. Next, we construct a formal economic model\nthat captures the feedback loop between prediction mechanisms designed to\nassist agents and the matching mechanism used to pair them. This economic model\nallows us to analyze adversarial interaction attacks. Finally, using school\nchoice as an example, we build a simulation to show that, as the trust in and\naccuracy of predictions increases, schools gain progressively more by\ninitiating an adversarial interaction attack. We also show that this attack\nincreases inequality in the student population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 09:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

In\nthis paper, our aim is to determine the predominant source of radio emission in\na sample of 44 NLS1s, selected based on their extended kpc-scale radio\nmorphologies at 5.2 GHz.

These data are complemented by\narchival data to draw a more complete picture of each source. We find an\nextraordinary diversity among our sample. Approximately equal fractions of our\nsources can be identified as AGN-dominated, composite, and host-dominated.\nAmong the AGN-dominated sources are a few NLS1s with very extended jets,\nreaching distances of tens of kpc from the nucleus. One of these, J0814+5609,\nhosts the most extended jets found in an NLS1 so far. We also identify five\nNLS1s that could be classified as compact steep-spectrum sources. We further\nconclude that due to the variety seen in NLS1s simple proxies, such as the star\nformation diagnostics also employed in this paper, and the radio loudness\nparameter, are not ideal tools for characterising NLS1s. We emphasise the\nnecessity of examining NLS1s as individuals, instead of making assumptions\nbased on their classification.

On the\nother hand, they can play a significant role in the Breit frame ($q^2<0$) and\nin the direct decay calculation ($q^2>0$), as a comparison with the\ninfinite-momentum-frame form factors (analytically continued to $q^2>0$)\nreveals.

Today, this challenge is\nespecially relevant given the emergence of systems which appear to increasingly\noutperform human beings. In some cases, this \"superhuman\" performance is\nreadily demonstrated; for example by defeating legendary human players in\ntraditional two player games. On the other hand, it can be challenging to\nevaluate classification models that potentially surpass human performance.\nIndeed, human annotations are often treated as a ground truth, which implicitly\nassumes the superiority of the human over any models trained on human\nannotations. In reality, human annotators can make mistakes and be subjective.\nEvaluating the performance with respect to a genuine oracle may be more\nobjective and reliable, even when querying the oracle is expensive or\nimpossible. In this paper, we first raise the challenge of evaluating the\nperformance of both humans and models with respect to an oracle which is\nunobserved. We develop a theory for estimating the accuracy compared to the\noracle, using only imperfect human annotations for reference. Our analysis\nprovides a simple recipe for detecting and certifying superhuman performance in\nthis setting, which we believe will assist in understanding the stage of\ncurrent research on classification. We validate the convergence of the bounds\nand the assumptions of our theory on carefully designed toy experiments with\nknown oracles. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our theory by\nmeta-analyzing large-scale natural language processing tasks, for which an\noracle does not exist, and show that under our assumptions a number of models\nfrom recent years are with high probability superhuman.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 11:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

Those solutions usually encode\nhair structures via orientation maps, which, however, are not very effective to\nencode complex structures. We observe that colored hair sketches already\nimplicitly define target hair shapes as well as hair appearance and are more\nflexible to depict hair structures than orientation maps.

At the first stage, we train a network to predict a\nhair matte from an input hair sketch, with an optional set of non-hair strokes.\nAt the second stage, another network is trained to synthesize the structure and\nappearance of hair images from the input sketch and the generated matte. To\nmake the networks in the two stages aware of long-term dependency of strokes,\nwe apply self-attention modules to them. To train these networks, we present a\nnew dataset containing thousands of annotated hair sketch-image pairs and\ncorresponding hair mattes. Two efficient methods for sketch completion are\nproposed to automatically complete repetitive braided parts and hair strokes,\nrespectively, thus reducing the workload of users. Based on the trained\nnetworks and the two sketch completion strategies, we build an intuitive\ninterface to allow even novice users to design visually pleasing hair images\nexhibiting various hair structures and appearance via freehand sketches.

While multiple motor control strategies can all lead to the desired\nbehavior, they result in different joint and muscle forces.

To assess the effect of different motor control\noptimization strategies, a direct measurement of muscle and joint forces is\ndesirable, but problematic for medical and ethical reasons. Computational\nmodeling might provide a solution by calculating approximations of these\nforces. In this study, we used a full-body computational musculoskeletal model\nto (1) predict forces measured in knee prostheses during walking and squatting\nand (2) to study the effect of different motor control strategies (i.e.,\nminimizing joint force vs. muscle activation) on the joint load and prediction\nerror. We found that musculoskeletal models can accurately predict knee joint\nforces with an RMSE of <0.5 BW in the superior direction and about 0.1 BW in\nthe medial and anterior directions. Generally, minimization of joint forces\nproduced the best predictions. Furthermore, minimizing muscle activation\nresulted in maximum knee forces of about 4 BW for walking and 2.5 BW for\nsquatting. Minimizing joint forces resulted in maximum knee forces of 2.25 BW\nand 2.12 BW, i.e., a reduction of 44% and 15%, respectively. Thus, changing the\nmuscular coordination strategy can strongly affect knee joint forces. Patients\nwith a knee prosthesis may adapt their neuromuscular activation to reduce joint\nforces during locomotion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 11:29:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 15:14:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 19:54:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 14:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Assume that a QKD protocol\ngenerates symmetric private key pairs for secure communication over each link\nin a network. The quantum key generation process is modeled using a stochastic\ncounting process. Packets are first encrypted with the quantum keys available\nfor each hop and then transmitted on a point-to-point basis over the links. A\nfundamental problem in this setting is the design of a secure and\ncapacity-achieving routing policy that takes into account the time-varying\navailability of the encryption keys and finite link capacities. In this paper,\nwe propose a new secure throughput-optimal policy called Tandem Queue\nDecomposition (TQD). The TQD policy is derived by combining the QKD process\nwith the Universal Max Weight routing policy, proposed earlier by Sinha and\nModiano. We show that the TQD policy solves the problem of secure and efficient\npacket routing for a broad class of traffic, including unicast, broadcast,\nmulticast, and anycast. The proposed decomposition reduces the problem to the\ngeneralized network flow problem without the key availability constraints over\na transformed network. The proof of the throughput-optimality of the TQD policy\nuses the Lyapunov stability theory for analyzing the interdependent packet\nqueueing process and the key-storage dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate the\ncompetitiveness of the TQD policy over the existing algorithms by numerically\ncomparing them on a simulator that we build on top of the state-of-the-art\nOMNeT++ network simulator platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 12:29:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 06:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

Specifically, we adjust the pitch and duration of each\nsyllable in natural speech to those of the corresponding note extracted from\nmusic scores, so as to narrow the gap between natural speech and singing voice.\nExperiments on DSing30 and Dali corpus show that the ALT system equipped with\nour PDAugment outperforms previous state-of-the-art systems by 5.9% and 18.1%\nWERs respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of PDAugment for ALT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 12:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 05:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

Our dataset has daily\ncadence and simultaneous optical and near-infrared coverage up to ~ 100 days,\ntogether with late time (+ 1.7 yr) MIR observations. At 230 days after light\ncurve peak the SN is not detected in the optical, but shows a surprisingly\nstrong near-infrared excess, with r - J > 3 mag and r - Ks > 5 mag. The time\nevolution of the infrared light curve enables us to investigate if the\nmid-infrared emission is from newly formed dust inside the SN ejecta, from a\npre-existing circumstellar envelope, or interstellar material heated by the\nradiation from the SN. We find the latter two scenarios can be ruled out, and a\nscenario where new dust is forming in the SN ejecta at epochs > 200 days can\nself-consistently reproduce the evolution of the SN flux. We can fit the\nspectral energy distribution well at +230 d with 5 x 10^-4 solar mass of carbon\ndust, increasing over the following several hundred days to 10^-2 solar mass by\n+535 d. SN 2018bsz is the first SLSN showing evidence for dust formation within\nthe SN ejecta, and appears to form ten times more dust than normal\ncore-collapse SNe at similar epochs. Together with their preference for low\nmass, low metallicity host galaxies, we suggest that SLSNe may be a significant\ncontributor to dust formation in the early Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 12:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

Such skewed distribution may result from\nthe users' conformity to the group, which deviates from reflecting users' true\npreference. Existing efforts for tackling this issue mainly focus on completely\neliminating popularity bias. However, we argue that not all popularity bias is\nevil. Popularity bias not only results from conformity but also item quality,\nwhich is usually ignored by existing methods. Some items exhibit higher\npopularity as they have intrinsic better property. Blindly removing the\npopularity bias would lose such important signal, and further deteriorate model\nperformance. To sufficiently exploit such important information for\nrecommendation, it is essential to disentangle the benign popularity bias\ncaused by item quality from the harmful popularity bias caused by conformity.\nAlthough important, it is quite challenging as we lack an explicit signal to\ndifferentiate the two factors of popularity bias. In this paper, we propose to\nleverage temporal information as the two factors exhibit quite different\npatterns along the time: item quality revealing item inherent property is\nstable and static while conformity that depends on items' recent clicks is\nhighly time-sensitive. Correspondingly, we further propose a novel Time-aware\nDisEntangled framework (TIDE), where a click is generated from three components\nnamely the static item quality, the dynamic conformity effect, as well as the\nuser-item matching score returned by any recommendation model. Lastly, we\nconduct interventional inference such that the recommendation can benefit from\nthe benign popularity bias while circumvent the harmful one.

The\nanalysis of a large sample of HFR observations (over about ten months), carried\nout jointly with an analysis of TNR-HFR data and prior to the antennas'\ndeployment, allowed us to estimate the reference system noise of the TNR-HFR\nreceivers.

In\nthis paper we look at the problem of estimating the velocity of road vehicles\nfrom a camera mounted on a moving car. Contrary to prior methods that train\nend-to-end deep networks that estimate the vehicles' velocity from the video\npixels, we propose a two-step approach where first an off-the-shelf tracker is\nused to extract vehicle bounding boxes and then a small neural network is used\nto regress the vehicle velocity from the tracked bounding boxes. Surprisingly,\nwe find that this still achieves state-of-the-art estimation performance with\nthe significant benefit of separating perception from dynamics estimation via a\nclean, interpretable and verifiable interface which allows us distill the\nstatistics which are crucial for velocity estimation.

The focus here is the class of physically symmetric and positive\ndefinite tensors, as they appear often in the description of materials, and one\nwants to be able to prescribe certain classes of spatial symmetries and\ninvariances for each member of the whole ensemble, while at the same time\ndemanding that the mean or expected value of the ensemble be subject to a\npossibly 'higher' spatial invariance class. We formulate a modelling framework\nwhich not only respects these two requirements$-$positive definiteness and\ninvariance$-$but also allows a fine control over orientation on one hand, and\nstrength/size on the other. As the set of positive definite tensors is not a\nlinear space, but rather an open convex cone in the linear space of physically\nsymmetric tensors, we consider it advantageous to widen the notion of mean to\nthe so-called Fr\\'echet mean on a metric space, which is based on distance\nmeasures or metrics between positive definite tensors other than the usual\nEuclidean one. It is shown how the random ensemble can be modelled and\ngenerated, independently in its scaling and orientational or directional\naspects, with a Lie algebra representation via a memoryless transformation. The\nparameters which describe the elements in this Lie algebra are then to be\nconsidered as random fields on the domain of interest. As an example, a 2D and\na 3D model of steady-state heat conduction in a human proximal femur, a bone\nwith high material anisotropy, is modelled with a random thermal conductivity\ntensor, and the numerical results show the distinct impact of incorporating\ninto the constitutive model different material uncertainties$-$scaling,\norientation, and prescribed material symmetry$-$on the desired quantities of\ninterest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 13:13:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 13:05:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 14:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

The fourth version of the system, developed within the Alexa\nPrize Socialbot Grand Challenge 4, brings two main innovations. The first\naddresses coherence, and the second addresses the engagingness of the\nconversation. For innovations regarding coherence, we propose a novel hybrid\napproach combining hand-designed responses and a generative model. The proposed\napproach utilizes hand-designed dialogues, out-of-domain detection, and a\nneural response generator. Hand-designed dialogues walk the user through\nhigh-quality conversational flows. The out-of-domain detection recognizes that\nthe user diverges from the predefined flow and prevents the system from\nproducing a scripted response that might not make sense for unexpected user\ninput. Finally, the neural response generator generates a response based on the\ncontext of the dialogue that correctly reacts to the unexpected user input and\nreturns the dialogue to the boundaries of hand-designed dialogues. The\ninnovations for engagement that we propose are mostly inspired by the famous\nexploration-exploitation dilemma. To conduct an engaging conversation with the\ndialogue partners, one has to learn their preferences and interests --\nexploration. Moreover, to engage the partner, we have to utilize the knowledge\nwe have already learned -- exploitation.

An open question is how to\nbest initialize a relatively small-sized ensemble of numerical model\nintegrations to produce reliable forecasts at these timescales. Reliability in\nthis case means that the statistical properties of the ensemble forecast are\nconsistent with the actual uncertainties about the future state of the\ngeophysical system under investigation. In the present work, a method is\nintroduced to construct initial conditions that produce reliable ensemble\nforecasts by projecting onto the eigenfunctions of the Koopman or the\nPerron-Frobenius operators, which describe the time-evolution of observables\nand probability distributions of the system dynamics, respectively. These\neigenfunctions can be approximated from data by using the Dynamic Mode\nDecomposition (DMD) algorithm. The effectiveness of this approach is\nillustrated in the framework of a low-order ocean-atmosphere model exhibiting\nmultiple characteristic timescales, and is compared to other ensemble\ninitialization methods based on the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) of\nthe model trajectory and on the backward and covariant Lyapunov vectors of the\nmodel dynamics. Projecting initial conditions onto a subset of the Koopman or\nPerron-Frobenius eigenfunctions that are characterized by time scales with\nfast-decaying oscillations is found to produce highly reliable forecasts at all\nlead times investigated, ranging from one week to two months. Reliable\nforecasts are also obtained with the adjoint covariant Lyapunov vectors, which\nare the eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator in the tangent space.

However, existing adversarial example generation methods for\ncrowd counting lack strong transferability among different black-box models,\nwhich limits their practicability for real-world systems.

The inverse\nof the linear operator, defined as the resolvent, is interpreted as a transfer\nfunction between the forcing and the velocity response. This inversion obscures\nthe physical interpretation of the governing equations and is prohibitive to\nanalytical manipulation, and for large systems leads to significant\ncomputational cost and memory requirements. In this work we suggest an\nalternative, inverse free, definition of the resolvent basis based on an\nextension of the Courant-Fischer-Weyl min-max principle in which resolvent\nmodes are defined as stationary points of a constrained variational problem.\nThis leads to a straightforward approach to approximate the resolvent\n(response) modes of complex flows as expansions in any basis. The proposed\nmethod avoids matrix inversions and requires only the spectral decomposition of\na matrix of significantly reduced size as compared to the original system. To\nillustrate this method and the advantages of the variational formulation we\npresent three examples. First, we consider streamwise constant fluctuations in\nturbulent channel flow where an asymptotic analysis allows us to derive closed\nform expressions for the optimal resolvent modes. Second, to illustrate the\ncost saving potential, and investigate the limits, of the proposed method we\napply our method to both a 2-dimensional, 3-component equilibrium solution in\nCouette flow and, finally, to a streamwise developing turbulent boundary layer.\nFor these larger systems we achieve a model reduction of up to two orders of\nmagnitude.

However, recommender systems are\noften trained on highly sensitive user data, thus potential data leakage from\nrecommender systems may lead to severe privacy problems.\n  In this paper, we make the first attempt on quantifying the privacy leakage\nof recommender systems through the lens of membership inference. In contrast\nwith traditional membership inference against machine learning classifiers, our\nattack faces two main differences. First, our attack is on the user-level but\nnot on the data sample-level. Second, the adversary can only observe the\nordered recommended items from a recommender system instead of prediction\nresults in the form of posterior probabilities. To address the above\nchallenges, we propose a novel method by representing users from relevant\nitems. Moreover, a shadow recommender is established to derive the labeled\ntraining data for training the attack model. Extensive experimental results\nshow that our attack framework achieves a strong performance. In addition, we\ndesign a defense mechanism to effectively mitigate the membership inference\nthreat of recommender systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 15:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

The most watched American football league in\nthe world is the United States' National Football League (NFL), where every\noffensive play can be either a run or a pass, and in this work we focus on\npasses. Many factors can affect the probability of pass completion, such as\nreceiver separation from the nearest defender, distance from receiver to\npasser, offense formation, among many others. When predicting the completion\nprobability of a pass, it is essential to know who the target of the pass is.\nBy using distance measures between players and the ball, it is possible to\ncalculate empirical probabilities and predict very accurately who the target\nwill be. The big question is: how likely is it for a pass to be completed in an\nNFL match while the ball is in the air? We developed a machine learning\nalgorithm to answer this based on several predictors. Using data from the 2018\nNFL season, we obtained conditional and marginal predictions for pass\ncompletion probability based on a random forest model. This is based on a\ntwo-stage procedure: first, we calculate the probability of each offensive\nplayer being the pass target, then, conditional on the target, we predict\ncompletion probability based on the random forest model.

Due to their importance in human intelligence, computational models\nof associative memories have been developed for several decades now. They\ninclude autoassociative memories, which allow for storing data points and\nretrieving a stored data point $s$ when provided with a noisy or partial\nvariant of $s$, and heteroassociative memories, able to store and recall\nmulti-modal data. In this paper, we present a novel neural model for realizing\nassociative memories, based on a hierarchical generative network that receives\nexternal stimuli via sensory neurons. This model is trained using predictive\ncoding, an error-based learning algorithm inspired by information processing in\nthe cortex. To test the capabilities of this model, we perform multiple\nretrieval experiments from both corrupted and incomplete data points. In an\nextensive comparison, we show that this new model outperforms in retrieval\naccuracy and robustness popular associative memory models, such as autoencoders\ntrained via backpropagation, and modern Hopfield networks. In particular, in\ncompleting partial data points, our model achieves remarkable results on\nnatural image datasets, such as ImageNet, with a surprisingly high accuracy,\neven when only a tiny fraction of pixels of the original images is presented.\nFurthermore, we show that this method is able to handle multi-modal data,\nretrieving images from descriptions, and vice versa. We conclude by discussing\nthe possible impact of this work in the neuroscience community, by showing that\nour model provides a plausible framework to study learning and retrieval of\nmemories in the brain, as it closely mimics the behavior of the hippocampus as\na memory index and generative model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 15:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

Conversely, a crowd-shipping service relying on public transport\nshould maximize the environmental benefits. Motivated by this observation, in\nthis study we assess the potentials of crowd-shipping based on metro commuters\nin the city of Brescia, Italy. Our contribution is twofold. First, we analyze\nthe results of a survey conducted among metro users to assess their willingness\nto act as crowd-shippers. The main result is that most young commuters and\nretirees are willing to be crowd-shippers even for a null reward. Second, we\nassess the potential economic impact of using metro-based crowd-shipping\ncoupled with a traditional home delivery service. To this end, we formulate a\nvariant of the VRP model where the customers closest to the metro stations may\nbe served either by a conventional vehicle or by a crowd-shipper.

Still, one can reduce the\ncost by representing the evolving particle density function in terms of its\nmoments. In particular, quadrature-based moment methods (QBMMs) invert these\nmoments with a quadrature rule, approximating the required statistics. QBMMs\nhave been shown to accurately model sprays and soot with a relatively compact\nset of moments. However, significantly non-Gaussian processes such as bubble\ndynamics lead to numerical instabilities when extending their moment sets\naccordingly. We solve this problem by training a recurrent neural network (RNN)\nthat adjusts the QBMM quadrature to evaluate unclosed moments with higher\naccuracy. The proposed method is tested on a simple model of bubbles\noscillating in response to a temporally fluctuating pressure field. The\napproach decreases model-form error by a factor of 10 when compared to\ntraditional QBMMs. It is both numerically stable and computationally efficient\nsince it does not expand the baseline moment set. Additional quadrature points\nare also assessed, optimally placed and weighted according to an additional\nRNN. These points further decrease the error at low cost since the moment set\nis again unchanged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 22:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

The law of excluded middle falls\nshort of explaining the contradictory meanings of the same symbols. The\nstatements like ``$r\\to 0$'', ``$q\\to 0$'', used by the physicist, are\ninconsistent on dimensional grounds because ``$r$'', ``$q$'' represent {\\it\nquantities} with physical dimensions of $[L], [Q]$ respectively and ``$0$''\nrepresents just a number devoid of physical dimension. Consequently, the\ninvolvement of the statement ``$\\lim_{q\\to 0}$, where $q$ is the test charge''\nin the definition of electric field leads to either circular reasoning or a\ncontradiction regarding the experimental verification of the smallest charge in\nthe Millikan-Fletcher oil drop experiment. Considering such issues as\nproblematic, by choice, I make an inquiry regarding the basic language in terms\nof which physics is written, with an aim of exploring how truthfully the verbal\nstatements can be converted to the corresponding physico-mathematical\nexpressions (involving physical dimensions). Necessarily I demonstrate the\nmeaning of the terms ``self inquiry'', ``middle way'', ``dependent\norigination'', ``emptiness/relational existence'', which signify the basic\ntenets of Buddhism. In light of this, I explain my view of ``definition''; the\nrelation among quantity, physical dimension and number; the logico-linguistic\nfallacy of ``zero quantity''; difference between unit and unity. I present a\ncritical analysis of the definitions of electric field due to Maxwell and\nJackson. A postulate regarding the existence of charges becomes necessary\nwhich, however, resolves the contradiction regarding the oil drop experiment.\nThis work is an appeal for the dissociation of the categorical disciplines of\nlogic and physics and on the large, a fruitful merger of Eastern philosophy and\nWestern science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 11:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

The commentary is intended\nto showcase how a general change in attitude towards making scientific\ninquiries can be beneficial for science as a whole. However, such a change can\ncome at the cost of looking beyond the categories of the disciplines of logic,\nphilosophy and physics. It is through self-inquiry that such a change is\npossible, along with the realization of the essence of the middle that is\notherwise excluded by choice. The logician, who generally holds a reverential\nattitude towards the physicist, can then actively contribute to the betterment\nof physics by improving the language through which the physicist expresses his\nexperience. The philosopher, who otherwise chooses to follow the advancement of\nphysics and gets stuck in the trap of sophistication of language, can then be\nof guidance to the physicist on intellectual grounds by having the physicist's\nexperience himself. In course of this commentary, I provide a glimpse of how a\ntruthful conversion of verbal statements to physico-mathematical expressions\nunravels the hitherto unrealized connection between Heisenberg uncertainty\nrelation and Cauchy's definition of derivative that is used in physics. The\ncommentary can be an essential reading if the reader is willing to look beyond\nthe categories of logic, philosophy and physics by being `nobody'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 11:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}
