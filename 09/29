Therefore, we devise a new protocol to construct an\nImageNet-style hierarchy representative of more languages and cultures. In\nparticular, we let the selection of both concepts and images be entirely driven\nby native speakers, rather than scraping them automatically.

The relative fraction of stable\niron-group elements synthesized in the explosion has been suggested as a\npossible discriminant between MCh and sub-MCh events. In particular, it is\nthought that the higher-density ejecta of MCh WDs, which favours the synthesis\nof stable isotopes of nickel, results in prominent [Ni II] lines in late-time\nspectra. We study the explosive nucleosynthesis of stable nickel in SNe Ia\nresulting from MCh and sub-MCh progenitors. We explore the potential for lines\nof [Ni II] at 7378 \\AA\\ and 1.94 microns in late-time spectra to serve as a\ndiagnostic of the exploding WD mass, using nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium\nradiative-transfer simulations with the CMFGEN code. We find that the radiative\nproton-capture reaction 57Co(p,gamma)58Ni is the dominant production mode for\n58Ni in both MCh and sub-MCh models, while the alpha-capture reaction on 54Fe\nhas a negligible impact on the final 58Ni yield. More importantly, we\ndemonstrate that the lack of [Ni II] lines in late-time spectra of sub-MCh\nevents is not always due to an under-abundance of stable Ni; rather, it results\nfrom the higher ionization of Ni in the inner ejecta. Conversely, the strong\n[Ni II] lines predicted in our 1D MCh models are completely suppressed when\n56Ni is sufficiently mixed with the innermost layers, which are rich in stable\niron-group elements. [Ni II] lines in late-time SN Ia spectra have a complex\ndependency on the abundance of stable Ni, which limits their use in\ndistinguishing among MCh and sub-MCh progenitors. However, we argue that a\nlow-luminosity SN Ia displaying strong [Ni II] lines would most likely result\nfrom a Chandrasekhar-mass progenitor.

To determine whether RVM differences\nbetween Black and White eyes were physiological, CNNs were trained to predict\nrace from color RFIs, raw RVMs, and thresholded, binarized, or skeletonized\nRVMs. Area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) was evaluated.\n  Findings: CNNs predicted race from RFIs near perfectly (image-level AUC-PR:\n0.999, subject-level AUC-PR: 1.000). Raw RVMs were almost as informative as\ncolor RFIs (image-level AUC-PR: 0.938, subject-level AUC-PR: 0.995).\nUltimately, CNNs were able to detect whether RFIs or RVMs were from Black or\nWhite babies, regardless of whether images contained color, vessel segmentation\nbrightness differences were nullified, or vessel segmentation widths were\nnormalized.\n  Interpretation: AI can detect race from grayscale RVMs that were not thought\nto contain racial information. Two potential explanations for these findings\nare that: retinal vessels physiologically differ between Black and White babies\nor the U-Net segments the retinal vasculature differently for various fundus\npigmentations. Either way, the implications remain the same: AI algorithms have\npotential to demonstrate racial bias in practice, even when preliminary\nattempts to remove such information from the underlying images appear to be\nsuccessful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

To overcome\nthis issue, Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) technologies have been adopted to\nreplace the caregivers and complement patients' lack of intelligence.\nTechnologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nhave enabled intelligent ubiquitous learning for smart buildings to monitor the\ncognitively declined occupants and provide in-home assistive services and\nsolutions.

The\nsuccessor representation (SR), which measures the expected cumulative,\ndiscounted state occupancy under a fixed policy, enables efficient transfer to\ndifferent reward structures in an otherwise constant Markovian environment and\nhas been hypothesized to underlie aspects of biological behavior and neural\nactivity. However, in the real world, rewards may move or only be available for\nconsumption once, may shift location, or agents may simply aim to reach goal\nstates as rapidly as possible without the constraint of artificially imposed\ntask horizons. In such cases, the most behaviorally-relevant representation\nwould carry information about when the agent was likely to first reach states\nof interest, rather than how often it should expect to visit them over a\npotentially infinite time span. To reflect such demands, we introduce the\nfirst-occupancy representation (FR), which measures the expected temporal\ndiscount to the first time a state is accessed.

Currently, reasonable\nestimations can be computed from single RGB images, especially when a\nmulti-task learning approach is used to force the system to consider the shape\nof the hand when its pose is determined. However, depending on the method used\nto represent the hand, the performance can drop considerably in real-life\ntasks, suggesting that stable descriptions are required to achieve satisfactory\nresults. In this paper, we present a keypoint-based end-to-end framework for 3D\nhand and pose estimation and successfully apply it to the task of hand gesture\nrecognition as a study case.

We found that with siblings and extended kin\ncommunication technologies could boost the frequency of interaction and help\nexchange support at a distance. With friendship ties, communication\ntechnologies provide a continuous, constant flow of interaction. We draw\nimplications for theories of social support and for social policy linked to\ninterventions aimed at helping vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 17:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

Over a lifelong manipulation process, the system\nkeeps learning features of objects it has interacted with and updates their\nreconstructed models. Whenever an instance of a previously manipulated object\nreappears, the system aims to first recognize it and then register its\npreviously reconstructed model given the current observation. This step greatly\nreduces object shape uncertainty allowing the system to even reason for parts\nof objects, which are currently not observable. This also results in better\nmanipulation efficiency as it reduces the need for active perception of the\ntarget object during manipulation. To get a reusable reconstructed model, the\nproposed pipeline adopts: i) TSDF for object representation, and ii) a variant\nof the standard particle filter algorithm for pose estimation and tracking of\nthe partial object model. Furthermore, an effective way to construct and\nmaintain a dataset of manipulated objects is presented. A sequence of\nreal-world manipulation experiments is performed.

A key problem hampering these efforts is that the\nhydrodynamics are often solved using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH),\nwhereas radiative transfer is typically solved on a grid. Here we present a\nradiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) scheme combining the SPH code Phantom and the\nMonte Carlo Radiative Transfer (MCRT) code CMacIonize, using the particle\ndistribution to construct a Voronoi grid on which the MCRT is performed. We\ndemonstrate that the scheme successfully reproduces the well-studied problem of\nD-type H II region expansion in a uniform density medium. Furthermore, we use\nthis simulation setup to study the robustness of the RHD code with varying\nchoice of grid structure, density mapping method, and mass and temporal\nresolution. To test the scheme under more realistic conditions, we apply it to\na simulated star-forming cloud reminiscing those in the Central Molecular Zone\nof our galaxy, in order to estimate the amount of ionised material that a\nsingle source could create. We find that a stellar population of several\n$10^3~\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ is needed to noticeably ionise the cloud. Based on our\nresults, we formulate a set of recommendations to guide the numerical setup of\nfuture and more complex simulations of star forming clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 18:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

During their\nlonger-lived evolutionary phases, stars are not expected to add to the Li\nbudget of the Galaxy, but to largely deplete it. In this context, recent\nanalyses of Li data from GALAH and LAMOST for field red clump (RC) stars have\nconcluded that there is the need for a new production channel of Li, ubiquitous\namong low-mass stars, and that would be triggered on the upper red giant branch\n(RGB) or at helium ignition. This is distinct from the \"Li-rich giant\" problem\nand reflects bulk RC star properties. We provide an analysis of the GALAH Li\ndata that accounts for the distribution of progenitor masses of field RC stars\nobserved today. Such progenitors are different than today's field RGB stars.\nUsing standard post main-sequence stellar evolution, we show that the\ndistribution of Li among field RC giants as observed by GALAH is consistent\nwith standard model predictions, and does not require new Li production\nmechanisms. Our model predicts a large fraction of very low Li abundances from\nlow mass progenitors, with higher abundances from higher mass ones. Moreover,\nthere should be a large number of upper limits for RC giants, and higher\nabundances should correspond to higher masses. The most recent GALAH data\nindeed confirm the presence of large numbers of upper limits, and a much lower\nmean Li abundance in RC stars, in concordance with our interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 18:00:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 01:05:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2022 22:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

However, the parabolic brush limit fails to describe polymers grafted\nto convex, curved substrates, such as the surfaces of spherical nanoparticles\nor the interfaces of strongly segregated block copolymers. It has been\npreviously shown that strongly-stretched, curved brushes require a boundary\nlayer devoid of free chain ends, requiring modifications of the theoretical\nanalysis. While this \"end exclusion zone\" has been successfully incorporated\ninto descriptions of brushes grafted onto the outer surfaces of cylinders and\nspheres, the behavior of brushes on surfaces of arbitrary curvature has not yet\nbeen studied. We present a formulation of the strong-stretching theory for\nmolten brushes on surfaces of arbitrary curvature and identify four distinct\nregimes of interest for which brushes are predicted to possess end exclusion\nzones, notably including regimes of positive mean curvature but negative\nGaussian curvature. Through numerical solutions of the strong-stretching brush\nequations, we report predicted scaling of the size of the end exclusion zone,\nthe chain end distribution, the chain polarization, and the free energy of\nstretching with mean and Gaussian surface curvatures. Through these results, we\npresent a comprehensive picture of how brush geometry influences the end\nexclusions zones and exact strong-stretching free energies, which can be\napplied, for example, to model the full spectrum of brush geometries\nencountered in block copolymer melt assembly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 18:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

In particular, it is crucial to develop efficient methods\nfor active device identification and message decoding in a multi-cell network\nwith fading, path loss, and delay uncertainties. This paper presents such a\nscheme using second-order Reed-Muller (RM) sequences and orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). For given positive integer $m$, a\ncodebook is generated with up to $2^{m(m+3)/2}$ codewords of length $2^m$,\nwhere each codeword is a unique RM sequence determined by a matrix-vector pair\nwith binary entries. This allows every device to send $m(m + 3)/2$ bits of\ninformation where an arbitrary number of these bits can be used to represent\nthe identity of a node, and the remaining bits represent a message. There can\nbe up to $2^{m(m+3)/2}$ different identities. Using an iterative algorithm, an\naccess point can estimate the matrix-vector pairs of each nearby device, as\nlong as not too many devices transmit in the same frame. It is shown that both\nthe computational complexity and the error performance of the proposed\nalgorithm exceed another state-of-the-art algorithm. The device identification\nand message decoding scheme developed in this work can serve as the basis for\ngrant-free massive access for billions of devices with hundreds of\nsimultaneously active devices in each cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 18:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

DirectLiNGAM algorithm is a well-known solution to learn\nthe true causal structure in high dimensional setting.

DNN training is commonly phrased as a stochastic\noptimization problem whose challenges include non-convexity, non-smoothness,\ninsufficient regularization, and complicated data distributions. Hence, the\nperformance of DNNs on a given task depends crucially on tuning\nhyperparameters, especially learning rates and regularization parameters. In\nthe absence of theoretical guidelines or prior experience on similar tasks,\nthis requires solving many training problems, which can be time-consuming and\ndemanding on computational resources. This can limit the applicability of DNNs\nto problems with non-standard, complex, and scarce datasets, e.g., those\narising in many scientific applications. To remedy the challenges of DNN\ntraining, we propose slimTrain, a stochastic optimization method for training\nDNNs with reduced sensitivity to the choice hyperparameters and fast initial\nconvergence. The central idea of slimTrain is to exploit the separability\ninherent in many DNN architectures; that is, we separate the DNN into a\nnonlinear feature extractor followed by a linear model. This separability\nallows us to leverage recent advances made for solving large-scale, linear,\nill-posed inverse problems. Crucially, for the linear weights, slimTrain does\nnot require a learning rate and automatically adapts the regularization\nparameter. Since our method operates on mini-batches, its computational\noverhead per iteration is modest. In our numerical experiments, slimTrain\noutperforms existing DNN training methods with the recommended hyperparameter\nsettings and reduces the sensitivity of DNN training to the remaining\nhyperparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 19:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

We analyze the\ndynamics of fast flavor conversions with collisions in detail based on the\nmotion of polarization vectors in cylindrical coordinate analogous to a\npendulum motion. The phase of the all polarization vector synchronizes in the\nlinear evolution, and the phase deviation from the Hamiltonian governs the\nconversion of neutrino flavor.

In this work we introduce\nfrequency tuned bipolar (FTB) gradients as a variation of oscillating gradients\nwith reduced echo time and demonstrate their utility by mapping the frequency\ndispersion of diffusion kurtosis in human subjects. Methods: An FTB oscillating\ngradient waveform is presented that provides encoding of 1.5 net oscillation\nperiods thereby reducing the echo time of the acquisition. Simulations were\nperformed to determine an optimal protocol based on SNR of kurtosis frequency\ndispersion - defined as the difference in kurtosis between pulsed and\noscillating gradient acquisitions. Healthy human subjects were scanned at 7T\nusing pulsed gradient and an optimized 23 Hz FTB protocol, which featured a\nmaximum b-value of 2500 s/mm2. In addition, to directly compare existing\nmethods, measurements using traditional cosine OGSE were also acquired.\nResults: FTB oscillating gradients demonstrated equivalent frequency dependent\ndiffusion measurements compared to cosine modulated OGSE while enabling a\nsignificant reduction in echo time. Optimization and in vivo results suggest\nFTB gradients provide increased SNR of kurtosis dispersion maps compared to\ntraditional cosine OGSE. The optimized FTB gradient protocol demonstrated\nconsistent reductions in apparent kurtosis values and increased diffusivity in\ngenerated frequency dispersion maps.

Recently, this concept has been generalized to the pair density\nwave (PDW) state predicted to exist in a variety of strongly correlated\nelectronic materials such as the cuprates. Although the signature of a cuprate\nPDW has been detected in Cooper-pair tunnelling, the distinctive signature in\nsingle-electron tunneling of a periodic $\\Delta(r)$ modulation has never been\nobserved. Here, using a new approach, we discover strong $\\Delta(r)$\nmodulations in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$+$\\delta$ that have eight-unit-cell\nperiodicity or wavevectors $Q=2{\\pi}/a_0(1/8,0)$; $2{\\pi}/a_0(0,1/8)$. This\nconstitutes the first energy-resolved spectroscopic evidence for the cuprate\nPDW state. An analysis of spatial arrangements of $\\Delta(r)$ modulations then\nreveals that this PDW is predominantly unidirectional, but with an arrangement\nof nanoscale domains indicative of a vestigial PDW. Simultaneous imaging of the\nlocal-density-of-states $N(r,E)$ reveals electronic modulations with\nwavevectors $Q$ and $2Q$, as anticipated when the PDW coexists with\nsuperconductivity. Finally, by visualizing the topological defects in these\n$N(r,E)$ density waves at $2Q$, we discover them to be concentrated in areas\nwhere the PDW spatial phase changes by $\\pi$, as predicted by the theory of\nhalf-vortices in a PDW state. Overall, this is a compelling demonstration, from\nmultiple single-electron signatures, of a PDW state coexisting with\nsuperconductivity at zero magnetic field, in the canonical cuprate\nBi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$+$\\delta$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 20:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-02"}

In this\npaper, we develop a new formalism that combines the shape information from\nimaging surveys with the kinematic information from resolved spectroscopy to\nbetter constrain the lensing distortion of source galaxies and to potentially\naddress systematic errors that affect conventional weak-lensing analyses. Using\na Bayesian forward model applied to mock galaxy observations, we model\ndistortions in the source galaxy's velocity field simultaneously with the\napparent shear-induced offset between the kinematic and photometric major axes.\nWe show that this combination dramatically reduces the statistical uncertainty\non the inferred shear, yielding statistical error gains of a factor of 2--6\ncompared to kinematics alone. While we have not accounted for errors from\nintrinsic kinematic irregularities, our approach opens kinematic lensing\nstudies to higher redshifts where resolved spectroscopy is more challenging.\nFor example, we show that ground-based integral-field spectroscopy of\nbackground galaxies at $z \\sim 0.7$ can deliver gravitational shear\nmeasurements with S/N $\\sim 1$ per source galaxy at 1 arcminute separations\nfrom a galaxy cluster at $z \\sim 0.3$.

Messages are often repeated, and such repetition can improve\nperformance in the form of cumulative influence. Repeated messages may also be\nignored due to a limited ability to process information. Learning processes are\nleading to the repeated messages being ignored, as their content has already\nbeen absorbed. In such cases, responsiveness decreases with repetition, and the\nhabituation effect can be observed. Here, we analyse spreading processes while\nconsidering the habituation effect and performance drop along with an increased\nnumber of contacts. The the ability to recover when reducing the number of\nmessages is also considered. The results show that even low habituation and a\ndecrease in propagation probability may substantially impact network coverage.\nThis can lead to a significant reduction in the potential for a seed set\nselected with an influence maximisation method.

Age of Information (AoI) has\nbeen studied extensively as a metric for the freshness of information in such\nsystems with and without an enforced hard or soft deadline. In this paper, we\npropose three metrics for status update systems to measure the ability of\ndifferent queuing systems to meet a threshold requirement for the AoI. The {\\em\noverage probability} is defined as the probability that the age of the most\nrecent update packet held by the receiver is larger than the threshold. The\n{\\em stale update probability} is the probability that an update is stale,\ni.e., its age has exceeded the deadline, when it is delivered to the receiver.\nFinally, the {\\em average overage} is defined as the time average of the\noverage (i.e., age beyond the threshold), and is a measure of the average\n``staleness'' of the update packets held by the receiver. We investigate these\nmetrics in three typical status update queuing systems -- M/G/1/1, M/G/1/$2^*$,\nand M/M/1. Numerical results show the performances for these metrics under\ndifferent parameter settings and different service distributions. The\ndifferences between the average overage and average AoI are also shown. Our\nresults demonstrate that a lower bound exists for the stale update probability\nwhen the buffer size is limited.

Recently,\nthe advent of Weyl and Dirac semimetals has brought about an interesting\nplatform for potentially uncovering phases of matter that combine nontrivial\nband topology and interactions. While electronic instabilities of such\nsemimetals at strong magnetic fields have been explored theoretically and\nexperimentally, the role of electron-phonon interactions therein has been\nlargely neglected. In this paper, we study the interplay of electron-electron\nand electron-phonon interactions in a minimal two-node model of Weyl semimetal.\nUsing a Kadanoff-Wilson renormalization group approach, we analyze lattice\n(Peierls) instabilities emerging from chiral and nonchiral Landau levels as a\nfunction of the magnetic field. We consider both the adiabatic and the\nnonadiabatic phonon regimes, in the presence or in the absence of improper\nsymmetries that relate Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. We find that (i) the\nCooper channel, often neglected in recent studies, can prevent purely\nelectronic instabilities while enabling lattice instabilities that are not\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like; (ii) breaking the improper symmetry that\nrelates the two Weyl nodes suppresses the Cooper channel, thereby increasing\nthe critical temperature for the lattice instability; (iii) in the adiabatic\nphonon regime, lattice instabilities can preempt purely electronic\ninstabilities; (iv) pseudoscalar phonons are more prone to undergo a Peierls\ninstability than scalar phonons. In short, our study emphasizes the importance\nof taking electron-phonon interactions into account for a complete\nunderstanding of interacting phases of matter in Dirac and Weyl semimetals at\nhigh magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 22:35:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 22:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 09:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

We consider single-species and two-species systems. In\nboth cases, we derive the corresponding macroscopic model and compare it with\nthe average behaviour of the ABM. We see good agreement between the ABM and the\nmacroscopic density. We also derive an expression for the cell-level diffusion\ncoefficient in terms of the swapping probability and cell density. We conclude\nby showing applications of swapping by using the ABM to represent cell movement\nwith proliferation and cell-cell adhesion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 23:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

The\nproposed structure addresses the scalability of the approach and the privacy\npreservation of the multi-agent system's state information. The former is\naddressed by using decentralized local observers, and the latter is achieved by\nimposing unobservability conditions at the global level. Also, the\ncommunication graph model is subject to topology switching, triggered by local\nobservers, allowing for the detection of stealthy attacks by the global\nobserver.

To date, QRA has mostly focused on\ntechnical barriers, despite many accidents having human failure as a primary\ncause or a contributing factor. Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) allows for the\nassessment of the human contribution to risk to be assessed both qualitatively\nand quantitatively. Most credible and highly advanced HRA methods have largely\nbeen developed and applied in support of nuclear power plants control room\noperations and in context of probabilistic risk analysis. Moreover, many of the\nHRA methods have issues that have led to inconsistencies, insufficient\ntraceability and reproducibility in both the qualitative and quantitative\nphases. Given the need to assess human error in the context of the oil\nindustry, it is necessary to evaluate available HRA methodologies and assess\nits applicability to petroleum operations. Furthermore, it is fundamental to\nassess these methods against good practices of HRA and the requirements for\nadvanced HRA methods. The present paper accomplishes this by analyzing seven\nHRA methods. The evaluation of the methods was performed in three stages. The\nfirst stage consisted of an evaluation of the degree of adaptability of the\nmethod for the Oil and Gas industry. In the second stage the methods were\nevaluated against desirable items in an HRA method. The higher-ranked methods\nwere evaluated, in the third stage, against requirements for advanced HRA\nmethods. In addition to the methods' evaluation, this paper presents an\noverview of state-of-the-art discussions on HRA, led by the Nuclear industry\ncommunity. It remarks that these discussions must be seriously considered in\ndefining a technical roadmap to a credible HRA method for the Oil and Gas\nindustry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 23:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

Tumours are able to express a variety of competing phenotypes\nwith different attributes and thus respond differently to various anti-cancer\ntherapies.

Cascade effects on final\noutcomes for secondary lesions are also investigated, showing that actions on\nprimary lesions could sometimes result in unexpected clearances of secondary\ntumours.

This relational specification can be viewed\nas the construction of a constraint program, allowing edits to coherently\npropagate to other parts of the design.

The phenomenon has\nbeen extensively investigated in the literature, both by means of experiments\nas well as via numerical simulations. The occurrence of the velocity jump has\nbeen associated with a change of the bubble shape under the formation of a\npointed tip at the rear end and to the appearance of a so-called negative wake\nwith the liquid velocity behind the bubble, pointing in the opposite direction\nto that in viscous Newtonian fluids. We revisit this topic, starting with a\nreview of the state of knowledge on the interrelations between the mentioned\ncharacteristic features. In search for a convincing explanation of the jump\nphenomenon, we performed detailed numerical simulations of the transient rise\nof single bubbles in 3D, allowing for a local polymer molecular conformation\ntensor analysis. The latter shows that polymer molecules traveling along the\nupper bubble hemisphere are stretched in the circumferential direction, due to\nthe flow kinematics. Then, depending on the relaxation time scale of the\npolymer, the stored elastic energy is either unloaded essentially above or\nbelow the bubble's equator. In the former case, this slows down the bubble,\nwhile the bubble gets accelerated otherwise. In this latter case, the relative\nvelocity of the polymer molecules against the bubble is increased, giving rise\nto a self-amplification of the effect and thus causing the bubble rise velocity\nto jump to a higher level. Detailed experimental velocity measurements in the\nliquid field around the bubble confirmed the conclusion that the ratio of the\ntime scale of the Lagrangian transport of polymer molecules along the bubble\ncontour to the relaxation time scale of the polymer molecules determines the\nsub- or supercritical state of the bubble motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 01:21:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2022 18:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

DPM is\nuseful in many ways such as predicting health state, categorizing disease\nstages, and assessing patients disease trajectory etc. Recently, with wider\navailability of electronic health records (EHR) and the broad application of\ndata-driven machine learning method, DPM has attracted much attention yet\nremains two major challenges: (i) Due to the existence of irregularity,\nheterogeneity and long-term dependency in EHRs, most existing DPM methods might\nnot be able to provide comprehensive patient representations. (ii) Lots of\nrecords in EHRs might be irrelevant to the target disease. Most existing models\nlearn to automatically focus on the relevant information instead of explicitly\ncapture the target-relevant events, which might make the learned model\nsuboptimal.

A two-component scenario with a main electron\ncomponent and a secondary proton component has been proposed to explain the\nwhole spectrum of the Crab Nebula, requiring a proton energy of\n$10^{46}-10^{47}{\\rm ergs}$ remaining in the present Crab Nebula. In this\npaper, we study the energy content of relativistic protons in pulsar winds with\nthe LHAASO data of the Crab Nebula, considering the effect of diffusive escape\nof relativistic protons. Depending on the extent of the escape of relativistic\nprotons, the total energy of protons lost in the pulsar wind could be 10-100\ntimes larger than that remaining in the nebula presently. We find that the\ncurrent LHAASO data allows up to $(10-50)\\%$ of the spindown energy of pulsars\nbeing converted into relativistic protons. The escaping protons from PWNe could\nmake a considerable contribution to the cosmic-ray flux of 10-100 PeV. We also\ndiscuss the leptonic scenario for the possible spectral hardening at PeV\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 02:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

Specifically, deep\nreinforcement learning algorithms have been highly effective in synthesizing\nneural-network controllers for a wide range of tasks.

This is in stark contrast to traditional model-based controller\ndesign, where principled approaches (like LQR) can synthesize stable\ncontrollers with provable guarantees. To address this gap, we propose a generic\nmethod to synthesize a Lyapunov-stable neural-network controller, together with\na neural-network Lyapunov function to simultaneously certify its stability. Our\napproach formulates the Lyapunov condition verification as a mixed-integer\nlinear program (MIP).

In this study, we formulate this idea as the so-called latent\nlanguage hypothesis (LLH), connecting linguistic representation learning to\ngeneral predictive processing within and across sensory modalities. We review\nthe extent that the audiovisual aspect of LLH is supported by the existing\ncomputational studies. We then explore LLH further in extensive learning\nsimulations with different neural network models for audiovisual\ncross-situational learning, and comparing learning from both synthetic and real\nspeech data. We investigate whether the latent representations learned by the\nnetworks reflect phonetic, syllabic, or lexical structure of input speech by\nutilizing an array of complementary evaluation metrics related to linguistic\nselectivity and temporal characteristics of the representations.

Our central finding is that a\nricher world is likely to be associated with a lower population, an effect\nespecially pronounced in rapidly developing countries. In our baseline\nscenario, where GDP per capita follows a business-as-usual trajectory, global\npopulation is projected to reach 9.2 billion in 2050 and peak in 2062.

In comparison to previous\napproaches, our implementation uses live dynamic analysis of a software\nsystem's runtime behavior. At any time, users can toggle the heat map feature\nand choose which runtime-dependent metric the heat map should visualize. Our\napproach continuously and automatically renders both software cities and heat\nmaps. It does not require a manual or semi-automatic generation of heat maps\nand seamlessly blends into the overall software visualization. We implemented\nthis approach in our web-based tool ExplorViz, such that the heat map overlay\nis also available in our augmented reality environment. ExplorViz is developed\nas open source software and is continuously published via Docker images. A live\ndemo of ExplorViz is publicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 06:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

An algorithm that performs\ninference on a factor graph should ideally be equivariant or invariant to\npermutations of global indices of nodes, variable orderings within a factor,\nand variable assignment orderings. However, existing neural network-based\ninference procedures fail to take advantage of this inductive bias. In this\npaper, we precisely characterize these isomorphic properties of factor graphs\nand propose two inference models: Factor-Equivariant Neural Belief Propagation\n(FE-NBP) and Factor-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (FE-GNN). FE-NBP is a\nneural network that generalizes BP and respects each of the above properties of\nfactor graphs while FE-GNN is an expressive GNN model that relaxes an\nisomorphic property in favor of greater expressivity. Empirically, we\ndemonstrate on both real-world and synthetic datasets, for both marginal\ninference and MAP inference, that FE-NBP and FE-GNN together cover a range of\nsample complexity regimes: FE-NBP achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nsmall datasets while FE-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on large\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 06:54:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

However, the\nsupervised training of SNNs remains a hard problem due to the discontinuity of\nthe spiking neuron model. Most existing methods imitate the backpropagation\nframework and feedforward architectures for artificial neural networks, and use\nsurrogate derivatives or compute gradients with respect to the spiking time to\ndeal with the problem. These approaches either accumulate approximation errors\nor only propagate information limitedly through existing spikes, and usually\nrequire information propagation along time steps with large memory costs and\nbiological implausibility. In this work, we consider feedback spiking neural\nnetworks, which are more brain-like, and propose a novel training method that\ndoes not rely on the exact reverse of the forward computation. First, we show\nthat the average firing rates of SNNs with feedback connections would gradually\nevolve to an equilibrium state along time, which follows a fixed-point\nequation. Then by viewing the forward computation of feedback SNNs as a\nblack-box solver for this equation, and leveraging the implicit differentiation\non the equation, we can compute the gradient for parameters without considering\nthe exact forward procedure. In this way, the forward and backward procedures\nare decoupled and therefore the problem of non-differentiable spiking functions\nis avoided.

Convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), which are state of the art, have limitations owing to the lack of\nimage-specific adaptation, such as low tissue contrasts and structural\ninhomogeneities, thereby leading to incomplete segmentation results. This paper\npresents a deep learning based automatic segmentation framework for knee tissue\nsegmentation. A novel multipath CNN-based method is proposed, which consists of\nan encoder decoder-based segmentation network in combination with a low rank\ntensor-reconstructed segmentation network. Low rank reconstruction in MRI\ntensor sub-blocks is introduced to exploit the structural and morphological\nvariations in knee tissues.

In this\nmodel, a large amount of energy is released from the magnetar crust due to the\nmagnetic reconnection or the starquakes of the star surface and is injected\ninto confined field lines, forming a trapped fireball bubble. After breaking\nthrough the shackles and expanding to the photospheric radius, the thermal\nphotons of the fireball are eventually Comptonized by the relativistic\n$e^{\\pm}$ pairs in the magnetar wind region, which produces additional\nhigher-energy gamma-ray emission.

Previous studies\nsuggest that many modern neural networks are over-confident on the predictions,\nhowever, surprisingly, we discover that GNNs are primarily in the opposite\ndirection, i.e., GNNs are under-confident. Therefore, the confidence\ncalibration for GNNs is highly desired. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntrustworthy GNN model by designing a topology-aware post-hoc calibration\nfunction.

We have identified four flow regimes in our simulation:\nmultiple small vortices, coexisted large-scale cyclone and anticyclone,\nlarge-scale cyclone, and turbulence. The formation of large-scale vortices\nrequires two conditions to be satisfied: the vertical Reynolds number is large\n($Re_{z}\\ge 400$), and the Rossby number is small ($Ro\\leq 0.4$). Large-scale\ncyclone first appears when $Ro$ decreases to be smaller than 0.4. When $Ro$\nfurther decreases to be smaller than 0.1, coexisted large-scale anticyclone\nemerges. We have studied the heat transfer in rapidly rotating convection. The\nresult reveals that the heat transfer is more efficient in the anticyclonic\nregion than in the cyclonic region.

To tackle this\nproblem, we introduce persistent homology as a rigorous framework that can be\nused to both define and compute higher-order features of data in a manner which\nis invariant to parameter choices, robust to noise, and independent of human\nobservation. Our work demonstrates its relevance for spatial games by showing\nhow topological features of simulation data that persist over different spatial\nscales reflect the stability of strategies in 2D lattice games. To do so, we\nanalyze the persistent homology of scenarios from two games: a Prisoner's\nDilemma and a SIRS epidemic model.

As a common approach to\ncounter these attacks, security staff deploy a variety of security and\nnon-security sensors at different lines of defense (Network, Host, and\nApplication) to track the attacker's behaviors during their kill chain.\nHowever, one of the drawbacks of this approach is the huge amount of events\nraised by heterogeneous security and non-security sensors which makes it\ndifficult to analyze logged events for later processing i.e. event correlation\nfor timely detection of APT attacks. Till now, some research papers have been\npublished on event aggregation for reducing the volume of logged low-level\nevents. However, most research works have been provided a method to aggregate\nthe events of a single-type and homogeneous event source i.e. NIDS. In\naddition, their main focus is only on the degree to which the event volume is\nreduced, while the amount of security information lost during the event\naggregation process is also very important. In this paper, we propose a\nthree-phase event aggregation method to reduce the volume of logged\nheterogeneous events during APT attacks considering the lowest rate of loss of\nsecurity information. To this aim, at first, low-level events of the sensors\nare clustered into some similar event groups and then, after filtering noisy\nevent clusters, the remained clusters are summarized based on an\nAttribute-Oriented Induction (AOI) method in a controllable manner to reduce\nthe unimportant or duplicated events. The method has been evaluated on the\nthree publicly available datasets: SotM34, Bryant, and LANL. The experimental\nresults show that the method is efficient enough in event aggregation and can\nreduce events volume up to 99.7\\% with an acceptable level of information loss\nratio (ILR).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 09:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

The measured data\nare affected by a large amplitude broadband noise, which has both mechanical\nand electronic origin. Noise sources cannot be easily avoided or removed, since\nthey are associated with the vibrations of the structure of the towing carriage\nand to the interaction between the measurement chain and the electromagnetic\nfields. The EEMD noise reduction method is based on the decomposition of the\nsignal into modes and on its partial reconstruction using the residue, the\nsignal-dominant modes and some further modes treated with a thresholding\ntechnique, which helps to retain some of the sharp features of the signal. The\nstrategy is developed and tested first on a synthetic signal with a\nsuperimposed and known background noise.

One consequence is that it is a challenge for surface flux\ntransport models (SFTMs) based on sunspot observations to determine the details\nof BMR emergence, which they require as input, from such data. We aimed to\nestablish the relationship between the amount of magnetic flux in newly emerged\nBMRs and the area of the enclosed sunspots. Earlier attempts to constrain BMR\nmagnetic flux were hindered by the fact that there is no proper database of the\nmagnetic and physical properties of newly emerged BMRs currently available. We\nmade use of the empirical model of the relationship between the disc-integrated\nfacular and network magnetic flux and the total surface coverage by sunspots\nreported in a recent study. The structure of the model is such that it enabled\nus to establish, from these disc-integrated quantities, an empirical\nrelationship between the magnetic flux and sunspot area of individual newly\nemerged BMRs, circumventing the lack of any proper BMR database. Applying the\nconstraint on BMR magnetic flux derived here to an established SFTM retained\nits ability to replicate various independent datasets and the correlation\nbetween the model output polar field at the end of each cycle and the observed\nstrength of the following cycle. The SFTM output indicates that facular and\nnetwork magnetic flux rises with increasing sunspot magnetic flux at a slowing\nrate such that it appears to gradually saturate, analogous to earlier studies.\nThe activity dependence of the ratio of facular and network flux to sunspot\nflux is consistent with the findings of recent studies: although the Sun is\nfaculae-dominated, it is only marginally so as facular and network brightening\nand sunspot darkening appear to be closely balanced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 09:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

This model incorporates both\nfrequency constraints and natural gas system (NGS) operational constraints and\naddresses the wind power uncertainty by designing DR joint chance constraints.\nWe show that this model admits a mixed-integer second-order cone programming.\nCase studies demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide a highly\nreliable and computationally efficient solution and show the importance of\nincorporating NGS operational constraints in the frequency constrained\nscheduling problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 10:02:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

To understand how edge ML accelerators perform,\nwe characterize the performance of a commercial Google Edge TPU, using 24\nGoogle edge NN models (which span a wide range of NN model types) and analyzing\neach NN layer within each model. We find that the Edge TPU suffers from three\nmajor shortcomings: (1) it operates significantly below peak computational\nthroughput, (2) it operates significantly below its theoretical energy\nefficiency, and (3) its memory system is a large energy and performance\nbottleneck. Our characterization reveals that the one-size-fits-all, monolithic\ndesign of the Edge TPU ignores the high degree of heterogeneity both across\ndifferent NN models and across different NN layers within the same NN model,\nleading to the shortcomings we observe.\n  We propose a new acceleration framework called Mensa. Mensa incorporates\nmultiple heterogeneous edge ML accelerators (including both on-chip and\nnear-data accelerators), each of which caters to the characteristics of a\nparticular subset of NN models and layers. During NN inference, for each NN\nlayer, Mensa decides which accelerator to schedule the layer on, taking into\naccount both the optimality of each accelerator for the layer and\nlayer-to-layer communication costs. Averaged across all 24 Google edge NN\nmodels, Mensa improves energy efficiency and throughput by 3.0x and 3.1x over\nthe Edge TPU, and by 2.4x and 4.3x over Eyeriss~v2, a state-of-the-art\naccelerator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 10:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

Individuals are then seen by observers as the output of a\nfilter that emphasizes a certain range of high or low frequencies. The\nselection of the filter depends on the social distance between the observing\nindividual or group and the person being observed as well as on motivation,\ncognitive resources and cultural background.

The\nfavoured explosion mechanism is by core-collapse, with the shock later revived\nby neutrino heating. However, there is an upper limit to the amount of\nradioactive Nickel-56 that such models can accomplish. Recent literature point\nto a tension between the maximum luminosity from such simulations and\nobservations. We use a well characterized sample of SE SNe from the Zwicky\nTransient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (BTS) to collect a sample of\nspectroscopically classified normal Type Ibc SNe for which we use the ZTF light\ncurves to determine the maximum luminosity. We cull the sample further based on\ndata quality, light-curve shape, distance and colors. The methodology of the\nsample construction from this BTS sample can be used for many other future\ninvestigations. In total we use 129 Type Ib or Type Ic BTS SNe with an initial\nrough luminosity distribution peaked at Mr = -17.61 +- 0.72, and where 36% are\napparently brighter than the theoretically predicted maximum brightness of Mr =\n-17.8. When we further cull this sample to ensure that the SNe are normal Type\nIbc with good LC data within the Hubble flow, the sample of 94 objects has Mr =\n-17.64 +- 0.54. A main uncertainty in absolute magnitude determinations for SNe\nis the host galaxy extinction correction, but the reddened objects only get\nmore luminous after corrections. If we simply exclude objects with red, unusual\nor uncertain colors, we are left with 14 objects at M = -17.90 +- 0.73, whereof\na handful are most certainly brighter than the suggested theoretical limit. The\nmain result of this study is thus that normal SNe Ibc do indeed reach\nluminosities above $10^{42.6}$ erg/s, apparently in conflict with existing\nexplosion models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 10:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

We build upon recent advancements in embedded platforms with\nre-programmable logic to design native in-memory access on rows and columns.\nOur approach, termed Relational Memory, relies on an FPGA- based accelerator\nthat sits between the CPU and main memory and transparently transforms base\ndata to any group of columns with minimal overhead at runtime. This design\nallows accessing any group of columns as if it already exists in memory. We\nimplement and deploy Relational Memory in real hardware, and we show that we\ncan access the desired columns up to 1.63x faster than accessing them from\ntheir row-wise counterpart, while matching the performance of a pure columnar\naccess for low projectivity, and outperforming it by up to 1.87x as\nprojectivity (and tuple re-construction cost) increases. Moreover, our approach\ncan be easily extended to support offloading of a number of operations to\nhardware, e.g., selection, group by, aggregation, and joins, having the\npotential to vastly simplify the software logic and accelerate the query\nexecution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 11:10:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 14:47:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

Novel benchmarks for multilingual natural\nlanguage understanding (NLU) include monolingual sentences in several\nlanguages, annotated with intents and slots. In such setup models for\ncross-lingual transfer show remarkable performance in joint intent recognition\nand slot filling. However, existing benchmarks lack of code-switched\nutterances, which are difficult to gather and label due to complexity in the\ngrammatical structure. The evaluation of NLU models seems biased and limited,\nsince code-switching is being left out of scope.\n  Our work adopts recognized methods to generate plausible and\nnaturally-sounding code-switched utterances and uses them to create a synthetic\ncode-switched test set. Based on experiments, we report that the\nstate-of-the-art NLU models are unable to handle code-switching.

The operation of a large number of different\nself-powered sensors is within the framework of a massive machine-type\ncommunications scenario using random access methods. Topical issues in this\ntype of communication are: reducing the transmission signal power and\nincreasing the duration of the device by reducing the consumption energy per\nbit. Formulation and analysis of the tasks of minimizing transmission power and\nspent energy per bit in systems without retransmissions and with\nretransmissions to obtain achievability bounds. A model of the system is\ndescribed, within which four problems of minimizing signal power and energy\nconsumption for given parameters (the number of information bits, the spectral\nefficiency of the system, and the Packet Delivery Ratio) are formulated and\ndescribed. The numerical results of solving these optimization problems are\npresented, which make it possible to obtain the achievability bounds for the\nconsidered characteristics in systems with and without losses. The lower bounds\nobtained by the Shannon formula are presented, assuming that the message length\nis not limited.

A rigorous cost and error analysis shows that a randomly shifted\nquasi-Monte Carlo method leads to a faster rate of decay in the root mean\nsquare error of the gradient than the ordinary Monte Carlo method, while\nconsidering multiple levels substantially reduces the computational effort.\nNumerical experiments confirm the improved rate of convergence and show that\nthe MLQMC method outperforms the multilevel Monte Carlo method and the single\nlevel quasi-Monte Carlo method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 11:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

Since the local regions similar to\ninfrared small-dim targets spread over the whole background, exploring the\ninteraction information amongst image features in large-range dependencies to\nmine the difference between the target and background is crucial for robust\ndetection. However, existing deep learning-based methods are limited by the\nlocality of convolutional neural networks, which impairs the ability to capture\nlarge-range dependencies. Additionally, the small-dim appearance of the\ninfrared target makes the detection model highly possible to miss detection. To\nthis end, we propose a robust and general infrared small-dim target detection\nmethod with the transformer. We adopt the self-attention mechanism of the\ntransformer to learn the interaction information of image features in a larger\nrange. Moreover, we design a feature enhancement module to learn discriminative\nfeatures of small-dim targets to avoid miss detection. After that, to avoid the\nloss of the target information, we adopt a decoder with the U-Net-like skip\nconnection operation to contain more information of small-dim targets. Finally,\nwe get the detection result by a segmentation head.

We built a compact\nwidefield NV microscope which incorporates an integrated widefield diamond\nprobe with full position and angular control, and developed a systematic\nalignment procedure based on optical interference fringes. Using this platform,\nwe imaged an ultrathin (1 nm) magnetic film test sample, and conducted a\ndetailed study of the spatial resolution. We reproducibly achieved an estimated\nNV-sample standoff (and hence spatial resolution) of at most $\\sim2~\\mu$m\nacross a $\\sim0.5$ mm field of view. Guided by these results, we suggest future\nimprovements for approaching the optical diffraction limit. This work is a step\ntowards realizing a widefield NV microscope suitable for routine\nhigh-throughput mapping of magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 12:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

The breeding of the $D$\nmeson of the reaction, such as $D^0X(3872)\\to D^0\\bar{D}^0D^0$, makes the chain\nreaction of $X(3872)$ matter possible. We estimate the cross section of the $D$\nmeson induced fission-like process of $X(3872)$ into two $D$ mesons. With very\nsmall $D^0$ beam momentum of 1 eV, the total cross section reaches an order of\n1000 b, and decreases rapidly with the increasing of beam momentum. With the\ntransition of $D^*$ meson in molecular states to a $D$ meson, the $X(3872)$ can\nrelease large energy, which is acquired by the final mesons. The momentum\ndistributions of the final $D$ mesons are analyzed. In the laboratory frame,\nthe spectator $D$ meson in molecular state concentrates in the low momentum\narea. The energy from the transition frim $D^*$ to $D$ meson is mainly acquired\nby two scattered $D$ mesons.

Tracing their evolution on a stellar corona allows\nus to characterize the X-ray cycles. However, directly mapping magnetic\nstructures is feasible only for the Sun, while such structures are spatially\nunresolved with present-day X-ray instruments on stellar coronae. We present\nhere a new method, implemented by us, that indirectly reproduces the stellar\nX-ray spectrum and its variability with solar magnetic structures. The\ntechnique converts solar corona observations into a format identical to that of\nstellar X-ray observations and, specifically, XMM-Newton spectra. From matching\nthese synthetic spectra with those observed for a star of interest, a\nfractional surface coverage with solar magnetic structures can be associated to\neach X-ray observation. We apply this method to two young solar-like stars:\n$\\epsilon$ Eri ($\\sim 400$ Myr), the youngest star to display a coronal cycle\n($\\sim 3$ yr), and Kepler 63 ($\\sim 200$ Myr), for which the X-ray monitoring\ndid not reveal a cyclic variability.

Although multiple candidates are generated by an ASR system through beam\nsearch, current error correction approaches can only correct one sentence at a\ntime, failing to leverage the voting effect from multiple candidates to better\ndetect and correct error tokens. In this work, we propose FastCorrect 2, an\nerror correction model that takes multiple ASR candidates as input for better\ncorrection accuracy. FastCorrect 2 adopts non-autoregressive generation for\nfast inference, which consists of an encoder that processes multiple source\nsentences and a decoder that generates the target sentence in parallel from the\nadjusted source sentence, where the adjustment is based on the predicted\nduration of each source token. However, there are some issues when handling\nmultiple source sentences. First, it is non-trivial to leverage the voting\neffect from multiple source sentences since they usually vary in length. Thus,\nwe propose a novel alignment algorithm to maximize the degree of token\nalignment among multiple sentences in terms of token and pronunciation\nsimilarity. Second, the decoder can only take one adjusted source sentence as\ninput, while there are multiple source sentences. Thus, we develop a candidate\npredictor to detect the most suitable candidate for the decoder. Experiments on\nour inhouse dataset and AISHELL-1 show that FastCorrect 2 can further reduce\nthe WER over the previous correction model with single candidate by 3.2% and\n2.6%, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging multiple candidates in ASR\nerror correction.

In the present work, we apply this approach to the\nasteroid Bennu using real data from the Osiris Rex mission. The mission\nmeasured the trajectories of not only the Osiris Rex spacecraft itself, but\nalso of numerous pebble-sized rock particles which temporarily orbited Bennu.\n  From these trajectory data, we obtain a representation of Bennu's mass\ndensity and validate it by propagating, in the resulting gravity field,\nmultiple pebbles not used in the training process.

This\nleads to difficulties in model training and subsequently impedes their\neffectiveness. In this work, we propose a novel deep hashing model with only a\nsingle learning objective. Specifically, we show that maximizing the cosine\nsimilarity between the continuous codes and their corresponding binary\northogonal codes can ensure both hash code discriminativeness and quantization\nerror minimization. Further, with this learning objective, code balancing can\nbe achieved by simply using a Batch Normalization (BN) layer and multi-label\nclassification is also straightforward with label smoothing. The result is an\none-loss deep hashing model that removes all the hassles of tuning the weights\nof various losses.

In this work, an agent-based model for preemptive\nevacuation decisions during typhoon is presented. In the model, civilians are\nrepresented by households and their evacuation decisions were based from\ncalculated perceived risk. Also, rescuer and shelter manager agents were\nincluded as facilitators during the preemptive evacuation process. National and\nmunicipal census data were employed in the model, particularly for the\ndemographics of household agents. Further, geospatial data of a village in a\ntyphoon-susceptible municipality was used to represent the environment. The\ndecision to evacuate or not to evacuate depends on the agent's perceived risk\nwhich also depends on three decision factors: characteristics of the decision\nmaker (CDM); capacity related factors (CRF); and hazard related factors (HRF).\nFinally, the number of households who decided to evacuate or opted to stay as\ninfluenced by the model`s decision factors were determined during simulations.\nSensitivity analysis using linear regression shows that all parameters used in\nthe model are significant in the evacuation decision of household agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 14:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

Hence, these methods are not applicable to disease or\nnon-normally distributed traits. Therefore, there is a need to develop unified\nand flexible methods to study association between a set of (possibly rare)\ngenetic variants and non-normal multivariate phenotypes. Copulas are\nmultivariate distribution functions with uniform margins on the $[0, 1]$\ninterval and they provide suitable models to deal with non-normality of errors\nin multivariate association studies.

In the state-of-the-art methods data about the process of human\nplanning is often used to group similar behaviors together and formulate verbal\ndescriptions of the strategies which might underlie those groups. Here, we\nautomate these two steps. Our method utilizes a new algorithm, called\nHuman-Interpret, that performs imitation learning to describe sequences of\nplanning operations in terms of a procedural formula and then translates that\nformula to natural language.

In this study, a new method is proposed to objectively and\nautomatically assess heart and lung signal quality on a 5-level scale in\nreal-time and to assess the effect of signal quality on vital sign estimation.\nFor the evaluation, a total of 207 10s long chest sounds were taken from 119\npreterm and full-term babies. Thirty of the recordings from ten subjects were\nobtained with synchronous vital signs from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit\n(NICU) based on electrocardiogram recordings. As reference, seven annotators\nindependently assessed the signal quality. For automatic quality\nclassification, 400 features were extracted from the chest sounds. After\nfeature selection using minimum redundancy and maximum relevancy algorithm,\nclass balancing, and hyper-parameter optimization, a variety of multi-class and\nordinal classification and regression algorithms were trained. Then, heart rate\nand breathing rate were automatically estimated from the chest sounds using\nadapted pre-existing methods. The results of subject-wise leave-one-out\ncross-validation show that the best-performing models had a mean squared error\n(MSE) of 0.49 and 0.61, and balanced accuracy of 57% and 51% for heart and lung\nqualities, respectively.

Due to this significant quantum contribution, we find\nthat the canonical and tautomeric forms of G-C inter-convert over timescales\nfar shorter than biological ones and hence thermal equilibrium is rapidly\nreached. Furthermore, we find a large tautomeric occupation probability of\n$1.73\\times 10^{-4}$, suggesting that such proton transfer may well play a far\nmore important role in DNA mutation than has hitherto been suggested.

In this paper, scenarios will be considered\nin which the radial emission of dark matter is brought into hydrostatic\nequilibrium with a uniform background.

Based on various attributes, three\nmodels have been trained and compared which are Decision tree C4.5, Random\nForest, and Neural Network. The three models provided very good accuracies\nbased on testing data, however, it is the Neural Network that outperformed the\nother two models. This work contributes to the early screening of toddlers by\nhelping identify those who have ASD traits and should pursue formal clinical\ndiagnosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 09:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

As such, there has been\nintense interest in this topic, especially in multi-user single-server and\nhomogeneous multi-server scenarios. However, the research in the heterogeneous\nmulti-server scenario is limited, where the servers are located at small\nbase-stations (SBSs), macro base-stations (MBSs), or the cloud with different\ncomputing and communication capabilities. On the other hand,\ncomputational-tasks offloading is limited by the type of MD-BS association with\nalmost all previous works focusing on offloading the MD's computational tasks\nto the MEC servers/cloudlets at its serving BS. However, in multi-BS\nassociation, or downlink/uplink decoupled (DUDe) scenarios, an MD can be served\nby multiple BSs and hence has multiple offloading choices.

Recently, the emergence of pre-trained models (PTM) has\nbrought this research field into a new era, in which the training objective\nplays a key role. The masked language model (MLM) is a self-supervised training\nobjective that widely used in various PTMs. With the development of training\nobjectives, many variants of MLM have been proposed, such as whole word\nmasking, entity masking, phrase masking, span masking, and so on. In different\nMLM, the length of the masked tokens is different. Similarly, in different\nmachine reading comprehension tasks, the length of the answer is also\ndifferent, and the answer is often a word, phrase, or sentence. Thus, in MRC\ntasks with different answer lengths, whether the length of MLM is related to\nperformance is a question worth studying. If this hypothesis is true, it can\nguide us how to pre-train the MLM model with a relatively suitable mask length\ndistribution for MRC task. In this paper, we try to uncover how much of MLM's\nsuccess in the machine reading comprehension tasks comes from the correlation\nbetween masking length distribution and answer length in MRC dataset. In order\nto address this issue, herein, (1) we propose four MRC tasks with different\nanswer length distributions, namely short span extraction task, long span\nextraction task, short multiple-choice cloze task, long multiple-choice cloze\ntask; (2) four Chinese MRC datasets are created for these tasks; (3) we also\nhave pre-trained four masked language models according to the answer length\ndistributions of these datasets; (4) ablation experiments are conducted on the\ndatasets to verify our hypothesis. The experimental results demonstrate that\nour hypothesis is true.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 04:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

In such a scheme, the focal intensity profile is critically\ndependent upon the relative phase of each fibre and so precise control over the\nphase of each fibre channel is essential. Determining the required phase\ncompensations from the focal intensity profile alone (as measured via a camera)\nis extremely challenging with a large number of fibres as the phase information\nis obfuscated. Whilst iterative methods exist for phase retrieval, in practice,\ndue to phase noise within a fibre laser amplification system, a single step\nprocess with computational time on the scale of milliseconds is needed. Here,\nwe show how a neural network can be used to identify the phases of each fibre\nfrom the focal intensity profile, in a single step of ~ 10 milliseconds, for a\nsimulated 3-ring hexagonal close packed arrangement, containing 19 separate\nfibres and subsequently how this enables bespoke beam shaping. In addition, we\nshow that deep learning can be used to determine whether a desired intensity\nprofile is physically possible within the simulation. This, coupled with the\ndemonstrated resilience against simulated experimental noise, indicates a\nstrong potential for the application of deep learning for coherent beam\ncombination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 19:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

Current works train deep learning models on low-level data\nrepresentations to solve the emotion recognition task. Since emotion datasets\noften have a limited amount of data, these approaches may suffer from\noverfitting, and they may learn based on superficial cues. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel cross-representation speech model, inspired by\ndisentanglement representation learning, to perform emotion recognition on\nwav2vec 2.0 speech features. We also train a CNN-based model to recognize\nemotions from text features extracted with Transformer-based models. We further\ncombine the speech-based and text-based results with a score fusion approach.\nOur method is evaluated on the IEMOCAP dataset in a 4-class classification\nproblem, and it surpasses current works on speech-only, text-only, and\nmultimodal emotion recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 07:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}
