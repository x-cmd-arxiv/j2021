In this paper, the discrete-time, finite-horizon case is\nconsidered, where the agents are also assumed to be homogeneous and\nindistinguishable. The latter means that the agents all have the same dynamics\nand objective functions and the observations are in terms of \"snap shots\" of\nall agents at different time instants, but what is not known is \"which agent\nmoved where\" for consecutive observations. This absence of linked optimal\ntrajectories makes the problem challenging. We first show that this problem is\nglobally identifiable. Then, for the case of noiseless observations, we show\nthat the true cost matrix, and hence the closed-loop system matrices, can be\nrecovered as the unique global optimal solution to a convex optimization\nproblem. Next, for the case of noisy observations, we formulate an estimator as\nthe unique global optimal solution to a modified convex optimization problem.\nMoreover, the statistical consistency of this estimator is shown. Finally, the\nperformance of the proposed method is demonstrated by a number of numerical\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 16:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 15:33:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 17:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

The typical approach is to\nincorporate physical domain knowledge as soft constraints on an empirical loss\nfunction and use existing machine learning methodologies to train the model. We\ndemonstrate that, while existing PINN methodologies can learn good models for\nrelatively trivial problems, they can easily fail to learn relevant physical\nphenomena for even slightly more complex problems. In particular, we analyze\nseveral distinct situations of widespread physical interest, including learning\ndifferential equations with convection, reaction, and diffusion operators. We\nprovide evidence that the soft regularization in PINNs, which involves\nPDE-based differential operators, can introduce a number of subtle problems,\nincluding making the problem more ill-conditioned. Importantly, we show that\nthese possible failure modes are not due to the lack of expressivity in the NN\narchitecture, but that the PINN's setup makes the loss landscape very hard to\noptimize. We then describe two promising solutions to address these failure\nmodes. The first approach is to use curriculum regularization, where the PINN's\nloss term starts from a simple PDE regularization, and becomes progressively\nmore complex as the NN gets trained. The second approach is to pose the problem\nas a sequence-to-sequence learning task, rather than learning to predict the\nentire space-time at once. Extensive testing shows that we can achieve up to\n1-2 orders of magnitude lower error with these methods as compared to regular\nPINN training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 16:06:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 18:47:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-12"}

However, recent studies have shown that noise can\nseverely limit the trainability of VQAs, e.g., by exponentially flattening the\ncost landscape and suppressing the magnitudes of cost gradients. Error\nMitigation (EM) shows promise in reducing the impact of noise on near-term\ndevices. Thus, it is natural to ask whether EM can improve the trainability of\nVQAs. In this work, we first show that, for a broad class of EM strategies,\nexponential cost concentration cannot be resolved without committing\nexponential resources elsewhere. This class of strategies includes as special\ncases Zero Noise Extrapolation, Virtual Distillation, Probabilistic Error\nCancellation, and Clifford Data Regression. Second, we perform analytical and\nnumerical analysis of these EM protocols, and we find that some of them (e.g.,\nVirtual Distillation) can make it harder to resolve cost function values\ncompared to running no EM at all. As a positive result, we do find numerical\nevidence that Clifford Data Regression (CDR) can aid the training process in\ncertain settings where cost concentration is not too severe. Our results show\nthat care should be taken in applying EM protocols as they can either worsen or\nnot improve trainability. On the other hand, our positive results for CDR\nhighlight the possibility of engineering error mitigation methods to improve\ntrainability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 16:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

That is, it\nconveys the potential ability to steer the state of another physical system\nwithout interacting with it by implementing independent measurements, this\nnonlocal phenomenon was named steering. On the other hand, the first proposals\nabout the nonlocality of a single photon focus on showing the Bell nonlocality\nby using a single photon path entanglement. This path entanglement of a single\nphoton was also used for analyzing and experimentally produce the steering of a\nsingle photon. However, these established facts have been recently called into\nquestion suggesting that single-photon entanglement is not non-local. In this\nletter, we show that by incorporating and manipulating the internal degrees of\nfreedom of the photon, together with the external path, it is easy to\ndemonstrate the nonlocal effect of steering of a single photon's state. In this\nsense, the experimental set-up that we propose differs from the one reported in\nthe quantum optics literature which only uses, to the best of our knowledge,\nthe path entanglement of photons for showing the steering phenomenon, i.e. here\nwe exploit the entanglement between the internal and external degrees of\nfreedom of the photon to show this nonlocal effect. The introduction of the\nphoton's internal degrees of freedom in the experimental set-up gives us new\ninsight, advantages and possibilities to control the nonlocal character of the\nsingle-photon entangled state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 16:19:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

In current experimental platforms control parameters such as\ninteraction range, temperature, density and dimension can be changed. The\nexistence of universal scaling regimes, where diverse physical systems and\nobservables display quantitative agreement, generates a common framework, where\nthe efforts of different research communities can be -- in some cases\nrigorously -- connected. Still, the application of this general framework to\nparticular experimental realisations requires the identification of the regimes\nwhere the universality phenomenon is expected to appear. In the present review\nwe summarise the recent investigations of many-body quantum systems with\nlong-range interactions, which are currently realised in Rydberg atom arrays,\ndipolar systems, trapped ion setups and cold atoms in cavity experiments. Our\nmain aim is to present and identify the common and (mostly) universal features\ninduced by long-range interactions in the behaviour of quantum many-body\nsystems. We will discuss both the case of very strong non-local couplings, i.e.\nthe non-additive regime, and the one in which energy is extensive, but\nnevertheless low-energy, long wavelength properties are altered with respect to\nthe short-range limit.

A filter pair can be seen as a presentation of a logic, given\nby presenting its lattice of theories as the image of a lattice homomorphism,\nwith certain properties ensuring that the resulting logic is finitary and\nsubstitution invariant. Every finitary, substitution invariant logic arises\nfrom a filter pair. Particular classes of logics can be characterized as\narising from special classes of filter pairs. We consider so-called congruence\nfilter pairs, i.e. filter pairs for which the domain of the lattice\nhomomorphism is a lattice of congruences for some quasivariety. We show that\nthe class of logics admitting a presentation by such a filter pair is exactly\nthe class of logics having an algebraic semantics. We study the properties of a\ncertain Galois connection coming with such filter pairs. We give criteria for a\ncongruence filter pair to present a logic in some classes of the Leibniz\nhierarchy by means of this Galois connection, and its interplay with the\nLeibniz operator.

A drawback of these techniques is the\nuse of hard depth layering, making them unable to model intricate appearance\ndetails such as thin hair-like structures. We present SLIDE, a modular and\nunified system for single image 3D photography that uses a simple yet effective\nsoft layering strategy to better preserve appearance details in novel views.

At the same time, SLIDE uses an efficient\nlayered depth formulation that only requires a single forward pass through the\ncomponent networks to produce high quality 3D photos. Extensive experimental\nanalysis on three view-synthesis datasets, in combination with user studies on\nin-the-wild image collections, demonstrate superior performance of our\ntechnique in comparison to existing strong baselines while being conceptually\nmuch simpler.

Still, these\nshort-pulse polarization transfers schemes are challenged by fast solvent\nchemical exchange. An alternative to improve these heteronuclear transfers is\nJ-driven cross polarization (J-CP), which transfers polarization by\nspin-locking the coupled spins under Hartmann-Hahn conditions. J-CP provides\ncertain immunity against chemical exchange and other T2-like relaxation\neffects, a behavior that is here examined in depth by both Liouville-space\nnumerical and analytical derivations describing the transfer efficiency. While\nsuperior to INEPT-based transfers, fast exchange may also slow down these J-CP\ntransfers, hurting their efficiency. This study therefore explores the\npotential of repeated projective operations to improve 1H->15N and 1H->15N->13C\nJ-CP transfers in the presence of fast solvent chemical exchanges. It is found\nthat while repeating J-CP provides little 1H->15N transfer advantages over a\nprolonged CP, multiple contacts that keep both the water and the labile protons\neffectively spin-locked can improve 1H->15N->13C transfers in the presence of\nchemical exchange. The ensuing Looped, Concatenated Cross Polarization (L-CCP)\ncompensates for single J-CP losses by relying on the 13C longer lifetimes,\nleading to a kind of algorithmic cooling that can provide high polarization for\nthe 15N as well as carbonyl and alpha 13Cs.

Surprisingly, IXPs and honeypots\nobserve mostly disjoint sets of attacks: 96% of IXP-inferred attacks were\ninvisible to a sizable honeypot platform. Second, we assess the effectiveness\nof observed DNS attacks by studying IXP traces jointly with diverse data from\nindependent measurement infrastructures. We find that attackers efficiently\ndetect new reflectors and purposefully rotate between them. At the same time,\nwe reveal that attackers are a small step away from bringing about\nsignificantly higher amplification factors (14x). Third, we identify and\nfingerprint a major attack entity by studying patterns in attack traces. We\nshow that this entity dominates the DNS amplification ecosystem by carrying out\n59% of the attacks, and provide an in-depth analysis of its behavior over time.\nFinally, our results reveal that operators of various .gov names do not adhere\nto DNSSEC key rollover best practices, which exacerbates amplification\npotential. We can verifiably connect this operational behavior to misuses and\nattacker decision-making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 17:27:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 12:58:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 08:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

Further\nreconstruction improvements for such inverse problems can be achieved by\nconditioning the generator on the measurement. The boundary equilibrium\ngenerative adversarial network (BEGAN) implements an equilibrium based loss\nfunction and an auto-encoding discriminator to better balance the performance\nof the generator and the discriminator. In this work we investigate a\nnetwork-based projected gradient descent (NPGD) algorithm for\nmeasurement-conditional generative models to solve the inverse problem much\nfaster than regular PGD. We combine the NPGD with conditional GAN/BEGAN to\nevaluate their effectiveness in solving compressed sensing type problems. Our\nexperiments on the MNIST and CelebA datasets show that the combination of\nmeasurement conditional model with NPGD works well in recovering the compressed\nsignal while achieving similar or in some cases even better performance along\nwith a much faster reconstruction. The achieved reconstruction speed-up in our\nexperiments is up to 140-175.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 17:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

Microbiome data generated from\nsequencing experiments contain the relative abundance of a large number of\nmicrobial taxa with their evolutionary relationships represented by a\nphylogenetic tree. The compositional and high-dimensional nature of the\nmicrobiome mediator invalidates standard mediation analyses. We propose a\nphylogeny-based mediation analysis method (PhyloMed) for the microbiome\nmediator. PhyloMed models the microbiome mediation effect through a cascade of\nindependent local mediation models on the internal nodes of the phylogenetic\ntree. Each local model captures the mediation effect of a subcomposition at a\ngiven taxonomic resolution. The method improves the power of the mediation test\nby enriching weak and sparse signals across mediating taxa that tend to cluster\non the tree. In each local model, we further empower PhyloMed by using a\nmixture distribution to obtain the subcomposition mediation test p-value, which\ntakes into account the composite nature of the null hypothesis. PhyloMed\nenables us to test the overall mediation effect of the entire microbial\ncommunity and pinpoint internal nodes with significant subcomposition mediation\neffects. Our extensive simulations demonstrate the validity of PhyloMed and its\nsubstantial power gain over existing methods. An application to a real study\nfurther showcases the advantages of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 17:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

This has\nbeen extensively explored in several Half-Heusler (HH) compounds hosting the\nexotic TI behaviour. In the present work we employ, first-principles based\nDensity Functional Theory to perform thorough investigations of pressure\ninduced topological phase transition (TPT) in HH AgSrBi which belongs to the\nF-43m space group. AgSrBi is intrinsically semi-metallic in nature which, under\nisotropic pressure exhibits semi-metal to trivial insulator transition\nretaining the cubic symmetry whereas, on breaking the cubic symmetry we observe\nthe much sought after non-trivial semi-metal to TI phase transition. We also\nexplore the effect of lowering crystal symmetry in realizing TI nature.\nFollowing this we perform qualitative analysis of the electronic properties to\nunderstand the origin of this non-trivial behavior followed by the quantitative\nanalysis of the Z$_2$ classification which indicates that AgSrBi is a strong TI\n(i.e., Z$_2$ = (1, 101)). We thus, propose AgSrBi as a dynamically stable TI\nwhich can be used as ultra-thin films thermoelectric and nanoelectronic\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 17:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

However, these studies have\nbeen conducted on Java and C, while empirical studies for other languages are\nmissing. For example, a controlled user study with crypto tasks in Python has\nshown that 68.5 % of the professional developers write a secure solution for a\ncrypto task. Aims: To understand if this observation holds for real-world code,\nwe conducted a study of crypto misuses in Python. Method: We developed a static\nanalysis tool that covers common misuses of 5 different Python crypto APIs.\nWith this analysis, we analyzed 895 popular Python projects from GitHub and 51\nMicroPython projects for embedded devices. Further, we compared our results\nwith the findings of previous studies. Results: Our analysis reveals that 52.26\n% of the Python projects have at least one misuse. Further, some Python crypto\nlibraries API design helps developers from misusing crypto functions, which\nwere much more common in studies conducted with Java and C code. Conclusion: We\nconclude that we can see a positive impact of the good API design on crypto\nmisuses for Python applications. Further, our analysis of MicroPython projects\nreveals the importance of hybrid analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 17:32:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

To shed light on such structure, we begin investigating\nthe relation with parent 4d $\\mathcal N=1$ theories obtained by geometric\nengineering M-theory on $\\mathcal X$. The main point of this paper is to\nsubstantiate the following dream: the holomorphic sector of such theories on\nmulti-centered Taub-NUT spaces gives rise to an algebra whose characters\norganise the $G_2$ instanton partition function. As a first step towards this\nprogram, we argue by string duality that a multitude of geometries $\\mathcal X$\nexist that are dual to well-known 4d SCFTs arising from D3 branes probes of CY\ncones: all these models are amenable to analysis along the lines suggested by\nDijkgraaf, Gukov, Neitzke and Vafa in the context of topological M-theory.\nMoreover, we discuss an interesting relation to Costello's twisted M-theory,\nwhich arises at local patches, and is a key ingredient in identifying the\nrelevant algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 17:34:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 17:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

In order to accomplish this,\nhumans need easy and effective ways of specifying tasks to the robot. Goal\nimages are one popular form of task specification, as they are already grounded\nin the robot's observation space. However, goal images also have a number of\ndrawbacks: they are inconvenient for humans to provide, they can over-specify\nthe desired behavior leading to a sparse reward signal, or under-specify task\ninformation in the case of non-goal reaching tasks. Natural language provides a\nconvenient and flexible alternative for task specification, but comes with the\nchallenge of grounding language in the robot's observation space. To scalably\nlearn this grounding we propose to leverage offline robot datasets (including\nhighly sub-optimal, autonomously collected data) with crowd-sourced natural\nlanguage labels. With this data, we learn a simple classifier which predicts if\na change in state completes a language instruction. This provides a\nlanguage-conditioned reward function that can then be used for offline\nmulti-task RL. In our experiments, we find that on language-conditioned\nmanipulation tasks our approach outperforms both goal-image specifications and\nlanguage conditioned imitation techniques by more than 25%, and is able to\nperform visuomotor tasks from natural language, such as \"open the right drawer\"\nand \"move the stapler\", on a Franka Emika Panda robot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 17:42:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 20:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

Traditionally, activity data have been gathered using patient\nself-report. However, these subjective data can suffer from bias and are\ndifficult to collect over long time periods. Smartphones offer an opportunity\nto address these challenges. The smartphone has built-in sensors that can be\nprogrammed to collect data objectively, unobtrusively, and continuously. Due to\ntheir widespread adoption, smartphones are also accessible to most of the\npopulation. A main challenge in smartphone-based activity recognition is\nextracting information optimally from multiple sensors to identify the unique\nfeatures of different activities. In our study, we analyze data collected by\nthe accelerometer and gyroscope, which measure the phone's acceleration and\nangular velocity, respectively. We propose an extension to the \"movelet method\"\nthat jointly incorporates both sensors. We also apply this joint-sensor method\nto a data set we collected previously. The findings show that combining data\nfrom the two sensors can result in more accurate activity recognition than\nusing each sensor alone. For example, the joint-sensor method reduces errors of\nthe gyroscope-only method in differentiating between standing and sitting.

Lens modelling using point source positions\nrules out a single source model, favouring an isothermal lens mass profile with\ntwo quasar sources separated by $\\sim6.0$ kpc (0.73$^{\\prime \\prime}$) in\nprojection. Given the resolving ability from lensing and current lensed quasar\nstatistics, this discovery suggests a large population of undiscovered,\nunlensed sub-10-kpc binaries. We also analyse spectra of two images of the\nquad, showing narrow Ly$\\alpha$ emission within the trough of a proximate\ndamped Ly$\\alpha$ absorber (PDLA). An apparent mismatch between the continuum\nand narrow line flux ratios provides a new potential tool for simultaneously\nstudying microlensing and the quasar host galaxy. Signs of the PDLA are also\nseen in the second source, however a deeper spectrum is still required to\nconfirm this. Thanks to the multiple lines-of-sight from lensing and two quasar\nsources, this system offers simultaneous sub-parsec and kpc-scale probes of a\nPDLA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

The key\nassumption of this formalism is that star formation proceeds from cold gas, at\na rate that is limited by an internal consumption timescale at early times, or\nby the rate of generation of gas via cooling at late times. These processes are\nanalysed as a function of the mass of dark matter haloes and integrated over\nthe halo population. We modify this approach in two main ways to make it more\ngeneral: (1) halo collapse times are included explicitly, so that the behaviour\nis physically reasonable at late times; (2) allowance is made for a\nmass-dependent baryon fraction in haloes, which incorporates feedback effects.\nThis model reproduces the main features of the observed baryonic Tully-Fisher\nrelationship, and is consistent with observational estimates of the baryon mass\nfraction in the intergalactic medium. With minimal adjustment of parameters,\nour approach reproduces the observed history of cosmic star formation within a\nfactor of two over the redshift range $0 < z < 10$. This level of agreement is\ncomparable to that achieved by state-of-the-art cosmological simulations.

This approach can produce results\nthat are plausible qualitatively but inaccurate quantatively. This approach\nalso causes numerical instabilities and locking in coarse discretizations or\notherwise poses a prohibitive restriction on the size of the time step. We\npropose a novel approach to alleviate these issues by replacing indirect volume\npreservation using Poisson's ratios with direct enforcement of zonal volume\nconstraints, while controlling fine-scale volumetric deformation through a\ncell-wise compression penalty. To increase realism, we propose an epidermis\nmodel to mimic the dramatically higher surface stiffness on real skinned\nbodies.

Due to the\nvolume preservation not being tied to mesh discretization, our method also\nallows a resolution consistent simulation of incompressible materials.

However,\nsymmetric shapes lead to pose ambiguity when using sparse sensor data such as\nLiDAR point clouds and suffer from the quantization uncertainty of the LiDAR.\nThis paper introduces the concept of optimizing target shape to remove pose\nambiguity for LiDAR point clouds. A target is designed to induce large\ngradients at edge points under rotation and translation relative to the LiDAR\nto ameliorate the quantization uncertainty associated with point cloud\nsparseness. Moreover, given a target shape, we present a means that leverages\nthe target's geometry to estimate the target's vertices while globally\nestimating the pose.

We quantitatively describe this\nphenomenon by a rate-equation model that takes into account the O background\npressure, the resulting formation of the suboxides via oxidation of the metal\nsource, and their subsequent thermally activated evaporation. As a result, the\ntotal flux composed of the metal and the suboxide fluxes exhibit an\n\\textsf{S}-shape temperature dependence instead of the expected linear one in\nan Arrhenius plot, in excellent agreement with the available experimental data.\nOur model reveals that the thermally activated regimes at low and high\ntemperatures are almost exclusively due to suboxide and metal evaporation,\nrespectively, joined by an intermediate plateau-like regime in which the flux\nis limited by the available amount of O.

Each\nnode in a synchronous system starts with a binary input. The goal is to reach\nagreement in the presence of Byzantine faulty nodes. We consider the setting\nwhere communication between nodes is modelled via a directed hypergraph. In the\nclassical point-to-point communication model, the communication between nodes\nis modelled as a simple graph where all messages sent on an edge are private\nbetween the two endpoints of the edge. This allows a faulty node to equivocate,\ni.e., lie differently to its different neighbors. Different models have been\nproposed in the literature that weaken equivocation. In the local broadcast\nmodel, every message transmitted by a node is received identically and\ncorrectly by all of its neighbors. In the hypergraph model, every message\ntransmitted by a node on a hyperedge is received identically and correctly by\nall nodes on the hyperedge. Tight network conditions are known for each of the\nthree cases for undirected (hyper)graphs. For the directed models, tight\nconditions are known for the point-to-point and local broadcast models.\n  In this work, we consider the directed hypergraph model that encompasses all\nthe models above. Each directed hyperedge consists of a single head (sender)\nand at least one tail (receiver), This models a local multicast channel where\nmessages transmitted by the sender are received identically by all the\nreceivers in the hyperedge. For this model, we identify tight network\nconditions for consensus. We observe how the directed hypergraph model reduces\nto each of the three models above under specific conditions. In each case, we\nrelate our network condition to the corresponding known tight conditions. The\ndirected hypergraph model also encompasses other practical network models of\ninterest that have not been explored previously, as elaborated in the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 20:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

We\nconsider the effect of particle size, particle concentration, and the\norientation of the plume buoyancy flux - either in the same or opposite\ndirection to the particle buoyancy flux. When the plume buoyancy flux is in the\nopposite direction to the particle buoyancy flux, entrainment into the plume\nincreases by up to 40%. The rate of entrainment increases linearly with the\nratio of particle buoyancy flux to fluid buoyancy flux but does not depend on\nthe particle size. In contrast, when the plume buoyancy flux is in the same\ndirection as the particle buoyancy flux, entrainment into the plume is\nunaffected by the addition of particles. The observed increase in entrainment,\nwhen the plume and particle buoyancy fluxes are in opposite directions, is\nconsistent with inertial clustering whereby particles are ejected from regions\nof relatively high vorticity and accumulate in regions of relatively high\nstrain rate within the turbulent flow field. Regions with high particle\nconcentration can then experience convective instabilities that affect the\nentrainment of ambient fluid into the plume. The differing behaviour observed\nbased on the plume buoyancy flux orientation is also consistent with the above\nmechanism.

State estimation for locomotion over dynamic rigid surfaces\n(DRS), such as elevators, ships, public transport vehicles, and aircraft,\nremains under-explored, although state estimator designs for stationary rigid\nsurfaces have been extensively studied. Addressing DRS locomotion in state\nestimation is a challenging problem mainly due to the nonlinear, hybrid nature\nof walking dynamics, the nonstationary surface-foot contact points, and\nhardware imperfections (e.g., limited availability, noise, and drift of onboard\nsensors). Towards solving this problem, we introduce an Invariant Extended\nKalman Filter (InEKF) whose process and measurement models explicitly consider\nthe DRS movement and hybrid walking behaviors while respectively satisfying the\ngroup-affine condition and invariant form. Due to these attractive properties,\nthe estimation error convergence of the filter is provably guaranteed for\nhybrid DRS locomotion. The measurement model of the filter also exploits the\nholonomic constraint associated with the support-foot and surface orientations,\nunder which the robot's yaw angle in the world becomes observable in the\npresence of general DRS movement.

When training data is not available in one region,\nclassifiers trained in similar regions can be transferred, but shifts in the\ndistribution of crop types as well as transformations of the features between\nregions lead to reduced classification accuracy. We present a methodology that\nuses aggregate-level crop statistics to correct the classifier by accounting\nfor these two types of shifts. To adjust for shifts in the crop type\ncomposition we present a scheme for properly reweighting the posterior\nprobabilities of each class that are output by the classifier. To adjust for\nshifts in features we propose a method to estimate and remove linear shifts in\nthe mean feature vector.

A promising category\nof accelerators utilizes nonvolatile memory arrays to both store weights and\nperform $\\textit{in situ}$ analog computation inside the array.

This work shows how architectural design\ndecisions, particularly in mapping neural network parameters to analog memory\ncells, influence inference accuracy. When evaluated using ResNet50 on ImageNet,\nthe resilience of the system to analog non-idealities - cell programming\nerrors, analog-to-digital converter resolution, and array parasitic resistances\n- all improve when analog quantities in the hardware are made proportional to\nthe weights in the network. Moreover, contrary to the assumptions of prior\nwork, nearly equivalent resilience to cell imprecision can be achieved by fully\nstoring weights as analog quantities, rather than spreading weight bits across\nmultiple devices, often referred to as bit slicing. By exploiting\nproportionality, analog system designers have the freedom to match the\nprecision of the hardware to the needs of the algorithm, rather than attempting\nto guarantee the same level of precision in the intermediate results as an\nequivalent digital accelerator.

In\nthis method, based on the strong form equation, the divergence of the flux on\neach vertex is computed directly from fluxes nearby by means of high order\nleast-square. In order to capture discontinuities, numerical flux of high order\naccuracy is calculated on each edge and serves as supporting data of the\nleast-square computation of the divergence. The high accuracy of the numerical\nflux depends on the high order WENO interpolation on each edge. To reduce the\ncomputing cost and complexity, a curvlinear stencil is assembled for each edge\nso that the economical one-dimensional WENO interpolation can be applied. With\nthe derivatives introduced, two-dimensional Hermite interpolation on a\ncurvilinear stencil is applied to keep the stencil compact and avoids using\nmany supporting points. In smooth region, the Hermite least-square 2D\ninterpolation of 5 nodes is adopted directly to achieve the fifth order\naccuracy. Near a discontinuity, three values obtained by means of least-square\n2D interpolation of 3 nodes, are weighted to obtain one value of the second\norder accuracy. After obtaining the flow states on both sides of the middle\npoint of an edge, numerical flux of high order accuracy along the edge can be\ncalculated. For inviscid flux, analytical flux on vertices and numerical flux\nalong edges are used to compute the divergence. While for viscous flux, only\nanalytical viscous flux on vertices are used. The divergence of the fluxes and\ntheir derivatives on each vertex are used to update the conservative variables\nand their derivatives with an explicit Runger-Kutta time scheme. Several\ncanonical numerical cases were solved to test the accuracy and the capability\nof shock capturing of this method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 02:58:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 12:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

In this context,\nenergy-efficiency becomes a critical challenge to be solved for harnessing\nthese promising applications to realize 'green' 6G networks. As a remedy,\nreconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have been proposed for improving the\nenergy efficiency by beneficially reconfiguring the wireless propagation\nenvironment. In conventional RIS solutions, however, the received\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) sometimes may even become\ndegraded. This is because the signals impinging upon an RIS are typically\ncontaminated by interfering signals which are usually dynamic and unknown. To\naddress this issue, `learning' the properties of the surrounding spectral\nenvironment is a promising solution, motivating the convergence of artificial\nintelligence and spectrum sensing, termed here as spectrum learning (SL).\nInspired by this, we develop an SL-aided RIS framework for intelligently\nexploiting the inherent characteristics of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum\nfor green 6G networks. Given the proposed framework, the RIS controller becomes\ncapable of intelligently `{think-and-decide}' whether to reflect or not the\nincident signals. Therefore, the received SINR can be improved by dynamically\nconfiguring the binary ON-OFF status of the RIS elements. The energy-efficiency\nbenefits attained are validated with the aid of a specific case study. Finally,\nwe conclude with a list of promising future research directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 03:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

Therefore, it is inevitable to bring a cross-modal bias between\nsemantic-guided samples and nonsemantic-guided samples, which results in an\ninformation asymmetry problem. To address this problem, we propose a\nModal-Alternating Propagation Network (MAP-Net) to supplement the absent\nsemantic information of unlabeled samples, which builds information symmetry\namong all samples in both visual and semantic modalities.

However,\nheavily relying on the normal images may cause the model training to overfit\nthe normal class. Self-supervised pre-training is an effective solution to this\nproblem.

In\nthis paper, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training method for UAD\ndesigned for MIA applications, named Multi-class Strong Augmentation via\nContrastive Learning (MSACL). MSACL is based on a novel optimisation to\ncontrast normal and multiple classes of synthetised abnormal images, with each\nclass enforced to form a tight and dense cluster in terms of Euclidean distance\nand cosine similarity, where abnormal images are formed by simulating a varying\nnumber of lesions of different sizes and appearance in the normal images. In\nthe experiments, we show that our MSACL pre-training improves the accuracy of\nSOTA UAD methods on many MIA benchmarks using colonoscopy, fundus screening and\nCovid-19 Chest X-ray datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 04:25:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 04:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-25"}

In this\nwork, we explore DUNE's sensitivity to observe charge-parity violation (CPV) in\nthe neutrino sector, and to resolve the mass ordering, for exposures of up to\n100 kiloton-megawatt-years (kt-MW-yr). The analysis includes detailed\nuncertainties on the flux prediction, the neutrino interaction model, and\ndetector effects. We demonstrate that DUNE will be able to unambiguously\nresolve the neutrino mass ordering at a 3$\\sigma$ (5$\\sigma$) level, with a 66\n(100) kt-MW-yr far detector exposure, and has the ability to make strong\nstatements at significantly shorter exposures depending on the true value of\nother oscillation parameters. We also show that DUNE has the potential to make\na robust measurement of CPV at a 3$\\sigma$ level with a 100 kt-MW-yr exposure\nfor the maximally CP-violating values $\\delta_{\\rm CP}} = \\pm\\pi/2$.\nAdditionally, the dependence of DUNE's sensitivity on the exposure taken in\nneutrino-enhanced and antineutrino-enhanced running is discussed. An equal\nfraction of exposure taken in each beam mode is found to be close to optimal\nwhen considered over the entire space of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 04:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

Given a data set with known class labels, J-score quantifies how\nwell the hypothetical clusters produced by clustering analysis recover the true\nclasses. It starts with bidirectional set matching to identify the\ncorrespondence between true classes and hypothetical clusters based on Jaccard\nindex. It then computes two weighted sums of Jaccard indices measuring the\nreconciliation from classes to clusters and vice versa. The final J-score is\nthe harmonic mean of the two weighted sums.\n  Results. Via simulation studies, we evaluated the performance of J-score and\ncompared with existing measures. Our results show that J-score is effective in\ndistinguishing partition structures that differ only by unmatched clusters,\nrewarding correct inference of class numbers, addressing biases towards\nexcessive clusters, and having a relatively stable baseline. The simplicity of\nits calculation makes the interpretation straightforward. It is a valuable tool\ncomplementary to other accuracy measures. We released an R/jScore package\nimplementing the algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 04:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

Under\nperiodic boundary conditions (PBC), the energy spectrum describes rather\ngenerally closed loops in complex plane, characterized by integer nonzero\nwinding numbers. Such nontrivial winding provides the topological signature of\nthe non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), i.e. the macroscopic condensation of bulk\nstates at the lattice edges under open boundary conditions (OBC). In spite of\nthe great relevance of band winding in the non-Hermitian topological band\ntheory and the related NHSE, most of current results rely on tight-binding\nmodels of non-Hermitian systems, while exact Bloch wave function analysis of\nthe NHSE and related topological band theory is still lacking. While\ntight-binding models can correctly describe narrow-band electronic states with\na relatively weak degree non-Hermiticity, they are not suited to describe\nhigh-energy wide-band electronic states and/or regimes corresponding to strong\nnon-Hermiticity. Here we consider the single-particle continuous Schr\\\"odinger\nequation in a periodic potential, in which non-Hermiticity is introduced by an\nimaginary vector potential in the equation, and show that the NHSE is\nubiquitous under OBC and characterized by a non-vanishing integer winding\nnumber, even thought the energy spectrum under PBC always comprises an open\ncurve, corresponding to high-energy electronic states. We also show that the\ninterior of the PBC energy spectrum corresponds to the complex eigenenergies\nsustaining localized (edge) states under semi-infinite boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 06:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

While\nthe increasing availability of HPC resources is in many cases pivotal to\nsuccessful science, even the largest collaborations lack the computational\nexpertise required for maximal exploitation of current hardware capabilities.\nThe need to maintain multiple platform-specific codebases further complicates\nmatters, potentially adding constraints on machines that can be utilized.\nFortunately, numerous programming models are under development that aim to\nfacilitate portable codes for heterogeneous computing. One in particular is\nSYCL, an open standard, C++-based single-source programming paradigm.

However, the personas\nused in current studies are pre-defined and hard to obtain before a\nconversation. To tackle this issue, we study a new task, named Speaker Persona\nDetection (SPD), which aims to detect speaker personas based on the plain\nconversational text. In this task, a best-matched persona is searched out from\ncandidates given the conversational text. This is a many-to-many semantic\nmatching task because both contexts and personas in SPD are composed of\nmultiple sentences. The long-term dependency and the dynamic redundancy among\nthese sentences increase the difficulty of this task. We build a dataset for\nSPD, dubbed as Persona Match on Persona-Chat (PMPC). Furthermore, we evaluate\nseveral baseline models and propose utterance-to-profile (U2P) matching\nnetworks for this task. The U2P models operate at a fine granularity which\ntreat both contexts and personas as sets of multiple sequences. Then, each\nsequence pair is scored and an interpretable overall score is obtained for a\ncontext-persona pair through aggregation. Evaluation results show that the U2P\nmodels outperform their baseline counterparts significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 06:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

In the molecular scheme, the $X(3872)$\nis interpreted as the bound state of $\\bar{D}^{*0}D^0/\\bar{D}^0D^{*0}$ and\n$D^{*-}D^+/D^-D^{*+}$ channels. In a cutoff-independent formalism, we relate\nthe coupling constants of $X(3872)$ with the two channels to the molecular wave\nfunction. The isospin violating decays of $X(3872)$ are obtained by two\nequivalent approaches, which amend some deficiencies about this issue in\nliterature. In the quantum field theory approach, the isospin violating decays\narise from the coupling constants of $X(3872)$ to two di-meson channels. In the\nquantum mechanics approach, the isospin violating is attributed to wave\nfunctions at the origin. We illustrate that how to cure the insufficient\nresults in literature. Within the comprehensive analysis, we bridge the isospin\nviolating decays of $X(3872)$ to its inner structure.

In our proposed COS, we study the\nnon-reciprocal transport of optical signals across two ports via three optical\nmodes optomechanically coupled to the mechanical excitations of two\nnano-mechanical resonators (NMRs) under the influence of strong classical drive\nfields and weak probe fields.

Information\ntransmission and communication between individual entities in the cohesive\ncollective lead to long-range order, vortical structures, and disorder to\nordered phase transitions. We ask the following questions: what makes a leader?\nWhat is the role of followers in leader cell formation? We used a\nparticle-based model to simulate epithelial cell migrations on substrates of\n9.4 kPa, 21 kPa and 33 kPa stiffness. The dynamics of cellular motion in the\nensemble are governed by orientational Vicsek and inter-cellular interactions\nbetween neighboring particles.

We show that border forces\nare essential in the leader cell formation and the overall areal expansions of\nepithelial monolayers on substrates. Radial velocities and areal expansions of\nthe monolayer agree with experiments reported for epithelial cells on\nsubstrates of varied stiffness. Ordering in follower cells within a specific\nregion of the monolayer was apparent on substrates of higher stiffness and\noccurred prior to the emergence of leader cells. We demonstrate that regions of\nincreased cell density occur behind the leader cell edge on all three\nsubstrates.

As a direct\nextension of the authors' recent work [Gamarnik, Jagannath, Wein 2020], we\nestablish that any poly-size $n$-output circuit that produces a spin assignment\nwith objective value within a certain constant factor of optimality, must have\ndepth at least $\\log n/(2\\log\\log n)$ as $n$ grows. This is stronger than the\nknown state of the art bounds of the form $\\Omega(\\log n/(k(n)\\log\\log n))$ for\nsimilar combinatorial optimization problems, where $k(n)$ depends on the\noptimality value. For example, for the largest clique problem $k(n)$\ncorresponds to the square of the size of the clique [Rossman 2010]. At the same\ntime our results are not quite comparable since in our case the circuits are\nrequired to produce a solution itself rather than solving the associated\ndecision problem. As in our earlier work, the approach is based on the overlap\ngap property (OGP) exhibited by random $p$-spin models, but the derivation of\nthe circuit lower bound relies further on standard facts from Fourier analysis\non the Boolean cube, in particular the Linial-Mansour-Nisan Theorem.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance when methods from\nspin glass theory have ramifications for circuit complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 06:59:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 19:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

One way to achieve this level of assurance is using formal\nverification, which provides proofs of system compliance with desired cyber\nsecurity properties. The use of Formal Methods (FM) in aspects of cyber\nsecurity and safety-critical systems are reviewed in this article. We split FM\ninto the three main classes: theorem proving, model checking and lightweight\nFM. To allow the different uses of FM to be compared, we define a common set of\nterms.

The comparisons are\nperformed in both simulation and real-world environments to systematically\nevaluate both methods from the aspect of tracking accuracy, robustness, and\ncomputational efficiency.

The accuracy and robustness of the resulting segment region boundaries\nare enhanced by combining information from multiple simultaneously-evaluated\nclustering operations. The stacking of object segmentation evaluations is\nperformed using image mask combination operations. This statistically-combined\nensemble (SCE) of different cluster masks allows us to construct cluster\nreliability metrics for each pixel and for the associated segments without any\nprior user input. By comparing the similarity of different cluster occurrences\nin the ensemble, we can also assess the optimal number of clusters needed to\ndescribe the data. Furthermore, by relying on ensemble-averaged spatial segment\nregion boundaries, the SCE method enables reconstruction of more accurate and\nrobust region of interest (ROI) boundaries for the different image data\nclusters. We apply the SCE algorithm to 2-dimensional simulation data snapshots\nof magnetically-dominated fully-kinetic turbulent plasma flows where accurate\nROI boundaries are needed for geometrical measurements of intermittent flow\nstructures known as current sheets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 08:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

Traditional methods to acquire\nhand-eye coordination skills are typically conducted through one-to-one\ninstruction where trainees must wear protective helmets and conduct several\ntests. This approach is inefficient as the harmful light emitted from the\nelectric arc impedes the close monitoring of the process; Practitioners can\nonly observe a small bright spot. To tackle these problems, recent training\napproaches have leveraged virtual reality to safely simulate the process and\nvisualize the geometry of the workpieces. However, the synthetic nature of\nthese types of simulation platforms reduces their effectiveness as they fail to\ncomprise actual welding interactions with the environment, which hinders the\ntrainees' learning process. To provide users with a real welding experience, we\nhave developed a new multi-sensor extended reality platform for arc welding\ntraining. Our system is composed of: (1) An HDR camera, monitoring the real\nwelding spot in real-time; (2) A depth sensor, capturing the 3D geometry of the\nscene; and (3) A head-mounted VR display, visualizing the process safely. Our\ninnovative platform provides users with a \"bot trainer\", virtual cues of the\nseam geometry, automatic spot tracking, and performance scores. To validate the\nplatform's feasibility, we conduct extensive experiments with several welding\ntraining tasks. We show that compared with the traditional training practice\nand recent virtual reality approaches, our automated multi-sensor method\nachieves better performances in terms of accuracy, learning curve, and\neffectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 08:56:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 11:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 08:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

In CX-ToM, we instead use\ncounterfactual explanations called fault-lines which we define as follows:\ngiven an input image I for which a CNN classification model M predicts class\nc_pred, a fault-line identifies the minimal semantic-level features (e.g.,\nstripes on zebra, pointed ears of dog), referred to as explainable concepts,\nthat need to be added to or deleted from I in order to alter the classification\ncategory of I by M to another specified class c_alt. We argue that, due to the\niterative, conceptual and counterfactual nature of CX-ToM explanations, our\nframework is practical and more natural for both expert and non-expert users to\nunderstand the internal workings of complex deep learning models. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative experiments verify our hypotheses, demonstrating\nthat our CX-ToM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art explainable AI\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 09:46:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 07:00:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 22:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

Predictive process analytics is a newly emerged\ndiscipline dedicated to providing business process intelligence in modern\norganisations. It uses event logs, which capture process execution traces in\nthe form of multi-dimensional sequence data, as the key input to train\npredictive models. These predictive models, often built upon deep learning\ntechniques, can be used to make predictions about the future states of business\nprocess execution. We apply attention mechanism to achieve model\ninterpretability. We propose i) two types of attentions: event attention to\ncapture the impact of specific process events on a prediction, and attribute\nattention to reveal which attribute(s) of an event influenced the prediction;\nand ii) two attention mechanisms: shared attention mechanism and specialised\nattention mechanism to reflect different design decisions in when to construct\nattribute attention on individual input features (specialised) or using the\nconcatenated feature tensor of all input feature vectors (shared). These lead\nto two distinct attention-based models, and both are interpretable models that\nincorporate interpretability directly into the structure of a process\npredictive model.

Inclusion-like features\nare the most common. Visible spectrophotometry was obtained for 46 of the 77\nlocations from MapCam images.

Generally, implicit/semi-implicit schemes are\npreferred over explicit ones to improve stability and correctness. However,\nexisting semi-implicit methods are usually iterative and employ a\ngeneral-purpose solver, which may be sub-optimal for a specific class of PDEs.\nIn this paper, we propose a neural solver to learn an optimal iterative scheme\nin a data-driven fashion for any class of PDEs. Specifically, we modify a\nsingle iteration of a semi-implicit solver using a deep neural network. We\nprovide theoretical guarantees for the correctness and convergence of neural\nsolvers analogous to conventional iterative solvers. In addition to the\ncommonly used Dirichlet boundary condition, we adopt a diffuse domain approach\nto incorporate a diverse type of boundary conditions, e.g., Neumann. We show\nthat the proposed neural solver can go beyond linear PDEs and applies to a\nclass of non-linear PDEs, where the non-linear component is non-stiff. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our method on 2D and 3D scenarios. To this end, we\nshow how our model generalizes to parameter settings, which are different from\ntraining; and achieves faster convergence than semi-implicit schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 12:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

We use optimal control theory to determine the maximum achievable\ngate speed for two-qubit gates in the qubit subspace of the many-level Hilbert\nspace, and we analyze the effect of the additional quantum states on the gate\nspeed. We identify two competing mechanisms. On one hand, higher energy levels\nare generally more strongly coupled to each other. Under suitable conditions,\nthis stronger coupling can be utilized to make two-qubit gates significantly\nfaster than the reference value based on simple qubits. On the other hand, a\nweak anharmonicity constrains the speed at which the system can be adequately\ncontrolled: according to the intuitive picture, faster operations require\nstronger control fields, which are more likely to excite higher levels in a\nweakly anharmonic system, which in turn leads to faster decoherence and\nuncontrolled leakage outside the qubit space.

We establish a connection with extreme\nvalue distributions and show that transition between states is mediated by a\nregime that is self-similar with the Reynolds number. The super-exponential\nvariation of the passage times is linked to the Reynolds-number dependence of\nthe parameters of the extreme value distribution.

The\norbital evolution of SMBHs is affected by dynamical friction that cannot be\npredicted self-consistently by contemporary simulations of galaxy formation in\nrepresentative volumes. Instead, such simulations typically use a simple\n\"repositioning\" of SMBHs, but the effects of this approach on SMBH and galaxy\nproperties have not yet been investigated systematically. Based on a suite of\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations with the SWIFT code and a\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton subgrid gas accretion model, we investigate the impact of\nrepositioning on SMBH growth and on other baryonic components through AGN\nfeedback. Across at least a factor ~1000 in mass resolution, SMBH repositioning\n(or an equivalent approach) is a necessary prerequisite for AGN feedback;\nwithout it, black hole growth is negligible. Limiting the effective\nrepositioning speed to $\\lesssim$ 10 km/s delays the onset of AGN feedback and\nseverely limits its impact on stellar mass growth in the centre of massive\ngalaxies. Repositioning has three direct physical consequences. It promotes\nSMBH mergers and thus accelerates their initial growth. In addition, it raises\nthe peak density of the ambient gas and reduces the SMBH velocity relative to\nit, giving a combined boost to the accretion rate that can reach many orders of\nmagnitude. Our results suggest that a more sophisticated and/or better\ncalibrated treatment of SMBH repositioning is a critical step towards more\npredictive galaxy formation simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 13:06:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 08:36:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 12:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

To this end,\nwe conduct axially symmetric numerical relativity simulations with multi-energy\nneutrino transport, using a hadron-quark hybrid equation of state (EOS). We\nconsider four non-rotating progenitor models, whose masses range from $9.6$ to\n$70$ M$_\\odot$. We find that the two less massive progenitor stars (9.6 and\n11.2 M$_\\odot$) show a successful explosion, which is driven by the neutrino\nheating. They do not undergo the QCD phase transition and leave behind a\nneutron star (NS). As for the more massive progenitor stars (50 and 70\nM$_\\odot$), the proto-neutron star (PNS) core enters the phase transition\nregion and experiences the second collapse. Because of a sudden stiffening of\nthe EOS entering to the pure quark matter regime, a strong shock wave is formed\nand blows off the PNS envelope in the 50 M$_\\odot$ model. Consequently, the\nremnant becomes a quark core surrounded by hadronic matters, leading to the\nformation of the hybrid star. However for the 70 M$_\\odot$ model, the shock\nwave cannot overcome the continuous mass accretion and it readily becomes a\nblack hole. We find that the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from\nsupernova explosions driven by the hadron-quark phase transition are detectable\nfor the present generation of neutrino and GW detectors. Furthermore, the\nanalysis of the GW detector response reveals unique kHz signatures, which will\nallow us to distinguish this class of supernova explosions from failed and\nneutrino-driven explosions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 13:31:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 13:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Numerous works study the cosmology of symmetric teleparallel\ngravity assuming a flat Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric, while\nworking in the so-called \"coincident gauge\", further assuming that the\nconnection coefficients vanish. However, little attention has been paid to the\nfact that both of these assumptions rely on the freedom to choose a particular\ncoordinate system in order to simplify the metric or the connection, and that\nthey may, in general, not be achieved simultaneously. Here we construct the\nmost general symmetric teleparallel geometry obeying the conditions of\nhomogeneity and isotropy, without making any assumptions on the properties of\nthe coordinates, and present our results in both the usual cosmological\ncoordinates and in the coincident gauge. We find that in general these\ncoordinates do not agree, and that assuming both to hold simultaneously allows\nonly for a very restricted class of geometries. For the general case, we derive\nthe energy-momentum-hypermomentum conservation relations and the cosmological\ndynamics of selected symmetric teleparallel gravity theories. Our results show\nthat the symmetric teleparallel connection in general contributes another\nscalar quantity into the cosmological dynamics, which decouples only for a\nspecific class of theories from the dynamics of the metric, and only if the\nmost simple geometry is chosen, in which both assumed coordinate systems agree.\nMost notably, the $f(Q)$ class of theories falls into this class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 17:10:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 19:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

Both of these operations are\nrestrictive and have previously been shown to be sub-optimal. To address this\nissue, a novel pooling scheme, named\\emph{ ordinal pooling}, is introduced in\nthis work. Ordinal pooling rearranges all the elements of a pooling region in a\nsequence and assigns a different weight to each element based upon its order in\nthe sequence. These weights are used to compute the pooling operation as a\nweighted sum of the rearranged elements of the pooling region. They are learned\nvia a standard gradient-based training, allowing to learn a behavior anywhere\nin the spectrum of average-pooling to max-pooling in a differentiable manner.\nOur experiments suggest that it is advantageous for the networks to perform\ndifferent types of pooling operations within a pooling layer and that a hybrid\nbehavior between average- and max-pooling is often beneficial. More\nimportantly, they also demonstrate that ordinal pooling leads to consistent\nimprovements in the accuracy over average- or max-pooling operations while\nspeeding up the training and alleviating the issue of the choice of the pooling\noperations and activation functions to be used in the networks. In particular,\nordinal pooling mainly helps on lightweight or quantized deep learning\narchitectures, as typically considered e.g. for embedded applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 14:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

It is indeed\nproved, in finite dimension, that these evolutions converge to IBV solutions.\nIf the viscosity operator is neglected, or has a nontrivial kernel, the weaker\nnotion of Inertial Virtual Viscosity (IVV) solutions is introduced, and the\nanalogous convergence result holds. Again in a finite-dimensional context, it\nis also shown that IBV and IVV solutions can be obtained via a natural\nextension of the Minimizing Movements algorithm, where the limit effect of\ninertial terms is taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 14:33:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 09:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

Speaker age estimation has applications in\nenabling personalization and age-appropriate curation of information and\ncontent. However, research in speaker age estimation in children is especially\nchallenging due to paucity of relevant speech data representing the\ndevelopmental spectrum, and the high signal variability especially intra age\nvariability that complicates modeling. Most approaches in children speaker age\nestimation adopt methods directly from research on adult speech processing. In\nthis paper, we propose features specific to children and focus on speaker's\nphone duration as an important biomarker of children's age. We propose phone\nduration modeling for predicting age from child's speech. To enable that,\nchildren speech is first forced aligned with the corresponding transcription to\nderive phone duration distributions. Statistical functionals are computed from\nphone duration distributions for each phoneme which are in turn used to train\nregression models to predict speaker age. Two children speech datasets are\nemployed to demonstrate the robustness of phone duration features.

Dominance\nreversals are characterized by the beneficial allele for a given context (e.g.,\nniche, time, trait or sex) being dominant in that context. This\ncontext-dependence at least partially mitigates the fitness consequence of\nheterozygotes carrying one of the 'wrong' alleles for their context and can\nresult in balancing selection that maintains both alleles. Despite being\ndismissed by some early on, dominance reversals are an inevitable outcome of\nantagonistic selection under reasonable assumptions, and mounting empirical\nevidence largely supports this theory. Here we review the theory and empirical\nevidence for beneficial reversals of dominance. Along the way, we identify some\nareas in need of further research and development, point out some complications\nwith contemporary approaches for detecting genetic tradeoffs, and highlight\nmethods that leverage signatures of dominance reversal toward identifying\ngenetic tradeoffs.

We analyze the topological\ntransformation of the space of training samples as it gets transformed by each\nsuccessive layer during training, by changing the activation function. The\nimpact of changing activation function on the convergence during training is\nreported for the task of binary classification. A novel activation function\naimed at faster convergence for classification tasks is proposed. Here, Betti\nnumbers are used to quantify topological complexity of data. Results of\nexperiments on popular synthetic binary classification datasets with large\nBetti numbers(>150) using MLPs are reported. Results show that the proposed\nactivation function results in faster convergence requiring fewer epochs by a\nfactor of 1.5 to 2, since Betti numbers reduce faster across layers with the\nproposed activation function. The proposed methodology was verified on\nbenchmark image datasets: fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10 and cat-vs-dog images, using\nCNNs.

The expected\nbenefit is to avoid the inherently difficult pose to shape conversion required\nwith skeletal parametrization applied on real characters. To this purpose, we\nconsider image style transfer techniques and investigate how to adapt them to\n3D human shapes.

As an alternative approach,\npresenting a representative set of solutions of the Pareto front may be\nadvantageous. Choosing such a representative set is by itself also a\nmulti-objective problem that must consider the number of solutions to present,\nthe uniformity, and/or the coverage of the representation, to guarantee its\nquality. This paper proposes three algorithms for the representation problem\nfor multi-objective integer linear programming problems with two or more\nobjective functions, each one of them dealing with each dimension of the\nproblem (cardinality, coverage, and uniformity).

There are many different methods for the motor imagery\nclassification, but the limited understanding on human brain requires more\neffective methods for extracting the features of EEG data. Graph neural\nnetworks(GNNs) have demonstrated its effectiveness in classifying graph\nstructures; and the use of GNN provides new possibilities for brain structure\nconnection feature extraction. In this paper we propose a novel graph neural\nnetwork based on the mutual information of the raw EEG channels called\nMutualGraphNet. We use the mutual information as the adjacency matrix combined\nwith the spatial temporal graph convolution network(ST-GCN) could extract the\ntransition rules of the motor imagery electroencephalogram(EEG) channels data\nmore effectively.

The photonic frontend includes a photonic\nsampling pulse generator for directly high-speed sampling and an optical\ntime-division demultiplexer (OTDM) for channel demultiplexing. It is found that\nthe frequency response of the CI-PADC is influenced by both the photonic\nsampling pulses and the OTDM, of which the combined impact can be characterized\nthrough demultiplexed pulse trains. First, the frequency response can be\ndivided into multiple frequency intervals and the range of the frequency\ninterval equals the repetition rate of demultiplexed pulse trains. Second, the\nanalog bandwidth of the CI-PADC is determined by the optical spectral bandwidth\nof demultiplexed pulse trains which is broadened in the OTDM.

Here we propose a scheme for all-optical\naggregation of several low bitrate channels to fewer channels with higher\nspectral efficiency. The method is based on optical vector summation\nfacilitated by coherent spectral superposition. Thereby it does not need any\noptical nonlinearities and is based on linear signal processing with an\nelectro-optic modulator. Furthermore, optical phase tuning required for vector\naddition can be easily achieved by a phase tuning of the radio frequency signal\ndriving the modulator. We experimentally demonstrate the aggregation of two 10\nGbaud BPSK signals into one 10 Gbaud QPSK and one 10 Gbaud PAM-4 signal, the\naggregation of two 10 Gbaud QPSK signals into 10 Gbaud QAM-16, as well as the\naggregation of sinc-shaped Nyquist signals. The presented concept of in-line\nall-optical aggregation demonstrates considerable improvement in network\nspectrum utilization and can significantly enhance the operational capacity\nwith reduced complexity. It provides a new way for realizing the flexible\noptical transmission of advanced modulation format signals, and suits for\nfuture dynamically reconfigurable optical networks.

Additionally, finite element analysis was used to\nstudy FREE design parameters as well as the workspace achieved with a module\ncomprised of multiple FREEs. Our finite element results indicate that\nvariations in the material properties of the elastic enclosure of a FREE are\nmore significant than variations in fiber properties. Finally, finite element\nresults show that a 30-degree difference in winding angle dramatically alters\nthe shape of the workspace generated by four FREEs assembled into a module.\nConcludingly, comments are made about the relative advantages and limitations\nof lumped-parameter and finite element models of FREEs and FREE modules in\nproviding useful insights into their behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 18:48:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 02:09:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 May 2022 03:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

However, the computational\ncomplexity of their direct calculations is proportional not only to the number\nof data points in a signal but also to the smoothing size, which is the\nstandard deviation in the Gaussian function in their transform functions. Thus,\nwhen the standard deviation is large, its considerable computation time\ndiminishes the advantages of aforementioned transforms. Therefore, it is\nimportant to formulate an algorithm to reduce the calculation time of the\ntransformations. In this paper, we first review calculation methods of Gaussian\nsmoothing by using the sliding Fourier transform (SFT) and our proposed\nattenuated SFT (ASFT) \\cite{YamashitaICPR2020}. Based on these methods, we\npropose two types of calculation methods for Morlet wavelet transforms. We also\npropose an algorithm to calculate SFT using the kernel integral on graphic\nprocessing unit (GPU). When the number of calculation cores in GPU is not less\nthan the number of data points, the order of its calculation time is the\nlogarithm of the smoothing size and does not depend on the number of data\npoints. Using experiments, we compare the two methods for calculating the\nMorlet wavelet transform and evaluate the calculation time of the proposed\nalgorithm using a kernel integral on GPU. For example, when the number of data\npoints and the standard deviation are 102400 and 8192.0, respectively, the\ncalculation time of the Morlet wavelet transform by the proposed method is\n0.545 ms, which 413.6 times faster than a conventional method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 08:33:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2021 05:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}
