It is an\nunsupervised learning technique that identifies a suitable linear subspace for\nthe input variable that contains maximal variation and preserves as much\ninformation as possible. PCA has also been used in prediction models where the\noriginal, high-dimensional space of predictors is reduced to a smaller, more\nmanageable, set before conducting regression analysis. However, this approach\ndoes not incorporate information in the response during the dimension-reduction\nstage and hence can have poor predictive performance. To address this concern,\nseveral supervised linear dimension-reduction techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature. This paper reviews selected techniques, extends some of them,\nand compares their performance through simulations. Two of these techniques,\npartial least squares (PLS) and least-squares PCA (LSPCA), consistently\noutperform the others in this study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 17:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

Unsup-SimCSE takes dropout as\na minimal data augmentation method, and passes the same input sentence to a\npre-trained Transformer encoder (with dropout turned on) twice to obtain the\ntwo corresponding embeddings to build a positive pair. As the length\ninformation of a sentence will generally be encoded into the sentence\nembeddings due to the usage of position embedding in Transformer, each positive\npair in unsup-SimCSE actually contains the same length information.

In the coarse-mesh 3-D modeling of advanced-reactor\ntransients that involve flow and heat transfer, accurately predicting the\nturbulent viscosity is a challenging task that requires an accurate and\ncomputationally efficient model to capture the unresolved fine-scale\nturbulence.

The model has a coarse-mesh\nsetup to ensure computational efficiency, while it is trained by fine-mesh\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) data to ensure accuracy.

However, existing works are incapable to deliver a continuous and\nfine-grained editing mode (e.g., editing a slightly smiling face to a big\nlaughing one) with natural interactions with users. In this work, we propose\nTalk-to-Edit, an interactive facial editing framework that performs\nfine-grained attribute manipulation through dialog between the user and the\nsystem. Our key insight is to model a continual \"semantic field\" in the GAN\nlatent space. 1) Unlike previous works that regard the editing as traversing\nstraight lines in the latent space, here the fine-grained editing is formulated\nas finding a curving trajectory that respects fine-grained attribute landscape\non the semantic field. 2) The curvature at each step is location-specific and\ndetermined by the input image as well as the users' language requests. 3) To\nengage the users in a meaningful dialog, our system generates language feedback\nby considering both the user request and the current state of the semantic\nfield.\n  We also contribute CelebA-Dialog, a visual-language facial editing dataset to\nfacilitate large-scale study. Specifically, each image has manually annotated\nfine-grained attribute annotations as well as template-based textual\ndescriptions in natural language. Extensive quantitative and qualitative\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of 1) the\nsmoothness of fine-grained editing, 2) the identity/attribute preservation, and\n3) the visual photorealism and dialog fluency.

This is compared with the\ngenerated pattern, and their performance accuracy forms the feedback to the\nlearner. The system proceeds to generate a new pattern of increased complexity\nwhen performance assessment results are within certain error bounds. The system\nthus mimics a learner-teacher relationship as the learner progresses in their\nfeedback-based learning. The choice of progression within a cycle for each\npattern is determined by a predefined complexity metric. This metric is based\non a coded element model for the perceptual processing of sequential stimuli.\nThe model earlier proposed for a sequence of tones and non-tones, is now used\nfor onsets and silences.

The EDE component briefly accelerates cosmic expansion just\nprior to recombination, which reduces the physical size of the sound horizon\nimprinted in the CMB.

We find that, while the efficiency decreases with higher\nflow speed (due to the reduced reaction time), the total production\nnevertheless increases due to the higher mass flux in most cases. Our results\nfurther show that, even at high flow speeds, spatial proximity of the two\ncatalysts increases reaction efficiency, which supports recent experimental\nefforts to locate both catalysts on a single fiber in a side-by-side geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 17:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

Another important\nconsequence of MOND as a classical modification of gravity is that the strong\nequivalence principle (SEP) -- which requires the dynamics of a small,\nfree-falling, self-gravitating system not to depend on the external\ngravitational field in which it is embedded -- should be broken. Multiple\ntentative detections of this so-called external field effect (EFE) of MOND have\nbeen made in the past, but the systems that should be most sensitive to it are\ngalaxies with low internal gravitational accelerations residing in galaxy\nclusters within a strong external field. Here, we show that ultra-diffuse\ngalaxies (UDGs) in the Coma cluster do lie on the RAR, and that their velocity\ndispersion profiles are in full agreement with isolated MOND predictions,\nespecially when including some degree of radial anisotropy.

The journal-wise\nvariational patterns of these four indicators, i.e. UF, CY, HD and TH and the\nrelationships of UF with other three indicators are analysed. The calculated\nnumerical values of these indicators are observed to formulate seven\nhypotheses, which are tested by F-Test method. The average annual rate of\nchange of uncited paper is found 67% of total number of papers. The indicator\nCY is found temporally constant.

The UF inversely varies with CY and TH for the\njournals and directly varies with TH over the years. Except few highly reputed\nIndian journals in physics and astronomy, majority other journals face the\nsituation of uncitedness. The uncitedness of Indian journals in this field\noutshines the same for global journals by 12%, which indicates lack of\ncirculation and timely reach of research communication to the relevant\naudience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 18:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-13"}

These dynamics encode the band structure,\nincluding non-trivial topological properties of the source material, through\nboth intraband current and interband polarization, into the high harmonic\nspectrum. In the course of this process, dephasing between the driven electron\nand the hole can significantly reduce the HHG efficiency. Here, we exploit this\nfeature and turn it into a measurement of e-h coherence in strongly driven\nsolids. Utilizing a pre-pump pulse, we first photodope monolayer molybdenum\ndisulfide and then examine the HHG induced by an intense infrared pulse. We\nobserve clear suppression of the HH intensity, which becomes more pronounced\nwith increasing order.

Micromagnetic simulations can be\nused to compute the spatial profiles and oscillation frequencies of spin-waves\nin magnetic system with almost arbitrary geometry and different magnetic\ninteractions. Although numerical approaches are very versatile, they often do\nnot give the same insight and physical understanding as analytical theories.\nFor example, it is not always possible to decide whether a certain feature\n(such as dispersion asymmetry, for example) is governed by one magnetic\ninteraction or the other. Moreover, since numerical approaches typically yield\nthe normal modes of the system, it is not always feasible to disentangle\nhybridized modes. In this manuscript, we build a bridge between numerics and\nanalytics by presenting a methodology to calculate the individual contributions\nto general spin-wave dispersions in a fully numerical manner. We discuss the\ngeneral form of any spin-wave dispersion in terms of the effective (stiffness)\nfields produced by the modes.

In particular, it becomes possible to disentangle\ncontributions of different magnetic interactions to the dispersion asymmetry in\nsystems where non-reciprocity is present. At the same time, dipolar-hybridized\nmodes can be easily disentangled.

The modulator works\nat data rates up to 2 Gbps with energy consumption below 4 pJ/bit, and we show\nthat this figure can be reduced to less than 40 fJ/bit with optimized design\nand fabrication.

Supervised Variational\nAutoencoders (SVAEs) have previously been used for this purpose, where a\ncarefully designed decoder can be used as an interpretable generative model\nwhile the supervised objective ensures a predictive latent representation.\nUnfortunately, the supervised objective forces the encoder to learn a biased\napproximation to the generative posterior distribution, which renders the\ngenerative parameters unreliable when used in scientific models.

These risks are then used to build safety sets which can represent\nrisk-averse to risk-insensitive perception. We define a notions of\n\"inclusiveness\" and \"versatility\" based on safety sets and use it to compare\nwith other models such as Conditional value at Risk (CVaR) and Expected risk\n(ER).

These affect the dynamical\nevolution of an open star cluster and impact its dissolution in a given\nGalactic potential. We investigate the correlation between the mass of OB stars\nand the observational properties of open clusters.

We also developed the tool to\ntransfer the simulation data to mock observations of Gaia.\n  Results: We find that OB stars and black holes have a major effect on star\ncluster evolution. Star clusters with the same initial conditions, but a\ndifferent initial content of OB stars, follow very different evolutionary\npaths. Thus, the initial total mass and radius of an observed star cluster\ncannot be unambiguously determined unless the initial content of OB stars is\nknown. We show that the stellar counts in the corresponding tidal tails, that\ncan be identified in the Gaia data, help to resolve this issues.

These findings are relevant for studies of the\nformation of massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 23:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

The\nrecent work on C-MinHash (Li and Li, 2021) has shown, with rigorous proofs,\nthat only two permutations are needed. An initial permutation is applied to\nbreak whatever structures which might exist in the data, and a second\npermutation is re-used $K$ times to produce $K$ hashes, via a circulant\nshifting fashion. (Li and Li, 2021) has proved that, perhaps surprisingly, even\nthough the $K$ hashes are correlated, the estimation variance is strictly\nsmaller than the variance of the traditional MinHash.\n  It has been demonstrated in (Li and Li, 2021) that the initial permutation in\nC-MinHash is indeed necessary. For the ease of theoretical analysis, they have\nused two independent permutations. In this paper, we show that one can actually\nsimply use one permutation. That is, one single permutation is used for both\nthe initial pre-processing step to break the structures in the data and the\ncirculant hashing step to generate $K$ hashes.

Deep Spatiotemporal graph neural networks\n(GNNs), which capture both spatial and temporal patterns, have achieved great\nsuccess in traffic forecasting applications. Understanding how GNNs-based\nforecasting work and the vulnerability and robustness of these models becomes\ncritical to real-world applications. For example, if spatiotemporal GNNs are\nvulnerable in real-world traffic prediction applications, a hacker can easily\nmanipulate the results and cause serious traffic congestion and even a\ncity-scale breakdown. However, despite that recent studies have demonstrated\nthat deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to carefully designed\nperturbations in multiple domains like objection classification and graph\nrepresentation, current adversarial works cannot be directly applied to\nspatiotemporal forecasting due to the causal nature and spatiotemporal\nmechanisms in forecasting models. To fill this gap, in this paper we design\nSpatially Focused Attack (SFA) to break spatiotemporal GNNs by attacking a\nsingle vertex. To achieve this, we first propose the inverse estimation to\naddress the causality issue; then, we apply genetic algorithms with a universal\nattack method as the evaluation function to locate the weakest vertex; finally,\nperturbations are generated by solving an inverse estimation-based optimization\nproblem. We conduct experiments on real-world traffic data and our results show\nthat perturbations in one vertex designed by SA can be diffused into a large\npart of the graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 01:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-13"}

Based on the above considerations, we propose\nan adaptively-cooperative fusion network (ACFNet) with ResinRes structure for\nsalient object detection. This structure is designed to flexibly utilize the\nadvantages of feature fusion in early and late stages. Secondly, an\nadaptively-cooperative semantic guidance (ACG) scheme is designed to suppress\ninaccurate features in the guidance phase. Further, we proposed a type-based\nattention module (TAM) to optimize the network and enhance the multi-scale\nperception of different objects. For different objects, the features generated\nby different types of convolution are enhanced or suppressed by the gated\nmechanism for segmentation optimization.

In particular, IKD trains the teacher model to generate specific soft\ntarget at each training step for a certain student. Joint optimization for both\nteacher and student is achieved by two iterative steps: a course step to\noptimize student with the soft target of teacher, and an exam step to optimize\nteacher with the feedback of student.

The starting point is dimension-3 MCFJ\nelectrodynamics in matter whose modified Maxwell equations, permittivity\ntensor, and dispersion relations are recapitulated. Corresponding refractive\nindices are achieved in terms of the frequency and the vector-valued background\nfield. For a purely timelike background, the refractive indices are real. Their\nassociated propagation modes are circularly polarized and exhibit\nbirefringence. For a purely spacelike background, one refractive index is\nalways real and the other can be complex. The circularly polarized propagating\nmodes may exhibit birefringence and dichroism (associated with absorption).\nSubsequently, we examine a dimension-five MCFJ-type electrodynamics, previously\nscrutinized in the literature, in a continuous medium. Following the same\nprocedure, we find the refractive indices from a sixth-order dispersion\nequation. For a purely timelike background, three distinct refractive indices\nare obtained, one of them being real and two being complex. They are associated\nwith two circularly polarized propagating modes that exhibit birefringence or\ndichroism, depending on the frequency range. Scenarios of propagation and\nabsorption analogous to those found in dispersive dielectrics are also observed\nfor spacelike background configurations. We conclude by comparing the\ndimension-three and five results and by emphasizing the richer phenomenology of\nthe propagating modes in the higher-derivative model. Our results are\napplicable in the realm of Weyl semimetals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 04:28:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 19:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}

STE can help the pruned weights revive in the process of\nfinding dynamic sparsity patterns. However, using these coarse gradients causes\ntraining instability and performance degradation owing to the unreliable\ngradient signal of the STE approximation.

To test these\ntheories, we need precise measurements of both the mean value and the scatter\nof epsilon_ff, but high-precision measurements have been difficult because they\nrequire determining cloud volume densities, from which we can calculate\nfree-fall times. Until recently, most density estimates assume clouds as\nuniform spheres, while their real structures are often filamentary and highly\nnon-uniform, yielding systematic errors in epsilon_ff estimates and smearing\nreal cloud-to-cloud variations. We recently developed a theoretical model to\nreduce this error by using column density distributions in clouds to produce\nmore accurate volume density estimates.

While there are existing vision-based intuitive\nphysics models that learn to predict physical interaction outcomes, they mostly\nfocus on generating short sequences of future frames based on physical\nproperties (e.g. mass, friction and velocity) extracted from visual inputs or a\nlatent space. However, there is a lack of intuitive physics models that are\ntested on long physical interaction sequences with multiple interactions among\ndifferent objects. We hypothesize that selective temporal attention during\napproximate mental simulations helps humans in physical interaction outcome\nprediction. With these motivations, we propose a novel scheme: Physical\nInteraction Prediction via Mental Simulation with Span Selection (PIP). It\nutilizes a deep generative model to model approximate mental simulations by\ngenerating future frames of physical interactions before employing selective\ntemporal attention in the form of span selection for predicting physical\ninteraction outcomes. To evaluate our model, we further propose the large-scale\nSPACE+ dataset of synthetic videos with long sequences of three prime physical\ninteractions in a 3D environment.

Owing to the limited number of\nanomaly labels in these complex systems, unsupervised anomaly detection methods\nhave attracted great attention in recent years. Two major challenges faced by\nthe existing unsupervised methods are: (i) distinguishing between normal and\nabnormal data in the transition field, where normal and abnormal data are\nhighly mixed together; (ii) defining an effective metric to maximize the gap\nbetween normal and abnormal data in a hypothesis space, which is built by a\nrepresentation learner. To that end, this work proposes a novel scoring network\nwith a score-guided regularization to learn and enlarge the anomaly score\ndisparities between normal and abnormal data. With such score-guided strategy,\nthe representation learner can gradually learn more informative representation\nduring the model training stage, especially for the samples in the transition\nfield.

Although many previous works have explored greatly on scene flow\nestimation based on point clouds, there are two problems that have not been\nnoticed or well solved before: 1) Points of adjacent frames in repetitive\npatterns may be wrongly associated due to similar spatial structure in their\nneighbourhoods; 2) Scene flow between adjacent frames of point clouds with\nlong-distance movement may be inaccurately estimated. To solve the first\nproblem, a novel context-aware set convolution layer is proposed in this paper\nto exploit contextual structure information of Euclidean space and learn soft\naggregation weights for local point features. This design is inspired by human\nperception of contextual structure information during scene understanding with\nrepetitive patterns. The context-aware set convolution layer is incorporated in\na context-aware point feature pyramid module of 3D point clouds for scene flow\nestimation.

Given a data set of size~$N$ and\nmargin~$\\gamma$ (how well the given data are separated), the query complexity\nof the best-known quantum training algorithm scales as either\n$(\\nicefrac{\\sqrt{N}}{\\gamma^2})\\log(\\nicefrac1{\\gamma^2)}$ or\n$\\nicefrac{N}{\\sqrt{\\gamma}}$, which is achieved by a hybrid of classical and\nquantum search. In this paper, we improve the version space quantum training\nmethod for perceptrons such that the query complexity of our algorithm scales\nas $\\sqrt{\\nicefrac{N}{\\gamma}}$. This is achieved by constructing an oracle\nfor the perceptrons using quantum counting of the number of data elements that\nare correctly classified. We show that query complexity to construct such an\noracle has a quadratic improvement over classical methods. Once such an oracle\nis constructed, bounded-error quantum search can be used to search over the\nhyperplane instances. The optimality of our algorithm is proven by reducing the\nevaluation of a two-level AND-OR tree (for which the query complexity lower\nbound is known) to a multi-criterion search. Our quantum training algorithm can\nbe generalized to train more complex machine learning models such as neural\nnetworks, which are built on a large number of perceptrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 06:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-13"}

For example, the\nlargest face dataset, WebFace42M contains about 2 million identities and 42\nmillion faces. However, a massive number of faces raise the constraints in\ntraining time, computing resources, and memory cost. The current research on\nthis problem mainly focuses on designing an efficient Fully-connected layer\n(FC) to reduce GPU memory consumption caused by a large number of identities.\nIn this work, we relax these constraints by resolving the redundancy problem of\nthe up-to-date face datasets caused by the greedily collecting operation (i.e.\nthe core-set selection perspective). As the first attempt in this perspective\non the face recognition problem, we find that existing methods are limited in\nboth performance and efficiency. For superior cost-efficiency, we contribute a\nnovel filtering strategy dubbed Face-NMS. Face-NMS works on feature space and\nsimultaneously considers the local and global sparsity in generating core sets.\nIn practice, Face-NMS is analogous to Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) in the\nobject detection community. It ranks the faces by their potential contribution\nto the overall sparsity and filters out the superfluous face in the pairs with\nhigh similarity for local sparsity. With respect to the efficiency aspect,\nFace-NMS accelerates the whole pipeline by applying a smaller but sufficient\nproxy dataset in training the proxy model. As a result, with Face-NMS, we\nsuccessfully scale down the WebFace42M dataset to 60% while retaining its\nperformance on the main benchmarks, offering a 40% resource-saving and 1.64\ntimes acceleration.

While\nexisting approaches seldom leverage the appearance-motion information in the\nvideo at multiple temporal scales, the interaction between the question and the\nvisual information for textual semantics extraction is frequently ignored.\nTargeting these issues, this paper proposes a novel Temporal Pyramid\nTransformer (TPT) model with multimodal interaction for VideoQA. The TPT model\ncomprises two modules, namely Question-specific Transformer (QT) and Visual\nInference (VI). Given the temporal pyramid constructed from a video, QT builds\nthe question semantics from the coarse-to-fine multimodal co-occurrence between\neach word and the visual content. Under the guidance of such question-specific\nsemantics, VI infers the visual clues from the local-to-global multi-level\ninteractions between the question and the video. Within each module, we\nintroduce a multimodal attention mechanism to aid the extraction of\nquestion-video interactions, with residual connections adopted for the\ninformation passing across different levels. Through extensive experiments on\nthree VideoQA datasets, we demonstrate better performances of the proposed\nmethod in comparison with the state-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 08:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-13"}

In particular, we\nshow that if $\\widetilde{H}$ is a DVM, then $H$ is transfer Krull if and only\nif $H\\subseteq\\widetilde{H}$ is inert. Moreover, we prove that if\n$\\widetilde{H}$ is factorial, then $H$ is transfer Krull if and only if\n$\\mathcal{A}(\\widetilde{H})=\\{u\\varepsilon\\mid\nu\\in\\mathcal{A}(H),\\varepsilon\\in\\widetilde{H}^{\\times}\\}$. We also show that\nif $\\widetilde{H}$ is half-factorial, then $H$ is transfer Krull if and only if\n$\\mathcal{A}(H)\\subseteq\\mathcal{A}(\\widetilde{H})$. Finally, we point out that\ncharacterizing the transfer Krull property is more intricate for monoids whose\nroot closure is Krull. This is done by providing a series of counterexamples\ninvolving reduced affine monoids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 10:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-13"}

Specific air traffic controllers are assigned to\nsolve such conflicts. A controller needs to consider various types of\ninformation in order to solve a conflict. The most common and preliminary\ninformation is the coordinate position of the involved aircraft. Additionally,\na controller has to take into account more information such as flight planning,\nweather, restricted territory, etc. The most important challenges a controller\nhas to face are: to think about the issues involved and make a decision in a\nvery short time. Due to the increased number of aircraft, it is crucial to\nreduce the workload of the controllers and help them make quick decisions. A\nconflict can be solved in many ways, therefore, we consider this problem as a\nmulti-label classification problem. In doing so, we are proposing a multi-label\nclassification model which provides multiple heading advisories for a given\nconflict. This model we named CRMLnet is based on a novel application of a\nmulti-layer neural network and helps the controllers in their decisions.

The\nbenefit of a high light yield, and thus a low energy threshold and a good\nenergy resolution, comes at the cost of the directional information featured by\nwater Cherenkov detectors, measuring $^8$B solar neutrinos above a few MeV.

The catalog of Stars With ExoplanETs (SWEET-Cat) was originally\nintroduced in 2013. Since then many more exoplanets have been confirmed,\nincreasing significantly the number of host stars listed there. A crucial step\ntoward a comprehensive understanding of these new worlds is the precise and\nhomogeneous characterization of their host stars. Better spectroscopic stellar\nparameters along with new results from Gaia eDR3 provide updated and precise\nparameters for the discovered planets. A new version of the catalog, whose\nhomogeneity in the derivation of the parameters is key to unraveling\nstar-planet connections, is available to the community. Methods. We made use of\nhigh-resolution spectra for planet-host stars, either observed by our team or\ncollected through public archives. The spectroscopic stellar parameters were\nderived for the spectra following the same homogeneous process using ARES and\nMOOG (ARES+MOOG) as for the previous SWEET-Cat releases. We re-derived\nparameters for the stars in the catalog using better quality spectra and/or\nusing the most recent versions of the codes. Moreover, the new SWEET-Cat table\ncan now be more easily combined with the planet properties listed both at the\nExtrasolar Planets Encyclopedia and at the NASA exoplanet archive to perform\nstatistical analyses of exoplanets. We also made use of the recent GAIA eDR3\nparallaxes and respective photometry to derive consistent and accurate surface\ngravity values for the host stars. Results. We increased the number of stars\nwith homogeneous parameters by more than 40\\% (from 645 to 928). We reviewed\nand updated the metallicity distributions of stars hosting planets with\ndifferent mass regimes comparing the low-mass planets (< 30M$_{\\oplus}$) with\nthe high-mass planets. The new data strengthen previous results showing the\npossible trend in the metallicity-period-mass diagram for low-mass planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 10:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

By\nassuming no disagreement on the cash flows, we emphasize how risk preferences\nin particular, but also the costs of capital, influence a subjective evaluation\nof the decision to invest now or retain the option to invest in future. We\npropose a risk-adjusted valuation model to facilitate investors' subjective\ndecision making, in response to the market valuation of an investment\nopportunity. The investor's subjective assessment arises from their perceived\nmisvaluation of the investment by the market, so projected cash flows are\ndiscounted using two different rates representing the investor's and the\nmarket's view. This liberates our model from perfect or imperfect hedging\nassumptions and instead, we are able to illustrate the hedging effect on the\nreal option value when perceptions of risk premia diverge. During crises\nperiods, delaying an investment becomes more valuable as the idiosyncratic risk\nof future cash flows increases, but the decision-maker may rush to invest too\nquickly when the risk level is exceptionally high. Our model verifies features\nestablished by classical real-option valuation models and provides many new\ninsights about the importance of modelling divergences in decision-makers risk\npremia, especially during crisis periods. It also has many practical advantages\nbecause it requires no more parameter inputs than basic discounted cash flow\napproaches, such as the marketed asset disclaimer method, but the outputs are\nmuch richer. They allow for complex interactions between cost and revenue\nuncertainties as well as an easy exploration of the effects of hedgeable and\nun-hedgeable risks on the real option value.

While a selective pulse (SP) on 1H at the beginning\nof pulsed SOT had been considered before, using SPs during the SOT suppresses\nundesired indirect spin-spin interactions. As a result, we achieved a more\nrobust SOT for the SP variants of the phINEPT+ sequence that we refer to as\nphSPINEPT+. Thereby, for the first time, we report a sequence that is effective\nfor all weakly coupled spin systems. Our simulations show that the method\nconverts close to 100 % of the parahydrogen-derived spin order into 13C\nhyperpolarization in weakly coupled three-spin systems and partially or fully\n2H-labeled molecules if relaxation is neglected. Experimentally we demonstrate\nhigh hyperpolarization of 13C with 15.8 % for 1-13C-hydroxyethyl propionate-d3\nand 12.6 % for 1-13C-ethyl acetate-d6, which corresponds to ~47 % and ~38 % if\nthe enrichment of parahydrogen had been 100 %. Even in non-2H-labeled\nmolecules, a remarkable 13C polarization is achieved, e.g. up to 20 % were\nsimulated for 100 % pH2, and 1.25 % were obtained experimentally for\n1-13C-ethyl pyruvate and 50 % pH2, which can be further improved by faster\nhydrogenation. As a result, full deuterium labeling may no longer be required\ne.g., when new PHIP agents are investigated, the synthesis of fully deuterated\nmolecules is too complex, or when a kinetic isotope effect regarding the\nmetabolic conversion rate of an agent is to be avoided. Using SPs during SOT\nseems very promising and may be extended to other sequences in the context of\nPHIP and be-yond to make them less prone to experimental imperfections or real\nmolecular environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 11:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-13"}

What happens\nfor example if each file is of potential interest to, say, $40\\,\\%$ of the\nusers and each user has potential interest in $40\\,\\%$ of the library? In this\nwork, we investigate the so-called symmetrically selfish coded caching\nscenario, where each user only makes requests from a subset of the library that\ndefines its own File Demand Set (FDS), each user caches selfishly only contents\nfrom its own FDS, and where the different FDSs symmetrically overlap to some\nextent. In the context of various traditional prefetching scenarios (prior to\nthe emergence of coded caching), selfish approaches were known to be\npotentially very effective. On the other hand, with the exception of some\nnotable works, little is known about selfish coded caching. We here present a\nnew information-theoretic converse that proves, in a general setting of\nsymmetric FDS structures, that selfish coded caching, despite enjoying a much\nlarger local caching gain and a much smaller set of possible demands,\nintroduces an unbounded load increase compared to the unselfish case.

While tackling the input domain gap, the standard domain\nadaptation settings assume no domain change in the output space. In semantic\nprediction tasks, different datasets are often labeled according to different\nsemantic taxonomies. In many real-world settings, the target domain task\nrequires a different taxonomy than the one imposed by the source domain. We\ntherefore introduce the more general taxonomy adaptive cross-domain semantic\nsegmentation (TACS) problem, allowing for inconsistent taxonomies between the\ntwo domains. We further propose an approach that jointly addresses the\nimage-level and label-level domain adaptation. On the label-level, we employ a\nbilateral mixed sampling strategy to augment the target domain, and a\nrelabelling method to unify and align the label spaces. We address the\nimage-level domain gap by proposing an uncertainty-rectified contrastive\nlearning method, leading to more domain-invariant and class-discriminative\nfeatures. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our framework under\ndifferent TACS settings: open taxonomy, coarse-to-fine taxonomy, and\nimplicitly-overlapping taxonomy.

Another fundamental distinction,\ndirectly relevant to scalability solutions such as sharding, is whether or not\na single untrusted user is able to point to *certificates*, which provide\nincontrovertible proof of block confirmation. Algorand produces such\ncertificates, while Bitcoin does not. Are these properties accidental? Or are\nthey inherent consequences of the paradigm of protocol design? Our aim in this\npaper is to understand what, fundamentally, governs the nature of security for\npermissionless blockchain protocols. Using the framework developed in\n(Lewis-Pye and Roughgarden, 2021), we prove general results showing that these\nquestions relate directly to properties of the user selection process, i.e.,\nthe method (such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake) which is used to select\nusers with the task of updating state. Our results suffice to establish, for\nexample, that the production of certificates is impossible for proof-of-work\nprotocols, but is automatic for standard forms of proof-of-stake protocols. As\na byproduct of our work, we also define a number of security notions and\nidentify the equivalences and inequivalences among them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 13:02:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 13:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

Such nanojets can\nbe observed in coronal loops and they have been linked to nanoflares. However,\nwhile models successfully describe the bilateral post-reconnection magnetic\nslingshot effect that leads to the jets, observations reveal that nanojets are\nunidirectional, or highly asymmetric, with only the jet travelling inward with\nrespect to the coronal loop's curvature being clearly observed. The aim of this\nwork is to address the role of the curvature of the coronal loop in asymmetric\nreconnection jets. In order to do so, we first use a simplified analytical\nmodel where we estimate the post-reconnection tension forces based on the local\nintersection angle between the pre-reconnection magnetic field lines and on\ntheir post-reconnection retracting length towards new equilibria. Second, we\nuse a simplified numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to study how two\nopposite propagating jets evolve in curved magnetic field lines. Our analytical\nmodel demonstrates that in the post-reconnection reorganised magnetic field,\nthe inward directed magnetic tension is inherently stronger (up to 3 orders of\nmagnitude) than the outward directed one and that, with a large enough\nretracting length, a regime exists where the outward directed tension\ndisappears, leading to no outward jet at large, observable scales. Our MHD\nnumerical model provides support for these results proving also that in the\nfollowing time evolution the inward jets are consistently more energetic. The\ndegree of asymmetry is also found to increase for small-angle reconnection and\nfor more localised reconnection regions. This work shows that the curvature of\nthe coronal loops plays a role in the asymmetry of the reconnection jets and\ninward directed jets are more likely to occur and more energetic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 13:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

Due to the non-negativity the focus is on conditional\nproportions that add up to 1 for each row. A row of conditional proportions is\ncalled an observed budget. Latent budget analysis (LBA) assumes a mixture of\nlatent budgets that explains the observed budgets. LBA is usually fitted to a\ncontingency table, where the rows are levels of one or more explanatory\nvariables and the columns the levels of a response variable. In prospective\nstudies, there is only knowledge about the explanatory variables of individuals\nand interest goes out to predicting the response variable. Thus, a form of LBA\nis needed that has the functionality of prediction. Previous studies proposed a\nconstrained neural network (NN) extension of LBA that was hampered by an\nunsatisfying prediction ability. Here we propose LBA-NN, a feed forward NN\nmodel that yields a similar interpretation to LBA but equips LBA with a better\nability of prediction. A stable and plausible interpretation of LBA-NN is\nobtained through the use of importance plots and table, that show the relative\nimportance of all explanatory variables on the response variable. An LBA-NN-K-\nmeans approach that applies K-means clustering on the importance table is used\nto produce K clusters that are comparable to K latent budgets in LBA. Here we\nprovide different experiments where LBA-NN is implemented and compared with\nLBA. In our analysis, LBA-NN outperforms LBA in prediction in terms of\naccuracy, specificity, recall and mean square error.

Among others, one direct\nmotivation of our model is the ad auction in which many ad platforms today\nelicit from each bidder not only their private value per conversion but also\ntheir private information about Internet users (e.g., user activities on the\nadvertiser's websites) in order to improve the platform's estimation of\nconversion rates.\n  We show that in this new setup, it is still possible to design mechanisms\nthat are both Incentive and Information Compatible (IIC). We develop two\ndifferent black-box transformations, which convert any mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$\nfor classic bidders to a mechanism $\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}$ for strategically\nreticent bidders, based on either outcome of expectation or expectation of\noutcome, respectively. We identify properties of the original mechanism\n$\\mathcal{M}$ under which the transformation leads to IIC mechanisms\n$\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}$. Interestingly, as corollaries of these results, we show\nthat running VCG with bidders' expected values maximizes welfare, whereas the\nmechanism using expected outcome of Myerson's auction maximizes revenue.\nFinally, we study how regulation on the auctioneer's usage of information can\nlead to more robust mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 14:01:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 01:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

For large-vocabulary systems, however, there are still\nmany difficulties, such as unsatisfactory video recognition accuracies, that\nmake it hard to improve over audio-only baselines. In this paper, we\nspecifically consider such scenarios, focusing on the large-vocabulary task of\nthe LRS2 database, where audio-only performance is far superior to video-only\naccuracies, making this an interesting and challenging setup for multi-modal\nintegration.\n  To address the inherent difficulties, we propose a new fusion strategy: a\nrecurrent integration network is trained to fuse the state posteriors of\nmultiple single-modality models, guided by a set of model-based and\nsignal-based stream reliability measures. During decoding, this network is used\nfor stream integration within a hybrid recognizer, where it can thus cope with\nthe time-variant reliability and information content of its multiple feature\ninputs.\n  We compare the results with end-to-end AVSR systems as well as with\ncompetitive hybrid baseline models, finding that the new fusion strategy shows\nsuperior results, on average even outperforming oracle dynamic stream\nweighting, which has so far marked the -- realistically unachievable -- upper\nbound for standard stream weighting. Even though the pure lipreading\nperformance is low, audio-visual integration is helpful under all -- clean,\nnoisy, and reverberant -- conditions. On average, the new system achieves a\nrelative word error rate reduction of 42.18\\% compared to the audio-only model,\npointing at a high effectiveness of the proposed integration approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 14:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-13"}

Trapped ultracold Rydberg-excited atoms\nin optical lattices are a promising platform for realizing quantum phases with\nbroken lattice translational symmetry since they are interacting over distances\nlarger than the lattice constant. Although numerous theoretical works on\ntrapped Rydberg-excited gases have predicted such phases, in particular density\nwave or supersolid phases, their experimental observation proves to be\ndifficult due to challenges such as scattering processes and the limited\nexperimentally achievable coupling strength. Most of these previous studies\nhave focused on isotropically interacting gases dressed with Rydberg\n$s$-states, while the effect of anisotropic interactions due to Rydberg-excited\n$p$-states in trapped quantum gases remains much less investigated.\nAdditionally, it was shown that the excitation scheme used to excite Rydberg\n$p$-states possesses advantages regarding achievable coupling strengths and\nlimitation of scattering processes compared to its $s$-state counterpart, which\nmakes the investigation of Rydberg $p$-state dressed quantum gases even more\ninteresting.

Most existing best-arm identification algorithms and analyses\noperate under the assumption that the rewards corresponding to different arms\nare independent of each other.

Our proposed algorithm C-LUCB, which generalizes\nthe LUCB algorithm utilizes this partial knowledge of correlations to sharply\nreduce the sample complexity of best-arm identification.

Because of the dual conformal\nfield theory (CFT) formulation in the anti-de Sitter space the conformal\ndimension $\\Delta (Q)$ of the lowest-dimension operator with charge Q under\nsome global U(1) symmetry must be a convex function of Q. This property has\nbeen conjectured to hold for any (unitary) conformal field theory and\ngeneralized to larger global symmetry groups. Here we refine and further test\nthe convex charge conjecture via semiclassical computations for fixed charge\nsectors of different theories in different dimensions. We analyze the convexity\nproperties of the leading and next-to-leading order terms stemming from the\nsemiclassical computation, de facto, extending previous tests beyond the\nleading perturbative contributions and to arbitrary charges. In particular, the\nleading contribution is sufficient to test convexity in the semiclassical\ncomputations. We also consider intriguing cases in which the models feature a\ntransition from real to complex conformal dimensions either as a function of\nthe charge or number of matter fields. As a relevant example of the first kind,\nwe investigate the $O(N)$ model in $4+\\epsilon$ dimensions. As an example of\nthe second type we consider the $U(N)\\times U(M)$ model in $4-\\epsilon$\ndimensions. Both models display a rich dynamics where, by changing the number\nof matter fields and/or charge, one can achieve dramatically different physical\nregimes. We discover that whenever a complex conformal dimension appears, the\nreal part satisfies the convexity property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 15:47:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 23:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

The automatic detection of MAs and HMs on retinal\nfundus images is a challenging task.

Though some methods detect both MAs and HMs, they suffer from the\ncurse of dimensionality of shape and colors features and fail to detect all\nshape variations of HMs such as flame-shaped.

We spectroscopically resolve the individual bulk and edge modes of this\nlattice, detect vacuum-stimulated Rabi oscillations between the excited\ntransmon and each mode, and thereby measure the synthetic-vacuum-induced Lamb\nshift of the transmon. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to employ the\ntransmon to count individual photons within each mode of the topological band\nstructure. This work opens the field of chiral quantum optics experiment,\nsuggesting new routes to topological many-body physics and offering unique\napproaches to backscatter-resilient quantum communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 22:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

It follows that the\nsolutions to the damped harmonic oscillator equation make the Pais-Uhlenbeck\naction stationary. Two systematic approaches are given for deriving the\nPais-Uhlenbeck action from the damped harmonic oscillator equation, and it may\nbe possible to use these methods to identify stationary action principles for\nother dissipative systems which do not conform to Hamilton's principle. It is\nalso shown that for every damped harmonic oscillator $x$, there exists a\ntwo-parameter family of dual oscillators $y$ satisfying the Pais-Uhlenbeck\nequation. The damped harmonic oscillator and any of its duals can be\ninterpreted as a system of two coupled oscillators with atypical spring\nstiffnesses (not necessarily positive and real-valued). For overdamped systems,\nthe resulting coupled oscillators should be physically achievable and may have\nengineering applications. Finally, a new physical interpretation is given for\nthe optimal damping ratio $\\zeta=1/\\sqrt{2}$ in control theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 01:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

Results of an uncertainty\nquantification for deep regression are compared against those obtained by a\nstatistical reference method. The reference method utilizes knowledge of the\nunderlying nonlinear functions and is based on a Bayesian linear regression\nusing a reference prior. Reliability of uncertainty quantification is assessed\nin terms of coverage probabilities, and accuracy through the size of calculated\nuncertainties. We illustrate the proposed framework by applying it to current\napproaches for uncertainty quantification in deep regression. The flexibility,\ntogether with the availability of a reference solution, makes the framework\nsuitable for defining benchmark sets for uncertainty quantification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 13:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

Accounting for fluid\ninertia engenders a rich spectrum of novel complex dynamics including bistable\nstates, where tumbling coexists with stable centerline swimming or swinging.\nThe dynamics is sensitive to the swimmer's hydrodynamic signature and goes well\nbeyond the findings at vanishing fluid inertia.

We introduce a new approach for\nestimating the IFR by first estimating the entire sequence of daily infections.\nUnlike prior approaches, we incorporate existing data on the number of daily\nCOVID-19 tests into our estimation; knowing the test rates helps us estimate\nthe ratio between the number of cases and the number of infections. Also unlike\nprior approaches, rather than determining a constant lag from studying a group\nof patients, we treat the lag as a random variable, whose parameters we\ndetermine empirically by fitting our infections sequence to the sequence of\ndeaths. Our approach allows us to narrow our estimation to smaller time\nintervals in order to observe how the IFR changes over time. We analyze a 250\nday period starting on March 1, 2020. We estimate that the IFR in the U.S.\ndecreases from a high of $0.68\\%$ down to $0.24\\%$ over the course of this time\nperiod.
