However, there is a paucity of RJMS techniques that\ncan solve key technical challenges associated with those new requirements,\nparticularly when they are coupled. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic\nand multi-level resource model approach to address three key well-known\nchallenges individually and in combination: i.e., 1) RJMS dynamism to\nfacilitate job and workflow adaptability, 2) integration of specialized\nexternal resources (e.g. user-centric cloud bursting), and 3) scheduling cloud\norchestration framework tasks. The core idea is to combine a dynamic directed\ngraph resource model with fully hierarchical scheduling to provide a unified\nsolution to all three key challenges. Our empirical and analytical evaluations\nof the solution using our prototype extension to Fluxion, a production\nhierarchical graph-based scheduler, suggest that our unified solution can\nsignificantly improve flexibility, performance and scalability across all three\nproblems in comparison to limited traditional approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 16:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

While 1-AU observations provide a direct measure of solar wind\nconditions, they are single-point observations and thus require interpolation\nto provide inputs to outer-heliosphere solar-wind models. In this study we test\nthe different interpolation methods using synthetic 1-AU observations of\ntime-evolving solar-wind structure. The simplest method is \"corotation\", which\nassumes solar-wind structure is steady state and rotates with the Sun. This\nmethod of reconstruction produces discontinuities in the solar-wind inputs as\nnew observations become available. This can be reduced by corotating both back\nand forward in time, but this still introduces large errors in the magnitude\nand timing of solar wind streams. We show how the dynamic time warping (DTW)\nalgorithm can provide around an order-of-magnitude improvement in solar-wind\ninputs to outer-heliosphere model from in-situ observations near 1 AU. This is\nintended to build the foundation for further work demonstrating and validating\nmethods to improve inner-boundary conditions to outer-heliosphere solar-wind\nmodels, including dealing with solar wind transients and quantifying the\nimprovements at Saturn and Jupiter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 16:03:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

The DES covered a\ncontiguous $5000$ deg$^2$ of the southern sky with $\\approx 80,000$ $3$ deg$^2$\nexposures in the $grizY$ optical/IR filters between 2013 and 2019. This search\nyielded 815 trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), one Centaur and one Oort cloud\ncomet, with 461 objects reported for the first time in this paper. We present\nmethodology that builds upon our previous search carried out on the first four\nyears of data. Here, all DES images were reprocessed with an improved detection\npipeline that leads to an average completeness gain of 0.47 mag per exposure,\nas well as an improved transient catalog production and optimized algorithms\nfor linkage of detections into orbits. All objects were verified by visual\ninspection and by computing the sub-threshold significance, the total\nsignal-to-noise ratio in the stack of images in which the object's presence is\nindicated by the orbit fit, but no detection was reported. This yields a highly\npure catalog of TNOs complete to $r \\approx 23.8$ mag and distances $29<d<2500$\nau. The Y6 TNOs have minimum (median) of 7 (12) distinct nights' detections and\narcs of 1.1 (4.2) years, and will have $grizY$ magnitudes available in a\nfurther publication. We present software for simulating our observational\nbiases that enable comparisons of population models to our detections. Initial\ninferences demonstrating the statistical power of the DES catalog are: the data\nare inconsistent with the CFEPS-L7 model for the classical Kuiper Belt; the 16\n``extreme'' TNOs ($a>150$ au, $q>30$ au) are consistent with the null\nhypothesis of azimuthal isotropy; and non-resonant TNOs with $q>38$ au, $a>50$\nau show a highly significant tendency to be sunward of the major mean motion\nresonances, whereas this tendency is not present for $q<38$ au.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 16:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

If it commonly operates, one would expect to\ncatch proto-Hot Jupiters on highly elliptical orbits that are undergoing\nhigh-eccentricity tidal migration. As of yet, few such systems have been\ndiscovered. Here, we introduce TOI-3362b (TIC-464300749b), an 18.1-day, 5\n$M_{\\rm Jup}$ planet orbiting a main-sequence F-type star that is likely\nundergoing high-eccentricity tidal migration. The orbital eccentricity is\n0.815$^{+0.023}_{-0.032}$. With a semi-major axis of 0.153$^{+0.002}_{-0.003}$\nau, the planet's orbit is expected to shrink to a final orbital radius of\n0.051$^{+0.008}_{-0.006}$ au after complete tidal circularization. Several\nmechanisms could explain the extreme value of the planet's eccentricity, such\nas planet-planet scattering and secular interactions. Such hypotheses can be\ntested with follow-up observations of the system, e.g., measuring the stellar\nobliquity and searching for companions in the system with precise, long-term\nradial velocity observations. The variation in the planet's equilibrium\ntemperature as it orbits the host star and the tidal heating at periapse make\nthis planet an intriguing target for atmospheric modeling and observation.\nBecause the planet's orbital period of 18.1 days is near the limit of TESS's\nperiod sensitivity, even a few such discoveries suggest that proto-Hot Jupiters\nmay be quite common.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 16:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

To achieve knowledge transfer across these heterogeneous on-device\nmodels, a zero-shot distillation approach is designed without any prerequisites\nfor private on-device data, which is contrary to certain prior research based\non a public dataset or a pre-trained data generator. Moreover, this\ncompute-intensive distillation task is assigned to the server to allow the\nparticipation of resource-constrained devices, where a generator is\nadversarially learned with the ensemble of collected on-device models. The\ndistilled central knowledge is then sent back in the form of the corresponding\non-device model parameters, which can be easily absorbed on the device side.\nExtensive experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of\nFedZKT towards on-device knowledge agnostic, on-device model heterogeneity, and\nother challenging federated learning scenarios, such as heterogeneous on-device\ndata and straggler effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 16:53:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 19:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

Recently, several\nsophisticated frameworks for robustification of classical streaming algorithms\nhave been developed. One of the main open questions in this area is whether\nefficient adversarially robust algorithms exist for moment estimation problems\nunder the turnstile streaming model, where both insertions and deletions are\nallowed. So far, the best known space complexity for streams of length $m$,\nachieved using differential privacy (DP) based techniques, is of order\n$\\tilde{O}(m^{1/2})$ for computing a constant-factor approximation with high\nconstant probability.\n  In this work, we propose a new simple approach to tracking moments by\nalternating between two different regimes: a sparse regime, in which we can\nexplicitly maintain the current frequency vector and use standard sparse\nrecovery techniques, and a dense regime, in which we make use of existing\nDP-based robustification frameworks. The results obtained using our technique\nbreak the previous $m^{1/2}$ barrier for any fixed $p$. More specifically, our\nspace complexity for $F_2$-estimation is $\\tilde{O}(m^{2/5})$ and for\n$F_0$-estimation, i.e., counting the number of distinct elements, it is $\\tilde\nO(m^{1/3})$.\n  All existing robustness frameworks have their space complexity depend\nmultiplicatively on a parameter $\\lambda$ called the \\emph{flip number} of the\nstreaming problem, where $\\lambda = m$ in turnstile moment estimation. The best\nknown dependence in these frameworks (for constant factor approximation) is of\norder $\\tilde{O}(\\lambda^{1/2})$, and it is known to be tight for certain\nproblems.

The physics behind\nequilibrium spin currents is uncovered by making an analogy between electronic\nsystems with SOC and non-Abelian gauge theories. The electron spin can be seen\nas the analogous of the color degree of freedom and equilibrium spin currents\ncan then be identified with diamagnetic color currents appearing as the\nresponse to an effective non-Abelian magnetic field generated by SOC.\nEquilibrium spin currents are not associated with spin transport and\naccumulation, but they should nonetheless be carefully taken into account when\ncomputing transport spin currents. We provide quantitative estimates of\nequilibrium spin currents for several systems, specifically metallic surfaces\npresenting Rashba-like surface states, nitride semiconducting nanostructures\nand bulk materials, such as the prototypical gyrotropic medium tellurium. In\ndoing so, we also point out the limitations of model approaches showing that\nfirst-principles calculations are needed to obtain reliable predictions. We\ntherefore use Density Functional Theory computing the so-called bond currents,\nwhich represent a powerful tool to understand the relation between equilibrium\ncurrents, electronic structure and crystal point group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 17:26:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 09:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

How to quickly identify and then recommend new apps of high\nquality is a challenging issue. Here, a fundamental requirement is the\ncapability to accurately measure an app's quality based on its inborn features,\nrather than user-generated features. Since users obtain first-hand experience\nof an app by interacting with its views, we speculate that the inborn features\nare largely related to the visual quality of individual views in an app and the\nways the views switch to one another. In this work, we propose AppQ, a novel\napp quality grading and recommendation system that extracts inborn features of\napps based on app source code. In particular, AppQ works in parallel to perform\ncode analysis to extract app-level features as well as dynamic analysis to\ncapture view-level layout hierarchy and the switching among views.

In this work, we derive a formalism for thermal\nCasimir forces between an arbitrary number of spheres based on fluctuational\nelectrodynamics and scattering theory without the assumption of Lorentz\nreciprocity. We study the total Casimir force in systems of two and three Weyl\nsemimetal spheres with time-reversal symmetry breaking for different\norientations of the momentum-space separation of Weyl nodes in both thermal\nequilibrium and nonequilibrium. In thermal nonequilibrium, we show that a net\nthermal Casimir force exists not only along the center-to-center displacements\nof the spheres, but also in the transverse direction to it due to thermal\nemission with non-zero angular momentum. Different symmetries of the system\ndrive a variety of dynamics such as global rotations, self-propulsion, and\nspinning of the spheres. We also show that the Casimir energy in thermal\nequilibrium depends on the orientations of the Weyl node directions in the\nspheres and that the lateral Casimir force will act between the spheres even in\nthermal equilibrium to relax the system into the minimum energy state without\ntransferring net energy and momentum to the environment.

We\ninvestigate the consistency of the constraints on a clumping factor parameter\n$b$ in a simplistic model, using the latest CMB data from Planck, ACT DR4 and\nSPT-3G 2018. For the combined CMB data alone, we find no evidence for clumping\nbeing different from zero, though when adding a prior on $H_0$ based on the\nlatest distance-ladder analysis of the SH0ES team, we report a weak detection\nof $b$. Our analysis of simulated datasets shows that ACT DR4 has more\nconstraining power with respect to SPT-3G 2018 due to the degeneracy breaking\npower of the TT band powers (not included in SPT). Simulations also suggest\nthat the TE,EE power spectra of the two datasets should have the same\nconstraining power. However, the ACT DR4 TE,EE constraint is tighter than\nexpectations, while the SPT-3G 2018 one is looser.

Consequently, the entanglement entropy is always bounded\nfrom above by the boundary area of the island, leading to an entropy bound in\nterms of the island. The island $I$ is located in the analytically continued\nspacetime, either at the bra or the ket part of the spacetime in\nSchwinger-Keldysh formalism. The entanglement entropy is given by an average of\n$complex$ pseudo generalized entropy for each entanglement island.

We find\ndetectable nuclear activity in ~30% of the sample. The presence of dusty tori\ninfluences the IR SED of galaxies, as highlighted by the strong correlation\namong the AGN contribution to the total IR luminosity budget (fAGN =\nLIR,AGN/LIR), its hard X-ray emission, and the Rayleigh-Jeans to mid-IR\n(S1.2mm/S24um) observed color, with consequences on the empirical SFR\nestimates. Nevertheless, we find only marginal effects of AGN on the CO\n(J=2,4,5,7) or neutral carbon ([CI](1-0), [CI](2-1)) line luminosities and on\nthe derived molecular gas excitation as gauged by line ratios and the full\nSLEDs.

A robust one-shot learning approach for symbol\nrecognition i.e., localization followed by classification, would therefore go a\nlong way towards this goal. Our method works by sampling pixels sequentially\nalong the different contour boundaries in the image. These sampled points form\npaths which are used in the prototypical line diagram to construct a graph that\ncaptures the structure of the contours. Subsequently, the prototypical graphs\nare fed into a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) which is\ntrained to classify graphs into one of the given symbol classes. Further, we\nappend embeddings from a Resnet-34 network which is trained on symbol images\ncontaining sampled points to make the classification network more robust.\nSince, many symbols in P&ID are structurally very similar to each other, we\nutilize Arcface loss during DGCNN training which helps in maximizing symbol\nclass separability by producing highly discriminative embeddings. The images\nconsist of components attached on the pipeline (straight line). The sampled\npoints segregated around the symbol regions are used for the classification\ntask. The proposed pipeline, named OSSR-PID, is fast and gives outstanding\nperformance for recognition of symbols on a synthetic dataset of 100 P&ID\ndiagrams.

A size of the region, in which the gravitational\ndynamics was observed was controlled by an absolute value of the Gauss-Bonnet\ncoupling. Dependencies of characteristics of the forming black holes on the\ndilatonic and Gauss-Bonnet parameters turned out to be similar in the case of\nblack hole masses and radii as well as their time of formation in terms of\nretarded time. In the cases of masses and radii minima were observed, while in\nthe remaining case a maximum existed. The electric charge of the emerging black\nholes possessed a maximum when measured versus the dilatonic coupling constant\nand was strictly decreasing with the Gauss-Bonnet coupling. All the\ncharacteristics changed monotonically with the field self-interaction\nstrengths. The times of formation and charges of black holes decreased, while\nmasses and radii increased with the self-interaction strengths of the dynamical\nfields.

The original lottery ticket hypothesis performs\npruning and weight resetting after training convergence, exposing it to the\nproblem of forgotten learning knowledge and potential high cost of training.\nTherefore, we propose a strategy that combines the idea of neural network\nstructure search with a pruning algorithm to alleviate this problem. This\nalgorithm searches and extends the network structure on existing winning ticket\nsub-network to producing new winning ticket recursively. This allows the\ntraining and pruning process to continue without compromising performance. A\nnew winning ticket sub-network with deeper network structure, better\ngeneralization ability and better test performance can be obtained in this\nrecursive manner. This method can solve: the difficulty of training or\nperformance degradation of the sub-networks after pruning, the forgetting of\nthe weights of the original lottery ticket hypothesis and the difficulty of\ngenerating winning ticket sub-network when the final network structure is not\ngiven. We validate this strategy on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. And after\nrelating it to similar biological phenomena and relevant lottery ticket\nhypothesis studies in recent years, we will further propose a new hypothesis to\ndiscuss which factors that can keep a network juvenile, i.e., those possible\nfactors that influence the learning potential or generalization performance of\na neural network during training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 18:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

Traditionally, the\nFIA program has relied on sample-based approaches -- permanent plot networks\nand associated design-based estimators -- to estimate forest variables across\nlarge geographic areas and long periods of time. These approaches generally\noffer unbiased inference on large domains but fail to provide reliable\nestimates for small domains due to low sample sizes. Rising demand for small\ndomain estimates will thus require the FIA program to adopt non-traditional\nestimation approaches that are capable of delivering defensible estimates of\nforest variables at increased spatial and temporal resolution, without the\nexpense of collecting additional field data. In light of this challenge, the\ndevelopment of small area estimation (SAE) methods for FIA data has become an\nactive and highly productive area of research. Yet, SAE methods remain\ndifficult to apply to FIA data, due in part to the complex data structures and\ninventory design used by the FIA program. Thus, we argue that a new suite of\nestimation tools (i.e., software) will be required to accommodate shifts in\ndemand for inference on large geographic areas and long time periods to\ninference on small spatial and/or temporal domains. Herein, we present rFIA, an\nopen-source R package designed to increase the accessibility of FIA data, as\none such tool.

The\ngravity model is a widely-used approach for estimating and predicting\npopulation flows in urban mobility networks, assuming the scale-free property.\nPrior studies have reported good performance results for the gravity model at\ncertain levels of aggregation. However, the characteristics of urban mobility\nnetworks might vary depending on the spatial and temporal resolutions of data.\nHence, the sensitivity of gravity model performance to variation in the level\nof aggregation of data and the temporal and spatial scale of urban mobility\nnetworks needs to be examined.

However, behavioral economics has provided\nstrong empirical evidence of irrational choice behavior, such as halo effects,\nthat are incompatible with this framework. Models belonging to the Random\nUtility Maximization family may therefore not accurately capture such\nirrational behavior. Hence, more general choice models, overcoming such\nlimitations, have been proposed. However, the flexibility of such models comes\nat the price of increased risk of overfitting. As such, estimating such models\nremains a challenge. In this work, we propose an estimation method for the\nrecently proposed Generalized Stochastic Preference choice model, which\nsubsumes the family of Random Utility Maximization models and is capable of\ncapturing halo effects. Specifically, we show how to use partially-ranked\npreferences to efficiently model rational and irrational customer types from\ntransaction data. Our estimation procedure is based on column generation, where\nrelevant customer types are efficiently extracted by expanding a tree-like data\nstructure containing the customer behaviors. Further, we propose a new\ndominance rule among customer types whose effect is to prioritize low orders of\ninteractions among products. An extensive set of experiments assesses the\npredictive accuracy of the proposed approach.

We simulated extremely long (10,000$\\tau$) AGN light curves using DRW,\nand then measured the variance and the mean of short light curves spanning\n1-1000$\\tau$.

This work presents our\ninitial step to tackle this challenge via the concept of wheeled humanoid robot\nlocomotion teleoperation by body tilt. Specifically, we developed a\nforce-feedback-capable whole-body human-machine interface (HMI), and designed a\nforce feedback mapping and two teleoperation mappings that map the human's body\ntilt to the robot's velocity or acceleration. We compared the two mappings and\nstudied the force feedback's effect via an experiment, where seven human\nsubjects teleoperated a simulated robot with the HMI to perform dynamic target\ntracking tasks. The experimental results suggest that all subjects accomplished\nthe tasks with both mappings after practice, and the force feedback improved\ntheir performances. However, the subjects exhibited two distinct teleoperation\nstyles, which benefited from the force feedback differently. Moreover, the\nforce feedback affected the subjects' preferences on the teleoperation\nmappings, though most subjects performed better with the velocity mapping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 20:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

Focusing on the case of music\nstreaming, we analyze the complete listening history of about 9k users over one\nyear and demonstrate that there is no blanket answer to the intertwinement of\nrecommendation use and consumption diversity: it depends on users. First we\ncompute for each user the relative importance of different access modes within\ntheir listening history, introducing a trichotomy distinguishing so-called\n`organic' use from algorithmic and editorial guidance. We thereby identify four\ncategories of users. We then focus on two scales related to content diversity,\nboth in terms of dispersion -- how much users consume the same content\nrepeatedly -- and popularity -- how popular is the content they consume. We\nshow that the two types of recommendation offered by music platforms --\nalgorithmic and editorial -- may drive the consumption of more or less diverse\ncontent in opposite directions, depending also strongly on the type of users.\nFinally, we compare users' streaming histories with the music programming of a\nselection of popular French radio stations during the same period. While radio\nprograms are usually more tilted toward repetition than users' listening\nhistories, they often program more songs from less popular artists. On the\nwhole, our results highlight the nontrivial effects of platform-mediated\nrecommendation on consumption, and lead us to speak of `filter niches' rather\nthan `filter bubbles'.

Our results bring the inhomogeneous theory almost in line with the\nhomogeneous theory, where it is known by a result of Beresnevich and Velani\n(2010) that monotonicity is not required when $nm>1$. That result resolved a\nconjecture of Beresnevich, Bernik, Dodson, and Velani (2009), and our work\nresolves almost every case of the natural inhomogeneous generalization of that\nconjecture.

The LPE-BC is\na high-SNR approximation of the fading Gaussian BC recently proposed by Tse and\nYates, who characterized the capacity region for any number of users and any\nnumber of layers when there is no COF. This paper provides a comparative\noverview of this channel model along the following lines: First, inner and\nouter bounds to the capacity region (set of achievable rates with backlogged\narrivals) are presented: a) a new outer bound based on the idea of the\nphysically degraded broadcast channel, and b) an inner bound of the LPE-BC with\nCOF for the case of two users and any number of layers. Next, an inner bound on\nthe stability region (set of exogenous arrival rates for which packet arrival\nqueues are stable) for the same model is derived. The capacity region inner\nbound generalizes past results for the two-user erasure BC, which is a special\ncase of the LPE-BC with COF with only one layer. The novelty lies in the use of\ninter-user and inter-layer network coding retransmissions (for those packets\nthat have only been received by the unintended user), where each random linear\ncombination may involve packets intended for any user originally sent on any of\nthe layers. For the case of $K = 2$ users and $Q \\geq 1$ layers, the inner\nbounds to the capacity region and the stability region coincide; both\nstrategically employ the novel retransmission protocol. For the case of $Q = 2$\nlayers, sufficient conditions are derived by Fourier-Motzkin elimination for\nthe inner bound on the stability region to coincide with the capacity outer\nbound, thus showing that in those cases the capacity and stability regions\ncoincide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 21:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

In a Bayesian setting the optimal\nestimator is given by the prior-dependent conditional mean. In a frequentist\nsetting various shrinkage methods were developed over the last century. The\nframework of empirical Bayes, put forth by Robbins (1956), combines Bayesian\nand frequentist mindsets by postulating that the parameters are independent but\nwith an unknown prior and aims to use a fully data-driven estimator to compete\nwith the Bayesian oracle that knows the true prior. The central figure of merit\nis the regret, namely, the total excess risk over the Bayes risk in the worst\ncase (over the priors). Although this paradigm was introduced more than 60\nyears ago, little is known about the asymptotic scaling of the optimal regret\nin the nonparametric setting.\n  We show that for the Poisson model with compactly supported and\nsubexponential priors, the optimal regret scales as $\\Theta((\\frac{\\log\nn}{\\log\\log n})^2)$ and $\\Theta(\\log^3 n)$, respectively, both attained by the\noriginal estimator of Robbins.

However,\nmost existing methods do not ensure that the physics, such as balance laws\n(e.g., mass, momentum, energy conservation), are constrained. Some recent works\n(e.g., physics-informed neural networks) softly enforce physics constraints by\nincluding partial differential equation (PDE)-based loss functions but need\nre-discretization of the PDEs using auto-differentiation. Training these neural\nnets on observational data showed that one could solve forward and inverse\nproblems in one shot. They evaluate the state variables and the parameters in a\nPDE. This re-discretization of PDEs is not necessarily an attractive option for\ndomain scientists that work with physics-based codes that have been developed\nfor decades with sophisticated discretization techniques to solve complex\nprocess models and advanced equations of state. This paper proposes a physics\nconstrained machine learning framework, AdjointNet, allowing domain scientists\nto embed their physics code in neural network training workflows. This\nembedding ensures that physics is constrained everywhere in the domain.\nAdditionally, the mathematical properties such as consistency, stability, and\nconvergence vital to the numerical solution of a PDE are still satisfied. We\nshow that the proposed AdjointNet framework can be used for parameter\nestimation (and uncertainty quantification by extension) and experimental\ndesign using active learning. The applicability of our framework is\ndemonstrated for four flow cases. Results show that AdjointNet-based inversion\ncan estimate process model parameters with reasonable accuracy.

The square lattice\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet is one of the first models that was approached with\nthe Schwinger boson theory.

The driving mode of\nturbulence is parameterized by $b$, which relates the width of the gas density\nPDF to the turbulent Mach number; $b\\approx 1/3$, $1$, and $0.4$ correspond to\ndriving that is solenoidal, compressive, and a natural mixture of the two,\nrespectively. In this work, we use high-resolution (sub-pc) ALMA $^{12}$CO ($J$\n= $2-1$), $^{13}$CO ($J$ = $2-1$), and C$^{18}$O ($J$ = $2-1$) observations of\nfilamentary molecular clouds in the star-forming region N159E (the Papillon\nNebula) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to provide the first measurement of\nturbulence driving parameter in an extragalactic region. We use a non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) analysis of the CO isotopologues to construct\na gas density PDF, which we find to be largely log-normal in shape with some\nintermittent features indicating deviations from lognormality. We find that the\nwidth of the log-normal part of the density PDF is comparable to the supersonic\nturbulent Mach number, resulting in $b \\approx 0.9$. This implies that the\ndriving mode of turbulence in N159E is primarily compressive. We speculate that\nthe compressive turbulence could have been powered by gravo-turbulent\nfragmentation of the molecular gas, or due to compression powered by H I flows\nthat led to the development of the molecular filaments observed by ALMA in the\nregion. Our analysis can be easily applied to study the nature of turbulence\ndriving in resolved star-forming regions in the local as well as the\nhigh-redshift Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 00:49:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 12:33:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

First,\nwe employ deep neural networks to approximate the drift and diffusion terms of\nthe SDE by solving appropriate supervised learning tasks. Subsequently, we\nsolve a steady-state Fokker-Plank equation associated with the estimated drift\nand diffusion coefficients with a neural-network-based least-squares method. We\nestablish the convergence of the proposed scheme under appropriate mathematical\nassumptions, accounting for the generalization errors induced by regressing the\ndrift and diffusion coefficients, and the PDE solvers. This theoretical study\nrelies on a recent perturbation theory of Markov chain result that shows a\nlinear dependence of the density estimation to the error in estimating the\ndrift term, and generalization error results of nonparametric regression and of\nPDE regression solution obtained with neural-network models. The effectiveness\nof this method is reflected by numerical simulations of a two-dimensional\nStudent's t distribution and a 20-dimensional Langevin dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 01:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

Objective: We wanted to study more\ncomprehensively how practitioners emotionally respond to RCs. Method: We\nconducted a world-wide survey with the participation of 201 software\npractitioners. In our survey, we used the Job-related Affective Well-being\nScale (JAWS) and open-ended questions to capture participants emotions when\nhandling RCs in their work and query about the different circumstances when\nthey feel these emotions. We used a combined approach of statistical analysis,\nJAWS, and Socio-Technical Grounded Theory (STGT) for Data Analysis to analyse\nour survey data. Findings: We identified (1) emotional responses to RCs, i.e.,\nthe most common emotions felt by practitioners when handling RCs; (2) different\nstimuli -- such as the RC, the practitioner, team, manager, customer -- that\ntrigger these emotions through their own different characteristics; (3)emotion\ndynamics, i.e., the changes in emotions during the project and RC handling life\ncycles; (4) distinct events where particular emotions are triggered:project\nmilestones, and RC stages; (5) and time related matters that regulate the\nemotion dynamics. Conclusion: Practitioners are not pleased with receiving RCs\nall the time. Last minute RCs introduced closer to a deadline especially\nviolate emotional well-being of practitioners.

LEASH works by starving maliciously behaving threads at runtime,\nproviding insufficient time and resources to carry out an attack.

However, existing multilingual machine translation models\nface a severe challenge: imbalance. As a result, the translation performance of\ndifferent languages in multilingual translation models are quite different. We\nargue that this imbalance problem stems from the different learning\ncompetencies of different languages. Therefore, we focus on balancing the\nlearning competencies of different languages and propose Competence-based\nCurriculum Learning for Multilingual Machine Translation, named CCL-M.\nSpecifically, we firstly define two competencies to help schedule the high\nresource languages (HRLs) and the low resource languages: 1) Self-evaluated\nCompetence, evaluating how well the language itself has been learned; and 2)\nHRLs-evaluated Competence, evaluating whether an LRL is ready to be learned\naccording to HRLs' Self-evaluated Competence. Based on the above competencies,\nwe utilize the proposed CCL-M algorithm to gradually add new languages into the\ntraining set in a curriculum learning manner. Furthermore, we propose a novel\ncompetenceaware dynamic balancing sampling strategy for better selecting\ntraining samples in multilingual training.

It aims at learning a mapping from the input domain to an\nembedding space, where semantically similar objects are located nearby and\ndissimilar objects far from another. The target similarity on the training data\nis defined by user in form of ground-truth class labels. However, while the\nembedding space learns to mimic the user-provided similarity on the training\ndata, it should also generalize to novel categories not seen during training.\nBesides user-provided groundtruth training labels, a lot of additional visual\nfactors (such as viewpoint changes or shape peculiarities) exist and imply\ndifferent notions of similarity between objects, affecting the generalization\non the images unseen during training. However, existing approaches usually\ndirectly learn a single embedding space on all available training data,\nstruggling to encode all different types of relationships, and do not\ngeneralize well. We propose to build a more expressive representation by\njointly splitting the embedding space and the data hierarchically into smaller\nsub-parts. We successively focus on smaller subsets of the training data,\nreducing its variance and learning a different embedding subspace for each data\nsubset. Moreover, the subspaces are learned jointly to cover not only the\nintricacies, but the breadth of the data as well. Only after that, we build the\nfinal embedding from the subspaces in the conquering stage.

While in some scenarios, the source samples are not available for the\ntarget domain due to data privacy and safety. To overcome this challenge,\nrecently, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) has attracted the attention of\nresearchers, where both a trained source model and unlabeled target samples are\ngiven. Existing SFDA methods either adopt a pseudo-label based strategy or\ngenerate more samples. However, these methods do not explicitly reduce the\ndistribution shift across domains, which is the key to a good adaptation.\nAlthough there are no source samples available, fortunately, we find that some\ntarget samples are very similar to the source domain and can be used to\napproximate the source domain. This approximated domain is denoted as the\npseudo-source domain. In this paper, inspired by this observation, we propose a\nnovel method based on the pseudo-source domain. The proposed method firstly\ngenerates and augments the pseudo-source domain, and then employs distribution\nalignment with four novel losses based on pseudo-label based strategy. Among\nthem, a domain adversarial loss is introduced between the pseudo-source domain\nthe remaining target domain to reduce the distribution shift.

A possible\ngeneration mechanism of SBs is through magnetic reconnection between open and\nclosed magnetic flux near the solar surface, termed interchange reconnection\nthat leads to the ejection of flux ropes (FR) into the solar wind. Observations\nalso suggest that SBs undergo merging, consistent with a FR picture of these\nstructures. The role of FRs merging in controlling the structure of SB in the\nsolar wind is explored through direct observations, through analytic analysis,\nand numerical simulations. Analytic analysis reveals key features of the\nstructure of FR and their scaling with the heliocentric distance R that are\nconsistent with observations and that reveal the critical role of merging in\ncontrolling the SB structure. FR merging is shown to be energetically favorable\nto reduce the strength of the wrapping magnetic field and drive the observed\nelongation of SBs. A further consequence is the resulting dominance of the\naxial magnetic field within SBs that leads to the characteristic sharp rotation\nof the magnetic field into the axial direction at the SB boundary that is\nrevealed in observations. Finally, the radial scaling of the SB area in the FR\nmodel of SBs suggests that the observational probability of SB identification\nshould be insensitive to R, which is consistent with the most recent\nstatistical analysis of SB observations from PSP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 03:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 17:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Distracted or\nanomalous driving behaviors are deviations from 'normal' driving that need to\nbe identified correctly to alert the driver. However, these driving behaviors\ndo not comprise one specific type of driving style and their distribution can\nbe different during the training and test phases of a classifier. We formulate\nthis problem as a supervised contrastive learning approach to learn a visual\nrepresentation to detect normal, and seen and unseen anomalous driving\nbehaviors. We made a change to the standard contrastive loss function to adjust\nthe similarity of negative pairs to aid the optimization. Normally, in a (self)\nsupervised contrastive framework, the projection head layers are omitted during\nthe test phase as the encoding layers are considered to contain general visual\nrepresentative information.

Then, for the specific class of desired behaviors\nstudied, we leverage these bounds to lower bound the minimum true system\nrobustness, without directly testing the true system. Finally, we compare a\nhigh-fidelity ROS simulator of a Segway, with a significantly noisier version\nof itself, and show that our probabilistic verification bounds are indeed\nsatisfied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 04:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

However, simulating sensors, including tactile sensors, has\nbeen a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we propose Taxim, a realistic\nand high-speed simulation model for a vision-based tactile sensor, GelSight. A\nGelSight sensor uses a piece of soft elastomer as the medium of contact and\nembeds optical structures to capture the deformation of the elastomer, which\ninfers the geometry and forces applied at the contact surface. We propose an\nexample-based method for simulating GelSight: we simulate the optical response\nto the deformation with a polynomial look-up table. This table maps the\ndeformed geometries to pixel intensity sampled by the embedded camera. In order\nto simulate the surface markers' motion that is caused by the surface stretch\nof the elastomer, we apply the linear elastic deformation theory and the\nsuperposition principle. The simulation model is calibrated with less than 100\ndata points from a real sensor. The example-based approach enables the model to\neasily migrate to other GelSight sensors or its variations. To the best of our\nknowledge, our simulation framework is the first to incorporate marker motion\nfield simulation that derives from elastomer deformation together with the\noptical simulation, creating a comprehensive and computationally efficient\ntactile simulation framework. Experiments reveal that our optical simulation\nhas the lowest pixel-wise intensity errors compared to prior work and can run\nonline with CPU computing.

We evaluate the viability of our approach using a\nproof-of-concept smart building system model which contains a variety of\nreal-world IoT devices and potential vulnerabilities. Our evaluation of the\nproposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness in terms of automatically\npredicting the vulnerability metrics of new vulnerabilities with more than 90%\naccuracy, on average, and identifying the most vulnerable attack paths within\nan IoT network.

It involves a Bach/Stravinsky game\nof deference in a group, in which people on each turn can either invest with\nanother player or hope someone invests with them. Players who receive\ninvestment capital are able to gamble for payoffs from a central pool which\nthen can be shared back with those who invested (but a portion of it may be\nkept, including all of it). The bigger gambles (people with more investors) get\nbigger payoffs.

One of our main results says that for\nevery sufficiently large integer $k$ there exists a prime number that can be\nrepresented as the sum of $k$ different and non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.\nThis property is closely related to, and based on, a prime number theorem for\ncertain morphic sequences. The proof of such a prime number theorem, combined\nwith a corresponding local result, is the central contribution of this paper,\nfrom which we derive the result stated in the beginning. Problems of this type\nhave been discussed intensively in the context of the base-$q$ expansion. The\nGelfond problems (1968/1969), and the Sarnak conjecture, were the driving\nforces of this development. Mauduit and Rivat resolved the question on the sum\nof digits of prime numbers (2010) and the sum of digits of squares (2009), thus\nleaving open only part of the third Gelfond problem. Later the second author\n(2017) proved Sarnak's conjecture for all automatic sequences, which are based\non the q-ary expansion of integers, and which generalize the sum-of-digits\nfunction in base $q$ considerably. In order to obtain corresponding results for\nFibonacci numbers, we have to extend Mauduit and Rivat's method considerably.\nIn fact, we are departing significantly from this method, proving the statement\nthat $\\exp(2\\pi i \\vartheta\\mathsf z(n))$ has \\emph{level of distribution} $1$\n(here $\\mathsf z(n)$ is the number of Fibonacci numbers needed to write $n$ as\ntheir sum). This latter result forms an essential part of our treatment of the\noccurring sums of type $\\textrm I$ and $\\textrm{II}$ and uses Gowers norms\nrelated to $\\mathsf z(n)$ as a central technical tool. The appearance of Gowers\nnorms in our method is intimately tied to the iterated application of a new\ngeneralization of van der Corput's inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 07:18:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 14:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Although extremely relevant and important, only limited\nstudies are available in the open literature on the effects of coolant\nsubcooling in heat-generating porous media and hence, this requires a detailed\nanalysis. The analysis is carried out using a developed computational model of\nmultiphase fluid flow through clear fluid and porous media considering the\nrelevant heat transfer and mass transfer phenomena. Results suggest that the\nqualitative nature of boiling heat transfer from the heat-generating porous\nbody, with subcooled coolants, remain similar to that observed with a saturated\ncoolant. Quantitative differences are, however, observed as a result of\nsolid-liquid convective heat transfer, and competing mechanisms of boiling and\ncondensation heat transfer, when subcooled liquid coolant is present. It is\nobserved that a substantially larger heating power density is required - as\ncoolant subcooling is increased - for achieving the same temperature rise in\nthe porous body. Dryout power density at different coolant subcooling is also\nobserved to follow a similar trend. The thermal energy removal limit is, hence,\nobserved to be substantially enhanced in presence of subcooled coolants.\nFurther, the dryout region within the porous body is observed to gradually\nshift towards its interior as the coolant subcooling is increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 07:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

Previous methods often adopt class re-balanced training\nstrategies to effectively alleviate the imbalance issue, but might be a risk of\nover-fitting tail classes. The recent decoupling method overcomes over-fitting\nissues by using a multi-stage training scheme, yet, it is still incapable of\ncapturing tail class information in the feature learning stage. In this paper,\nwe show that soft label can serve as a powerful solution to incorporate label\ncorrelation into a multi-stage training scheme for long-tailed recognition. The\nintrinsic relation between classes embodied by soft labels turns out to be\nhelpful for long-tailed recognition by transferring knowledge from head to tail\nclasses.\n  Specifically, we propose a conceptually simple yet particularly effective\nmulti-stage training scheme, termed as Self Supervised to Distillation (SSD).\nThis scheme is composed of two parts.

Traditionally, policy synthesis techniques are proposed such that a\ntotal expected cost or reward is minimized or maximized. However, optimality in\nthe total expected cost sense is only reasonable if system behavior in the\nlarge number of runs is of interest, which has limited the use of such policies\nin practical mission-critical scenarios, wherein large deviations from the\nexpected behavior may lead to mission failure. In this paper, we consider the\nproblem of designing policies for MDPs and POMDPs with objectives and\nconstraints in terms of dynamic coherent risk measures, which we refer to as\nthe constrained risk-averse problem. For MDPs, we reformulate the problem into\na infsup problem via the Lagrangian framework and propose an optimization-based\nmethod to synthesize Markovian policies. For MDPs, we demonstrate that the\nformulated optimization problems are in the form of difference convex programs\n(DCPs) and can be solved by the disciplined convex-concave programming (DCCP)\nframework. We show that these results generalize linear programs for\nconstrained MDPs with total discounted expected costs and constraints. For\nPOMDPs, we show that, if the coherent risk measures can be defined as a Markov\nrisk transition mapping, an infinite-dimensional optimization can be used to\ndesign Markovian belief-based policies. For stochastic finite-state controllers\n(FSCs), we show that the latter optimization simplifies to a\n(finite-dimensional) DCP and can be solved by the DCCP framework.

We propose to segment a whole block of echo signal evenly into\nsub-blocks; adjacent ones are allowed to overlap.

In the proposed method, we use the scaling\nof the symmetric near-field matrix to develop a diagonally dominant overall\nmatrix to enable a power series solution. Left and right block scaling\ncoefficients are required for scaling near-field blocks to diagonal blocks\nusing Schur's complement method. However,only the right-hand scaling\ncoefficients are computed for symmetric near-field matrix leading to saving of\ncomputation time and memory. Due to symmetric property, the left side-block\nscaling coefficients are just the transpose of the right-scaling blocks. Next,\nthe near-field blocks are replaced by scaled near-field diagonal blocks. Now\nthe scaled near-field blocks in combination with far-field and scaling\ncoefficients are subjected to power series solution terminating after only two\nterms. As all the operations are performed on the near-field blocks, the\ncomplexity of scaling coefficient computation is retained as O(N). The power\nseries solution only involves the matrix-vector product of the far-field,\nscaling coefficients blocks, and inverse of scaled near-field blocks. Hence,\nthe solution cost remains O(NlogN). Several numerical results are presented to\nvalidate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed numerical method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 09:30:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 18:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

The two dialogue modes can potentially be\nintertwined together seamlessly in the same conversation, as easily done by a\nfriendly human assistant. Such ability is desirable in conversational agents,\nas the integration makes them more accessible and useful. Our paper addresses\nthis problem of fusing TODs and ODDs in multi-turn dialogues. Based on the\npopular TOD dataset MultiWOZ, we build a new dataset FusedChat, by rewriting\nthe existing TOD turns and adding new ODD turns. This procedure constructs\nconversation sessions containing exchanges from both dialogue modes. It\nfeatures inter-mode contextual dependency, i.e., the dialogue turns from the\ntwo modes depend on each other. Rich dependency patterns including co-reference\nand ellipsis are features. The new dataset, with 60k new human-written ODD\nturns and 5k re-written TOD turns, offers a benchmark to test a dialogue\nmodel's ability to perform inter-mode conversations. This is a more challenging\ntask since the model has to determine the appropriate dialogue mode and\ngenerate the response based on the inter-mode context. But such models would\nbetter mimic human-level conversation capabilities. We evaluate baseline models\non this task, including classification-based two-stage models and two-in-one\nfused models.

Most state-of-the-art methods adopt an\nencoder-decoder framework with attention mechanism, which generates text\nautoregressively from left to right. Despite the convincing performance, the\nspeed is limited because of the one-by-one decoding strategy. As opposed to\nautoregressive models, non-autoregressive models predict the results in\nparallel with a much shorter inference time, but the accuracy falls behind the\nautoregressive counterpart considerably.

Model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been shown to\ndynamically learn the relocating policy by actively interacting with the\nintrinsic dynamics in large-scale ride-hailing systems. However, the issues of\nsparse reward signals and unbalanced demand and supply distribution place\ncritical barriers in developing effective DRL models. Conventional exploration\nstrategy (e.g., the $\\epsilon$-greedy) may barely work under such an\nenvironment because of dithering in low-demand regions distant from\nhigh-revenue regions. This study proposes the deep relocating option policy\n(DROP) that supervises vehicle agents to escape from oversupply areas and\neffectively relocate to potentially underserved areas. We propose to learn the\nLaplacian embedding of a time-expanded relocation graph, as an approximation\nrepresentation of the system relocation policy. The embedding generates\ntask-agnostic signals, which in combination with task-dependent signals,\nconstitute the pseudo-reward function for generating DROPs. We present a\nhierarchical learning framework that trains a high-level relocation policy and\na set of low-level DROPs. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated\nusing a custom-built high-fidelity simulator with real-world trip record data.\nWe report that DROP significantly improves baseline models with 15.7% more\nhourly revenue and can effectively resolve the dithering issue in low-demand\nareas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 10:20:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

More specifically, we introduce a dual attack\nframework, which contains a Pay No Attention (PNA) attack and a PatchOut\nattack, to improve the transferability of adversarial samples across different\nViTs. We show that skipping the gradients of attention during backpropagation\ncan generate adversarial examples with high transferability.

The subjective experience of turn speed did not correlate\nwith either the SSQ scores or comfort, even though people often mentioned\nturning speed as a source of discomfort in the open-ended questions. Through\nexploring the open-ended answers more carefully, a possible reason is that the\nlength and lack of predictability also play a large role in making people\nobserve turns as uncomfortable.

The renormalizations enter the perturbation theory via self-consistent\nevaluations of one-particle and two-particle Green functions. The one-particle\nself-consistency is discussed within the Baym-Kadanoff construction. We point\nto an inherent dichotomy of the Baym-Kadanoff approach in the relation between\none and two-particle Green functions. They are the Schwinger-Dyson equation,\ndirectly derived from the generating Luttinger-Ward functional, and the Ward\nidentity. The latter imposes a severe restriction on the two-particle\nirreducible vertex and is not guaranteed in the Baym-Kadanoff approach. No\napproximate theory is capable to obey both relations. I further discuss the\ntwo-particle approach with two-particle renormalizations that offers a way to\nreconcile the Schwinger-Dyson equation and the Ward identity. The two-particle\nirreducible vertex from the critical Bethe-Salpeter equation becomes a\ngenerating functional in the two-particle renormalization of the perturbation\ntheory. The irreducible vertex is used in the Ward identity to determine the\norder parameter beyond the critical point and in the Bethe-Salpeter equation\nrepresenting the vertex of the Schwinger-Dyson equation to determine the\nspectral self-energy in such a way that the thermodynamic critical behavior\nfrom both equations is qualitatively the same.

The goal is to decide where to\nlocate the two facilities, so as to (a) incentivize the agents to truthfully\nreport their preferences, and (b) achieve a good approximation of the minimum\ntotal (social) cost or the maximum cost among all agents. For both objectives,\nwe design deterministic strategyproof mechanisms with approximation ratios that\nsignificantly outperform the state-of-the-art, and complement these results\nwith (almost) tight lower bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 12:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

One-dimensional (1-D) EEG signal is yet easily\ndisturbed by certain artifacts (a.k.a. noise) due to the high temporal\nresolution. Thus, it is crucial to remove the noise in received EEG signal.\nRecently, deep learning-based EEG signal denoising approaches have achieved\nimpressive performance compared with traditional ones. It is well known that\nthe characteristics of self-similarity (including non-local and local ones) of\ndata (e.g., natural images and time-domain signals) are widely leveraged for\ndenoising. However, existing deep learning-based EEG signal denoising methods\nignore either the non-local self-similarity (e.g., 1-D convolutional neural\nnetwork) or local one (e.g., fully connected network and recurrent neural\nnetwork). To address this issue, we propose a novel 1-D EEG signal denoising\nnetwork with 2-D transformer, namely EEGDnet. Specifically, we comprehensively\ntake into account the non-local and local self-similarity of EEG signal through\nthe transformer module. By fusing non-local self-similarity in self-attention\nblocks and local self-similarity in feed forward blocks, the negative impact\ncaused by noises and outliers can be reduced significantly. Extensive\nexperiments show that, compared with other state-of-the-art models, EEGDnet\nachieves much better performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative\nmetrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 12:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

Using tree\ngraphs such as the $k$-coordinated Bethe lattice ${\\cal B}(k)$ and a hypertree\ncalled the $(k,n)$-hyper-Bethe lattice ${\\cal HB}(k,n)$ consisting of\n$k$-coordinated hyperlinks (defined by $n$ sites), we construct\nmultidimensional arboreal arenas such as ${\\cal B}(k_1) \\square {\\cal B}(k_2)$\nby the notion of a graph Cartesian product $\\square$. We study various quantum\nsystems such as the ${\\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge theory, generalized quantum Ising\nmodels (GQIM), the fractonic X-cube model, and related X-cube gauge theory\ndefined on these arenas. Even the simplest ${\\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge theory on a 2d\narboreal arena is fractonic -- the monopole excitation is immobile. The X-cube\nmodel on a 3d arboreal arena is fully fractonic, all multipoles are rendered\nimmobile. We obtain variational ground state phase diagrams of these gauge\ntheories. Further, we find an intriguing class of dualities in arboreal arenas\nas illustrated by the ${\\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge theory defined on ${\\cal B}(k_1)\n\\square {\\cal B}(k_2)$ being dual to a GQIM defined on ${\\cal HB}(2,k_1)\n\\square {\\cal HB}(2,k_2)$. Finally, we discuss different classes of topological\nand fracton orders on arboreal arenas.

In multimedia analysis, domain adaptation\nstudies the problem of cross-domain knowledge transfer from a label rich source\ndomain to a label scarce target domain, thus potentially alleviates the\nannotation requirement for deep learning models. However, we find that\ncontemporary domain adaptation methods for cross-domain image understanding\nperform poorly when source domain is noisy. Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation\n(WSDA) studies the domain adaptation problem under the scenario where source\ndata can be noisy. Prior methods on WSDA remove noisy source data and align the\nmarginal distribution across domains without considering the fine-grained\nsemantic structure in the embedding space, which have the problem of class\nmisalignment, e.g., features of cats in the target domain might be mapped near\nfeatures of dogs in the source domain.

We report on the\nidentification of several lopsided galactic bars in the Illustris TNG100\nsimulation found among a sample of elongated bar-like galaxies studied in the\npast. The bars show a clear asymmetry in the face-on view, which is in the\nshape of a footprint. We measured the evolution of the different parameters of\nthe bars' shape and asymmetry as a function of time and find that the asymmetry\nis preserved for a few Gyr. It can grow together with a bar or appear later,\nafter bar formation. We considered two scenarios leading to the formation of\nlopsided bars using controlled simulations. In the first, a Milky Way-like\ngalaxy interacts with a massive companion placed on a radial orbit in the plane\nof the disk and perpendicular to the orientation of the bar at the time of the\nfirst passage. In the second, the galaxy initially has an off-center disk and\nthe growth of the bar and its asymmetry is more similar to the one found in\nIllustrisTNG galaxies, where it is also preceded by the presence of an\nasymmetric disk. It is thus possible that lopsided bars are born in lopsided\ndisks, although in some cases, the time difference between the occurrence of\nthe asymmetry in the two components is quite large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 14:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

Among many options of models, we\npropose the generative model and the inference model for variational learning\nof the end-to-end TOD system, both as auto-regressive language models based on\nGPT-2, which can be further trained over a mix of labeled and unlabeled dialog\ndata in a semi-supervised manner. Variational training of VLS-GPT is both\nstatistically and computationally more challenging than previous variational\nlearning works for sequential latent variable models, which use turn-level\nfirst-order Markovian. The inference model in VLS-GPT is non-Markovian due to\nthe use of the Transformer architecture. In this work, we establish Recursive\nMonte Carlo Approximation (RMCA) to the variational objective with\nnon-Markovian inference model and prove its unbiasedness. Further, we develop\nthe computational strategy of sampling-then-forward-computation to realize\nRMCA, which successfully overcomes the memory explosion issue of using GPT in\nvariational learning and speeds up training. Semi-supervised TOD experiments\nare conducted on two benchmark multi-domain datasets of different languages -\nMultiWOZ2.1 and CrossWOZ.

Previously, neural network\ndesigns, such as Multitask Learning, have accounted for variations in emotional\nexpressions due to demographic and contextual factors.

In the present study, we propose the Nonparametric\nHierarchical Neural Network (NHNN), a lightweight hierarchical neural network\nmodel based on Bayesian nonparametric clustering. In comparison to Multitask\nLearning approaches, the proposed model does not require domain/task labels. In\nour experiments, the NHNN models generally outperform the models with similar\nlevels of complexity and state-of-the-art models in within-corpus and\ncross-corpus tests.

Among these methods, prompt tuning, which freezes PLMs and\nonly tunes soft prompts, provides an efficient and effective solution for\nadapting large-scale PLMs to downstream tasks. However, prompt tuning is yet to\nbe fully explored. In our pilot experiments, we find that prompt tuning\nperforms comparably with conventional full-model fine-tuning when downstream\ndata are sufficient, whereas it performs much worse under few-shot learning\nsettings, which may hinder the application of prompt tuning in practice. We\nattribute this low performance to the manner of initializing soft prompts.\nTherefore, in this work, we propose to pre-train prompts by adding soft prompts\ninto the pre-training stage to obtain a better initialization. We name this\nPre-trained Prompt Tuning framework \"PPT\". To ensure the generalization of PPT,\nwe formulate similar classification tasks into a unified task form and\npre-train soft prompts for this unified task. Extensive experiments show that\ntuning pre-trained prompts for downstream tasks can reach or even outperform\nfull-model fine-tuning under both full-data and few-shot settings.

Based on our findings, we\npropose a new segmentation framework, named UCTransNet (with a proposed CTrans\nmodule in U-Net), from the channel perspective with attention mechanism.\nSpecifically, the CTrans module is an alternate of the U-Net skip connections,\nwhich consists of a sub-module to conduct the multi-scale Channel Cross fusion\nwith Transformer (named CCT) and a sub-module Channel-wise Cross-Attention\n(named CCA) to guide the fused multi-scale channel-wise information to\neffectively connect to the decoder features for eliminating the ambiguity.\nHence, the proposed connection consisting of the CCT and CCA is able to replace\nthe original skip connection to solve the semantic gaps for an accurate\nautomatic medical image segmentation.

In such a scenario, the firmware delivery\nand update processes play a central role in ensuring firmware integrity.\nUnfortunately, several existing solutions lack proper integrity verification,\nexposing firmware to repackaging attacks. If this is not the case, they still\nrequire an external trust anchor (e.g., signing keys or secure storage\ntechnologies), which could limit their adoption in resource-constrained\nenvironments. In addition, state-of-the-art frameworks do not cope with the\nentire firmware production and delivery process, thereby failing to protect the\ncontent generated by the firmware producers through the whole supply chain. To\nmitigate such a problem, in this paper, we introduce PARIOT, a novel\nself-protecting scheme for IoT that allows the injection of integrity checks,\ncalled anti-tampering (AT) controls, directly into the firmware. The AT\ncontrols enable the runtime detection of repackaging attempts without needing\nexternal trust anchors or computationally expensive systems. PARIOT can be\nadopted on top of existing state-of-the-art solutions ensuring the widest\ncompatibility with current IoT ecosystems and update frameworks. Also, we have\nimplemented this scheme into PARIOTIC, a prototype to automatically protect\nC/C++ IoT firmware. The evaluation phase of 50 real-world firmware samples\ndemonstrated the feasibility of the proposed methodology and its robustness\nagainst practical repackaging attacks without altering the firmware behavior or\nsevere overheads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 15:23:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 10:39:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 15:53:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 15:57:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-26"}

Indeed, this has been confirmed empirically on systems\nthat utilise Bayesian approaches to dialogue belief tracking. However, such\nsystems consider only confidence estimates and have difficulty scaling to more\ncomplex settings. Neural dialogue systems, on the other hand, rarely take\nuncertainties into account. They are therefore overconfident in their decisions\nand less robust. Moreover, the performance of the tracking task is often\nevaluated in isolation, without consideration of its effect on the downstream\npolicy optimisation. We propose the use of different uncertainty measures in\nneural belief tracking. The effects of these measures on the downstream task of\npolicy optimisation are evaluated by adding selected measures of uncertainty to\nthe feature space of the policy and training policies through interaction with\na user simulator. Both human and simulated user results show that incorporating\nthese measures leads to improvements both of the performance and of the\nrobustness of the downstream dialogue policy. This highlights the importance of\ndeveloping neural dialogue belief trackers that take uncertainty into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 15:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

While the\nfinite element method (FEM) is a proven technique to effectively approximate\nsoft tissue deformation through biomechanical formulations, their degree of\nsuccess boils down to a trade-off between accuracy and speed. To circumvent\nthis problem, the most recent works in this domain have proposed leveraging\ndata-driven models obtained by training various machine learning algorithms --\ne.g., random forests, artificial neural networks (ANNs) -- with the results of\nfinite element analysis (FEA) to speed up tissue deformation approximations by\nprediction. These methods, however, do not account for the structure of the\nfinite element (FE) mesh during training that provides information on node\nconnectivities as well as the distance between them, which can aid with\napproximating tissue deformation based on the proximity of force load points\nwith the rest of the mesh nodes. Therefore, this work proposes a novel\nframework, PhysGNN, a data-driven model that approximates the solution of the\nFEM by leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs), which are capable of accounting\nfor the mesh structural information and inductive learning over unstructured\ngrids and complex topological structures. Empirically, we demonstrate that the\nproposed architecture, PhysGNN, promises accurate and fast soft tissue\ndeformation approximations, and is competitive with the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nalgorithms while promising enhanced computational feasibility, therefore\nsuitable for neurosurgical settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 15:43:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 17:40:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 17:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

One key problem is to allocate the limited slots in the feed to maximize\nthe overall revenue as well as improve user experience, which requires a good\nmodel for user preference. Instead of modeling the influence of individual\nitems on user behaviors, the arrangement signal models the influence of the\narrangement of items and may lead to a better allocation strategy. However,\nmost of previous strategies fail to model such a signal and therefore result in\nsuboptimal performance. In addition, the percentage of ads exposed (PAE) is an\nimportant indicator in ads allocation. Excessive PAE hurts user experience\nwhile too low PAE reduces platform revenue. Therefore, how to constrain the PAE\nwithin a certain range while keeping personalized recommendation under the PAE\nconstraint is a challenge. In this paper, we propose Cross Deep Q Network\n(Cross DQN) to extract the crucial arrangement signal by crossing the\nembeddings of different items and modeling the crossed sequence by\nmulti-channel attention.

To address such\nproblems, in this paper we propose MAYA, a Multi-grAnularitY Attack model to\neffectively generate high-quality adversarial samples with fewer queries to\nvictim models.

To account for the possibility of phenotypic\nheterogeneity, we extend to the case of a population continuously structured\nacross space, time and phenotype, where the latter determines variation in\nchemotactic responsiveness, proliferation rate, and the level of chemical\nenvironment modulation. The extended model considered here comprises a\nnon-local partial differential equation for the local phenotype distribution of\ncells which is coupled, through an integral term, with a differential equation\nfor the concentration of an attractant, which is sensed and degraded by the\ncells.
