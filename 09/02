The CML\nshows that a spiral arm is a type of traffic jam, and its motion is governed by\nboth a gas inflow into and outflow from the jam. In particular, we present a\nnew approach to simply and directly evaluating the disappearance of spiral\narms, called \"light-in and heavy-out\". It is based on the gas flow rate\ndifference between the light inflow and heavy outflow leading to the\ndisappearance of traffic jams. Furthermore, we propose an approximate formula\nfor the remaining lifetime of spiral arms, which is immediately derived from\nthe \"light-in and heavy-out\" approach without calculating their pattern speeds\nas in conventional differential rotation. The proposed formula is successfully\napplied to the CML simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 16:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 17:27:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

Various methods have\nbeen proposed to investigate the relationship between the variables in each\ndataset, e.g., matching and latent variable modeling. It is necessary to\nutilize these datasets as a single-source dataset with missing variables.\nExisting methods assume that the datasets to be integrated are acquired from\nthe same population or that the sampling depends on covariates.

For most slowly rotating asteroids (P > 12), no spin\nand shape model is available because of observation selection effects. This\nhampers determination of their thermal parameters and accurate sizes.\n  We continue our campaign in minimising selection effects among main belt\nasteroids. Our targets are slow rotators with low light-curve amplitudes. The\ngoal is to provide their scaled spin and shape models together with thermal\ninertia, albedo, and surface roughness to complete the statistics. Rich\nmulti-apparition datasets of dense light curves are supplemented with data from\nKepler and TESS. In addition to data in the visible range, we also use thermal\ndata from infrared space observatories (IRAS, Akari and WISE) in a combined\noptimisation process using the Convex Inversion Thermophysical Model (CITPM).\nThis novel method has so far been applied to only a few targets, and in this\nwork we further validate the method.\n  We present the models of 16 slow rotators. All provide good fits to both\nthermal and visible data. The obtained sizes are on average accurate at the 5%\nprecision, with diameters in the range from 25 to 145 km. The rotation periods\nof our targets range from 11 to 59 hours, and the thermal inertia covers a wide\nrange of values, from 2 to <400 SI units, not showing any correlation with the\nperiod. With this work we increase the sample of slow rotators with reliable\nspin and shape models and known thermal inertia by 40%. The thermal inertia\nvalues of our sample do not display a previously suggested increasing trend\nwith rotation period, which might be due to their small skin depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 16:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

Unfortunately, new side-channels have often been\nuncovered that exploit these enhanced designs. One area that has received\nlittle attention from a security perspective is the processor's hard-ware\nprefetcher, a critical component used to mitigate DRAM latency in today's\nsystems. Prefetchers, like branch predictors, hold critical state related to\nthe execution of the application, and have the potential to leak secret\ninformation. But up to now, there has not been a demonstration of a generic\nprefetcher side-channel that could be actively exploited in today's hardware.\n  In this paper, we present AfterImage, a new side-channel that exploits the\nIntel Instruction Pointer-based stride prefetcher. We observe that, when the\nexecution of the processor switches between different private domains, the\nprefetcher trained by one domain can be triggered in another. To the best of\nour knowledge, this work is the first to publicly demonstrate a methodology\nthat is both algorithm-agnostic and also able to leak kernel data into\nuserspace. AfterImage is different from previous works, as it leaks data on the\nnon-speculative path of execution. Because of this, a large class of work that\nhas focused on protecting transient, branch-outcome-based data will be unable\nto block this side-channel. By reverse-engineering the IP-stride prefetcher in\nmodern Intel processors, we have successfully developed three variants of\nAfterImage to leak control flow information across code regions, processes and\nthe user-kernel boundary. We find a high level of accuracy in leaking\ninformation with our methodology (from 91%, up to 99%), and propose two\nmitigation techniques to block this side-channel, one of which can be used on\nhardware systems today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 16:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

Evolving dynamics in linguistic and behavioural patterns\nobserved in new data require adapting stance detection systems to deal with the\nchanges. In this survey paper, we investigate the intersection between\ncomputational linguistics and the temporal evolution of human communication in\ndigital media. We perform a critical review of emerging research considering\ndynamics, exploring different semantic and pragmatic factors that impact\nlinguistic data in general, and stance in particular. We further discuss\ncurrent directions in capturing stance dynamics in social media. We discuss the\nchallenges encountered when dealing with stance dynamics, identify open\nchallenges and discuss future directions in three key dimensions: utterance,\ncontext and influence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 16:28:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 15:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

The important tasks carried out to\naddress this challenge include the design and development of a hardware system\nwith efficient grabbing and popping mechanisms, considering the restrictions in\nvolume and payload, design of accurate target interception algorithms using\nvisual information suitable for outdoor environments, and development of a\nsoftware architecture for dynamic multi-agent aerial systems performing complex\ndynamic missions.

However, a main limitation of nearly all prior literature is the need\nof employing anomalous images to set a class-specific threshold to locate the\nanomalies. This limits their usability in realistic scenarios, where only\nnormal data is typically accessible. Despite this major drawback, only a\nhandful of works have addressed this limitation, by integrating supervision on\nattention maps during training. In this work, we propose a novel formulation\nthat does not require accessing images with abnormalities to define the\nthreshold. Furthermore, and in contrast to very recent work, the proposed\nconstraint is formulated in a more principled manner, leveraging well-known\nknowledge in constrained optimization. In particular, the equality constraint\non the attention maps in prior work is replaced by an inequality constraint,\nwhich allows more flexibility. In addition, to address the limitations of\npenalty-based functions we employ an extension of the popular log-barrier\nmethods to handle the constraint.

Consequently, the optimal way to insert OpenACC\ndirectives may be different from the original way of inserting OpenMP\ndirectives. We point out these differences in the implementation of sparse\nmatrix-matrix multiplications (SpMM), which constitutes the main cost of the\neigensolver, as well as other differences in the preconditioning step and dense\nlinear algebra operations. We compare the performance of the OpenACC based\nimplementation executed on multiple GPUs with the performance on\ndistributed-memory many-core CPUs, and demonstrate significant speedup achieved\non GPUs compared to the on-node performance of a many-core CPU.

This partial differential equation, randomly stirred by a forcing term\nwhich is smooth in space and delta-correlated in time, was shown to converge at\ninfinite time towards a state of finite variance, without the aid of viscosity.\nFurthermore, the spatial profile of its solution gets rough, with the same\nregularity as a fractional Gaussian field. We here focus on the temporal\nbehavior and derive explicit asymptotic predictions for the correlation\nfunction in time of this solution and observe that their regularity is not\ninfluenced by the spatial regularity of the problem, only by the correlation in\ntime of the stirring contribution. We also show that the correlation in time of\nthe solution depends on the position, contrary to its correlation in space at\nfixed times. We then investigate the influence of a forcing which is correlated\nin time on the spatial and time statistics of this equation. In this situation,\nwhile for small correlation times the homogeneous spatial statistics of the\nwhite-in-time case are recovered, for large correlation times homogeneity is\nbroken, and a concentration around the origin of the system is observed in the\nvelocity profiles. In other words, this fractional velocity field is a\nrepresentation in one-dimension, through a linear dynamical model, of the\nself-similar velocity fields proposed by Kolmogorov in 1941, but only at fixed\ntimes, for a delta-correlated forcing, in which case the spatial statistics is\nhomogeneous and rough, as expected of a turbulent velocity field. The\nregularity in time of turbulence, however, is not captured by this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 17:00:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 08:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

The spin density vector for the\nground state phases exhibits density, quadrupole and dipole like spin\npolarizations.

The relation has a power-law form\n$\\Sigma_{SFR} \\propto \\Sigma_{gas}^n$. Assuming that star formation results\nfrom gravitational collapse of the interstellar medium, $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ can be\ndetermined by dividing $\\Sigma_{gas}$ by the local free-fall time $t_{ff}$. The\nformulation of $t_{ff}$ yields the relation between $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ and\n$\\Sigma_{gas}$, assuming that a constant fraction ($\\varepsilon_{SFE}$) of gas\nis converted into stars every $t_{ff}$. This is done here for the first time\nusing Milgromian dynamics (MOND). Using linear stability analysis of a\nuniformly rotating thin disc, it is possible to determine the size of a\ncollapsing perturbation within it. This lets us evaluate the sizes and masses\nof clouds (and their $t_{ff}$) as a function of $\\Sigma_{gas}$ and the rotation\ncurve. We analytically derive the relation $\\Sigma_{SFR} \\propto\n\\Sigma_{gas}^{n}$ both in Newtonian and Milgromian dynamics, finding that\n$n=1.4$. The difference between the two cases is a change only to the constant\npre-factor, resulting in increased $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ of up to 25\\% using MOND in\nthe central regions of dwarf galaxies. Due to the enhanced role of disk\nself-gravity, star formation extends out to larger galactocentric radii than in\nNewtonian gravity, with the clouds being larger. In MOND, a nearly exact\nrepresentation of the present-day main sequence of galaxies is obtained if\n$\\epsilon_{SFE} = \\text{constant} \\approx 1.1\\%$. We also show that empirically\nfound correction terms to the Kennicutt-Schmidt law are included in the here\npresented relations.

In this paper, we propose a novel gray-box modeling approach that not\nonly identifies the model-form error but also utilizes it to improve the\npredictive capability of the known but approximate governing equation. The\nprimary idea is to treat the unknown model-form error as a residual force and\nestimate it using duel Bayesian filter based joint input-state estimation\nalgorithms. For improving the predictive capability of the underlying physics,\nwe first use machine learning algorithm to learn a mapping between the\nestimated state and the input (model-form error) and then introduce it into the\ngoverning equation as an additional term. This helps in improving the\npredictive capability of the governing physics and allows the model to\ngeneralize to unseen environment. Although in theory, any machine learning\nalgorithm can be used within the proposed framework, we use Gaussian process in\nthis work.

Monitoring\nof the white dwarf spin may reveal whether the white dwarf spin is currently in\na state of near-equilibrium, or of uni-directional evolution towards longer or\nshorter periods, reflecting the recent history of the system and providing\nconstraints for evolutionary models. This makes the monitoring of the spin\nhistory of magnetic white dwarfs of high interest. In this paper we report the\nresults of a campaign of follow-up optical photometry to detect and track the\n39 sec white dwarf spin pulses recently discovered in Hubble Space Telescope\ndata of the cataclysmic variable V1460 Her. We find the spin pulsations to be\npresent in g-band photometry at a typical amplitude of 0.4%. Under favourable\nobserving conditions, the spin signal is detectable using 2-meter class\ntelescopes. We measured pulse-arrival times for all our observations, which\nallowed us to derive a precise ephemeris for the white dwarf spin. We have also\nderived an orbital modulation correction that can be applied to the\nmeasurements.

However, a\ngeneric approach towards the pre-training procedure can naturally be\nsub-optimal in some cases. Particularly, fine-tuning a pre-trained language\nmodel on a source domain and then applying it to a different target domain,\nresults in a sharp performance decline of the eventual classifier for many\nsource-target domain pairs. Moreover, in some NLP tasks, the output categories\nsubstantially differ between domains, making adaptation even more challenging.\nThis, for example, happens in the task of aspect extraction, where the aspects\nof interest of reviews of, e.g., restaurants or electronic devices may be very\ndifferent.

The deformation can be\naccessed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions by measuring the collective flow\nresponse of the produced quark-gluon plasma to the eccentricity $\\varepsilon_2$\nand the density gradient $d_{\\perp}$ in the initial state.

Recently, there is a growing amount of literature that\nemploys mean-field partial differential equations (PDEs) to model the density\nevolution and uses density feedback to design control laws which, by acting on\nindividual systems, stabilize their density towards a target profile. In spite\nof its stability property and computational efficiency, the success of density\nfeedback relies on assuming the systems to be homogeneous first-order\nintegrators (plus white noise) and ignores higher-order dynamics, making it\nless applicable in practice. In this work, we present a backstepping design\nalgorithm that extends density control to heterogeneous and higher-order\nstochastic systems in strict-feedback forms. We show that the strict-feedback\nform in the individual level corresponds to, in the collective level, a PDE (of\ndensities) distributedly driven by a collection of heterogeneous stochastic\nsystems. The presented backstepping design then starts with a density feedback\ndesign for the PDE, followed by a sequence of stabilizing design for the\nremaining stochastic systems. We present a candidate control law with stability\nproof and apply it to nonholonomic mobile robots.

However, the calibration of their luminosity\ndistances is not an easy task in comparison to Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa). To\ncalibrate these data, correlations between their luminosity and other observed\nproperties of GRBs need to be identified, and we must consider the validity of\nour assumptions about these correlations over their entire observed redshift\nrange. In this work, we propose a new method to calibrate GRBs as cosmological\ndistance indicators using SNeIa observations with a machine learning\narchitecture. As well we include a new data GRB calibrated sample using\nextended cosmography in a redshift range above $z>3.6$. An overview of this\nmachine learning technique was developed in [1] to study the evolution of dark\nenergy models at high redshift. The aim of the method developed in this work is\nto combine two networks: a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a Bayesian Neural\nNetwork (BNN). Using this computational approach, denoted RNN+BNN, we extend\nthe network's efficacy by adding the computation of covariance matrices to the\nBayesian process. Once this is done, the SNeIa distance-redshift relation can\nbe tested on the full GRB sample and therefore used to implement a cosmographic\nreconstruction of the distance-redshift relation in different regimes. Thus,\nour newly-trained neural network is used to constrain the parameters describing\nthe kinematical state of the Universe via a cosmographic approach at high\nredshifts (up to $z\\approx 10$), wherein we require a very minimal set of\nassumptions on the deep learning architecture itself that do not rely on\ndynamical equations for any specific theory of gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 22:12:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 23:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

The transformed system is said to be in the\nTFL normal form.

This naturally raises the question of how\nthe performance of ViT can be advanced with design techniques of CNN. To this\nend, we propose to incorporate two techniques and present ViT-ResNAS, an\nefficient multi-stage ViT architecture designed with neural architecture search\n(NAS). First, we propose residual spatial reduction to decrease sequence\nlengths for deeper layers and utilize a multi-stage architecture. When reducing\nlengths, we add skip connections to improve performance and stabilize training\ndeeper networks. Second, we propose weight-sharing NAS with multi-architectural\nsampling. We enlarge a network and utilize its sub-networks to define a search\nspace. A super-network covering all sub-networks is then trained for fast\nevaluation of their performance. To efficiently train the super-network, we\npropose to sample and train multiple sub-networks with one forward-backward\npass. After that, evolutionary search is performed to discover high-performance\nnetwork architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that ViT-ResNAS\nachieves better accuracy-MACs and accuracy-throughput trade-offs than the\noriginal DeiT and other strong baselines of ViT.

We propose a new variant called the Stealing Multi-Queue\n(SMQ), a cache-efficient variant of the Multi-Queue, which leverages both queue\naffinity -- each thread has a local queue, from which tasks are usually\nremoved; but, with some probability, threads also attempt to steal\nhigher-priority tasks from the other queues -- and task batching, that is, the\nprocessing of several tasks in a single insert / delete step. These ideas are\nwell-known for task scheduling without priorities; our theoretical contribution\nis showing that, despite relaxations, this design can still provide rank\nguarantees, which in turn implies bounds on total work performed. We provide a\ngeneral SMQ implementation that can surpass state-of-the-art schedulers such as\nGalois and PMOD in terms of performance on popular graph-processing benchmarks.\nNotably, the performance improvement comes mainly from the superior rank\nguarantees provided by our scheduler, confirming that analytically-reasoned\napproaches can still provide performance improvements for priority task\nscheduling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 00:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

Development teams aiming\nto review architectural aspects (design) of a change commit consider many\nessential scenarios such as access rules and restrictions on usage of program\nentities across modules. Moreover, design review is essential when proper\narchitectural formulations are paramount for developing and deploying a system.\nUntangling architectural changes, recovering semantic design, and producing\ndesign notes are the crucial tasks of the design review process. To support\nthese tasks, we construct a lightweight tool [4] that can detect and decompose\nsemantic slices of a commit containing architectural instances. A semantic\nslice consists of a description of relational information of involved modules,\ntheir classes, methods and connected modules in a change instance, which is\neasy to understand to a reviewer. We extract various directory and naming\nstructures (DANS) properties from the source code for developing our tool.\nUtilizing the DANS properties, our tool first detects architectural change\ninstances based on our defined metric and then decomposes the slices (based on\nstring processing). Our preliminary investigation with ten open-source projects\n(developed in Java and Kotlin) reveals that the DANS properties produce highly\nreliable precision and recall (93-100%) for detecting and generating\narchitectural slices.

Although a conventional superconducting\nnanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) is not a PNR detector, by arranging\nnanowires in a series array and multiplexing photons over space, such series\nPNR-SNSPD can gain quasi-PNR capacity. However, the accuracy and maximum\nresolved photon number are both limited by the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of\nthe output pulses. Here, we introduce a matched filter, which is an optimal\nfilter in terms of SNR for SNSPD pulses. Experimentally, compared to\nconventional readout using a room-temperature amplifier, the normalized spacing\nbetween pulse amplitudes from adjacent photon number detections increased by a\nmaximum factor of 2.1 after the matched filter. Combining with a cryogenic\namplifier to increase SNR further, such spacing increased by a maximum factor\nof 5.3. In contrast to a low pass filter, the matched filter gave better SNRs\nwhile maintaining good timing jitters. Minimum timing jitter of 55 ps was\nobtained experimentally.

Despite the continuous development in the field, we have still\nlimited knowledge about how deformation - one of the representative nuclear\nstructures - affects multinucleon transfer reactions.\n  Purpose: To shed light on the effect of deformation in multinucleon transfer\nprocesses, we study the $^{16}$O+$^{154}$Sm reaction at $E_{\\rm lab}$=85 MeV\n(around the Coulomb barrier) and 134 MeV (substantially above the Coulomb\nbarrier), where the target nucleus, $^{154}$Sm, is a well-established, deformed\nnucleus.\n  Results: Angular distributions for elastic scattering and for various\ntransfer channels were measured over a wide angular range at the BARC-TIFR\npelletron-Linac accelerator facility, Mumbai. The $Q$-value- and\nangle-integrated isotope production cross sections have been extracted from the\nmeasured angular distributions. The experimental data are analyzed along with\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations.

It designs a global\nuncertainty representation p(z), which is an aggregation on a discretized input\nspace. The causal effect between the degree of global uncertainty and the\nintra-task diversity is discussed. The learnt prior is analyzed on a variety of\nscenarios, including 1D, 2D, and a newly proposed spatial-temporal COVID\ndataset. Our manipulation of the global uncertainty not only achieves\ngenerating the desired samples to tackle few-shot learning, but also enables\nthe probability evaluation on the functional priors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 03:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

However, while\nthe ML moment closure has better accuracy, it is not able to guarantee\nhyperbolicity and has issues with long time stability. In our second paper\n\\cite{huang2021hyperbolic}, we identified a symmetrizer which leads to\nconditions that enforce that the gradient based ML closure is symmetrizable\nhyperbolic and stable over long time. The limitation of this approach is that\nin practice the highest moment can only be related to four, or fewer, lower\nmoments.\n  In this paper, we propose a new method to enforce the hyperbolicity of the ML\nclosure model.

Unlike the existing models of fractal\nscale-free networks (FSFNs), the present model can systematically and widely\nchange the network structure.

The choice of generators enables us to control the\nscale-free property, fractality, and other structural properties of\nhierarchical FSFNs. We calculate theoretically various characteristic\nquantities of networks, such as the exponent of the power-law degree\ndistribution, fractal dimension, average clustering coefficient, global\nclustering coefficient, and joint probability describing the nearest-neighbor\ndegree correlation. As an example of analyses of phenomena occurring on FSFNs,\nwe also present the critical point and critical exponents of the\nbond-percolation transition on infinite FSFNs, which is related to the\nrobustness of networks against edge removal.

We found that continuous Ar ion irradiation at room temperature of GST\nfilms causes complete amorphization of GST when exceeding 0.6 (for rock-salt\nGST) and 3 (for hexagonal GST) displacements per atom (n_dpa). While the\ntransition from rock-salt to amorphous GST is caused by progressive\namorphization via the accumulation of lattice defects, several transitions\noccur in hexagonal GST upon ion irradiation. In hexagonal GST, the creation of\npoint defects and small defect clusters leads to disordering of intrinsic\nvacancy layers (van der Waals gaps) that drives the electronic metal-insulator\ntransition. Increasing disorder then induces a structural transition from\nhexagonal to rock-salt and then leads to amorphization. Furthermore, we\nobserved different annealing behavior of defects for rock-salt and hexagonal\nGST. The higher amorphization threshold in hexagonal GST compared to rock-salt\nGST is caused by an increased defect-annealing rate, i.e., a higher resistance\nagainst ion-beam-induced disorder.

Using LAMOST and Gaia, we found\nthese stars share the same kinematics as the canonical high-$\\alpha$ old\nstellar population in the Galactic thick disk. The stellar abundances show that\nthese high-$\\alpha$ massive stars have $\\alpha$- and iron-peak element\nabundances similar to those of the high-$\\alpha$ old thick disk stars. However,\na portion of them exhibit higher [(N+C)/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] ratios, which implies\nthey have gained C- and Ba-rich materials from extra sources, presumably\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) companions. The results support the previous\nsuggestion that these RGB stars are products of binary evolution. Their high\nmasses thus mimic \"young\" single stars, yet in fact they belong to an intrinsic\nold stellar population. To fully explain the stellar abundance patterns of our\nsample stars, a variety of binary evolution channels, such as, main-sequence\n(MS) + RGB, MS + AGB, RGB + RGB and RGB + AGB, are required, pointing to\ndiverse formation mechanisms of these seemly rejuvenated cannibals. With this\nlarger sample, our results confirm earlier findings that most, if not all,\n$\\alpha$-rich stars in the Galactic disk seem to be old.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 07:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

When formed through hierarchical mergers, for\nexample when a GW190521-like remnant captures a stellar mass black hole, IMRI\nsystems have a large total mass, large spin on the primary, and possibly\nresidual eccentricity; features that potentially raise the prospect for memory\ndetection.

This methodology allows an accurate determination of the\nthermal conductivity, and does not require complex modeling or intensive\ncomputational efforts to process the experimental data, i.e., the thermal\nconductivity is obtained through a simple linear fit (\"slope method\"), in a\nsimilar fashion as in the 3-omega method. We demonstrate the potential of this\napproach by studying isotropic and anisotropic materials in a wide range of\nthermal conductivities. In particular, we have studied the following inorganic\nand organic systems: (i) glass, Si, and Ge substrates (isotropic), (ii)\n$\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, and a Kapton substrate (anisotropic) and , (iii) a 285 nm\nSiO$_2$/Si thin film. The accuracy in the determination of the thermal\nconductivity is estimated at $\\approx$ 5\\%, whereas the best temperature\nresolution is $\\Delta$T $\\approx$ 3 mK.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 07:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

While experimental observations\nindicate a much slower rate of the full-fluorination process, compared with the\nhalf-fluorination one, the obtained energy profiles demonstrate much enhanced\nfluorine adsorption after the half-fluorination stage.

In particular, after\nadsorption at a fluid interface, interfacial tension provides two-dimensional\n(2D) confinement for microgel monolayers and drives the reconfiguration of the\nparticles, enabling their deployment in foam and emulsion stabilization and in\nsurface patterning for lithography, sensing and optical materials. However,\nmost studies focus on systems of fluids with a high interfacial tension, e.g.\nalkanes/ or air/water interfaces, which imparts similar properties to the\nassembled monolayers. Here, instead, we compare two organic fluid phases,\nhexane and methyl tert-butyl ether, which have markedly different interfacial\ntension ($\\gamma$) values with water and thus tune the elasticity and\ndeformation of adsorbed microgels. We rationalize how $\\gamma$ controls the\nsingle-particle morphology, which consequently modulates the structural and\nmechanical response of the monolayers at varying interfacial compression.\nSpecifically, when $\\gamma$ is low, the microgels are less deformed within the\ninterface plane and their polymer networks can rearrange more easily upon\nlateral compression, leading to softer monolayers. Selecting interfaces with\ndifferent surface energy offers an additional control to customize the 2D\nassembly of soft particles, from the fine-tuning of particle size and\ninterparticle spacing to the tailoring of mechanical properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 09:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

We specifically search for UV aurora on the\nlate-type T6.5 brown dwarf 2MASS J12373919+6526148 (in the following 2MASS\nJ1237+6526). Methods: Introducing a parameter referred to as auroral power\npotential, we derive scaling models for auroral powers for rotationally driven\naurora applicable to a broad range of wavelengths. We also analyze Hubble Space\nTelescope observations obtained with the STIS camera at near-UV, far-UV, and\nLy-$\\alpha$ wavelengths of 2MASS J1237+6526. Results: We show that brown\ndwarfs, due to their typically strong surface magnetic fields and fast\nrotation, can produce auroral UV powers on the order of 10$^{19}$ watt or more.\nConsidering their negligible thermal UV emission, their potentially powerful\nauroral emissions make brown dwarfs ideal candidates for detecting extrasolar\naurorae. We find possible emission from 2MASS J1237+6526, but cannot\nconclusively attribute it to the brown dwarf due to low signal-to-noise values\nin combination with nonsystematic trends in the background fluxes. The\nobservations provide upper limits for the emission at various UV wavelength\nbands. The upper limits for the emission correspond to a UV luminosity of\n$\\sim$1 $\\times$ 10$^{19}$ watt, which lies in the range of the theoretically\nexpected values.

Since the trapped matter is likely to have a certain amount of specific\nangular momentum, the accretion stream eventually forms an accretion ring\naround the black hole. According to the recent study, the accretion ring\nconsists of a thick envelope and a thin core, and angular momenta are\ntransfered from the inner side facing to the black hole to the opposite side\nrespectively in the envelope and the core. As a result, a thick accretion flow\nand a thick excretion flow extend from the envelope, and a thin accretion disk\nand a thin excretion disk do from the core. The thin excretion disk is\npredicted to terminate at some distance forming an excretion ring, while the\nthick excretion flow is considered to become a super-sonic wind flowing to the\ninfinity.

Using a Monte-Carlo model we simulate the dynamics within a thin\nfilm semiconductor and analyse the results using both pulsed-PLQY and TRPL\nmethods. We find that pulsed-PLQY has a larger operational region and depends\nless on the excitation fuence than the TRPL approach.

Depending on the\nmagnetisation mechanisms and responsive behaviour, MAPs are mainly classified\ninto two groups: i) hard magnetic MAPs in which a large residual magnetic flux\ndensity sustains even after the removal of the external magnetic field, and ii)\nsoft magnetic MAPs where the magnetisation of the filler particles disappear\nupon the removal of the external magnetic field. Polymeric materials are widely\ntreated as fully incompressible solids that require special numerical treatment\nto solve the associated boundary value problem. Furthermore, both soft and hard\nmagnetic particles-filled soft polymers are inherently viscoelastic. Therefore,\nthe aim of this paper is to devise a unified finite element method-based\nnumerical framework for magneto-mechanically coupled systems that can work for\ncompressible and fully incompressible materials and from hard to soft MAPs,\nincluding the effects of the time-dependent viscoelastic behaviour of the\nunderlying matrix. First, variational formulations for the uncoupled problem\nfor hard MAPs and the coupled problem for soft MAPs are derived. The weak forms\nare then discretised with higher-order B\\'ezier elements while the evolution\nequation for internal variables in viscoelastic models is solved using the\ngeneralised-alpha time integration scheme, which is implicit and second-order\naccurate. Finally, a series of experimentally-driven boundary value problems\nconsisting of the beam and robotic gripper models are solved in\nmagneto-mechanically coupled settings, demonstrating the versatility of the\nproposed numerical framework. The effect of viscoelastic material parameters on\nthe response characteristics of MAPs under coupled magneto-mechanical loading\nis also studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 11:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

Planning time and energy optimal paths for these\nvehicles to navigate in stochastic dynamic ocean environments is essential to\nreduce operational costs.

Towards a unifying treatment of fairness and\neconomic efficiency objectives, we develop an algorithmic framework for finding\nonline allocations to maximize the generalized mean of the values received by\nthe agents. In particular, working with the assumption that each agent's value\nfor the grand bundle of goods is appropriately scaled, we address online\nmaximization of $p$-mean welfare. Parameterized by an exponent term $p \\in\n(-\\infty, 1]$, these means encapsulate a range of welfare functions, including\nsocial welfare ($p=1$), egalitarian welfare ($p \\to -\\infty$), and Nash social\nwelfare ($p \\to 0$).\n  We present a simple algorithmic template that takes a threshold as input and,\nwith judicious choices for this threshold, leads to both universal and tailored\ncompetitive guarantees.

While recent studies developed\nan index for nociception level of patients under general anesthesia, based on\nmultiple physiological parameters, it remains unclear whether and how dynamics\nof these parameters indicate long-term post-operative pain (POP). To extract\nunbiased and interpretable descriptions of how physiological parameters\ndynamics change over time and across patients in response to surgical\nprocedures, we employed a multivariate-temporal analysis. We demonstrate the\nmain features of intra-operative physiological responses can be used to predict\nlong-term POP. We propose to use a complex higher-order SVD method to\naccurately decompose the patients' physiological responses into multivariate\nstructures evolving in time. We used intra-operative vital signs of 175\npatients from a mixed surgical cohort to extract three interconnected,\nlow-dimensional complex-valued descriptions of patients' physiological\nresponses: multivariate factors, reflecting sub-physiological parameters;\ntemporal factors reflecting common intra-surgery temporal dynamics; and\npatients factors, describing patient to patient changes in physiological\nresponses. Adoption of complex-HOSVD allowed us to clarify the dynamic\ncorrelation structure included in intra-operative physiological responses.\nInstantaneous phases of the complex-valued physiological responses within the\nsubspace of principal descriptors enabled us to discriminate between mild\nversus severe levels of long-term POP. By abstracting patients into different\nsurgical groups, we identified significant surgery-related principal\ndescriptors: each of them potentially encodes different surgical stimulation.\nThe dynamics of patients' physiological responses to these surgical events are\nlinked to long-term post-operative pain development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 12:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

In this\npaper we conduct a structured, empirical study of the effect of sparsification\non the trainable part of MPNNs known as the Update step. To this end, we design\na series of models to successively sparsify the linear transform in the Update\nstep.

Hence, it is\nessential to determine when this lifetime is the shortest, corresponding to\nwhen the remnant has a mass equal to the threshold mass, $M_{\\rm th}$, to\nprompt collapse to a black hole. We report on the results of more than 360\nsimulations of merging neutron-star binaries covering 40 different\nconfigurations differing in mass ratio and spin of the primary. Using this\ndata, we have derived a quasi-universal relation for $M_{\\rm th}$ and expressed\nits dependence on the mass ratio and spin of the binary.

Finally, we extend to\nunequal-masses and spinning binaries the lower limits that can be set on the\nstellar radii once a neutron-star binary is detected, illustrating how the\nmerger of an unequal-mass, rapidly spinning binary can significantly constrain\nthe allowed values of the stellar radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 13:31:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 12:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

Our main motivation is to explore the\nimpact of a common tactic adopted in numerical simulations of convection that\nuse realistic stellar conditions. This tactic is to artificially increase the\nluminosity and to modify the thermal diffusivity of the reference stellar\nmodel. This work focuses on the impact of these modifications on convective\npenetration (or overshooting) at the base of the convective envelope of a\nsolar-like model. We explore a range of enhancement factors for the energy\ninput and confirm the increase in the characteristic overshooting depth with\nthe increase in the energy input. Our results highlight the importance of the\nimpact of penetrative downflows on the thermal background below the convective\nboundary. This is a result of compression and shear which induce local heating\nand thermal mixing. The artificial increase in the energy flux intensifies the\nheating process by increasing the velocities in the convective zone and at the\nconvective boundary, revealing a subtle connection between the local heating of\nthe thermal background and the plume dynamics. This heating also increases the\nefficiency of heat transport by radiation which may counterbalance further\nheating and helps to establish a steady state. The modification of the thermal\nbackground by penetrative plumes impacts the width of the overshooting layer.\nOur results suggest that an artificial modification of the radiative\ndiffusivity in the overshooting layer, rather than only accelerating the\nthermal relaxation, could also alter the dynamics of the penetrating plumes and\nthus the width of the overshooting layer. Results from simulations with an\nartificial modification of the energy flux and of the thermal diffusivity\nshould be regarded with caution if used to determine an overshooting width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 13:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

These structures are overall\nless extended and less massive than the molecular clouds identified in the\n$^{12}$CO(1-0) data-set because they trace the brightest and densest part of\nthe $^{12}$CO(1-0) clouds. Conversely, the distribution of aspect ratio,\nequivalent spherical radius, velocity dispersion, and virial parameter in the\ntwo catalogues are similar. The mean value of the mass surface density of\nmolecular clouds is 87$\\pm$55 M$_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ and is almost constant\nacross the galactocentric radius, indicating that this parameter, which is a\nproxy of star formation, is mostly affected by local conditions.In data of the\nForgotten Quadrant Survey, we find a good agreement between the total mass and\nvelocity dispersion of the clouds derived from $^{12}$CO(1-0) and\n$^{13}$CO(1-0). This is likely because in the surveyed portion of the Galactic\nplane, the H$_2$ column density is not particularly high, leading to a CO\nemission with a not very high optical depth.

This kind of process generates a very peculiar data structure, in\nwhich successive measurements of many process variables in each batch run are\navailable.

The main reason is that the time series inference theory is\nnot based on replications of time series, as it is in batch process data. It is\nbased on the variability in a time domain. This fact demands some adaptations\nof this theory in order to accommodate the model coefficient estimates,\nconsidering jointly the batch to batch samples variability (batch domain) and\nthe serial correlation in each batch (time domain). In order to address this\nissue, this paper proposes a new approach grounded in a group of control charts\nbased on the classical ARMA model for monitoring and diagnostic of batch\nprocesses dynamics.

It often attempts to\nsuggest a sequence of point of interests (POIs) for a user who requests a\npersonalized travel demand. Conventional methods either leverage the heuristic\nalgorithms (e.g., dynamic programming) or statistical analysis (e.g., Markov\nmodels) to search or rank a POI sequence. These procedures may fail to capture\nthe diversity of human needs and transitional regularities. They even provide\nrecommendations that deviate from tourists' real travel intention when the trip\ndata is sparse. Although recent deep recursive models (e.g., RNN) are capable\nof alleviating these concerns, existing solutions hardly recognize the\npractical reality, such as the diversity of tourist demands, uncertainties in\nthe trip generation, and the complex visiting preference. Inspired by the\nadvance in deep learning, we introduce a novel self-supervised representation\nlearning framework for trip recommendation -- SelfTrip, aiming at tackling the\naforementioned challenges.

Compared with Frequency-Division\nMultiple Access (FDMA), OFDMA has higher spectrum efficiency thanks to the\nsmaller subcarrier spacing. Although OFDMA has been introduced in 802.11ax, the\npurpose was to add flexibility in spectrum usage. Our Reliable OFDMA design,\nreferred to as ROFA, is a clean-slate design with a single goal of\nultra-reliable packet delivery. ROFA solves a number of key challenges to\nensure the ultra-reliability: (1) a downlink-coordinated time-synchronization\nmechanism to synchronize the uplink transmission of users, with at most $0.1us$\ntiming offset; (2) an \"STF-free\" packet reception synchronization method that\nmakes use of the property of synchronous systems to avoid packet misdetection;\nand (3) an uplink precoding mechanism to reduce the CFOs between users and the\nAP to a negligible level. We implemented ROFA on the Universal Software Radio\nPeripheral (USRP) SDR platform with real-time signal processing. Extensive\nexperimental results show that ROFA can achieve ultra-reliable packet delivery\n($PER<10^5$) with $11.5dB$ less transmit power compared with OFDM-TDMA when\nthey use $3$ and $52$ subcarriers respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 14:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

To obtain large mechanocaloric effects, we need\nmaterials whose elastic properties (e.g., strain, elastic compliance) are\nstrongly temperature dependent. This is the case of ferroelectric perovskite\noxides, where the development of the spontaneous electric polarization is\naccompanied by significant strains and lattice softening.

We refer to this Markov\nchain as the Navigation Control System (NCS). Furthermore, we model that agents\nsense the environment by considering that the transition rates of the NCS\ndepend on local (scalar) measurement of the environment such as e.g. chemical\nconcentrations, light intensity, or temperature. Here, we investigate under\nwhich conditions the (asymptotic) behavior of the agents can be reduced to an\neffective convection-diffusion equation for the density of the agents,\nproviding effective expressions for the drift and diffusion terms.

In addition, we indicate that the sign of the drift\nterm - i.e. whether agents develop a positive or negative chemotactic response\n- can be changed by modifying the asymmetry of the NCS or by swapping the speed\nassociated to the internal states.

The pros and cons of these two variants of\nself-consistency are sufficiently well documented in literature for the\nsimplest GW approximation to the Hedin's equations. Our study, therefore, aims\nprimarily at the level of theory beyond GW approximation, i.e. at the level of\ntheory which includes vertex corrections. Whereas quasi-particle\nself-consistency has certain advantages at GW level (well known fact), the\nsituation becomes quite different when vertex corrections are included. In the\nvariant with full self-consistency, vertex corrections (both for polarizability\nand for self energy) systematically reduce the calculated band gaps making them\ncloser to the experimental values. In the variant with quasi-particle\nself-consistency, however, an inclusion of the same diagrams has considerably\nlarger effect and calculated band gaps become severely underestimated.\nDifferent effect of vertex corrections in two variants of self-consistency can\nbe related to the Z-factor cancellation which plays positive role in\nquasi-particle self-consistency at GW level of theory but appears to be\ndestructive for the quasi-particle approximation when higher order diagrams are\nincluded.

The\ninclination angle of the system is so high that in principle, it should be hard\nto observe both the direct thermal emission of the central object and the\nreflection component of the spectrum because they are hidden by the outer edge\nof the accretion disc. Assuming that the source accretes at the Eddington\nlimit, we analysed non-simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations and\nstudied the average broadband spectrum, with the aim to investigate the\npresence of a reflection component.

We modelled the spectral\nemission of the source using two different reflection models, Diskline plus\nPexriv and the self-consistent model RfxConv. In our analysis, we find\nsignificant evidence of a reflection component in the spectrum, in addition to\ntwo lines associated with neutral or mildly ionised iron. The continuum\nspectrum is well fitted by a saturated Comptonisation model and a thermal\nblack-body component emitted by the accretion disc at a lower temperature.

In our proposed scenario, the source is\naccreting at the Eddington limit with an intrinsic luminosity of $10^{38}$\nerg/s, while the observed luminosity is two orders of magnitude lower. Despite\nthe high inclination, we find that a reflection component is required to fit\nresiduals at the Fe line range and the hard excess observed in the spectrum.\nThe best-fit value of the inner disc radius is still uncertain and model\ndependent. More observations are therefore needed to confirm these results,\nwhich can give important information on this enigmatic and peculiar source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 15:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

The key idea is to transform numerical time series to\nsymbolic representations in the time or frequency domain, i.e., sequences of\nsymbols, and then extract features from these sequences. While achieving high\naccuracy, existing symbolic classifiers are computationally expensive. In this\npaper we present MrSQM, a new time series classifier which uses multiple\nsymbolic representations and efficient sequence mining, to extract important\ntime series features. We study four feature selection approaches on symbolic\nsequences, ranging from fully supervised, to unsupervised and hybrids. We\npropose a new approach for optimal supervised symbolic feature selection in\nall-subsequence space, by adapting a Chi-squared bound developed for\ndiscriminative pattern mining, to time series. Our extensive experiments on 112\ndatasets of the UEA/UCR benchmark demonstrate that MrSQM can quickly extract\nuseful features and learn accurate classifiers with the classic logistic\nregression algorithm. Interestingly, we find that a very simple and fast\nfeature selection strategy can be highly effective as compared with more\nsophisticated and expensive methods. MrSQM advances the state-of-the-art for\nsymbolic time series classifiers and it is an effective method to achieve high\naccuracy, with fast runtime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 15:54:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 21:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

Such clothing is predominantly\nsingle-use, made of plastic-based synthetic fibres such as polypropylene and\npolyester, low cost and able to provide protection against pathogens. However,\nthe environmental impacts of synthetic fibre-based clothing are significant and\nwell-documented. Despite growing environmental concerns with single-use\nplastic-based protective clothing, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has seen a\nsignificant increase in their use, that could result in a further surge of\noceanic plastic pollution, adding to mass of plastic waste that already\nthreatens marine life. In this review, we briefly discuss the nature of the raw\nmaterials involved in the production of such clothing, as well as manufacturing\ntechniques and the PPE supply chain. We identify the environmental impacts at\ncritical points in the protective clothing value chain from production to\nconsumption, focusing on water use, chemical pollution, CO2 emissions and\nwaste. On the basis of these environmental impacts, we outline the need for\nfundamental changes in the business model, including increased usage of\nreusable protective clothing, addressing supply chain bottlenecks, establishing\nbetter waste management, and the use of sustainable materials and processes\nwithout associated environmental problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 15:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

In the field of supervised learning, two complementary approaches\nstand out: error-based and target-based learning. However, there exists no\nconsensus on which is better suited for which task, and what is the most\nbiologically plausible. Here we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework\nthat includes these two frameworks as special cases. This novel theoretical\nformulation offers major insights into the differences between the two\napproaches. In particular, we show how target-based naturally emerges from\nerror-based when the number of constraints on the target dynamics, and as a\nconsequence on the internal network dynamics, is comparable to the degrees of\nfreedom of the network. Moreover, given the experimental evidences on the\nrelevance that spikes have in biological networks, we investigate the role of\ncoding with specific patterns of spikes by introducing a parameter that defines\nthe tolerance to precise spike timing during learning. Our approach naturally\nlends itself to Imitation Learning (and Behavioral Cloning in particular) and\nwe apply it to solve relevant closed-loop tasks such as the button-and-food\ntask, and the 2D Bipedal Walker. We show that a high dimensionality feedback\nstructure is extremely important when it is necessary to solve a task that\nrequires retaining memory for a long time (button-and-food). On the other hand,\nwe find that coding with specific patterns of spikes enables optimal\nperformances in a motor task (the 2D Bipedal Walker). Finally, we show that our\ntheoretical formulation suggests protocols to deduce the structure of learning\nfeedback in biological networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 15:57:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 17:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Methods: We used data at\n3mm and 1.4mm obtained with IRAM-NOEMA in the framework of the Large Program\nSOLIS. Results: We imaged the spatial distribution of the line emission of\n32SO, 34SO, C32}S, C34S, C33S, OCS, H2C32S, H2C34S, and NS. The low excitation\n(9 K) 32SO line is tracing the fast collimated jet driven by the nearby\nSVS13-B. Conversely, the rest of the lines are confined in the inner SVS13-A\nregion, where complex organics have been previously imaged. The non-LTE LVG\nanalysis of SO, SO2, and H2CS indicates a hot corino origin (60-120 au).\nTemperatures between 50 K and 300 K, and volume densities larger than 10^5 cm-3\nhave been derived. The abundances are in the following ranges: 0.3-6 10^-6\n(CS), 7 10^-9} - 1 10^-7 (SO), 1-10 10^-7 (SO2), a few 10^-10 (H2CS and OCS),\nand 10^{-10} - 10^{-9}(NS). The N(NS)/N(NS^+) ratio is larger than 10,\nsupporting that the NS^+ ion is mainly formed in the extended envelope.\nConclusions: The [H2CS]/[H2CO] ratio increases with time (from Class 0 to Class\nII objects) by more than one order of magnitude. This suggests that [S]/[O]\nchanges along the Sun-like star forming process. The estimate of the [S]/[H]\nbudget in SVS13-A is 2%-17% of the Solar System value (1.8 10^-5), being\nconsistent with what was previously measured towards Class 0 objects (1%-8%).\nThis supports that the enrichment of the sulphuretted species with respect to\ndark clouds keeps constant from the Class 0 to the Class I stages of low-mass\nstar formation.

Any instance of MTS is generated from a hybrid\ndynamical system and their specific dynamics are usually unknown. The hybrid\nnature of such a dynamical system is a result of complex external attributes,\nsuch as geographic location and time of day, each of which can be categorized\ninto either spatial attributes or temporal attributes. Therefore, there are two\nfundamental views which can be used to analyze MTS data, namely the spatial\nview and the temporal view. Moreover, from each of these two views, we can\npartition the set of data samples of MTS into disjoint forecasting tasks in\naccordance with their associated attribute values. Then, samples of the same\ntask will manifest similar forthcoming pattern, which is less sophisticated to\nbe predicted in comparison with the original single-view setting. Considering\nthis insight, we propose a novel multi-view multi-task (MVMT) learning\nframework for MTS forecasting. Instead of being explicitly presented in most\nscenarios, MVMT information is deeply concealed in the MTS data, which severely\nhinders the model from capturing it naturally. To this end, we develop two\nkinds of basic operations, namely task-wise affine transformation and task-wise\nnormalization, respectively. Applying these two operations with prior knowledge\non the spatial and temporal view allows the model to adaptively extract MVMT\ninformation while predicting. Extensive experiments on three datasets are\nconducted to illustrate that canonical architectures can be greatly enhanced by\nthe MVMT learning framework in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. In\naddition, we design rich case studies to reveal the properties of\nrepresentations produced at different phases in the entire prediction\nprocedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 06:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Traditional\nmodels usually motivate themselves by designing complex or tailored\narchitectures based on different assumptions. However, the training data of\nrecommender system can be extremely sparse and imbalanced, which poses great\nchallenges for boosting the recommendation performance. To alleviate this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose to reformulate the recommendation task\nwithin the causal inference framework, which enables us to counterfactually\nsimulate user ranking-based preferences to handle the data scarce problem. The\ncore of our model lies in the counterfactual question: \"what would be the\nuser's decision if the recommended items had been different?\". To answer this\nquestion, we firstly formulate the recommendation process with a series of\nstructural equation models (SEMs), whose parameters are optimized based on the\nobserved data. Then, we actively indicate many recommendation lists (called\nintervention in the causal inference terminology) which are not recorded in the\ndataset, and simulate user feedback according to the learned SEMs for\ngenerating new training samples. Instead of randomly intervening on the\nrecommendation list, we design a learning-based method to discover more\ninformative training samples. Considering that the learned SEMs can be not\nperfect, we, at last, theoretically analyze the relation between the number of\ngenerated samples and the model prediction error, based on which a heuristic\nmethod is designed to control the negative effect brought by the prediction\nerror. Extensive experiments are conducted based on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 14:28:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 16:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

By imposing a series\nof regularization constraints to the learning problem, we exploit a pooling\nmechanism that incorporates such notion of fragments within the node soft\nassignment function that produces the embeddings. We present an extensive\nexperimental evaluation on a collection of sentence classification tasks\nconducted on several argument mining corpora, showing that the proposed\napproach performs well with respect to state-of-the-art techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 08:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

However, like many other neural\narchitectures, they are still weak on exploiting domain knowledge and on\ninterpretability. Unfortunately, the exploitation of external, structured\nknowledge is notoriously prone to a knowledge acquisition bottleneck. We thus\npropose a memory enhancement of transformer models that makes use of\nunstructured knowledge. That, expressed in plain text, can be used to carry out\nclassification tasks and as a source of explanations for the model output. An\nexperimental evaluation conducted on two challenging datasets demonstrates that\nour approach produces relevant explanations without losing in performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 09:17:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 13:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-13"}

Recent methods\naiming to provide interpretability and explainability to black-box models\nprimarily focus on post-hoc explanations of (sometimes spurious) input-output\ncorrelations. Instead, we emphasize using prototype networks directly\nincorporated into the model architecture and hence explain the reasoning\nprocess behind the network's decisions. Our architecture performs on par with\nseveral language models and, moreover, enables learning from user interactions.\nThis not only offers a better understanding of language models but uses human\ncapabilities to incorporate knowledge outside of the rigid range of purely\ndata-driven approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 11:34:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 13:50:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 08:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 13:37:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

The\nalgorithm allows user to pick an application and input specific data for\ncalibration, which on completion enables the device for further working. To\nverify and test its capability, a smart home garden environment is created\nusing this device, temperature, humidity, soil moisture sensors and actuators.\nAs it is implicit that real-time communication is inevitable for an IoT\napplication, the sensor data is published to a Mosquitto MQTT broker to permit\nreal-time remote access. The decision taken by the device is sent to actuators\nvia relay, thus a continuous monitoring process is achieved.
