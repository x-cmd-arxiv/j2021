Overall, the form of the phase diagram\nobserved in our simulations is very similar to that found in the exact solution\nof the model on a Husimi lattice.

The\nmain focus is then a model with negative counter term, the probabilistic\nversion of the so-called \\emph{Huang-Yang-Luttinger} (HYL) model \\cite{BLP}.\nCriticality in this model is the existence of a critical parameter for which\ntwo simultaneous minimiser exists. At criticality an order parameter is\nintroduced as the double limits for the density of cycles with diverging\nlength, and as such it extends recent work \\cite{AD21}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Sep 2021 18:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Near these points, the electronic dispersion is gapless\nand linear. A magnetic field $B$ changes this dispersion into a set of Landau\nlevels which are dispersive along the direction of the magnetic field only. The\n$n=0$ Landau level is special since its dispersion$\\ $is linear and\nunidirectional. The presence of this chiral level distinguishes Weyl from\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger fermions. In this paper, we study the quantum oscillations of\nthe orbital magnetization and magnetic susceptibility in Weyl semimetals. We\ngeneralise earlier works% \\cite{Mikitik2019} on these De Haas-Van Alphen\noscillations by considering the effect of a tilt of the Weyl nodes. We study\nhow the fundamental period of the oscillations in the small $B$ limit and the\nstrength of the magnetic field $B_{1}$ required to reach the quantum limit are\nmodified by the magnitude and orientation of the tilt vector $\\mathbf{t}$. We\nshow that the magnetization from a single node is finite in the $B\\rightarrow\n0$ limit. Its sign depends on the product of the chirality and sign of the tilt\ncomponent along the magnetic field direction. We also study the magnetic\noscillations from a pair of Weyl nodes with opposite chirality and with\nopposite or identical tilt. Our calculation shows that these two cases lead to\na very different behavior of the magnetization in the small and large $B$\nlimits. We finally consider the effect of an energy shift $\\pm \\Delta _{0}$ of\na pair of Weyl nodes on the magnetic oscillations. We assume a constant density\nof carriers so that both nodes share a common Fermi level.

Unfortunately, modern main memory chips internally use on-die error\ncorrecting codes (on-die ECC) that obfuscate the memory controller's view of\nerrors, complicating the process of identifying at-risk bits (i.e., error\nprofiling). To understand the problems that on-die ECC causes for error\nprofiling, we analytically study how on-die ECC changes the way that memory\nerrors appear outside of the memory chip (e.g., to the memory controller). We\nshow that on-die ECC introduces statistical dependence between errors in\ndifferent bit positions, raising three key challenges for practical and\neffective error profiling.\n  To address the three challenges, we introduce Hybrid Active-Reactive\nProfiling (HARP), a new error profiling algorithm that rapidly achieves full\ncoverage of at-risk bits in memory chips that use on-die ECC. HARP separates\nerror profiling into two phases: (1) using existing profiling techniques with\nthe help of small modifications to the on-die ECC mechanism to quickly identify\na subset of at-risk bits; and (2) using a secondary ECC within the memory\ncontroller to safely identify the remaining at-risk bits, if and when they\nfail. Our evaluations show that HARP achieves full coverage of all at-risk bits\nfaster (e.g., 99th-percentile coverage 20.6%/36.4%/52.9%/62.1% faster, on\naverage, given 2/3/4/5 raw bit errors per ECC word) than two state-of-the-art\nbaseline error profiling algorithms, which sometimes fail to achieve full\ncoverage.

SLR is a\nfundamental problem in Operations Research and Machine Learning which arises in\nvarious applications, including data compression, latent semantic indexing,\ncollaborative filtering, and medical imaging. We introduce a novel formulation\nfor SLR that directly models its underlying discreteness. For this formulation,\nwe develop an alternating minimization heuristic that computes high-quality\nsolutions and a novel semidefinite relaxation that provides meaningful bounds\nfor the solutions returned by our heuristic. We also develop a custom\nbranch-and-bound algorithm that leverages our heuristic and convex relaxations\nto solve small instances of SLR to certifiable (near) optimality. Given an\ninput $n$-by-$n$ matrix, our heuristic scales to solve instances where\n$n=10000$ in minutes, our relaxation scales to instances where $n=200$ in\nhours, and our branch-and-bound algorithm scales to instances where $n=25$ in\nminutes.

It is extremely hard to accurately\ndetect manipulated videos using content analysis, especially in the face of\nsubtle, yet effective, manipulations, such as frame rate changes or skin tone\nadjustments. One prominent alternative to content analysis is to securely embed\nprovenance information into videos. However, prior approaches have poor\nperformance and/or granularity that is too coarse. To this end, we construct\nVronicle -- a video provenance system that offers fine-grained provenance\ninformation and substantially better performance. It allows a video consumer to\nauthenticate the camera that originated the video and the exact sequence of\nvideo filters that were subsequently applied to it. Vronicle exploits the\nincreasing popularity and availability of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)\non many types of computing platforms.\n  One contribution of Vronicle is the design of provenance information that\nallows the consumer to verify various aspects of the video, thereby defeating\nnumerous fake-video creation methods. Vronicle's adversarial model allows for a\npowerful adversary that can manipulate the video (e.g., in transit) and the\nsoftware state outside the TEE. Another contribution is the use of\nfixed-function Intel SGX enclaves to post-process videos. This design\nfacilitates verification of provenance information.\n  We present a prototype implementation of Vronicle (to be open sourced), which\nrelies on current technologies, making it readily deployable.

The hilus consists of\nexcitatory mossy cells (MCs) and inhibitory HIPP (hilar perforant\npath-associated) cells.

An action\nbased on both the Ricci scalar and its square leads to a renormalizable\npropagator of the generic Pauli-Villars form. However, given the form of the\nHamiltonian and the propagator such theories are thought to be plagued by\neither energies that are unbounded from below or states of negative Dirac norm\n(the overlap of a ket with its Hermitian conjugate bra). But when one\nconstructs the quantum Hilbert space one finds (Bender and Mannheim) that in\nfact neither of these problems is actually present. The Hamiltonian turns out\nto not be Hermitian but to instead have an antilinear $PT$ symmetry, and for\nthis symmetry the needed inner product is the overlap of a ket with its $PT$\nconjugate bra. And this inner product is positive definite. Moreover, for the\npure $1/k^4$ propagator the Hamiltonian turns out to not be diagonalizable, and\nagain there are no states of negative energy or of negative norm. Instead there\nare states of zero norm, non-standard but perfectly acceptable states that\nserve to maintain probability conservation. With the locally conformal\ninvariant fourth-order derivative conformal gravity theory being in this\ncategory, it can be offered as a candidate theory of quantum gravity that is\nrenormalizable and unitary in four spacetime dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 01:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

While\nimproving the robustness of neural networks is one promising approach to\nmitigate this issue, an appealing alternate to robustifying networks against\nall possible test-time shifts is to instead directly adapt them to unlabeled\ninputs from the particular distribution shift we encounter at test time.\nHowever, this poses a challenging question: in the standard Bayesian model for\nsupervised learning, unlabeled inputs are conditionally independent of model\nparameters when the labels are unobserved, so what can unlabeled data tell us\nabout the model parameters at test-time? In this paper, we derive a Bayesian\nmodel that provides for a well-defined relationship between unlabeled inputs\nunder distributional shift and model parameters, and show how approximate\ninference in this model can be instantiated with a simple regularized entropy\nminimization procedure at test-time. We evaluate our method on a variety of\ndistribution shifts for image classification, including image corruptions,\nnatural distribution shifts, and domain adaptation settings, and show that our\nmethod improves both accuracy and uncertainty estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 01:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

Artificially reducing the ion/electron mass ratio is a\ntime-honored practice to reduce simulation costs. Usually, this is a severe\napproximation. However, for steady-state collisionless, electrostatic\n(Vlasov-Poisson) systems, the solution with reduced mass ratio can be scaled to\nthe solution for the real mass ratio, with no approximation. This 'scaled mass'\nmethod, which works with already-existing PIC codes, can reduce the computation\ntime for a large class of electrostatic PIC simulations by the square root of\nthe mass ratio. The particle distributions of the resulting steady state must\nbe trivially rescaled to yield the true distributions, but the self-consistent\nelectrostatic field is independent of the mass ratio.

The cyclotron wave modes in\nthe sense of ions or electrons are among the most crucial wave components.\nHowever, their origin and evolution in the inner heliosphere close to the Sun\nremain mysteries. Specifically, it remains unknown whether it is an emitted\nsignal from the solar atmosphere or an eigenmode growing locally in the\nheliosphere due to plasma instability. To address and resolve this controversy,\nwe must investigate the key quantity of the energy change rate of the wave\nmode. We develop a new technique to measure the energy change rate of plasma\nwaves, and apply this technique to the wave electromagnetic fields measured by\nPSP. We provide the wave Poynting flux in the solar wind frame, identify the\nwave nature to be the outward propagating fast-magnetosonic/whistler wave mode\ninstead of the sunward propagating waves. We provide the first evidence for\ngrowth of the fast-magnetosonic/whistler wave mode in the inner heliosphere\nbased on the derived spectra of the real and imaginary parts of the wave\nfrequencies. The energy change rate rises and stays at a positive level in the\nsame wavenumber range as the bumps of the electromagnetic field power spectral\ndensities, clearly manifesting that the observed fast-magnetosonic/whistler\nwaves are locally growing to a large amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 02:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Furthermore, signs of\nplanet formation, gaps in the disk at a distance of several 10 astronomical\nunits (AU) from the central protostar are also reported. From a theoretical\npoint of view, however, it is not clear how planet form at the outer region of\na disk despite the difficulty due to rapid inward drift of dust so called\nradial drift barrier. Here, on the basis of three-dimensional\nmagneto-hydrodynamical simulations of disk evolution with the dust growth, we\npropose a mechanism named \"ash-fall\" phenomenon induced by powerful molecular\noutflow driven by magnetic field which may circumvent the radial drift barrier.\nWe found that the large dust which grows to a size of $\\sim \\cm$ in the inner\nregion of a disk is entrained by an outflow from the disk. Then large dust\ndecoupled from gas is ejected from the outflow due to centrifugal force,\nenriching the grown dust in the envelope and is eventually fall onto the outer\nedge of the disk. The overall process is similar to behaviour of ash-fall from\nvolcanic eruptions. In the ash-fall phenomenon, the Stokes number of dust\nincreases by reaccreting to the less dense disk outer edge. This may make the\ndust grains overcome the radial drift barrier. Consequently, the ash-fall\nphenomenon can provide a crucial assist for making the formation of the\nplanetesimals in outer region of the disk possible, and hence the formation of\nwide-orbit planets and the formation of the gaps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 03:42:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 06:35:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 07:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

In order for\na robot to influence people in the same way, the robot should be able to\nimitate the range of human emotions when speaking. To achieve this, we propose\na speech synthesis method for imitating the emotional states in human speech.\nIn contrast to previous methods, the advantage of our method is that it\nrequires less manual effort to adjust the emotion of the synthesized speech.\nOur synthesizer receives an emotion vector to characterize the emotion of\nsynthesized speech. The vector is automatically obtained from human utterances\nby using a speech emotion recognizer. We evaluated our method in a scenario\nwhen a robot tries to regulate an elderly person's circadian rhythm by speaking\nto the person using appropriate emotional states. For the target speech to\nimitate, we collected utterances from professional caregivers when they speak\nto elderly people at different times of the day. Then we conducted a subjective\nevaluation where the elderly participants listened to the speech samples\ngenerated by our method. The results showed that listening to the samples made\nthe participants feel more active in the early morning and calmer in the middle\nof the night. This suggests that the robot may be able to adjust the\nparticipants' circadian rhythm and that the robot can potentially exert\ninfluence similarly to a person.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 04:12:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

DRMRR uses a Distributionally\nRobust Optimization (DRO) framework to minimize a multi-output loss function\nunder the most adverse distributions in the neighborhood of the empirical data\ndistribution defined by a Wasserstein ball. We show that this is equivalent to\na regularized regression problem with a matrix norm regularizer. Our\nexperiments were conducted on two real-world applications, medical document\nretrieval, and drug response prediction, showing that DRMRR notably outperforms\nstate-of-the-art LTR models. We also conducted a comprehensive analysis to\nassess the resilience of DRMRR against various types of noise: Gaussian noise,\nadversarial perturbations, and label poisoning. We show that DRMRR is not only\nable to achieve significantly better performance than other baselines, but it\ncan maintain a relatively stable performance as more noise is added to the\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 05:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

To reduce a mismatch in the ASR decoder\nbetween teacher-forcing during training and conditioning on CTC outputs during\ntesting, we also propose sampling CTC outputs during training. Experimental\nevaluations on three corpora show that Fast-MD achieved about 2x and 4x faster\ndecoding speed than that of the na\\\"ive MD model on GPU and CPU with comparable\ntranslation quality.

A method to solve this problem is to assume a prior\ndistribution on the full rooted trees. This enables the optimal model selection\nbased on the Bayes decision theory.

The key novelty of our formulation is that it is a\nconstant sum game, i.e., the total payoff across all service providers (or\ncoalitions of providers) is fixed, and dictated by the total size of the\nmarket. The game thus captures the tension between resource pooling (to benefit\nfrom the resulting statistical economies of scale) and competition between\ncoalitions over market share. In a departure from the prior literature on\nresource pooling for congestible services, we show that the grand coalition is\nin general not stable, once we allow for competition over market share.\nInstead, the stable configurations are duopolies, where the dominant coalition\nexploits its economies of scale to corner a disproportionate market share.

Typically, the goal of the problem is to predict different types\nof crimes for each geographical region (like a neighborhood or censor tract) in\nthe near future. Since nearby regions usually have similar socioeconomic\ncharacteristics which indicate similar crime patterns, recent state-of-the-art\nsolutions constructed a distance-based region graph and utilized Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) techniques for crime forecasting, because the GNN techniques\ncould effectively exploit the latent relationships between neighboring region\nnodes in the graph. However, this distance-based pre-defined graph cannot fully\ncapture crime correlation between regions that are far from each other but\nshare similar crime patterns. Hence, to make an accurate crime prediction, the\nmain challenge is to learn a better graph that reveals the dependencies between\nregions in crime occurrences and meanwhile captures the temporal patterns from\nhistorical crime records. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end\ngraph convolutional recurrent network called HAGEN with several novel designs\nfor crime prediction. Specifically, our framework could jointly capture the\ncrime correlation between regions and the temporal crime dynamics by combining\nan adaptive region graph learning module with the Diffusion Convolution Gated\nRecurrent Unit (DCGRU). Based on the homophily assumption of GNN, we propose a\nhomophily-aware constraint to regularize the optimization of the region graph\nso that neighboring region nodes on the learned graph share similar crime\npatterns, thus fitting the mechanism of diffusion convolution. It also\nincorporates crime embedding to model the interdependencies between regions and\ncrime categories. Empirical experiments and comprehensive analysis on two\nreal-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of HAGEN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 07:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

The CO line shows an absorption\ncore at beam positions within Pluto's disk, a direct signature of Pluto's cold\nmesosphere. Analysis provides tentative evidence for a non-uniform temperature\nfield in the lower atmosphere (near 30 km), with summer pole latitudes being\n7$\\pm$3.5 K warmer than low latitudes. This unexpected result may point to\nshorter radiative timescales in the atmosphere than previously thought. The HCN\nemission is considerably more extended than CO, peaking at radial distances\nbeyond Pluto limb, and providing a new method to determine Pluto's HCN vertical\nprofile in 2017. The mean (column-averaged) location of HCN is at 690+/-75 km\naltitude, with an upper atmosphere (> 800 km) mixing ratio of ~ 1.8 x\n10$^{-4}$. Little or no HCN (<5 x 10$^{-9}$ at 65 km) is present in the lower\natmosphere, implying undersaturation of HCN there.

The\nnormal training paradigm from such biased data tends to repetitively generate\nrecommendations from the head items, which further exacerbates the biases and\naffects the exploration of potentially interesting items from the niche set. In\nthis work, distinct from existing methods, we innovatively explore the central\ntheme of unbiased recommendation from an item cluster-wise multi-objective\noptimization perspective. Aiming to balance the learning on various item\nclusters that differ in popularity during the training process, we characterize\nthe recommendation task as an item cluster-wise multi-objective optimization\nproblem. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic framework namely Item\nCluster-Wise Multi-Objective Recommendation (ICMRec) for unbiased\nrecommendation. In detail, we define our item cluster-wise optimization target\nthat the recommender model should balance all item clusters that differ in\npopularity. Thus we set the model learning on each item cluster as a unique\noptimization objective. To achieve this goal, we first explore items'\npopularity levels from a novel causal reasoning perspective.

Our findings reveal how such a multi-layer arrangement strongly\naffects the attenuation of the surface wave motion within and after the\nbarrier.

Recently,\nit has been predicted that external magnetic field can introduce rich physics\ninto two-dimensional (2D) HOTIs. However, up to now the theoretical description\nis still incomplete and the experimental realization is still lacking. Here we\ninvestigate the influence of continuously varying magnetic field on 2D\nSu-Schriffer-Heeger lattice, which is one of the most celebrated HOTI models,\nand proposed a corresponding circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) simulator.\nOur numerical calculation shows that the zero energy corner modes (ZECMs),\nwhich can serve as evidence of the high order topology of the lattice, exhibit\nexotic and rich dependence on the imposed magnetic field and the inhomogeneous\nhopping strength. Moreover, by exploiting the parametric conversion method, we\ncan establish time- and site-resolved tunable hopping constants in the proposed\ncQED simulator, thus providing an ideal platform for simulating the magnetic\nfield induced topological phase transitions in 2D HOTIs. Since the high-order\ntopological phases of the proposed model can be characterized by the existence\nof the ZECMs on the lattice, we further investigate the corner site excitation\nof the lattice in the steady state limit. Our numerical results imply that the\npredicted topological phase transitions can be unambiguously identified by the\nsteady-state photon number measurement of the corner sites and their few\nneighbors. Requiring only current level of technology, our scheme can be\nreadily tested in experiment and may pave an alternative way towards the future\ninvestigation of HOTIs in the presence of magnetic field, disorder, and strong\ncorrelation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 10:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

A classical global pooled\nrepresentation will probably lose useful local information. Many few-shot\nlearning methods have recently addressed this challenge using deep descriptors\nand learning a pixel-level metric. However, using deep descriptors as feature\nrepresentations may lose image contextual information. Moreover, most of these\nmethods independently address each class in the support set, which cannot\nsufficiently use discriminative information and task-specific embeddings. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel transformer-based neural network architecture\ncalled sparse spatial transformers (SSFormers), which finds task-relevant\nfeatures and suppresses task-irrelevant features. Particularly, we first divide\neach input image into several image patches of different sizes to obtain dense\nlocal features.

A unique gate voltage\ndependence on the RS is identified which has a remarkable impact on the\nswitching performance of MoS2 RRAM. RS behavior was found to be significantly\ndependent on the charge conduction in the channel. Moreover, we have shown a\npotential device forming event when MoS2 gated RRAMs were subjected to a\nsteady-state electrical stress. Both hysteresis and steady state electrical\nstress were found to disturb the transistor action of these gated RRAMs, which\nin fact can be used as a signature of RS. Interestingly, current-voltage\nhysteresis resulted in unipolar RS, whereas steady-state electrical stress\nbefore RS measurement led to bipolar RS. Moreover, successive stress cycles of\nsuch an electrical stress leads to multiple resistance states, a behavior\nsimilar to synaptic properties like long-term potentiation and long-term\ndepression, typically found in memristors. We find that charge transport\nmechanism dominant in the MoS2 FET in conjunction with steady-state stress\ninduced device forming determine the extent of RS induced in these MoS2 based\ngated RRAMs. Finally on the basis of insights developed from the dependence on\ncharge transport mechanism and steady-state stress induced forming of MoS2\nchannel, we propose a certain steady-state electrical stress condition which\ncan be used as a forming process employed prior to use of MoS2 based binary\nRRAMs for improved switching performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 10:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

We first analyze the case without exonuclease activity. In that\ncase, accuracy is determined by a kinetic competition between stepping and\nunbinding, with discrimination between correct and incorrect nucleotides in\nboth transitions.

The analysis also shows that the design of a replication system\ndoes not universally have to follow the speed-accuracy trade-off rule, although\nit does in the biologically realized parameter range.

Using this example of ad-hoc communication\nbetween aircraft mid-flight, a tutorial-style description is attempted that\nshall show how the OMNeT++ simulator can be used when a wealth of real-world\ntrace data is available. In particular, it is described how mobility trace\nfiles can be directly used within OMNeT++, and how to link the generation of\ndata messages to this mobility data. This is explained via an example\nsimulation that evaluates a communication network in which an aircraft notifies\nthe ground control when it enters or leaves a specific geographic region.\nAdditionally, a novel trace-based application has been developed to achieve\nthis link between mobility and message generation. Furthermore, a new\nTDMA-based medium access protocol for decentralized communication networks is\npresented, which is oracle-based and thus allows a TDMA-like behavior of medium\naccess without causing any overhead; it can be useful when upper-layer\nprotocols should be evaluated under the assumption of TDMA-like behavior, but\nisolated from the effects of a full-fledged TDMA protocol. Finally, physical\nlayer behavior is often either overly simplistic or overly computationally\nexpensive. For the latter case, when a detailed channel model is available but\nits evaluation requires prohibitive computational effort, then averaging its\nbehavior into trace data can find a middle ground between efficient evaluation\nand realistic representation. Hence, a novel trace-based radio model has been\ndeveloped that makes use of an SNR to PER mapping.

Most notably, this indistinguishability requires the\nthree-body trion state to have p-wave symmetry. To explore the consequences of\nthis, we evaluate the system's optical properties within a polaron description,\nwhich can interpolate from the low density limit -- where the relevant\nexcitations are few-body bound states -- to higher density many-body states. In\nthe parameter regime where the trion is bound, we demonstrate that the spectrum\nis characterized by an attractive quasiparticle branch, a repulsive branch, and\na many-body continuum, and we evaluate the doping dependence of the\ncorresponding energies and spectral weights. In particular, at low doping we\nfind that the oscillator strength of the attractive branch scales with the\nsquare of the Fermi energy as a result of the trion's p-wave symmetry. Upon\nincreasing density, we find that both the repulsive and attractive branches\nblueshift, and that the orbital character of the states associated with these\nbranches interchanges.

Deep learning with Differential Privacy (DP) was implemented as a\npractical learning algorithm at a manageable cost in complexity. However, DP is\nvulnerable to aggressive Bayesian restoration attacks as disclosed in the\nliterature and demonstrated in experimental results of this work.

To our best knowledge, this Bayesian\nPrivacy analysis is the first to provides theoretical justification of secure\nprivacy-preserving capabilities against Bayesian restoration attacks.

Our main objective is to resolve limitations of previous\napproaches, that means to simultaneously cope with various noise sources,\nperform exact beat segmentation, and to retain diagnostically important\nmorphological information. Methods: We therefore propose a model that is based\non Hermite and sigmoid functions combined with piecewise polynomial\ninterpolation for exact segmentation and low-dimensional representation of\nindividual ECG beat segments. Hermite and sigmoidal functions enable reliable\nextraction of important ECG waveform information while the piecewise polynomial\ninterpolation captures noisy signal features like the BLW. For that we use\nvariable projection, which allows the separation of linear and nonlinear\nmorphological variations of the according ECG waveforms.

Based on our\nresults, we can identify three different regions of interest. For inhomogeneous\nbroadening less than 0.3 MHz, typical of diamonds used in state of the art\nsensing experiments, Ramsey interferometry yields the highest sensitivity. In\nthe regime where inhomogeneous broadening is greater than 0.3 MHz, such as for\nstandard optical grade diamonds or in miniaturized integrated devices, drive\namplitude variations determine the optimal protocol to use. For low to medium\ndrive amplitude variations, the highest sensitivity is reached using pi-pulse\nODMR. For high drive amplitude variations, relevant for widefield microscopic\nimaging, CW ODMR can yield the best sensing performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 13:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

Currently, this is typically\nachieved through centralised cloud-based data analytics services. However,\naccording to many studies, this approach may present significant issues from\nthe standpoint of data ownership, and even wireless network capacity. One\npossibility to cope with these shortcomings is to move data analytics closer to\nwhere data is generated. In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing and\nanalyzing a distributed learning framework, whereby data analytics are\nperformed at the edge of the network, i.e., on locations very close to where\ndata is generated. Specifically, in our framework, partial data analytics are\nperformed directly on the nodes that generate the data, or on nodes close by\n(e.g., some of the data generators can take this role on behalf of subsets of\nother nodes nearby). Then, nodes exchange partial models and refine them\naccordingly. Our framework is general enough to host different analytics\nservices. In the specific case analysed in the paper, we focus on a learning\ntask, considering two distributed learning algorithms. Using an activity\nrecognition and a pattern recognition task, both on reference datasets, we\ncompare the two learning algorithms between each other and with a central cloud\nsolution (i.e., one that has access to the complete datasets). Our results show\nthat using distributed machine learning techniques, it is possible to\ndrastically reduce the network overhead, while obtaining performance comparable\nto the cloud solution in terms of learning accuracy. The analysis also shows\nwhen each distributed learning approach is preferable, based on the specific\ndistribution of the data on the nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 13:44:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

It follows the trend of simplifying\nthe network by pushing the functionalities to the edge. Fastpod explores an\nextreme end of the design spectrum and can be treated as a thought experiment\nto raise discussion in the community of data center networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 14:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

In particular, neural network models can describe\ninteractions at the level of accuracy of quantum mechanics-based calculations,\nbut with a fraction of the cost, enabling the simulation of large systems over\nlong timescales with ab initio accuracy. However, implicit in the construction\nof neural network potentials is an assumption of locality, wherein atomic\narrangements on the scale of about a nanometer are used to learn interatomic\ninteractions. Because of this assumption, the resulting neural network models\ncannot describe long-range interactions that play critical roles in dielectric\nscreening and chemical reactivity. To address this issue, we introduce the\nself-consistent field neural network (SCFNN) model -- a general approach for\nlearning the long-range response of molecular systems in neural network\npotentials. The SCFNN model relies on a physically meaningful separation of the\ninteratomic interactions into short- and long-range components, with a separate\nnetwork to handle each component. We demonstrate the success of the SCFNN\napproach in modeling the dielectric properties of bulk liquid water, and show\nthat the SCFNN model accurately predicts long-range polarization correlations\nand the response of water to applied electrostatic fields. Importantly, because\nof the separation of interactions inherent in our approach, the SCFNN model can\nbe combined with many existing approaches for building neural network\npotentials. Therefore, we expect the SCFNN model to facilitate the proper\ndescription of long-range interactions in a wide-variety of machine\nlearning-based force fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 14:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

Then, we link the structural information to the\nmicroscopic arrangement through a detailed cluster analysis of Monte Carlo\nconfigurations. In this regard, we devise a novel method to compute the maximum\ndistance for which two spheres can be regarded as bonded together, a crucial\nissue in the proper identification of fluid aggregates.

We also observe that\nstreaming rate can change under different conditions (e.g., number of users in\na session, mobile device status, etc), which affects user-perceived streaming\nquality. Beyond these findings, our measurement methodology can enable\nreproducible benchmark analysis for any types of comparative or longitudinal\nstudy on available videoconferencing systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

Unfortunately, an ultrasound image is a low-quality version of\nthe expected Tissue Reflectivity Function (TRF) mainly due to the non-ideal\nPoint Spread Function (PSF) of the imaging system. This paper presents a novel\nbeamforming approach based on deep learning to get closer to the ideal PSF in\nPlane-Wave Imaging (PWI). The proposed approach is designed to reconstruct the\ndesired TRF from echo traces acquired by transducer elements using only a\nsingle plane-wave transmission. In this approach, first, an ideal model for the\nTRF is introduced by setting the imaging PSF as a sharp Gaussian function.\nThen, a mapping function between the pre-beamformed Radio-Frequency (RF)\nchannel data and the proposed TRF is constructed using deep learning. Network\narchitecture contains multi-resolution decomposition and reconstruction using\nwavelet transform for effective recovery of high-frequency content of the\ndesired TRF. Inspired by curriculum learning, we exploit step by step training\nfrom coarse (mean square error) to fine ($\\ell_{0.2}$) loss functions. The\nproposed method is trained on a large number of simulation ultrasound data with\nthe ground-truth echogenicity map extracted from real photographic images. The\nperformance of the trained network is evaluated on the publicly available\nsimulation and \\textit{in vivo} test data without any further fine-tuning.\nSimulation test results confirm that the proposed method reconstructs images\nwith a high quality in terms of resolution and contrast, which are also\nvisually similar to the proposed ground-truth image. Furthermore, \\textit{in\nvivo} results show that the trained mapping function preserves its performance\nin the new domain. Therefore, the proposed approach maintains high resolution,\ncontrast, and framerate simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

Extensions to continuous exposures,\nhowever, either quantify the effects of interventions that are rarely relevant\n(e.g., applying the same exposure level uniformly in the population), or\nconsider shift interventions that are rarely intended, raising the question how\nlarge a shift to consider. Average derivative effects (ADEs) instead express\nthe effect of an infinitesimal shift in each subject's exposure level, making\ninference less prone to extrapolation. ADEs, however, are rarely considered in\npractice because their estimation usually requires estimation of (a) the\nconditional density of exposure given covariates, and (b) the derivative of (a)\nw.r.t. exposure. Here, we introduce a class of estimands which can be inferred\nwithout requiring estimates of (a) and (b), but which reduce to ADEs when the\nexposure obeys a specific distribution determined by the choice of estimand in\nthe class. We moreover show that when the exposure does not obey this\ndistribution, our estimand represents an ADE w.r.t. an `intervention' exposure\ndistribution.

We\ndiscuss the dependence of the imprinted spin texture on the wave-vector of the\nhelical structure, and on the strength of the effective local exchange field.\nBased on these results we discuss the nature of the superconducting\ninstabilities that can take place in helimagnet encapsulated twisted bilayer\ngraphene. Our results put forward helimagnetic encapsulation as a powerful way\nof designing spin-textured flat band systems, providing a starting point to\nengineer a new family of correlated moire states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:44:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 14:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

Therefore, we go beyond classical\ninterpolatory quadrature by lowering the degree of the polynomial approximant\nand by applying auxiliary mapping functions that map the original quadrature\nnodes to more suitable fake nodes. More precisely, we investigate the\ncombination of the Kosloff Tal-Ezer map and least-squares approximation (KTL)\nfor numerical quadrature: a careful selection of the mapping parameter ensures\nstability of the scheme, a high accuracy of the approximation and, at the same\ntime, an asymptotically optimal ratio between the degree of the polynomial and\nthe spacing of the grid.

During the development and deployment\nof federated models, they are exposed to risks including illegal copying,\nre-distribution, misuse and/or free-riding. To address these risks, the\nownership verification of federated learning models is a prerequisite that\nprotects federated learning model intellectual property rights (IPR) i.e.,\nFedIPR. We propose a novel federated deep neural network (FedDNN) ownership\nverification scheme that allows private watermarks to be embedded and verified\nto claim legitimate IPR of FedDNN models. In the proposed scheme, each client\nindependently verifies the existence of the model watermarks and claims\nrespective ownership of the federated model without disclosing neither private\ntraining data nor private watermark information. The effectiveness of embedded\nwatermarks is theoretically justified by the rigorous analysis of conditions\nunder which watermarks can be privately embedded and detected by multiple\nclients. Moreover, extensive experimental results on computer vision and\nnatural language processing tasks demonstrate that varying bit-length\nwatermarks can be embedded and reliably detected without compromising original\nmodel performances. Our watermarking scheme is also resilient to various\nfederated training settings and robust against removal attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 12:51:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 14:05:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 05:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

One, they do not typically generalize\nwell outside of the distribution for which they were trained, and two, they\ntend to exhibit confident behavior regardless of whether or not they are\nproducing meaningful outputs. While Deep Learning possesses immense power to\nsolve realistic, high-dimensional problems, these traits in concert make it\ndifficult to have confidence in their real-world applications. To overcome this\ndifficulty, the task of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) Detection has been defined,\nto determine when a model has received an input from outside of the\ndistribution for which it is trained to operate.\n  This paper introduces and examines a novel methodology, DOODLER, for OOD\nDetection, which directly leverages the traits which result in its necessity.\nBy training a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) on the same data as another Deep\nLearning model, the VAE learns to accurately reconstruct In-Distribution (ID)\ninputs, but not to reconstruct OOD inputs, meaning that its failure state can\nbe used to perform OOD Detection. Unlike other work in the area, DOODLER\nrequires only very weak assumptions about the existence of an OOD dataset,\nallowing for more realistic application. DOODLER also enables pixel-wise\nsegmentations of input images by OOD likelihood, and experimental results show\nthat it matches or outperforms methodologies that operate under the same\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 14:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

In particular, complex non-spherical configurations known as `pasta'\nphases may exist at the highest densities in the inner crust, potentially\nhaving an impact on different neutron-star phenomena. We study the properties\nof the pasta phase and the uncertainties in the pasta observables which are due\nto our incomplete knowledge of the nuclear energy functional. To this aim, we\nemployed a compressible liquid-drop model approach with surface parameters\noptimised either on experimental nuclear masses or theoretical calculations. To\nassess the model uncertainties, we performed a Bayesian analysis by largely\nvarying the model parameters using uniform priors, and generating posterior\ndistributions with filters accounting for both our present low-density nuclear\nphysics knowledge and high-density neutron-star physics constraints. Our\nresults show that the nuclear physics constraints, such as the neutron-matter\nequation of state at very low density and the experimental mass measurements,\nare crucial in determining the crustal and pasta observables. Accounting for\nall constraints, we demonstrate that the presence of pasta phases is robustly\npredicted in an important fraction of the inner crust. We estimate the relative\ncrustal thickness associated with pasta phases as $R_{\\rm pasta}/R_{\\rm\ncrust}=0.128\\pm 0.047$ and the relative moment of inertia as $I_{\\rm\npasta}/I_{\\rm crust}=0.480\\pm 0.137$. Our findings indicate that the surface\nand curvature parameters are more influential than the bulk parameters for the\ndescription of pasta observables. We also show that using a surface tension\nthat is inconsistent with the bulk functional leads to an underestimation of\nboth the average values and the uncertainties in the pasta properties, thus\nhighlighting the importance of a consistent calculation of the nuclear\nfunctional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 06:47:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 06:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

Neural Transducer based models are increasingly popular in\nstreaming E2E based ASR systems and have been reported to outperform the\ntraditional hybrid system in some scenarios. However, the joint optimization of\nacoustic model, lexicon and language model in neural Transducer also brings\nabout challenges to utilize pure text for language model adaptation. This\ndrawback might prevent their potential applications in practice. In order to\naddress this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel model, factorized neural\nTransducer, by factorizing the blank and vocabulary prediction, and adopting a\nstandalone language model for the vocabulary prediction. It is expected that\nthis factorization can transfer the improvement of the standalone language\nmodel to the Transducer for speech recognition, which allows various language\nmodel adaptation techniques to be applied. We demonstrate that the proposed\nfactorized neural Transducer yields 15% to 20% WER improvements when\nout-of-domain text data is used for language model adaptation, at the cost of a\nminor degradation in WER on a general test set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:04:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 04:56:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 07:29:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 15:09:59 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 08:03:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

Existing dynamic embedding methods on TIG discretely\nupdate node embeddings merely when an interaction occurs. They fail to capture\nthe continuous dynamic evolution of embedding trajectories of nodes. In this\npaper, we propose a two-module framework named ConTIG, a continuous\nrepresentation method that captures the continuous dynamic evolution of node\nembedding trajectories. With two essential modules, our model exploit\nthree-fold factors in dynamic networks which include latest interaction,\nneighbor features and inherent characteristics. In the first update module, we\nemploy a continuous inference block to learn the nodes' state trajectories by\nlearning from time-adjacent interaction patterns between node pairs using\nordinary differential equations. In the second transform module, we introduce a\nself-attention mechanism to predict future node embeddings by aggregating\nhistorical temporal interaction information. Experiments results demonstrate\nthe superiority of ConTIG on temporal link prediction, temporal node\nrecommendation and dynamic node classification tasks compared with a range of\nstate-of-the-art baselines, especially for long-interval interactions\nprediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 12:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

The second DPRK test had no reliable aftershock hypotheses at the\nlevel of the method sensitivity and resolution. The closest to the test site\narray station USRK was not operational before 20.12.2008 and the first DPRK\ntest cannot be analyzed by the multi-master method based on waveform templates\nfrom two IMS stations - USRK and KSRS. The largest aftershocks of the DPRK3 and\nDPRK4 are close in magnitude to the first aftershock of the DPRK5 on\n11.09.2016, and many aftershocks of the DPRK6. Three big aftershocks of the\nDPRK3 occurred on 25.05.2014, i.e. 467 days after the mainshock. The DPRK3\naftershock found at 6:43:03 UTC had a relative magnitude of 2.91. There were\nfound two aftershocks of the DPRK4: on 19.02.2016 (0:28:07 UTC) and on\n02.07.2016 (19:52:27 UTC). The largest aftershocks of the DPRK3 and DPRK4 could\nbe interpreted as related to the cavity collapse process likely followed by a\nchimney collapse, not reaching the free surface, however, as no noble gases\nand/or radionuclide particles were detected. Seismic signals from all events\nfound before the DPRK5 (09.09.2016), had a high level of cross-correlation with\nthe waveform templates of the DRPK5 and DPRK6. These signals prove the shape\nsimilarity, and thus, the close spatial proximity of the seismic events after\nDPRK3/DPRK4 to the DPRK5/DPRK6 aftershocks. There were no other events found by\nthe multi-master method since 01.01.2009, even when the highest resolution\nregime was used. The resolution and sensitivity of the multi-master method were\ntuned and tested using the data after 09.09.2016.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 09:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

Although such plots are prevalent in engineering for more than 150\nyears, their theoretical understanding is lacking. Recently a scaling theory of\nW\\\"ohler plots in the context of cyclic bending was offered [1]. Here we\nelaborate further on cyclic bending and extend the considerations to cyclic\ntensile loads on an amorphous strip of material; the scaling theory applies to\nboth types of cyclic loading equally well. On the basis of atomistic\nsimulations we conclude that the crucial quantities to focus on are the\naccumulated damage and the average damage per cycle. The dependence of these\nquantities on the loading determines the statistics of the number of cycles to\nfailure. Finally we consider the probability distribution functions of the\nnumber of cycles to failure and demonstrate that the scaling theory allows\nprediction of these distributions at one value of the forcing amplitude from\nmeasurements and another value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Sep 2021 16:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}
