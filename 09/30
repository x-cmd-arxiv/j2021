This has become arguably more so in the\ncase of learning-based agents. To this end, considerable recent effort has been\ndevoted to developing increasingly realistic and higher fidelity simulators.\nHowever, we lack any principled way to evaluate how good a \"proxy domain\" is,\nspecifically in terms of how useful it is in helping us achieve our end\nobjective of building an agent that performs well in the target domain. In this\nwork, we investigate methods to address this need.

In this paper, we attempt to clarify the role of\nproxy domains and establish new proxy usefulness (PU) metrics to compare the\nusefulness of different proxy domains. We propose the relative predictive PU to\nassess the predictive ability of a proxy domain and the learning PU to quantify\nthe usefulness of a proxy as a tool to generate learning data.

First, we characterize DRAM timing parameter margins\nand find that certain regions of DRAM can be accessed faster than other regions\ndue to DRAM cell process manufacturing variation. We exploit this by enabling\nvariable access times depending on the DRAM cells being accessed, which not\nonly improves overall system performance, but also decreases power consumption.\nSecond, we find that we can uniquely identify DRAM devices by the locations of\nfailures that result when we access DRAM with timing parameters reduced below\nspecification values. Because we induce these failures with DRAM accesses, we\ncan generate these unique identifiers significantly more quickly than prior\nwork.

However, existing deep blind methods\nusually directly reconstruct the image without predicting the quality factor,\nthus lacking the flexibility to control the output as the non-blind methods. To\nremedy this problem, in this paper, we propose a flexible blind convolutional\nneural network, namely FBCNN, that can predict the adjustable quality factor to\ncontrol the trade-off between artifacts removal and details preservation.\nSpecifically, FBCNN decouples the quality factor from the JPEG image via a\ndecoupler module and then embeds the predicted quality factor into the\nsubsequent reconstructor module through a quality factor attention block for\nflexible control. Besides, we find existing methods are prone to fail on\nnon-aligned double JPEG images even with only a one-pixel shift, and we thus\npropose a double JPEG degradation model to augment the training data.

The\nanalysis of QMHD relies upon the use of Madelung transformations. The rigorous\nderivation requires non-trivial smoothing estimates, which are obtained by\nassuming slightly higher regularity for the electromagnetic potential. These\nassumptions are motivated by the nonlinear dependence of the hydrodynamic\nsystem in terms of the underlying wave function dynamics, which is\nsupercritical with respect to the bare energy bounds. Due to quantum effects on\nthe dispersive properties of QMHD, our approach requires neither smallness nor\nhigh regularity, unlike a large amount of existing literature for\nEuler-Maxwell's classical system. For quantum MHD system the irrotationality\nand the presence of a highly nonlinear quantum stress tensor induce much\nstronger dispersive properties, as a byproduct of a close relationship with the\nclassical Maxwell-Schr\\\"odinger system.

Our bounds depend on the\ninterplay between a pair of graphs: the Tanner graph of the set of measured\nPauli operators, and the connectivity graph which represents the qubit\nconnections required to implement the circuit. For local-expander quantum\ncodes, which are promising for low-overhead quantum error correction, we prove\nthat any syndrome extraction circuit implemented with local Clifford gates in a\n2D square patch of $N$ qubits has depth at least $\\Omega(n/\\sqrt{N})$ where $n$\nis the code length. Then, we propose two families of quantum circuits\nsaturating this bound. First, we construct 2D local syndrome extraction\ncircuits for quantum LDPC codes with bounded depth using only $O(n^2)$ ancilla\nqubits. Second, we design a family of 2D local syndrome extraction circuits for\nhypergraph product codes using $O(n)$ ancilla qubits with depth $O(\\sqrt{n})$.\nFinally, we use circuit noise simulations to compare the performance of a\nfamily of hypergraph product codes using this last family of 2D syndrome\nextraction circuits with a syndrome extraction circuit implemented with fully\nconnected qubits. While there is a threshold of about $10^{-3}$ for a fully\nconnected implementation, we observe no threshold for the 2D local\nimplementation despite simulating error rates of as low as $10^{-6}$. This\nsuggests that quantum LDPC codes are impractical with 2D local quantum\nhardware. We believe that our proof technique is of independent interest and\ncould find other applications. Our bounds on circuit sizes are derived from a\nlower bound on the amount of correlations between two subsets of qubits of the\ncircuit and an upper bound on the amount of correlations introduced by each\ncircuit gate, which together provide a lower bound on the circuit size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 17:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

These distance constraints would translate to a < 4%\nprecision measurement on $H_{\\rm 0}$ in flat $\\Lambda CDM$ for a single lens.\nOur study shows that IFU stellar kinematics of time-delay strong lenses will be\nkey in lifting the MSD on a per lens basis, assuming reasonable core sizes.\nHowever, even in the limit of infinite $r_{\\rm c}$, where $D_{\\Delta t}$ is\ndegenerate with $\\lambda_{\\rm int}$, stellar kinematics of the deflector, time\ndelays and imaging data will provide powerful constraints on $D_{\\rm d}$, which\nbecomes the dominant source of information in the cosmological inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

The traditional RAR strategy alters the randomization ratio on\na patient-by-patient basis; this has been heavily criticized for bias due to\ntime-trends. An alternate approach is blocked RAR, which groups patients\ntogether in blocks and recomputes the randomization ratio in a block-wise\nfashion; the final analysis is then stratified by block. However, the typical\nblocked RAR design divides patients into equal-sized blocks, which is not\ngenerally optimal.\n  This paper presents TrialMDP, an algorithm that designs two-armed blocked RAR\nclinical trials. Our method differs from past approaches in that it optimizes\nthe size and number of blocks as well as their treatment allocations. That is,\nthe algorithm yields a policy that adaptively chooses the size and composition\nof the next block, based on results seen up to that point in the trial.\nTrialMDP is related to past works that compute optimal trial designs via\ndynamic programming.\n  The algorithm maximizes a utility function balancing (i) statistical power,\n(ii) patient outcomes, and (iii) the number of blocks.

In the HH model, layered structures undulate and\nbuckle in response to local, geometric incompatibilities, in order to maintain\nthe preferred layer spacing. Classic HH systems include cholesteric liquid\ncrystals under electromagnetic field distortions and smectic liquid crystals\nunder mechanical strains, where both materials are confined between rigid\nsubstrates. However, richer phenomena are observed when undulation\ninstabilities occur in the presence of deformable interfaces and variable\nboundary conditions. Understanding how the HH instability is affected by\ndeformable surfaces is imperative for applying the instability to a broader\nrange of materials. In this review, we re-examine the HH instability and give\nspecial focus to how the boundary conditions influence the mechanical response\nof lamellar systems to geometrical frustration.

We then end by identifying similar\nphenomena across a wide variety of materials, both biological and synthetic.\nWith this review, we aim to highlight that the HH instability is a generic and\noften overlooked response of periodic materials to geometrical frustration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 19:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

First, a coded\ncaching method is used, where each file is split into the same type of\nfragments labeled using sets with fixed cardinality, and the optimality of the\nselected cardinality is proved. Optimal file subpacketization by splitting the\nfile into multiple types of fragments labeled with multiple cardinalities is\nthen discussed.

The severity of UC is often\nrepresented by the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) which quantifies mucosal\ndisease activity from endoscopy videos. In clinical trials, an endoscopy video\nis assigned an MES based upon the most severe disease activity observed in the\nvideo. For this reason, severe inflammation spread throughout the colon will\nreceive the same MES as an otherwise healthy colon with severe inflammation\nrestricted to a small, localized segment. Therefore, the extent of disease\nactivity throughout the large intestine, and overall response to treatment, may\nnot be completely captured by the MES. In this work, we aim to automatically\nestimate UC severity for each frame in an endoscopy video to provide a higher\nresolution assessment of disease activity throughout the colon. Because\nannotating severity at the frame-level is expensive, labor-intensive, and\nhighly subjective, we propose a novel weakly supervised, ordinal classification\nmethod to estimate frame severity from video MES labels alone.

Traditional methods\nfor beam alignment require exhaustive sweeps of all possible beam directions,\nthus scale communications overhead linearly with antenna array size. For better\nscaling with the large arrays required at high mmW bands, compressive sensing\nmethods have been proposed as their overhead scales logarithmically with the\narray size.

Traditional model\nreduction techniques use an affine subspace to reduce the dimensionality of the\nsolution manifold and, as a result, yield limited reduction and require\nextensive training due to the slowly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width of\nconvection-dominated problems. The proposed approach circumvents the slowly\ndecaying $n$-width limitation by using a nonlinear approximation manifold\nsystematically defined by composing a low-dimensional affine space with a space\nof bijections of the underlying domain. Central to the implicit feature\ntracking approach is a residual minimization problem over the reduced nonlinear\nmanifold that simultaneously determines the reduced coordinates in the affine\nspace and the domain mapping that minimize the residual of the unreduced PDE\ndiscretization. The nonlinear trial manifold is constructed by using the\nproposed residual minimization formulation to determine domain mappings that\ncause parametrized features to align in a reference domain for a set of\ntraining parameters. Because the feature is stationary in the reference domain,\ni.e., the convective nature of solution removed, the snapshots are effectively\ncompressed to define an affine subspace. The space of domain mappings,\noriginally constructed using high-order finite elements, are also compressed in\na way that ensures the boundaries of the original domain are maintained.\nSeveral numerical experiments are provided, including transonic and supersonic,\ninviscid, compressible flows, to demonstrate the potential of the method to\nyield accurate approximations to convection-dominated problems with limited\ntraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 19:58:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

In general, the number of conflicts to be resolved decides the\nrun time of these planners and most of the existing work focuses on how to\nefficiently resolve these conflicts. In this work, we take a different view and\naim to reduce the number of conflicts (and thus improve the overall search\nefficiency) by improving each agent's individual plan.

In this\ninitial work, we propose a new Unsupervised paradigm for Semantic Image\nSynthesis (USIS) as a first step towards closing the performance gap between\npaired and unpaired settings.

In cases\nwhere meta-domain information such as label distributions is available, weak\nsupervision can further boost performance. We propose a novel framework, CALDA,\nto tackle these two problems. CALDA synergistically combines the principles of\ncontrastive learning and adversarial learning to robustly support multi-source\nUDA (MS-UDA) for time series data. Similar to prior methods, CALDA utilizes\nadversarial learning to align source and target feature representations. Unlike\nprior approaches, CALDA additionally leverages cross-source label information\nacross domains. CALDA pulls examples with the same label close to each other,\nwhile pushing apart examples with different labels, reshaping the space through\ncontrastive learning.

We empirically validate our proposed approach.\nBased on results from human activity recognition, electromyography, and\nsynthetic datasets, we find utilizing cross-source information improves\nperformance over prior time series and contrastive methods.

The approach is able to trade bitcoins in a simulated environment with\nsynchronous data and obtains a 31.67% more return than that of the best\nbenchmark, improving the benchmark by 12.75%.

However, existing\nimage-based motion estimation methods, which optimize the motion field by\nevaluating the local image similarity, are prone to produce implausible\nestimation, especially in the presence of large motion. In this study, we\nprovide a novel motion estimation framework of Dense-Sparse-Dense (DSD), which\ncomprises two stages. In the first stage, we process the raw dense image to\nextract sparse landmarks to represent the target organ anatomical topology and\ndiscard the redundant information that is unnecessary for motion estimation.\nFor this purpose, we introduce an unsupervised 3D landmark detection network to\nextract spatially sparse but representative landmarks for the target organ\nmotion estimation. In the second stage, we derive the sparse motion\ndisplacement from the extracted sparse landmarks of two images of different\ntime points. Then, we present a motion reconstruction network to construct the\nmotion field by projecting the sparse landmarks displacement back into the\ndense image domain. Furthermore, we employ the estimated motion field from our\ntwo-stage DSD framework as initialization and boost the motion estimation\nquality in light-weight yet effective iterative optimization.

A mixed-type DG method in conjunction with the\nstress-velocity formulation is employed for the Stokes equations, where the\nsymmetry of stress is strongly imposed. The staggered DG method is exploited to\ndiscretize the Darcy equations. As such, the discrete formulation can be easily\nadapted to account for the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman interface conditions without\nintroducing additional variables. Importantly, the continuity of normal\nvelocity is satisfied exactly at the discrete level. A rigorous convergence\nanalysis is performed for all the variables.

The convergence of the\nproposed iterative method is analyzed rigorously. In particular, the proposed\niterative method also works for very small viscosity coefficient.

This video summarization method predicts a\nconcise synopsis of the original video based on the user query, which is\ncommonly represented by the input text. However, two inherent problems exist in\nthis query-driven way. First, the text query might not be enough to describe\nthe exact and diverse needs of the user.

The standard way to implement\ndifferential privacy is to inject a sufficient amount of noise into the data.\nHowever, in addition to other limitations of differential privacy, this process\nof adding noise will affect data accuracy and utility. Another approach to\nenable privacy in data sharing is based on the concept of synthetic data. The\ngoal of synthetic data is to create an as-realistic-as-possible dataset, one\nthat not only maintains the nuances of the original data, but does so without\nrisk of exposing sensitive information. The combination of differential privacy\nwith synthetic data has been suggested as a best-of-both-worlds solutions. In\nthis work, we propose the first noisefree method to construct differentially\nprivate synthetic data; we do this through a mechanism called \"private\nsampling\". Using the Boolean cube as benchmark data model, we derive explicit\nbounds on accuracy and privacy of the constructed synthetic data. The key\nmathematical tools are hypercontractivity, duality, and empirical processes. A\ncore ingredient of our private sampling mechanism is a rigorous \"marginal\ncorrection\" method, which has the remarkable property that importance\nreweighting can be utilized to exactly match the marginals of the sample to the\nmarginals of the population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 04:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

However, in certain applications such as Network Intrusion\nDetection Systems, it is challenging to obtain data samples for all attack\nclasses that the model will most likely observe in production. ML-based NIDSs\nface new attack traffic known as zero-day attacks, that are not used in the\ntraining of the learning models due to their non-existence at the time. In this\npaper, a zero-shot learning methodology has been proposed to evaluate the ML\nmodel performance in the detection of zero-day attack scenarios. In the\nattribute learning stage, the ML models map the network data features to\ndistinguish semantic attributes from known attack (seen) classes. In the\ninference stage, the models are evaluated in the detection of zero-day attack\n(unseen) classes by constructing the relationships between known attacks and\nzero-day attacks.

The\nresults demonstrate that while the majority of the attack classes do not\nrepresent significant risks to organisations adopting an ML-based NIDS in a\nzero-day attack scenario.

On these platforms, discussions in the form\nof trending topics provide a glimpse of events happening around the world in\nreal-time. Also, these trends are used for political campaigns, public\nawareness, and brand promotions. Consequently, these trends are sensitive to\nmanipulation by malicious users who aim to mislead the mass audience. In this\narticle, we identify and study the characteristics of users involved in the\nmanipulation of Twitter trends in Pakistan. We propose 'Manipify', a framework\nfor automatic detection and analysis of malicious users for Twitter trends. Our\nframework consists of three distinct modules: i) user classifier, ii) hashtag\nclassifier, and ii) trend analyzer. The user classifier introduces a novel\napproach to automatically detect manipulators using tweet content and user\nbehaviour features. Also, the module classifies human and bot users. Next, the\nhashtag classifier categorizes trending hashtags into six categories assisting\nin examining manipulators behaviour across different categories. Finally, the\ntrend analyzer module examines users, hashtags, and tweets for hashtag reach,\nlinguistic features and user behaviour. Our user classifier module achieves\n0.91 accuracy in classifying the manipulators. We further test Manipify on the\ndataset comprising of 665 trending hashtags with 5.4 million tweets and 1.9\nmillion users. The analysis of trends reveals that the trending panel is mostly\ndominated by political hashtags. In addition, our results show a higher\ncontribution of human accounts in trend manipulation as compared to bots.\nFurthermore, we present two case studies of hashtag-wars and anti-state\npropaganda to implicate the real-world application of our research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 06:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

Several\nPython routines that are commonly employed (e.g., SciPy and NumPy) in the field\nof science and engineering are only required so that the users can alter the\nsoftware structure depending on their needs. The modeling algorithm exploits\nthe Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for the data regression. The discrete\nrelaxation models can be built by a proper combination of well-known relaxation\nmodels. In addition to these models, the electrode polarization, which is a\ncommon measurement artifact for interpreting the dielectric spectra, can be\nincorporated in the modeling algorithm. A continuous relaxation model, which\nsolves the Fredholm integral equation of the first kind (a mathematically\nill-posed problem) is also included. This open-source software enables users to\nfreely adjust the physical parameters so that they can obtain physical insight\ninto their materials under test and will be consistently updated for more\naccurate measurement and interpretation of dielectric spectra in an automated\nmanner. This work describes the theoretical and mathematical background of the\nsoftware, lays out the workflow, validates the software functionality based on\nboth synthetic and empirical data included in the software.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 07:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

Finding\noptimal PC constructions (within a pre-specified parameter space) that generate\nreflection spectra closest to a targeted spectrum is thus an interesting and\nmeaningful inverse design problem, although relevant studies are still limited.\nHere we report a generally effective machine learning-based inverse design\napproach for one-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs), focusing on visible\nlight spectra which are of high practical relevance. For a given class of 1DPC\nsystem, a deep neural network (DNN) in a unified structure is first trained\nover data from sizeable forward calculations (from layer thicknesses to\nspectrum).

These surfaces typically rely on\ntheir reflection beamforming codebooks to reflect and focus the signal on the\ntarget receivers. Prior work has mainly considered pre-defined RIS beamsteering\ncodebooks that do not adapt to the environment and hardware and lead to large\nbeam training overhead. In this work, a novel deep reinforcement learning based\nframework is developed to efficiently construct the RIS reflection beam\ncodebook. This framework adopts a multi-level design approach that transfers\nthe learning between the multiple RIS subarrays, which speeds up the learning\nconvergence and highly reduces the computational complexity for large RIS\nsurfaces. The proposed approach is generic for co-located/distributed RIS\nsurfaces with arbitrary array geometries and with stationary/non-stationary\nchannels. Further, the developed solution does not require explicitly channel\nknowledge and adapts the codebook beams to the surrounding environment, user\ndistribution, and hardware characteristics. Simulation results show that the\nproposed learning framework can learn optimized interaction codebooks within\nreasonable iterations. Besides, with only 6 beams, the learned codebook\noutperforms a 256-beam DFT codebook, which significantly reduces the beam\ntraining overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 08:11:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 03:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

We consider five crystal shapes of vertex-transitive polyhedra with\nthe cubic symmetry such as a cube, an octahedron and a cuboctahedron. We derive\nreal-space formulas for the hinge and corner charges in terms of the electric\ncharges associated with bulk Wyckoff positions. We find that both the hinge and\ncorner charges can be predicted from the bulk perspective only modulo certain\nfractions depending on the crystal shape, because the relaxation near\nboundaries of the crystal may affect the fractional parts. In particular, we\nshow that a fractionally quantized charge $1/24$ mod $1/12$ in the unit of\nelementary charge can appear in a crystal with a shape of a truncated cube or a\ntruncated octahedron. We also investigate momentum-space formulas for the hinge\nand corner charges.

In ONs, the\nspontaneous collaboration among mobile devices is exploited to disseminate data\ntoward interested users. However, the limited resources and knowledge available\nat each node, and the vast amount of data available, make it difficult to\ndevise efficient schemes to accomplish this task. Recent solutions propose to\nequip each device with data filtering methods derived from human data\nprocessing schemes, known as Cognitive Heuristics, i.e. very effective methods\nused by the brain to quickly drop useless information, while keeping the most\nrelevant one. These solutions can become less effective when facing dynamic\nscenarios or situations where nodes cannot fully collaborate. One of the\nreasons is that the solutions proposed so far do not take take into account the\nsocial structure of the environment where the nodes move in. To be more\neffective, the selection of information performed by each node should take into\nconsideration this dimension of the environment.

It\nturns out that, even on shape space where scale is not part of the description,\nthe equations of motion diverge at (and only at) the points of total collision.\nWe construct and study the stratified total-collision manifold and show that,\nat the points of total collision on shape space, the singularity is essential.\nThere is, thus, no way to evolve the solutions through these points. This\nmirrors closely the big bang singularity of general relativity, where the\nhomogeneous-but-not-isotropic cosmological model of Bianchi IX shows an\nessential singularity at the big bang. A simple modification of the\ngeneral-relativistic model (the addition of a stiff matter field) changes the\nsystem into one whose shape-dynamical description allows for a deterministic\nevolution through the singularity. We suspect that, similarly, some\nmodification of the dynamics would be required in order to regularize the total\ncollision singularity of the N-body model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 09:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

The key idea is to irregularly configure a given number of\nRIS elements on an enlarged surface, which provides extra spatial degrees of\nfreedom compared with the regular RIS.

Here, in the setting of a Dutch mortgage provider,\nwe propose to include non-linear financial instruments in the hedge portfolio\nwhen dealing with mortgages with the option to prepay part of the notional\nearly. Based on the assumption that there is a correlation between prepayment\nand the interest rates in the market, a model is proposed which is based on a\nspecific refinancing incentive. The linear and non-linear risks are addressed\nby a set of tradeable instruments in a static hedge strategy. We will show that\na stochastic model for the notional of a mortgage unveils non-linear risk\nembedded in a prepayment option. Based on a calibration of the refinancing\nincentive on a data set of more than thirty million observations, a functional\nform of the prepayments is defined, which accurately reflects the borrowers'\nbehaviour. We compare this functional form with a fully rational model, where\nthe option to prepay is assumed to be exercised rationally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 10:11:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 15:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

Unlike\nconventional frame-based cameras, these sensors capture a stream of\nasynchronous 'events' that pose multiple advantages over the former, like high\ndynamic range, low latency, low power consumption, and reduced motion blur.\nHowever, these advantages come at a high cost, as the event camera data\ntypically contains more noise and has low resolution. Moreover, as event-based\ncameras can only capture the relative changes in brightness of a scene, event\ndata do not contain usual visual information (like texture and color) as\navailable in video data from normal cameras. So, moving object detection in\nevent-based cameras becomes an extremely challenging task.

In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in the\ntechnique to investigate the distribution of hydrogen in metals. However, the\npresence of hydrogen in the analysis of almost all specimens from nearly all\nmaterial systems has caused numerous debates as to its origins and impact on\nthe quantitativeness of the measurement. It is often perceived that most H\narises from residual gas ionization, therefore affecting primarily materials\nwith a relatively low evaporation field. In this work, we perform systematic\ninvestigations to identify the origin of H residuals in APT experiments by\ncombining density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and APT measurements on\nan alkali and a noble metal, namely Na and Pt, respectively. We report that no\nH residual is found in Na metal samples, but in Pt, which has a higher\nevaporation field, a relatively high signal of H is detected. These results\ncontradict the hypothesis of the H signal being due to direct ionization of\nresidual H$_2$ without much interaction with the specimen's surface. Based on\nDFT, we demonstrate that alkali metals are thermodynamically less likely to be\nsubject to H contamination under APT-operating conditions compared to\ntransition or noble metals. These insights indicate that the detected H-signal\nis not only from ionization of residual gaseous H$_2$ alone, but is strongly\ninfluenced by material-specific physical properties. The origin of H residuals\nis elucidated by considering different conditions encountered during APT\nexperiments, specifically, specimen-preparation, transportation, and\nAPT-operating conditions by taking thermodynamic and kinetic aspects into\naccount.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 10:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

An example of a convolutional approach is\nAudioUNet, which takes inspiration from novel methods of upsampling images.

Based on the EDSR network for image super-resolution, the\nnewly proposed model outperforms UNet with a 20% increase in log spectral\ndistance and a mean opinion score of 4.06 compared to 3.82 for the two times\nupsampling case.

The magnetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) has been proposed as\na means of generating magnetohy- drodynamic turbulence and encouraging wave\nenergy dissipation in the solar corona, particularly within transversely\noscillating loops. Aims. Our goal is to determine whether the KHI encourages\nmagnetic reconnection in oscillating flux tubes in the solar corona. This will\nestablish whether the instability enhances the dissipation rate of energy\nstored in the magnetic field. Methods. We conducted a series of\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the KHI excited by an\noscillating velocity shear. We investigated the effects of numerical\nresolution, field line length, and background currents on the growth rate of\nthe KHI and on the subsequent rate of magnetic reconnection. Results. The KHI\nis able to trigger magnetic reconnection in all cases, with the highest rates\noccurring during the initial growth phase. Reconnection is found to occur\npreferentially along the boundaries of Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices, where the\nshear in the velocity and magnetic fields is greatest. The estimated rate of\nreconnection is found to be lowest in simulations where the KHI growth rate is\nreduced. For example, this is the case for shorter field lines or due to shear\nin the background field. Conclusions. In non-ideal regimes, the onset of the\ninstability causes the local reconnection of magnetic field lines and enhances\nthe rate of coronal wave heating. However, we found that if the equilibrium\nmagnetic field is sheared across the Kelvin-Helmholtz mixing layer, the\ninstability does not significantly enhance the rate of reconnection of the\nbackground field, despite the free energy associated with the non-potential\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 11:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

The difficulty stems from two aspects: 1)\nthe uncertain, time- (and space-) varying nature of wind speed, which can not\nbe measured accurately, and 2) the need to consider, in the same optimization\nproblem, the different operational phases of the power cycle. A new,\nmodel-based approach that solves this problem is proposed. In the design phase,\na model of the AWE system is employed to collect data pertaining to the cycle\npower obtained with various reel-in/reel-out speed pairs, assuming known wind\nspeed. Then, a nonlinear map, identified from these data, is used as cost\nfunction in an optimization program that computes the best reel-in and -out\nspeed pairs for each wind speed. Finally, the optimization results are\nexploited to infer the link between optimal reeling speed and tether force,\nwhich are both measured with high accuracy. Such a link is used to design a\nfeedback controller that computes the reeling speed based on the measured\ntether force, in order to converge on the optimal force-speed manifold.\nSimulation results with a realistic model illustrate the effectiveness of the\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 11:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

Unlike the standard\nauthentication schemes where one central authority authenticates users one by\none, group authentication can handle the authentication process at once for all\nmembers of the group. The recently presented group authentication algorithms\nmainly exploit Lagrange's polynomial interpolation along with elliptic curve\ngroups over finite fields. As a fresh approach, this work suggests use of\nlinear spaces for group authentication and key establishment for a group of any\nsize. The approach with linear spaces introduces a reduced computation and\ncommunication load to establish a common shared key among the group members.\nThe advantages of using vector spaces make the proposed method applicable to\nenergy and resource constrained devices. In addition to providing lightweight\nauthentication and key agreement, this proposal allows any user in a group to\nmake a non-member to be a member, which is expected to be useful for autonomous\nsystems in the future. The scheme is designed in a way that the sponsors of\nsuch members can easily be recognized by anyone in the group. Unlike the other\ngroup authentication schemes based on Lagrange's polynomial interpolation, the\nproposed scheme doesn't provide a tool for adversaries to compromise the whole\ngroup secrets by using only a few members' shares as well as it allows to\nrecognize a non-member easily, which prevents service interruption attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 12:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

Generative models of these data\nare of particular interest, as they enable a range of impactful downstream\napplications like simulation or creating synthetic training data. Recent work\nhas highlighted the potential of generative adversarial nets (GANs) for\ngenerating spatio-temporal data. A new GAN algorithm COT-GAN, inspired by the\ntheory of causal optimal transport (COT), was proposed in an attempt to better\ntackle this challenge. However, the task of learning more complex\nspatio-temporal patterns requires additional knowledge of their specific data\nstructures. In this study, we propose a novel loss objective combined with\nCOT-GAN based on an autoregressive embedding to reinforce the learning of\nspatio-temporal dynamics. We devise SPATE (spatio-temporal association), a new\nmetric measuring spatio-temporal autocorrelation by using the deviance of\nobservations from their expected values. We compute SPATE for real and\nsynthetic data samples and use it to compute an embedding loss that considers\nspace-time interactions, nudging the GAN to learn outputs that are faithful to\nthe observed dynamics. We test this new objective on a diverse set of complex\nspatio-temporal patterns: turbulent flows, log-Gaussian Cox processes and\nglobal weather data. We show that our novel embedding loss improves performance\nwithout any changes to the architecture of the COT-GAN backbone, highlighting\nour model's increased capacity for capturing autoregressive structures.

However, most existing quantization\nmethods for PLMs follow quantization-aware training~(QAT) that requires\nend-to-end training with full access to the entire dataset. Therefore, they\nsuffer from slow training, large memory overhead, and data security issues. In\nthis paper, we study post-training quantization~(PTQ) of PLMs, and propose\nmodule-wise quantization error minimization~(MREM), an efficient solution to\nmitigate these issues. By partitioning the PLM into multiple modules, we\nminimize the reconstruction error incurred by quantization for each module. In\naddition, we design a new model parallel training strategy such that each\nmodule can be trained locally on separate computing devices without waiting for\npreceding modules, which brings nearly the theoretical training speed-up (e.g.,\n$4\\times$ on $4$ GPUs). Experiments on GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks show that our\nproposed PTQ solution not only performs close to QAT, but also enjoys\nsignificant reductions in training time, memory overhead, and data consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 12:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

Currently, its most accurate implementation\nrelies on the acquisition of raw speckle images at different exposure times but\nrequires modulation of a laser pulse in duration and intensity and precise\nsynchronization with camera. This complex instrumentation has limited the use\nof multiple exposure speckle imaging. We evaluate here a simplified approach\nbased on synthetic exposure images created from the sum of successive frames\nacquired with a 1 ms exposure time. Both methods have been applied to evaluate\ncontrolled flows in micro-channels. The contribution of noises to the speckle\ncontrast have been quantified and compared. Dark, readout and shot noise\ncontributions to the total contrast remains constant for modulated exposure,\nwhile all these contributions decrease with increasing exposure time for\nsynthetic exposure. The relative contribution of noises to speckle contrast\ndepends on the level of illumination, the exposure time and the flows that are\nimaged. Guidelines for accurate flow measurements in the synthetic exposure\nacquisition scheme are provided. The synthetic exposure method is simple to\nimplement and should facilitate the translation of multiple exposure speckle\nimaging to clinical setups .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 12:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

After each access we can rearrange the list, similarly to\nMove-To-Front, but dependencies need to be respected.\n  We present a 4-competitive online rearrangement algorithm, whose cost is at\nmost four times worse than the optimal offline algorithm; no deterministic\nalgorithm can be better than 3-competitive.

Researchers have tried to bridge this gap with data mixing, domain\nadaptation, and domain-adversarial training, but we show that it is possible to\nsynthesize data with minimal domain gap, so that models trained on synthetic\ndata generalize to real in-the-wild datasets.

However, rule-based models are hard to optimize,\nespecially on large data sets, due to their discrete parameters and structures.\nEnsemble methods and fuzzy/soft rules are commonly used to improve performance,\nbut they sacrifice the model interpretability. To obtain both good scalability\nand interpretability, we propose a new classifier, named Rule-based\nRepresentation Learner (RRL), that automatically learns interpretable non-fuzzy\nrules for data representation and classification. To train the\nnon-differentiable RRL effectively, we project it to a continuous space and\npropose a novel training method, called Gradient Grafting, that can directly\noptimize the discrete model using gradient descent. An improved design of\nlogical activation functions is also devised to increase the scalability of RRL\nand enable it to discretize the continuous features end-to-end. Exhaustive\nexperiments on nine small and four large data sets show that RRL outperforms\nthe competitive interpretable approaches and can be easily adjusted to obtain a\ntrade-off between classification accuracy and model complexity for different\nscenarios.

The coupled\nexcitons and phonons are modeled by Frenkel-Holstein type Hamiltonians with\non-site and nearest-neighbor interactions only. We reduce the memory\nconsumption as well as the computational costs significantly by employing\nefficient decompositions to construct low rank tensor-train representations,\nthus mitigating the curse of dimensionality. In order to compute also higher\nquantum states, we introduce an approach which directly incorporates the\nWielandt deflation technique into the alternating linear scheme for the\nsolution of eigenproblems. Besides systems with coupled excitons and phonons,\nwe also investigate uncoupled problems for which (semi-)analytical results\nexist. There, we find that in case of homogeneous systems the tensor-train\nranks of state vectors only marginally depend on the chain length which results\nin a linear growth of the storage consumption. However, the CPU time increases\nslightly faster with the chain length than the storage consumption because the\nalternating linear scheme adopted in our work requires more iterations to\nachieve convergence for longer chains and a given rank. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat the tensor-train approach to the quantum treatment of coupled excitons and\nphonons makes it possible to directly tackle the phenomenon of mutual\nself-trapping.

Since the embedding space generated by autoencoder may have no\nobvious cluster structures, we propose to further transform the embedding space\nto a new space that reveals the cluster-structure information. This is achieved\nby an orthonormal transformation matrix, which contains the eigenvectors of the\nwithin-class scatter matrix of K-means. The eigenvalues indicate the importance\nof the eigenvectors' contributions to the cluster-structure information in the\nnew space. Our goal is to increase the cluster-structure information. To this\nend, we discard the decoder and propose a greedy method to optimize the\nrepresentation. Representation learning and clustering are alternately\noptimized by DEKM. Experimental results on the real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat DEKM achieves state-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 14:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

Traditionally, it is assumed that the\nentries of the matrix are \"missing completely at random\" (MCAR), i.e., each\nentry is revealed at random, independent of everything else, with uniform\nprobability. This is likely unrealistic due to the presence of \"latent\nconfounders\", i.e., unobserved factors that determine both the entries of the\nunderlying matrix and the missingness pattern in the observed matrix. For\nexample, in the context of movie recommender systems -- a canonical application\nfor matrix completion -- a user who vehemently dislikes horror films is\nunlikely to ever watch horror films. In general, these confounders yield\n\"missing not at random\" (MNAR) data, which can severely impact any inference\nprocedure that does not correct for this bias. We develop a formal causal model\nfor matrix completion through the language of potential outcomes, and provide\nnovel identification arguments for a variety of causal estimands of interest.\nWe design a procedure, which we call \"synthetic nearest neighbors\" (SNN), to\nestimate these causal estimands. We prove finite-sample consistency and\nasymptotic normality of our estimator. Our analysis also leads to new\ntheoretical results for the matrix completion literature. In particular, we\nestablish entry-wise, i.e., max-norm, finite-sample consistency and asymptotic\nnormality results for matrix completion with MNAR data. As a special case, this\nalso provides entry-wise bounds for matrix completion with MCAR data.

In this paper, we study the method of adding\nwhite noise to the DNN output to mitigate such attacks, with a unique focus on\nthe trade-off analysis of noise level and query cost. The attacker's query\ncount (QC) is derived mathematically as a function of noise standard deviation.\nWith this result, the defender can conveniently find the noise level needed to\nmitigate attacks for the desired security level specified by QC and limited DNN\nperformance loss. Our analysis shows that the added noise is drastically\nmagnified by the small variation of DNN outputs, which makes the reconstructed\ngradient have an extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Adding slight white\nnoise with a standard deviation less than 0.01 is enough to increase QC by many\norders of magnitude without introducing any noticeable classification accuracy\nreduction.

Typically, to\nguarantee desirable knowledge transfer, a common (latent) space is adopted for\nassociating the visual and semantic domains in ZSL. However, existing common\nspace learning methods align the semantic and visual domains by merely\nmitigating distribution disagreement through one-step adaptation. This strategy\nis usually ineffective due to the heterogeneous nature of the feature\nrepresentations in the two domains, which intrinsically contain both\ndistribution and structure variations. To address this and advance ZSL, we\npropose a novel hierarchical semantic-visual adaptation (HSVA) framework.\nSpecifically, HSVA aligns the semantic and visual domains by adopting a\nhierarchical two-step adaptation, i.e., structure adaptation and distribution\nadaptation. In the structure adaptation step, we take two task-specific\nencoders to encode the source data (visual domain) and the target data\n(semantic domain) into a structure-aligned common space. To this end, a\nsupervised adversarial discrepancy (SAD) module is proposed to adversarially\nminimize the discrepancy between the predictions of two task-specific\nclassifiers, thus making the visual and semantic feature manifolds more closely\naligned. In the distribution adaptation step, we directly minimize the\nWasserstein distance between the latent multivariate Gaussian distributions to\nalign the visual and semantic distributions using a common encoder. Finally,\nthe structure and distribution adaptation are derived in a unified framework\nunder two partially-aligned variational autoencoders.

Inspired by this\ndiscovery, we propose a simple yet effective end-to-end self-supervised\nlearning framework for event segmentation/boundary detection. Unlike the\nmainstream clustering-based methods, our framework exploits a transformer-based\nfeature reconstruction scheme to detect event boundary by reconstruction\nerrors. This is consistent with the fact that humans spot new events by\nleveraging the deviation between their prediction and what is actually\nperceived. Thanks to their heterogeneity in semantics, the frames at boundaries\nare difficult to be reconstructed (generally with large reconstruction errors),\nwhich is favorable for event boundary detection. Additionally, since the\nreconstruction occurs on the semantic feature level instead of pixel level, we\ndevelop a temporal contrastive feature embedding module to learn the semantic\nvisual representation for frame feature reconstruction. This procedure is like\nhumans building up experiences with \"long-term memory\". The goal of our work is\nto segment generic events rather than localize some specific ones.

Unidentified objects such as digital \"stickers,\" also known as\nadversarial patches, can fool facial recognition systems, surveillance systems\nand self-driving cars. Fortunately, most existing adversarial patches can be\noutwitted, disabled and rejected by a simple classification network called an\nadversarial patch detector, which distinguishes adversarial patches from\noriginal images. An object detector classifies and predicts the types of\nobjects within an image, such as by distinguishing a motorcyclist from the\nmotorcycle, while also localizing each object's placement within the image by\n\"drawing\" so-called bounding boxes around each object, once again separating\nthe motorcyclist from the motorcycle. To train detectors even better, however,\nwe need to keep subjecting them to confusing or deceitful adversarial patches\nas we probe for the models' blind spots. For such probes, we came up with a\nnovel approach, a Low-Detectable Adversarial Patch, which attacks an object\ndetector with small and texture-consistent adversarial patches, making these\nadversaries less likely to be recognized. Concretely, we use several geometric\nprimitives to model the shapes and positions of the patches. To enhance our\nattack performance, we also assign different weights to the bounding boxes in\nterms of loss function.

The theories of the `Integer' (IQHE) and the\n`Fractional' (FQHE) quantum Hall effects are very different at present, despite\ntheir remarkable phenomenological similarity. The fractional effect invokes\nmulti-particle dynamics and collective phenomena in the presence of a dominant\nCoulomb interaction, in a complex hierarchical scheme, whereas the integer\neffect is a simpler single-particle scenario. The experimental situation, in\ncontrast, shows that both the effects appear seamlessly, intermingling, as\neither the magnetic field or the carrier density is varied. I prove that a\ncrucial physics input that is missing in the current theories is the\nrelativistic gravity of the matter-energy in the Universe. The dynamically\ninduced relativistic gravitational potential play a startling role to modify\nthe quantum degeneracy, by coupling to the mass of electrons. The key point is\nthat the quantum degeneracy of Landau levels is modified by the relativistic\ncosmic gravitomagnetic field, thereby making the degeneracy dependent on the\nnumber density of the electrons. I successfully derive the main characteristics\nand the full sequence of both IQHE and FHQE in a seamless unified\nsingle-particle scenario, without any quasiparticles, particle-flux composites,\nor extraneous postulates. Apart from correctly reproducing all the observed\nfilling factors of the QHE for the $\\nu\\geq1/3$, this new unified theory has\nthe natural explanation for the absence of the QHE at even fractions for\n$\\nu<1$. Further, there is a consistent description of the edge state charge\ntransport and thermal transport, in the FQHE states. The gravitational paradigm\nshows clearly the physical reason for the phenomenological success of the\neffective theories with the quasiparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

The regular\nblack holes examined can be further categorised as static spacetimes, however\nthe traversable wormhole is allowed to have a dynamic (non-static) throat.\nAstrophysical observables are calculated for a recently proposed regular black\nhole model containing an exponential suppression of the Misner-Sharp\nquasi-local mass. This same regular black hole model is then used to construct\na wormhole via the ''cut- and-paste'' technique.

However, due to the sparsity of mobility data, it is\nnot an easy task to predict future POIs (place-of-interests) that are going to\nbe visited. In this paper, we propose MobTCast, a Transformer-based\ncontext-aware network for mobility prediction. Specifically, we explore the\ninfluence of four types of context in the mobility prediction: temporal,\nsemantic, social and geographical contexts. We first design a base mobility\nfeature extractor using the Transformer architecture, which takes both the\nhistory POI sequence and the semantic information as input. It handles both the\ntemporal and semantic contexts. Based on the base extractor and the social\nconnections of a user, we employ a self-attention module to model the influence\nof the social context. Furthermore, unlike existing methods, we introduce a\nlocation prediction branch in MobTCast as an auxiliary task to model the\ngeographical context and predict the next location. Intuitively, the\ngeographical distance between the location of the predicted POI and the\npredicted location from the auxiliary branch should be as close as possible. To\nreflect this relation, we design a consistency loss to further improve the POI\nprediction performance. In our experimental results, MobTCast outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art next POI prediction methods. Our approach illustrates the\nvalue of including different types of context in next POI prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 09:42:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

The article discusses the\napplication of unsupervised machine learning to support the pragmatic designs\nof complex experiments. Complex experiments are characterized by having a large\nnumber of factors, mixed-level designs, and may be subject to constraints that\neliminate some unfeasible trials for various reasons. Having such attributes,\nit is very challenging to design pragmatic experiments that are economically,\noperationally, and timely sound. It means a significant decrease in the number\nof required trials from a full factorial design, while still attempting to\nachieve the defined objectives. A beta variational autoencoder (beta-VAE) has\nbeen applied to represent trials of the initial full factorial design after\nfiltering out unfeasible trials on the low dimensional latent space. Regarding\nvisualization and interpretability, the paper is limited to 2D representations.\nBeta-VAE supports (1) orthogonality of the latent space dimensions, (2)\nisotropic multivariate standard normal distribution of the representation on\nthe latent space, (3) disentanglement of the latent space representation by\nlevels of factors, (4) propagation of the applied constraints of the initial\ndesign into the latent space, and (5) generation of trials by decoding latent\nspace points.

Since the appearance of this technology, numerous supercomputers\nhave been equipped with burst buffers exploring various architectures. Despite\nthe development of real-world architectures as well as research concepts,\nResource and Job Management Systems, such as Slurm, provide only marginal\nsupport for scheduling jobs with burst buffer requirements. This research is\nprimarily motivated by the alerting observation that burst buffers are omitted\nfrom reservations in the procedure of backfilling in existing job schedulers.\nIn this dissertation, we forge a detailed supercomputer simulator based on\nBatsim and SimGrid, which is capable of simulating I/O contention and I/O\ncongestion effects. Due to the lack of publicly available workloads with burst\nbuffer requests, we create a burst buffer request distribution model derived\nfrom Parallel Workload Archive logs. We investigate the impact of burst buffer\nreservations on the overall efficiency of online job scheduling for canonical\nalgorithms: First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) and Shortest-Job-First (SJF)\nEASY-backfilling. Our results indicate that the lack of burst buffer\nreservations in backfilling may significantly deteriorate the performance of\nscheduling. [...] Furthermore, this lack of reservations may cause the\nstarvation of medium-size and wide jobs. Finally, we propose a\nburst-buffer-aware plan-based scheduling algorithm with simulated annealing\noptimisation, which improves the mean waiting time by over 20% and mean bounded\nslowdown by 27% compared to the SJF EASY-backfilling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 22:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}
