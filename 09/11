The algebraic\nstructure of YB-semitrusses is investigated, and as a consequence, it is\nproven, for example, that any finite left non-degenerate set-theoretic solution\nof the Yang-Baxter equation is right non-degenerate if and only if it is\nbijective. Furthermore, it is shown that some finite left non-degenerate\nsolutions can be reduced to non-degenerate solutions of smaller size. The\nstructure algebra of a finitely generated YB-semitruss is an algebra defined by\nhomogeneous quadratic relations. We prove that it often is a left Noetherian\nalgebra of finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension that satisfies a polynomial\nidentity, but in general, it is not right Noetherian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 16:24:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 20:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

CEED is a\nresearch partnership involving more than 30 computational scientists from two\nUS national labs and five universities, including members of the Nek5000, MFEM,\nMAGMA and PETSc projects. We discuss the CEED co-design activities based on\ntargeted benchmarks, miniapps and discretization libraries and our work on\nperformance optimizations for large-scale GPU architectures. We also provide a\nbroad overview of research and development activities in areas such as\nunstructured adaptive mesh refinement algorithms, matrix-free linear solvers,\nhigh-order data visualization, and list examples of collaborations with several\nECP and external applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 17:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-13"}

Without such, one neither can show, nor expect, strong\nproperties.

Eigenfunctions are $L^2$ in the weighted space allowing for\nextremely rapid growth. Rapid growth would be disastrous for many applications.\nSurprisingly, for very general tensors, manifolds and weights, we show the same\npolynomial growth bounds that Laplace and Hermite observed for functions on\nEuclidean space for the standard Gaussian. This covers all shrinkers for Ricci\nand mean curvature flows.\n  These results open a door for understanding general non-compact spaces. It\nprovides an analytic framework for doing nonlinear PDE on Gaussian spaces where\npreviously the Gaussian weight allowed wild growth that made it impossible to\napproximate nonlinear by linear. It is key to bound the growth of\ndiffeomorphisms of non-compact manifolds and is the key for solving the \"gauge\nproblem\".

While radiative transfer\nmodels have shown that molecular levels of CO can become mildly inverted,\ncausing maser emission, CO maser emission has yet to be confirmed\nobservationally. High-resolution observations of the CO emission around AGB\nstars now have the brightness temperature sensitivity to detect possible weak\nCO maser emission. We used high angular resolution observations taken with the\nAtacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe the small-scale\nstructure of CO $J=3-2$ emission around the oxygen-rich AGB star W Hya. We find\nCO maser emission amplifying the stellar continuum with an optical depth\n$\\tau\\approx-0.55$. The maser predominantly amplifies the limb of the star\nbecause CO $J=3-2$ absorption from the extended stellar atmosphere is strongest\ntowards the centre of the star. The CO maser velocity corresponds to a\npreviously observed variable component of high-frequency H$_2$O masers and with\nthe OH maser that was identified as the amplified stellar image. This implies\nthat the maser originates beyond the acceleration region and constrains the\nvelocity profile since we find the population inversion primarily in the inner\ncircumstellar envelope. We find that inversion can be explained by the\nradiation field at 4.6 $\\mu$m and that the existence of CO maser emission is\nconsistent with the estimated mass-loss rates for W Hya. However, the pumping\nmechanism requires a complex interplay between absorption and emission lines in\nthe extended atmosphere. Excess from dust in the circumstellar envelope of W\nHya is not sufficient to contribute significantly to the required radiation\nfield at 4.6 $\\mu$m.

In contrast to standard pCT systems, the residual energy is\ndetermined via a time-of-flight (TOF) measurement between different 4D-tracking\nstations. The design parameters for a realistic proton computed tomography\nsystem based on 4D-tracking detectors were studied and optimized using Monte\nCarlo simulations.

Despite the\nwidespread turn to human oversight, these policies rest on an uninterrogated\nassumption: that people are able to effectively oversee algorithmic\ndecision-making. In this article, I survey 41 policies that prescribe human\noversight of government algorithms and find that they suffer from two\nsignificant flaws. First, evidence suggests that people are unable to perform\nthe desired oversight functions. Second, as a result of the first flaw, human\noversight policies legitimize government uses of faulty and controversial\nalgorithms without addressing the fundamental issues with these tools. Thus,\nrather than protect against the potential harms of algorithmic decision-making\nin government, human oversight policies provide a false sense of security in\nadopting algorithms and enable vendors and agencies to shirk accountability for\nalgorithmic harms. In light of these flaws, I propose a shift from human\noversight to institutional oversight as the central mechanism for regulating\ngovernment algorithms. This institutional approach operates in two stages.\nFirst, agencies must justify that it is appropriate to incorporate an algorithm\ninto decision-making and that any proposed forms of human oversight are\nsupported by empirical evidence. Second, these justifications must receive\ndemocratic public review and approval before the agency can adopt the\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 18:58:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 18:08:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 16:30:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 14:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

The method\nenables the agent to balance its perception costs with those incurred by\noperating in its environment. To obtain a computationally tractable solution,\nwe approximate the value function using a novel method of invariant finite\nbelief sets, wherein the agent acts exclusively on a finite subset of the\ncontinuous belief space. We solve the approximate problem through value\niteration in which a linear program is solved individually for each belief\nstate in the set, in each iteration. Finally, we prove that the value\nfunctions, under an assumption on their structure, converge to their continuous\nstate-space values as the sample density increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 19:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

This project develops an interactive plan\noptimization module for HDRBT of gynecological cancer. By efficiently solving\nan optimization problem in real time, it allows a user to visualize a plan and\ninteractively modify it to improve quality. We formulated an optimization\nproblem with an objective function containing a weighted sum of doses to normal\norgans subject to user-specified target coverage.

Numerical solution procedures for many dynamical\nsystems have existed for several decades, but can be slow due to\nhigh-dimensional state space of the dynamical system. Thus, deep learning-based\nreduced order models (ROMs) are of interest and one such family of algorithms\nalong these lines are based on the Koopman theory. This paper extends a\nrecently developed adversarial Koopman model (Balakrishnan \\& Upadhyay,\narXiv:2006.05547) to stochastic space, where the Koopman operator applies on\nthe probability distribution of the latent encoding of an encoder.\nSpecifically, the latent encoding of the system is modeled as a Gaussian, and\nis advanced in time by using an auxiliary neural network that outputs two\nKoopman matrices $K_{\\mu}$ and $K_{\\sigma}$. Adversarial and gradient losses\nare used and this is found to lower the prediction errors. A reduced Koopman\nformulation is also undertaken where the Koopman matrices are assumed to have a\ntridiagonal structure, and this yields predictions comparable to the baseline\nmodel with full Koopman matrices. The efficacy of the stochastic Koopman model\nis demonstrated on different test problems in chaos, fluid dynamics,\ncombustion, and reaction-diffusion models. The proposed model is also applied\nin a setting where the Koopman matrices are conditioned on other input\nparameters for generalization and this is applied to simulate the state of a\nLithium-ion battery in time.

The most favored mechanism,the selective\nphotodissociation of CO gas to produce $^{16}$O depleted water,requires finely\ntuned mixing timescales to transport $^{16}$O depleted water from the cold\nouter solar system to exchange isotopically with dust grains to produce the\n$^{16}$O depleted planetary bodies observed today. Here we show that energetic\nparticle irradiation of SiO$_2$ (and Al$_2$O$_3$) makes them susceptible to\nanomalous isotope exchange with H$_2$O ice at temperatures as low as 10 K. The\nobserved magnitude of the anomalous isotope exchange (D$^{17}$O) is sufficient\nto generate the $^{16}$O depletion characteristic of the terrestrial bodies in\nthe solar system. We calculated the cosmic-ray exposure times needed to produce\nthe observed $^{16}$O depletions in silicate (SiO2) dust in the interstellar\nmedium and early solar system and find that radiation damage induced oxygen\nisotope exchange could have rapidly (~10-100 yrs) depleted dust grains of\n$^{16}$O during the Sun's T-Tauri phase. Our model explains whythe oldest and\nmost refractory minerals found in the solar system, the anhydrous Calcium with\nAluminum Inclusions (CAIs),are generally $^{16}$O enriched compared to\nchondrules and the bulk terrestrial solids and provides a mechanism for\nproducing $^{16}$O depleted grains very early in the solar system's history.\nOur findings have broad implications for the distribution of oxygen isotopes in\nthe solar system, the interstellar medium, the formation of the planets and its\nbuilding blocks as well as the nature of mass-independent isotope effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 21:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

While such routines enable flexible automation, they\nalso lead to an instance of the integrity problem in these systems: untrusted\nthird-parties may use platform APIs to modify the abstract home objects (AHOs)\nthat privileged, high-integrity devices such as security cameras rely on (i.e.,\nas triggers), thereby transitively attacking them. As most accesses to AHOs are\nlegitimate, removing the permissions or applying naive information flow\ncontrols would not only fail to prevent these problems, but also break useful\nfunctionality. Therefore, this paper proposes the alternate approach of home\nabstraction endorsement, which endorses a proposed change to an AHO by\ncorrelating it with certain specific, preceding, environmental changes. We\npresent the HomeEndorser framework, which provides a policy model for\nspecifying endorsement policies for AHOs as changes in device states, relative\nto their location, and a platform-based reference monitor for mediating all API\nrequests to change AHOs against those device states. We evaluate HomeEndorser\non the HomeAssistant platform, finding that we can derive over 1000 policy\nrules for HomeEndorser to endorse changes to 6 key AHOs, preventing malice and\naccidents for less than 10% overhead for endorsement check microbenchmarks, and\nwith no false alarms under realistic usage scenarios. In doing so, HomeEndorser\nlays the first steps towards providing a practical foundation for ensuring that\nAPI-induced changes to abstract home objects correlate with the physical\nrealities of the user's environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 23:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

A discovery process is rationalizable if players play\nextensive-form rationalizable strategies in each game with unawareness. We show\nthat for any game with unawareness there is a rationalizable discovery process\nthat leads to a self-confirming game that possesses a self-confirming\nequilibrium in extensive-form rationalizable conjectures. This notion of\nequilibrium can be interpreted as steady-state of both a discovery and learning\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2021 00:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

When estimating,\ndeciding which type of covariates need to be included in the propensity score\nfunction is important, since incorporating some unnecessary covariates may\namplify both bias and variance of estimators of ATE. In this paper, we show\nthat including additional instrumental variables that satisfy the exclusion\nrestriction for outcome will do harm to the statistical efficiency. Also, we\nprove that, controlling for covariates that appear as outcome predictors, i.e.\npredict the outcomes and are irrelevant to the exposures, can help reduce the\nasymptotic variance of ATE estimation. We also note that, efficiently\nestimating the ATE by non-parametric or semi-parametric methods require the\nestimated propensity score function, as described in Hirano et al.\n(2003)\\cite{Hirano2003}. Such estimation procedure usually asks for many\nregularity conditions, Rothe (2016)\\cite{Rothe2016} also illustrated this point\nand proposed a known propensity score (KPS) estimator that requires mild\nregularity conditions and is still fully efficient. In addition, we introduce a\nlinearly modified (LM) estimator that is nearly efficient in most general\nsettings and need not estimation of the propensity score function, hence\nconvenient to calculate. The construction of this estimator borrows idea from\nthe interaction estimator of Lin (2013)\\cite{Lin2013}, in which regression\nadjustment with interaction terms are applied to deal with data arising from a\ncompletely randomized experiment. As its name suggests, the LM estimator can be\nviewed as a linear modification on the IPW estimator using known propensity\nscores.

This is indicated through the presence of additional nuclear Bragg\nreflections that are otherwise forbidden for the space group P$bam$ but are in\ngood agreement with the polar space group P$12_11$.

While rectifiers\nare normally based on semiconductor diodes, quantum mechanical non-reciprocal\ntransport effects that enable highly controllable rectification have recently\nbeen discovered. One such effect is magnetochiral anisotropy (MCA), where the\nresistance of a material or a device depends on both the direction of current\nflow and an applied magnetic field. However, the size of rectification possible\ndue to MCA is usually extremely small, because MCA relies on inversion symmetry\nbreaking leading to the manifestation of spin-orbit coupling, which is a\nrelativistic effect.

For instance, the search in a\nscenario database for a driving scenario with a map of a given road-shape\nshould abstract over the lane markings, adjacent vegetation, or weather\nsituation.

Different separation modes are identified through a parametric\nstudy with varying spinning speed and impact parameter. A prominent finding is\nthat increasing the droplet spinning speed tends to suppress the reflexive\nseparation and to promote the stretching separation. Physically, the reflexive\nseparation is suppressed because the increased rotational energy reduces the\nexcessive reflexive kinetic energy within the droplet, which is the cause for\nthe droplet reflexive separation. The stretching separation is promoted because\nthe increased droplet angular momentum enhances the local stretching flow\nwithin the droplet, which tends to separate the droplet. The roles of orbital\nangular momentum and spin angular momentum in affecting the droplet separation\nare further substantiated by studying the collision between two spinning\ndroplets with either the same or opposite chirality.

The challenge\narises as traffic flows often exhibit intrinsic and latent spatio-temporal\ncorrelations that cannot be identified by extracting the spatial and temporal\npatterns of traffic data separately. We argue that such correlations are\nuniversal and play a pivotal role in traffic flow. We put forward {spacetime\ninterval learning} as a paradigm to explicitly capture these correlations\nthrough a unified analysis of both spatial and temporal features. Unlike the\nstate-of-the-art methods, which are restricted to a particular road network, we\nmodel the universal spatio-temporal correlations that are transferable from\ncities to cities. To this end, we propose a new spacetime interval learning\nframework that constructs a local-spacetime context of a traffic sensor\ncomprising the data from its neighbors within close time points. Based on this\nidea, we introduce local spacetime neural network (STNN), which employs novel\nspacetime convolution and attention mechanism to learn the universal\nspatio-temporal correlations.

Some recent works propose to\nsimultaneously learn representation using deep neural networks and perform\nclustering by defining a clustering loss on top of embedded features. However,\nthese approaches are sensitive to imbalanced data and out-of-distribution\nsamples. As a consequence, these methods optimize clustering by pushing data\nclose to randomly initialized cluster centers. This is problematic when the\nnumber of instances varies largely in different classes or a cluster with few\nsamples has less chance to be assigned a good centroid. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce a new unsupervised framework for joint debiased\nrepresentation learning and image clustering. We simultaneously train two deep\nlearning models, a deep representation network that captures the data\ndistribution, and a deep clustering network that learns embedded features and\nperforms clustering. Specifically, the clustering network and learning\nrepresentation network both take advantage of our proposed statistics pooling\nblock that represents mean, variance, and cardinality to handle the\nout-of-distribution samples and class imbalance. Our experiments show that\nusing these representations, one can considerably improve results on imbalanced\nimage clustering across a variety of image datasets. Moreover, the learned\nrepresentations generalize well when transferred to the out-of-distribution\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2021 09:26:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 13:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

However, the use of uniform TS or LS factor may not be optimal\nfor calibrating models trained on a long-tailed dataset where the model\nproduces overly confident probabilities for high-frequency classes. In this\nstudy, we propose class-distribution-aware TS (CDA-TS) and LS (CDA-LS) by\nincorporating class frequency information in model calibration in the context\nof long-tailed distribution.

Alternatively, a monocular camera alleviates the limitation\nat the expense of accuracy in estimating depth, and the challenge exacerbates\nin harsh environmental conditions. Moreover, an optical sensor often fails to\nacquire vital signals in harsh environments, and radar is used instead, which\ngives coarse but more accurate signals.

In this paper, for a FL setting, we model\nthe learning gain achieved by an IoT device against its participation cost as\nits utility. The local model quality and the associated cost differs from\ndevice to device due to the device-heterogeneity which could be time-varying.\nWe identify that this results in utility unfairness because the same global\nmodel is shared among the devices. In the vanilla FL setting, the master is\nunaware of devices' local model computation and transmission costs, thus it is\nunable to address the utility unfairness problem. In addition, a device may\nexploit this lack of knowledge at the master to intentionally reduce its\nexpenditure and thereby boost its utility. We propose to control the quality of\nthe global model shared with the devices, in each round, based on their\ncontribution and expenditure.

By comparing clusters of players resulting from our form\nrepresentations and those resulting from traditional abermetrics, we\ndemonstrate that our form representations contain information about how players\nimpact the course of play, not present in traditional, publicly available\nstatistics.

While NP-hard in the worst case, there are\nprovably efficient algorithms for certain families of team game. In particular,\nif the game has common external information, also known as A-loss recall --\ninformally, actions played by non-team members (i.e., the opposing team or\nnature) are either unknown to the entire team, or common knowledge within the\nteam -- then polynomial-time algorithms exist (Kaneko & Kline 1995). In this\npaper, we devise a completely new algorithm for solving team games. It uses a\ntree decomposition of the constraint system representing each team's strategy\nto reduce the number and degree of constraints required for correctness\n(tightness of the mathematical program). Our approach has the bags of the tree\ndecomposition correspond to team-public states. Our algorithm reduces the\nproblem of solving team games to a linear program with at most $O(NW^{w+1})$\nnonzero entries in the constraint matrix, where $N$ is the size of the game\ntree, $w$ is a parameter that depends on the amount of uncommon external\ninformation, and $W$ is the treewidth of the tree decomposition.

Our algorithm is based on a new\nway to write a custom, concise tree decomposition, and its fast run time does\nnot assume that the decomposition has small treewidth. Since our algorithm\ndescribes the polytope of correlated strategies directly, we get equilibrium\nfinding in correlated strategies for free -- instead of, say, having to run a\ndouble oracle algorithm.

This relationship is of particular\nrelevance to coarse grained and continuum descriptions of a given phenomenon.\nIn this work, we derive the scaling of the entropy production under iterative\ncoarse graining on the basis of the correlations of the underlying microscopic\ntransition rates. Our approach unveils a natural criterion to distinguish\nequilibrium-like and genuinely non-equilibrium macroscopic phenomena based on\nthe sign of the scaling exponent of the entropy production per mesostate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2021 14:25:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 17:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

In the absence of a ubiquitous tool like the suffix tree\nfor labeled graphs, we introduce the labeled direct product of two graphs as a\ngeneral tool for obtaining optimal algorithms: we obtain conceptually simpler\nalgorithms for the quadratic problems of string matching (SMLG) and longest\ncommon substring (LCSP) in labeled graphs. Our algorithms are also more\nefficient, since they run in time linear in the size of the labeled product\ngraph, which may be smaller than quadratic for some inputs, and their run-time\nis predictable, because the size of the labeled direct product graph can be\nprecomputed efficiently. We also solve LCSP on graphs containing cycles, which\nwas left as an open problem by Shimohira et al. in 2011. To show the power of\nthe labeled product graph, we also apply it to solve the matching statistics\n(MSP) and the longest repeated string (LRSP) problems in labeled graphs.\nMoreover, we show that our (worst-case quadratic) algorithms are also optimal,\nconditioned on the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis.

The\nkey point is to separate the Dirac spinor into two separate concepts, one of\nwhich is Lorentz-covariant, and the other Lorentz-invariant. This produces a\nmodel which does not have a CPT-symmetry, and therefore supports an asymmetry\nbetween particles and antiparticles. The Lagrangian has four terms, and there\nis a gauge group GL(4,R) which permits the terms to be separated in an\narbitrary way, so that the model is generally covariant. Quantum gravity in\nthis model turns out to be described by quite a different gauge group, namely\nSO(5), acting on a 5-dimensional space that behaves like a spin 2\nrepresentation after suitable symmetry-breaking.

However, it remains\nchallenging to quantitatively reconstruct defects, such as disbonds and kissing\nbonds, that influence the integrity of adhesive bonds and seriously reduce the\nstrength of assemblies. In this work, an ultrasonic method based on the\nsupervised fully convolutional network (FCN) is proposed to quantitatively\nreconstruct defects hidden in multi-layered bonded composites. In the training\nprocess of this method, an FCN establishes a non-linear mapping from measured\nultrasonic data to the corresponding velocity models of multi-layered bonded\ncomposites. In the predicting process, the trained network obtained from the\ntraining process is used to directly reconstruct the velocity models from the\nnew measured ultrasonic data of adhesively bonded composites. The presented\nFCN-based inversion method can automatically extract useful features in\nmulti-layered composites. Although this method is computationally expensive in\nthe training process, the prediction itself in the online phase takes only\nseconds. The numerical results show that the FCN-based ultrasonic inversion\nmethod is capable to accurately reconstruct ultrasonic velocity models of the\nhigh contrast defects, which has great potential for online detection of\nadhesively bonded composites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2021 10:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

We find that during the pandemic, the\nmoneyline betting markets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) became\nvery inefficient. During this period, if one bet uniformly on underdog teams in\nthe NBA, one could achieve a 16.7% profit margin. It is hypothesized that this\ninefficiency is due to the absence of live audiences during the NBA games. Such\ninefficiencies are not seen for any other sport. Much of the inefficiency comes\nfrom a small fraction of games with moneyline odds in the 233 to 400 range. We\nfind that with clever strategies, one is able to achieve a 26-fold gain on an\ninitial investment by betting on NBA underdogs during this time period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2021 01:37:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

The LIO subsystem (FAST-LIO) takes advantage of\nthe measurement from LiDAR and inertial sensors and builds the geometry\nstructure of (i.e. the position of 3D points) global maps. The VIO subsystem\nutilizes the data of visual-inertial sensors and renders the map's texture\n(i.e. the color of 3D points). More specifically, the VIO subsystem fuses the\nvisual data directly and effectively by minimizing the frame-to-map photometric\nerror. The developed system R3LIVE is developed based on our previous work\nR2LIVE, with careful architecture design and implementation. Experiment results\nshow that the resultant system achieves more robustness and higher accuracy in\nstate estimation than current counterparts (see our attached video).\n  R3LIVE is a versatile and well-engineered system toward various possible\napplications, which can not only serve as a SLAM system for real-time robotic\napplications, but can also reconstruct the dense, precise, RGB-colored 3D maps\nfor applications like surveying and mapping. Moreover, to make R3LIVE more\nextensible, we develop a series of offline utilities for reconstructing and\ntexturing meshes, which further minimizes the gap between R3LIVE and various of\n3D applications such as simulators, video games and etc (see our demos video).\nTo share our findings and make contributions to the community, we open source\nR3LIVE on our Github, including all of our codes, software utilities, and the\nmechanical design of our device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 22:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

The emergence of wireless sensor networks in locations without\navailable reference data makes calibrating such networks without the aid of\ntrue values a key area of research. While deep learning (DL) has proved\nsuccessful on numerous other tasks, it is under-researched in the context of\nblind WSN calibration, particularly in scenarios with networks that mix static\nand mobile sensors. In this paper we investigate the use of DL architectures\nfor such scenarios, including the effects of weather in both drifting and\nsensor measurement. New models are proposed and compared against a baseline,\nbased on a previous proposed model and extended to include mobile sensors and\nweather data. Also, a procedure for generating simulated air quality data is\npresented, including the emission, dispersion and measurement of the two most\ncommon particulate matter pollutants: PM 2.5 and PM 10 . Results show that our\nmodels reduce the calibration error with an order of magnitude compared to the\nbaseline, showing that DL is a suitable method for WSN calibration and that\nthese networks can be remotely calibrated with minimal cost for the deployer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2021 07:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}
