The codes at current time level are then projected\nback to the original full space by the decoder layers in the SAE network. The\ncapability of this data-driven reduced order model (DDROM) is illustrated\nnumerically by two test cases: flow past a cylinder, and a lock exchange,\nrespectively. The results obtained show that the DDROM performs better in terms\nof accuracy than the popular model reduction method namely proper orthogonal\ndecomposition.

Unfortunately, the fabrication of\nnanocrystalline metals often requires non-equilibrium processing routes, which\ntypically limit the specimen size and require large energy budgets. In this\nstudy, multiple dopant atoms in ternary Al alloys are deliberately selected to\nenable segregation to the grain boundary region and promote the formation of\namorphous complexions. Three different fully dense bulk nanocrystalline Al\nalloys (Al-Mg-Y, Al-Fe-Y, and Al-Ni-Y) with small grain sizes were successfully\nfabricated using a simple powder metallurgy approach, with full densification\nconnected directly to the onset of amorphous complexion formation. All the\ncompositions demonstrate densities above 99% with grain sizes of <60 nm\nfollowing consolidation via hot pressing at 585 oC. The very fine grain\nstructure results in excellent mechanical properties, with nanoindentation\nhardness values in the range of 2.2-2.8 GPa. Detailed microstructural\ncharacterization verifies the segregation of all dopant species to grain\nboundaries as well as the formation of amorphous complexions, which suggests\ntheir influential role in aiding effective consolidation and endowing thermal\nstability in the alloys. Moreover, nanorods with a core-shell structure are\nalso observed at the grain boundaries, which likely contribute to the\nstabilization of the grain structure and high strength. Finally, intermetallic\nparticles with a sizes of hundreds of nanometers form. As a whole, the results\npresented here demonstrate a general alloy design strategy of segregation and\nboundary evolution pathway that enables the fabrication of multiple\nnanocrystalline Al alloys with hierarchical microstructures and improved\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2021 18:11:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 18:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

Many splitting algorithms have been designed for\nefficient temporal discretization. In this paper, our goal is to use temporal\nsplitting concepts in designing machine learning algorithms and, at the same\ntime, help splitting algorithms by incorporating data and speeding them up.\nSince the spitting solution usually has an explicit and implicit part, we will\ncall our method hybrid explicit-implict (HEI) learning. We will consider a\nrecently introduced multiscale splitting algorithms. To approximate the\ndynamics, only a few degrees of freedom are solved implicitly, while others\nexplicitly. In this paper, we use this splitting concept in machine learning\nand propose several strategies. First, the implicit part of the solution can be\nlearned as it is more difficult to solve, while the explicit part can be\ncomputed. This provides a speed-up and data incorporation for splitting\napproaches. Secondly, one can design a hybrid neural network architecture\nbecause handling explicit parts requires much fewer communications among\nneurons and can be done efficiently. Thirdly, one can solve the coarse grid\ncomponent via PDEs or other approximation methods and construct simpler neural\nnetworks for the explicit part of the solutions. We discuss these options and\nimplement one of them by interpreting it as a machine translation task. This\ninterpretation successfully enables us using the Transformer since it can\nperform model reduction for multiple time series and learn the connection. We\nalso find that the splitting scheme is a great platform to predict the coarse\nsolution with insufficient information of the target model: the target problem\nis partially given and we need to solve it through a known problem. We conduct\nfour numerical examples and the results show that our method is stable and\naccurate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2021 18:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Classifier design aims at building\nmodels from training data for representing feature-label distributions--either\nexplicitly or implicitly. In many scientific or clinical settings, training\ndata are typically limited, which makes designing accurate classifiers and\nevaluating their classification error extremely challenging. While transfer\nlearning (TL) can alleviate this issue by incorporating data from relevant\nsource domains to improve learning in a different target domain, it has\nreceived little attention for performance assessment, notably in error\nestimation. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating knowledge\ntransferability in the context of classification error estimation within a\nBayesian paradigm. We introduce a novel class of Bayesian minimum mean-square\nerror (MMSE) estimators for optimal Bayesian transfer learning (OBTL), which\nenables rigorous evaluation of classification error under uncertainty in a\nsmall-sample setting.

These observations\nrepresent the first time that stereoscopy was achieved for brightenings at such\na small scale.

The height of the campfires is located between\n1000 km and 5000 km above the photosphere and we find a good agreement between\nthe manual and automatic methods. The internal structure of campfires is mostly\nunresolved by AIA; however, for a particularly large campfire, we were able to\ntriangulate a few pixels, which are all in a narrow range between 2500 and 4500\nkm. The low height of EUI campfires suggests that they belong to the previously\nunresolved fine structure of the transition region and low corona of the quiet\nSun. They are probably apexes of small-scale dynamic loops heated internally to\ncoronal temperatures. This work demonstrates that high-resolution stereoscopy\nof structures in the solar atmosphere has become feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2021 21:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

For doubling metrics\nthis implies an exponential improvement over the lower bound for general\nmetrics, and as a special case it effectively answers a question left open by\nSkowron and Elkind (AAAI '17) regarding the distortion of STV under\nlow-dimensional Euclidean spaces. More broadly, this constitutes the first\nnexus between the performance of any voting rule and the \"intrinsic\ndimensionality\" of the underlying metric space. We also establish a\nnearly-matching lower bound, refining the construction of Skowron and Elkind.\nMoreover, motivated by the efficiency of STV, we investigate whether natural\nlearning rules can lead to low-distortion outcomes.

Passive Optical Network (PON) is a popular access network\ntechnology, which is envisioned to handle such applications at the access\nsegment of the network. However, the existing standards cannot handle strict\nQoS constraints. The available solutions rely on instantaneous heuristic\ndecisions and maintain QoS constraints (mostly bandwidth) in an average sense.\nExisting works with optimal strategies are computationally complex and are not\nsuitable for uRLLC applications. This paper presents a novel\ncomputationally-efficient, far-sighted bandwidth allocation policy design for\nfacilitating bursty traffic in a PON framework while satisfying strict QoS (age\nof information/delay and bandwidth) requirements of modern applications. To\nthis purpose, first we design a delay-tracking mechanism which allows us to\nmodel the resource allocation problem from a control-theoretic viewpoint as a\nModel Predictive Control (MPC). MPC helps in taking far-sighted decisions\nregarding resource allocations and captures the time-varying dynamics of the\nnetwork. We provide computationally efficient polynomial-time solutions and\nshow its implementation in the PON framework. Compared to existing approaches,\nMPC reduces delay violations by approximately 15% for a delay-constrained\napplication of 1ms target. Our approach is also robust to varying traffic\narrivals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2021 23:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Purpose: We revisit and analyze the role of the\ntensor force for the $\\beta$ decay of $^{14}$C as well as of neighboring\nisotopes. Methods: We add a tensor force to the Gogny interaction, and derive\nan effective Hamiltonian for shell-model calculations. The calculations were\ncarried out in a $p$-$sd$ model space to investigate cross-shell effects.\nFurthermore, we decompose the wave functions according to the total orbital\nangular momentum $L$ in order to analyze the effects of the tensor force and\ncross-shell mixing.\n  Results: The inclusion of the tensor force significantly improves the\nshell-model calculations of the $\\beta$-decay properties of carbon isotopes. In\nparticular, the anomalously slow $\\beta$ decay of $^{14}$C can be explained by\nthe isospin $T=0$ part of the tensor force, which changes the components of\n$^{14}$N with the orbital angular momentum $L=0,1$, and results in a dramatic\nsuppression of the Gamow-Teller transition strength.

However, the \"microburst\" may occur even in\nlightly-loaded scenarios, which leads to the indeterministic service latency\n(i.e., unpredictable delay or delay variation), hence hindering the deployment\nof MEC. Deterministic IP networking (DIP) has been proposed that can provide\nbounds on latency, and high reliability in the large-scale networks.\nNevertheless, the direct migration of DIP into the MEC network is non-trivial\nowing to its original design for the Ethernet with homogeneous devices.\nMeanwhile, DIP also faces the challenges on the network throughput and\nscheduling flexibility. In this paper, we delve into the adoption of DIP for\nthe MEC networks and some of the relevant aspects. A deterministic MEC (D-MEC)\nnetwork is proposed to deliver the deterministic service (i.e., providing the\nMEC service with bounded service latency). In the D-MEC network, two\nmechanisms, including the cycle mapping and cycle shifting, are designed to\nenable: (i) seamless and deterministic transmission with heterogeneous\nunderlaid resources; and (ii) traffic shaping on the edges to improve the\nresource utilization. We also formulate a joint configuration to maximize the\nnetwork throughput with deterministic QoS guarantees.

This\nunique shape results from the interplay between interface motion and the\nnatural convective flows driven by the descent of relatively heavy solute.\nPrevious investigations suggest these structures to be associated with\nshock-formation in the underlying evolution equations, with the regularizing\nGibbs-Thomson effect required for finite tip curvature. Here, we find a class\nof exact solutions that act as attractors for the shape dynamics in two and\nthree dimensions. Intriguingly, the solutions exhibit large but finite tip\ncurvature without any regularization, and they agree remarkably well with\nexperimental measurements. The relationship between the dimensions of the\ninitial shape and the final state of dissolution may offer a principle for\nestimating the age and environmental conditions of geological structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 02:33:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 16:15:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 14:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2022 14:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Conventional methods usually\nfocus on learning discriminative features for each facial image of a paired\nsample and neglect how to fuse the obtained two facial image features and\nreason about the relations between them. To address this, we propose a\nStar-shaped Reasoning Graph Network (S-RGN). Our S-RGN first constructs a\nstar-shaped graph where each surrounding node encodes the information of\ncomparisons in a feature dimension and the central node is employed as the\nbridge for the interaction of surrounding nodes. Then we perform relational\nreasoning on this star graph with iterative message passing. The proposed S-RGN\nuses only one central node to analyze and process information from all\nsurrounding nodes, which limits its reasoning capacity. We further develop a\nHierarchical Reasoning Graph Network (H-RGN) to exploit more powerful and\nflexible capacity. More specifically, our H-RGN introduces a set of latent\nreasoning nodes and constructs a hierarchical graph with them. Then bottom-up\ncomparative information abstraction and top-down comprehensive signal\npropagation are iteratively performed on the hierarchical graph to update the\nnode features. Extensive experimental results on four widely used kinship\ndatabases show that the proposed methods achieve very competitive results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 03:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Channel\npruning is one important compression strategy and is widely used in slimming\nvarious DNNs. Previous gate-based or importance-based pruning methods aim to\nremove channels whose importance is smallest. However, it remains unclear what\ncriteria the channel importance should be measured on, leading to various\nchannel selection heuristics. Some other sampling-based pruning methods deploy\nsampling strategies to train sub-nets, which often causes the training\ninstability and the compressed model's degraded performance. In view of the\nresearch gaps, we present a new module named Gates with Differentiable\nPolarization (GDP), inspired by principled optimization ideas. GDP can be\nplugged before convolutional layers without bells and whistles, to control the\non-and-off of each channel or whole layer block. During the training process,\nthe polarization effect will drive a subset of gates to smoothly decrease to\nexact zero, while other gates gradually stay away from zero by a large margin.\nWhen training terminates, those zero-gated channels can be painlessly removed,\nwhile other non-zero gates can be absorbed into the succeeding convolution\nkernel, causing completely no interruption to training nor damage to the\ntrained model. Experiments conducted over CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show\nthat the proposed GDP algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance on\nvarious benchmark DNNs at a broad range of pruning ratios.

We study one-on-one correlations of\nthe priCME 3D speed, flare intensity, suprathermal backgrounds, and height of\nCME-CME interaction with the SEP intensity.

This further supports the dominant role of the priCME in\ncontrolling the SEP enhancements, and emphasizes the consideration of the\nlatitudinal effect.

In this\npaper, a multi-species spatiotemporal size-structured operating model for\nsedentary species is presented. The model combines a spatially continuous\nGaussian Markov Random Field model of the population dynamics with an areal\nharvesting model that supports preferential targeting and site selection\nconstraints (e.g., economic constraints). This approach is very compute\nefficient, which makes it feasible to simulate realistic fisher dynamics and\ncatch data at true spatial scale (e.g., the swept area of a dredge). The New\nZealand surfclam fishery was used as a case study to demonstrate the\nversatility of the operating model and to showcase the simulation of localized\ndepletion, which was manifest in the generation of realistic\ncatch-per-unit-effort data that were uncorrelated with the trends in population\nabundance. The model is available as part of the open-source R package\nspatialSim.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 03:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Early\nidentification of plant water stress status enables suitable corrective\nmeasures to be applied to obtain the expected crop yield. Further, improving\ncrop yield through precision agriculture methods is a key component of climate\npolicy and the UN sustainable development goals [1]. Leaf water content (LWC)\nis a measure that can be used to estimate water content and identify stressed\nplants. LWC during the early crop growth stages is an important indicator of\nplant productivity and yield. The effect of water stress can be instantaneous\n[15], affecting gaseous exchange or long-term, significantly reducing [9, 18,\n22]. It is thus necessary to identify potential plant water stress during the\nearly stages of growth [15] to introduce corrective irrigation and alleviate\nstress. LWC is also useful for identifying plant genotypes that are tolerant to\nwater stress and salinity by measuring the stability of LWC even under\nartificially induced water stress [18, 25]. Such experiments generally employ\ndestructive procedures to obtain the LWC, which is time-consuming and labor\nintensive.

In this article, we investigate the possibility of using\ndeep learning generative models to improve the performance of radiomics from\nlow dose CTs. We used two datasets of low dose CT scans -NSCLC Radiogenomics\nand LIDC-IDRI - as test datasets for two tasks - pre-treatment survival\nprediction and lung cancer diagnosis. We used encoder-decoder networks and\nconditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) trained in a previous study\nas generative models to transform low dose CT images into full dose CT images.\nRadiomic features extracted from the original and improved CT scans were used\nto build two classifiers - a support vector machine (SVM) and a deep attention\nbased multiple instance learning model - for survival prediction and lung\ncancer diagnosis respectively. Finally, we compared the performance of the\nmodels derived from the original and improved CT scans. Encoder-decoder\nnetworks and CGANs improved the area under the curve (AUC) of survival\nprediction from 0.52 to 0.57 (p-value<0.01).

Moreover, there are no statistically\nsignificant differences in improving AUC by using encoder-decoder network and\nCGAN (p-value=0.34) when networks trained at 75 and 100 epochs.

We show that the perturbation interfaces, defined\nby the logarithm of the modulus of the perturbation vector components, exhibit\nthe universal, geometry-dependent statistical laws of the KPZ class, despite\nthe deterministic nature of STC. We demonstrate that KPZ statistics for three\nestablished geometries arise for different initial profiles of the\nperturbation, namely point (local), uniform, and \"pseudo-stationary\" initial\nperturbations, the last being the statistically stationary state of KPZ\ninterfaces given independently of the Lyapunov vector. This geometry dependence\nlasts until the KPZ correlation length becomes comparable to the system size.\nThereafter, perturbation vectors converge to the unique Lyapunov vector,\nshowing characteristic meandering, coalescence, and annihilation of borders of\npiece-wise regions that remain different from the Lyapunov vector. Our work\nimplies that the KPZ universality for stochastic systems generally\ncharacterizes deterministic STC perturbations, providing new insights for STC,\nsuch as the universal dependence on initial perturbation and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 07:27:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 02:33:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 02:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

Hence, rumors and fake news can quickly spread on a huge scale. This\nmay pose a threat to the credibility of social media and can cause serious\nconsequences in real life. Therefore, the task of rumor detection and\nverification has become extremely important. Assessing the veracity of a social\nmedia message (e.g., by fact checkers) involves analyzing the text of the\nmessage, its context and any multimedia attachment. This is a very\ntime-consuming task that can be much helped by machine learning. In the\nliterature, most message veracity verification methods only exploit textual\ncontents and metadata. Very few take both textual and visual contents, and more\nparticularly images, into account. In this paper, we second the hypothesis that\nexploiting all of the components of a social media post enhances the accuracy\nof veracity detection. To further the state of the art, we first propose using\na set of advanced image features that are inspired from the field of image\nquality assessment, which effectively contributes to rumor detection. These\nmetrics are good indicators for the detection of fake images, even for those\ngenerated by advanced techniques like generative adversarial networks (GANs).\nThen, we introduce the Multimodal fusiON framework to assess message veracIty\nin social neTwORks (MONITOR), which exploits all message features (i.e., text,\nsocial context, and image features) by supervised machine learning. Such\nalgorithms provide interpretability and explainability in the decisions taken,\nwhich we believe is particularly important in the context of rumor\nverification. Experimental results show that MONITOR can detect rumors with an\naccuracy of 96% and 89% on the MediaEval benchmark and the FakeNewsNet dataset,\nrespectively. These results are significantly better than those of\nstate-of-the-art machine learning baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 07:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

In this study, we investigate the interface plasmon mode along the edge\nof a metal gate electrode with ungated and gated QH regions in both integer and\nfractional QH regimes using a time-resolved measurement scheme. The observed\nplasmon waveform was delayed and broadened due to the influence of the charge\npuddles formed around the channel. The charge velocity and diffusion constant\nof the plasmon mode were evaluated by analyzing the waveform using a\ndistributed circuit model. We found that the conductive puddles in the gated\nregion induce significant dissipation in plasmon transport. For instance, a\nfractional interface channel with a reasonably fast velocity was obtained by\npreparing a fractional state in the ungated region and an integer state in the\ngated region, whereas a channel in the swapped configuration was quite\ndissipative. This reveals a high-quality interface channel that provides a\nclean path to transport fractional charges for studying various fractional QH\nphenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 08:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

First, based on the nonlinear Dist-Flow model, an optimization\nproblem that minimizes the sum of slack variables is formulated to describe the\ndispatchable region. The nonconvexity caused by alternating-current (AC) power\nflow constraints makes it intractable. To deal with this issue, the problem is\nrelaxed to a second-order cone program (SOCP) whose strong dual problem is\nderived.

However, current direct control methods are\nimpractical, and existing tools for programming robot remotely have focused on\nusers with significant robotic experience. Extending robot remote programming\nto end users, i.e., users who are experts in a domain but novices in robotics,\nrequires tools that balance the rich features necessary for complex\nteleoperation tasks with ease of use. The primary challenge to usability is\nthat novice users are unable to specify complete and robust task plans to allow\na robot to perform duties autonomously, particularly in highly variable\nenvironments. Our solution is to allow operators to specify shorter sequences\nof high-level commands, which we call task-level authoring, to create periods\nof variable robot autonomy. This approach allows inexperienced users to create\nrobot behaviors in uncertain environments by interleaving exploration,\nspecification of behaviors, and execution as separate steps. End users are able\nto break down the specification of tasks and adapt to the current needs of the\ninteraction and environments, combining the reactivity of direct control to\nasynchronous operation. In this paper, we describe a prototype system\ncontextualized in light manufacturing and its empirical validation in a user\nstudy where 18 participants with some programming experience were able to\nperform a variety of complex telemanipulation tasks with little training. Our\nresults show that our approach allowed users to create flexible periods of\nautonomy and solve rich manipulation tasks. Furthermore, participants\nsignificantly preferred our system over comparative more direct interfaces,\ndemonstrating the potential of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 09:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

The differences in the marginalised forecast errors, with the\nfull-sky approximation performing poorly for small survey areas but excellently\nfor stage-IV-like areas, are found to be absorbed by the marginalisation on\ngalaxy bias nuisance parameters.

For\ntensor data with complex manifold structure, the graph can not exactly\nconstruct similarity relationships. In this paper, in order to effectively\nutilize the higher-dimensional and complicated similarities among objects, we\nintroduce hypergraph to the framework of NTR to further enhance the feature\nextraction, upon which a hypergraph regularized nonnegative tensor ring\ndecomposition (HGNTR) method is developed. To reduce the computational\ncomplexity and suppress the noise, we apply the low-rank approximation trick to\naccelerate HGNTR (called LraHGNTR).

They\nappear in the formalism once the analytic behaviour of fields near infinity is\nspecified and have received a renewed interest in the last years after a\npossible connection with the information-loss paradox has been conjectured.\n  One of the various methods used to study the asymptotic symmetries of field\ntheories relies on the Hamiltonian formalism and was introduced in the seminal\nwork of Henneaux and Troessaert, who successfully applied it to the case of\ngravity and electrodynamics. The main advantage of this approach is that the\nstudy of the asymptotic symmetries ensues from clear-cut first principles.\n  After an extensive review of how the Hamiltonian approach to study asymptotic\nsymmetries of gauge theories works, we apply these methods to two specific\nsituations of physical interest. First, we deal with the non-abelian Yang-Mills\ncase and we show that the above principles lead to trivial asymptotic\nsymmetries (nothing else than the Poincar\\'e group) and, as a consequence, to a\nvanishing total colour charge. This is a new and somewhat unexpected result. It\nimplies that no globally colour-charged states exist in classical non-abelian\nYang-Mills theory.\n  The second situation considered is a scalar field minimally-coupled to an\nabelian gauge field, which can be used to study, at the same time, two specific\ncases: scalar electrodynamics and the abelian Higgs model. We show that the\nsituation in scalar electrodynamics amply depends on whether the scalar field\nis massive or massless, insofar as, in the latter case, one cannot canonically\nimplement asymptotic symmetries. Furthermore, we illustrate that, in the\nabelian Higgs model, the asymptotic canonical symmetries reduce to the\nPoincar\\'e group in an unproblematic fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 10:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

One of\nthe most important riddles is the good empirical generalization of\noverparameterized models. Overparameterized models are excessively complex with\nrespect to the size of the training dataset, which results in them perfectly\nfitting (i.e., interpolating) the training data, which is usually noisy. Such\ninterpolation of noisy data is traditionally associated with detrimental\noverfitting, and yet a wide range of interpolating models -- from simple linear\nmodels to deep neural networks -- have recently been observed to generalize\nextremely well on fresh test data. Indeed, the recently discovered double\ndescent phenomenon has revealed that highly overparameterized models often\nimprove over the best underparameterized model in test performance.\n  Understanding learning in this overparameterized regime requires new theory\nand foundational empirical studies, even for the simplest case of the linear\nmodel. The underpinnings of this understanding have been laid in very recent\nanalyses of overparameterized linear regression and related statistical\nlearning tasks, which resulted in precise analytic characterizations of double\ndescent. This paper provides a succinct overview of this emerging theory of\noverparameterized ML (henceforth abbreviated as TOPML) that explains these\nrecent findings through a statistical signal processing perspective. We\nemphasize the unique aspects that define the TOPML research area as a subfield\nof modern ML theory and outline interesting open questions that remain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 10:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Especially during times of increased solar activity, the\nevolution of the magnetic field may yield large uncertainties. A significant\nsource of uncertainty is the Sun's magnetic field on the side of the Sun that\nis not visible to the observer. Various methods have been used to complete the\npicture: synoptic charts, flux-transport models, and far side helioseismology.\nIn this study, we present a new method to estimate the far-side open flux\nwithin coronal holes using STEREO EUV observations. First, we correlate the\nstructure of the photospheric magnetic field as observed with the Helioseismic\nand Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (HMI/SDO) with\nfeatures in the transition region. From the 304A intensity distribution, which\nwe found to be specific to coronal holes, we derive an empirical estimate for\nthe open flux. Then we use a large sample of 313 SDO coronal hole observations\nto verify this relation. Finally, we perform a cross-instrument calibration\nfrom SDO to STEREO data to enable the estimation of the open flux at solar\nlongitudes not visible from Earth. We find that the properties of strong,\nunipolar magnetic elements in the photosphere, which determine the coronal\nhole's open flux, can be approximated by open fields in the transition region.\nWe find that structures below a threshold of 78% (STEREO) or 94% (SDO) of the\nsolar disk median intensity as seen in 304A filtergrams are reasonably well\ncorrelated with the mean magnetic flux density of coronal holes (cc = 0.59).\nUsing the area covered by these structures (A_of) and the area of the coronal\nhole (A_ch), we model the open magnetic flux of a coronal hole as |Phi_ch| =\n0.25 A_ch exp(0.032 A_of) with an estimated uncertainty of 40 to 60%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 11:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

Circuit topology captures the\narrangements of intra-chain contacts within a given folded linear chain and\nallows for the classification and comparison of chains. Contacts keep chain\nsegments in physical proximity and can be either mechanically hard attachments\nor soft entanglements that constrain a physical chain. Contrary to knot theory,\nwhich offers many established knot invariants, circuit invariants are just\nbeing developed. Here, we present polynomial invariants that are both efficient\nand sufficiently powerful to deal with any combination of soft and hard\ncontacts. A computer implementation and table of chains with up to three\ncontacts is also provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 12:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Physics-based models that capture the wake flow-field with high-fidelity\nare computationally very expensive to perform layout optimization of wind\nfarms, and, thus, data-driven reduced order models can represent an efficient\nalternative for simulating wind farms. In this work, we use real-world light\ndetection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements of wind-turbine wakes to construct\npredictive surrogate models using machine learning. Specifically, we first\ndemonstrate the use of deep autoencoders to find a low-dimensional\n\\emph{latent} space that gives a computationally tractable approximation of the\nwake LiDAR measurements. Then, we learn the mapping between the parameter space\nand the (latent space) wake flow-fields using a deep neural network.\nAdditionally, we also demonstrate the use of a probabilistic machine learning\ntechnique, namely, Gaussian process modeling, to learn the\nparameter-space-latent-space mapping in addition to the epistemic and aleatoric\nuncertainty in the data.

For ease of construction, a seek for using\none-dimensional photonic crystals to achieve RGB triple reflective bands is a\nmeaningful endeavor. Only very limited previous studies exist, all relying on\ntraditional periodic photonic crystals (PPCs) and of large thickness.

While such path selection has\nthe potential to increase performance and security of networks, there is a\nprominent concern that it could also lead to network instability (i.e.,\nflow-volume oscillation) if paths are selected in a greedy, load-adaptive\nfashion. However, the extent and the impact vectors of instability caused by\npath selection are rarely concretized or quantified, which is essential to\ndiscuss the merits and drawbacks of end-host path selection.\n  In this work, we investigate the effect of end-host path selection on various\nmetrics of networks both qualitatively and quantitatively. To achieve general\nand fundamental insights, we leverage the recently introduced axiomatic\nperspective on congestion control and adapt it to accommodate joint algorithms\nfor path selection and congestion control, i.e., multi-path congestion-control\nprotocols. Using this approach, we identify equilibria of the multi-path\ncongestion-control dynamics and analytically characterize these equilibria with\nrespect to important metrics of interest in networks (the 'axioms') such as\nefficiency, fairness, and loss avoidance. Moreover, we analyze how these\naxiomatic ratings for a general network change compared to a scenario without\npath selection, thereby obtaining an interpretable and quantititative\nformalization of the performance impact of end-host path-selection.

However, these forces produce a rather soft equation of state\n(EoS) in neutron matter, which leads to predict maximum masses of neutron stars\nwell below the observed value of two solar masses. To remove this limitation,\nwe built new Gogny parametrizations by modifying the density dependence of the\nsymmetry energy predicted by the force in such a way that they can be applied\nto the neutron star domain and can also reproduce the properties of finite\nnuclei as good as their predecessors. These new parametrizations allow us to\nobtain stiffer EoS's based on the Gogny interactions, which predict maximum\nmasses of neutron stars around two solar masses. Moreover, other global\nproperties of the star, such as the moment of inertia and the tidal\ndeformability, are in harmony with those obtained with other well tested EoSs\nbased on the SLy4 Skyrme force or the Barcelona--Catania--Paris--Madrid (BCPM)\nenergy density functional. Properties of the core-crust transition predicted by\nthese Gogny EoSs are also analyzed. Using these new Gogny forces, the EoS in\nthe inner crust is obtained with the Wigner--Seitz approximation in the\nVariational Wigner--Kirkwood approach along with the Strutinsky integral\nmethod, which allows one to estimate in a perturbative way the proton shell and\npairing corrections.

Due to the fundamental problem\nof causality, individual causal effects (ICEs) cannot be retrieved from\ncross-sectional data. However, in crossover studies, it is accepted that ICEs\ncan be estimated under the assumptions of no carryover effects and time\ninvariance of potential outcomes. A generic potential-outcome formulation with\nappropriate statistical assumptions to identify ICEs is lacking for other\nlongitudinal data with time-varying exposures. We present a general framework\nfor causal effect heterogeneity in which individual-specific effect\nmodification is parameterized with a latent variable, the receptiveness factor.\nIf the exposure varies over time, then the repeated measurements contain\ninformation on an individual's level of this receptiveness factor. Therefore,\nwe study the conditional distribution of the ICE given all an individual's\nfactual information. This novel conditional random variable is called the\ncross-world causal effect (CWCE). For known causal structures and time-varying\nexposures, the variability of the CWCE reduces with an increasing number of\nrepeated measurements. The CWCE becomes identifiable from observational data\nunder the causal assumption of cross-world similarity of individual-effect\nmodification (i.e. there exists an exposure strategy whose effect is affected\nby all latent causes).

This loss of variance is often\nattributed to reduced-rank representations of the covariance matrix, as in\nensemble methods for example, or else to the use of dissipative numerical\nmethods. Through a combination of analytical work and numerical experiments, we\ndemonstrate that significant variance loss, as well as gain, typically occurs\nduring covariance propagation, even at full rank. The cause of this unusual\nbehavior is a discontinuous change in the continuum covariance dynamics as\ncorrelation lengths become small, for instance in the vicinity of sharp\ngradients in the velocity field. This discontinuity in the covariance dynamics\narises from hyperbolicity: the diagonal of the kernel of the covariance\noperator is a characteristic surface for advective dynamics. Our numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that standard numerical methods for evolving the state\nare not adequate for propagating the covariance, because they do not capture\nthe discontinuity in the continuum covariance dynamics as correlations lengths\ntend to zero. Our analytical and numerical results demonstrate in the context\nof mass conservation that this leads to significant, spurious variance loss in\nregions of mass convergence and gain in regions of mass divergence. The results\nsuggest that developing local covariance propagation methods designed\nspecifically to capture covariance evolution near the diagonal may prove a\nuseful alternative to current methods of covariance propagation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 15:12:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

The combinatorial space of scenarios is huge, e.g., API input\nparameters, order of API execution, and network faults. Hybrid Cloud and edge\nenvironments exacerbate the challenge of API testing due to the need to\ncoordinate test execution across dynamic wide-area networks, possibly across\nnetwork boundaries.

It is subjected to dependency on sensor type,\npower supply stability, and connectivity stability without mentioning artifacts\nintroduced by the person himself. Multiple challenges have to be overcome in\nthis field, such as; monitoring the precise spatial location of the person, and\nestimating vital signs like an individuals average temperature. Privacy is\nanother domain of the problem to be thought of with care. Identifying the\npersons posture without a camera is another challenge. Posture identification\nassists in the persons fall detection. Thermal imaging could be a proper\nsolution for most of the mentioned challenges. It provides monitoring both the\npersons average temperature and spatial location while maintaining privacy. In\nthis research, we propose an IoT system for monitoring an indoor ADL using\nthermal sensor array (TSA).

Recently Neural Machine Translation based approaches are gaining\nmomentum that translates natural language queries to structured query languages\nthereby solving the KGQA task. However, most of these methods struggle with\nout-of-vocabulary words where test entities and relations are not seen during\ntraining time. In this work, we propose a modular two-stage neural architecture\nto solve the KGQA task.\n  The first stage generates a sketch of the target SPARQL called SPARQL\nsilhouette for the input question. This comprises of (1) Noise simulator to\nfacilitate out-of-vocabulary words and to reduce vocabulary size (2) seq2seq\nmodel for text to SPARQL silhouette generation. The second stage is a Neural\nGraph Search Module. SPARQL silhouette generated in the first stage is\ndistilled in the second stage by substituting precise relation in the predicted\nstructure. We simulate ideal and realistic scenarios by designing a noise\nsimulator. Experimental results show that the quality of generated SPARQL\nsilhouette in the first stage is outstanding for the ideal scenarios but for\nrealistic scenarios (i.e. noisy linker), the quality of the resulting SPARQL\nsilhouette drops drastically. However, our neural graph search module recovers\nit considerably.

However, the porosity of the as-built part deteriorates the\nmechanical property and even hinders the further application of metal additive\nmanufacturing. Particularly, the mechanisms of keyhole pores associated with\nthe keyhole fluctuation are not fully understood. To reveal the mechanisms of\nthe keyhole pores formation, we adopt a multiphysics thermal-fluid flow model\nincorporating heat transfer, liquid flow, metal evaporation, Marangoni effect,\nand Darcy's law to simulate the keyhole pore formation process, and the results\nare validated with the in-situ X-ray images. The simulation results present the\ninstant bubble formation due to the keyhole instability and motion of the\ninstant bubble when it pins on the solidification front. Moreover, the unevenly\ndistributed recoil pressure on the keyhole surface is an important factor for\nkeyhole collapse and penetration. Furthermore, comparing the keyhole pore\nformation under different laser scanning speeds shows that the keyhole pore is\nsensitive to the manufacturing parameters. The keyhole fluctuation features and\nenergy absorptivity variation on the rear keyhole wall could be metrics to\nevaluate the likelihood of the keyhole pore formation. Additionally, the\nsimulation under a low ambient pressure shows the feasibility of improving the\nkeyhole stability to reduce and even avoid the formation of keyhole pores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 00:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}
