This rich data source will give\nus insights on the best ways to perform genomic surveillance for this and\nfuture pandemic threats, with the ultimate goal of mitigating or eliminating\nsuch threats. Analyzing and processing the several million genomic sequences is\na challenging task. Although traditional methods for sequence classification\nare proven to be effective, they are not designed to deal with these specific\ntypes of genomic sequences. Moreover, most of the existing methods also face\nthe issue of scalability. Previous studies which were tailored to coronavirus\ngenomic data proposed to use spike sequences (corresponding to a subsequence of\nthe genome), rather than using the complete genomic sequence, to perform\ndifferent machine learning (ML) tasks such as classification and clustering.\nHowever, those methods suffer from scalability issues. In this paper, we\npropose an approach called Spike2Vec, an efficient and scalable feature vector\nrepresentation for each spike sequence that can be used for downstream ML\ntasks.

In addition to errors that occur during gate and measurement\noperations, a qubit is susceptible to idling errors, which occur when the qubit\nis idle and not actively undergoing any operations. To mitigate idling errors,\nprior works in the quantum devices community have proposed Dynamical Decoupling\n(DD), that reduces stray noise on idle qubits by continuously executing a\nspecific sequence of single-qubit operations that effectively behave as an\nidentity gate. Unfortunately, existing DD protocols have been primarily studied\nfor individual qubits and their efficacy at the application-level is not yet\nfully understood.\n  Our experiments show that naively enabling DD for every idle qubit does not\nnecessarily improve fidelity. While DD reduces the idling error-rates for some\nqubits, it increases the overall error-rate for others due to the additional\noperations of the DD protocol. Furthermore, idling errors are program-specific\nand the set of qubits that benefit from DD changes with each program. To enable\nrobust use of DD, we propose Adaptive Dynamical Decoupling (ADAPT), a software\nframework that estimates the efficacy of DD for each qubit combination and\njudiciously applies DD only to the subset of qubits that provide the most\nbenefit. ADAPT employs a Decoy Circuit, which is structurally similar to the\noriginal program but with a known solution, to identify the DD sequence that\nmaximizes the fidelity. To avoid the exponential search of all possible DD\ncombinations, ADAPT employs a localized algorithm that has linear complexity in\nthe number of qubits. Our experiments on IBM quantum machines (with 16-27\nqubits) show that ADAPT improves the application fidelity by 1.86x on average\nand up-to 5.73x compared to no DD and by 1.2x compared to DD on all qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2021 16:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

As quantum programs\ncreate and manipulate correlated states, all the program qubits are measured in\neach trial and thus, the severity of measurement errors increases with the\nprogram size. The fidelity of quantum programs can be improved by reducing the\nnumber of measurement operations.\n  We present JigSaw, a framework that reduces the impact of measurement errors\nby running a program in two modes.

But little is\nknown about the delay performance of systems with multiserver jobs. We consider\nqueueing models for multiserver jobs in scaling regimes where the system load\nbecomes heavy and meanwhile the total number of servers in the system and the\nnumber of servers that a job needs become large. Prior work has derived upper\nbounds on the queueing probability in this scaling regime. However, without\nproper lower bounds, the existing results cannot be used to differentiate\nbetween policies. In this paper, we study the delay performance by establishing\nsharp bounds on the mean waiting time of multiserver jobs, where the waiting\ntime of a job is the time spent in queueing rather than in service.

Several\nmodifications have been proposed over the sinusoidal positional encodings used\nin the original transformer architecture; these include, for instance,\nseparating position encodings and token embeddings, or directly modifying\nattention weights based on the distance between word pairs. We first show that\nsurprisingly, while these modifications tend to improve monolingual language\nmodels, none of them result in better multilingual language models. We then\nanswer why that is: Sinusoidal encodings were explicitly designed to facilitate\ncompositionality by allowing linear projections over arbitrary time steps.\nHigher variances in multilingual training distributions requires higher\ncompression, in which case, compositionality becomes indispensable. Learned\nabsolute positional encodings (e.g., in mBERT) tend to approximate sinusoidal\nembeddings in multilingual settings, but more complex positional encoding\narchitectures lack the inductive bias to effectively learn compositionality and\ncross-lingual alignment. In other words, while sinusoidal positional encodings\nwere originally designed for monolingual applications, they are particularly\nuseful in multilingual language models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2021 23:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

We suggest a rigorous new paradigm for loss\nminimization in machine learning where the loss function can be ignored at the\ntime of learning and only be taken into account when deciding an action.\n  We introduce the notion of an (${\\mathcal{L}},\\mathcal{C}$)-omnipredictor,\nwhich could be used to optimize any loss in a family ${\\mathcal{L}}$.

The timing of relatively young, alluvial fan-forming rivers is\nespecially important, as Mars' Amazonian atmosphere is thought to have been too\nthin to consistently support surface liquid water. Previous regional studies\nsuggested that alluvial fans formed primarily between the Early Hesperian and\nthe Early Amazonian. In this study, we describe how a combination of a global\nimpact crater database, a global geologic map, a global alluvial fan database,\nand statistical models can be used to estimate the timing of alluvial fan\nformation across Mars. Using our global approach and improved statistical\nmodeling, we find that alluvial fan formation likely persisted into the last\n~2.5 Gyr, well into the Amazonian period.

Focusing on radiative muon mass, we constrain the model from the\nrequirement of satisfying muon mass, recently measured muon anomalous magnetic\nmoment by the E989 experiment at Fermilab along with other experimental bounds\nincluding the large hadron collider (LHC) limits. The anomalous Higgs coupling\nto muon is constrained from the LHC measurements of Higgs to dimuon decay. The\nsinglet fermion dark matter phenomenology is discussed showing the importance\nof both annihilation and coannihilation effects. Incorporating all bounds lead\nto a constrained parameter space which can be probed at different experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2021 03:41:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 04:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

The\nless time EMVs spend traveling through the traffic, the more likely it would\nhelp save people's lives and reduce property loss. To reduce the travel time of\nEMVs, prior work has used route optimization based on historical traffic-flow\ndata and traffic signal pre-emption based on the optimal route. However,\ntraffic signal pre-emption dynamically changes the traffic flow which, in turn,\nmodifies the optimal route of an EMV. In addition, traffic signal pre-emption\npractices usually lead to significant disturbances in traffic flow and\nsubsequently increase the travel time for non-EMVs.

To study the\nintrinsic magnetic properties, zero-field magnetometry is desirable. However,\nfor shallow NV centers under zero field, the strain near diamond surfaces would\ncause level anti-crossing between the spin states, leading to clock transitions\nwhose frequencies are insensitive to magnetic signals. Furthermore, the charge\nnoises from the surfaces would induce extra spin decoherence and hence reduce\nthe magnetic sensitivity.

The hyperfine bias\nenhances the dc magnetic sensitivity by a factor of 22 in our setup. With the\ncharge noises suppressed by the strong hyperfine field, the ac magnetometry\nunder zero field also reaches the limit set by decoherence due to the nuclear\nspin bath. In addition, the 130 MHz splitting of the NV center spin transitions\nallows relaxometry of magnetic noises simultaneously at two well-separated\nfrequencies (~2.870 +/- 0.065 GHz), providing (low-resolution) spectral\ninformation of high-frequency noises under zero field.

Our study not only sheds further insight into the\nmechanism for the periodic electronic structure, but also reveals the interplay\nbetween the anomalous metal and superconducting fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2021 07:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

Its aim is the design of a (nonlinear) feedback law\nthat brings and maintains the state trajectory of a dynamic system on a given\nsliding surface. Here, dynamics becomes completely independent of the model\nparameters and can be tuned accordingly to the desired target. In this paper we\nstudy this problem when the feedback law is subject to strong structural\nconstraints. In particular, we assume that the control input may take values\nonly over two bounded and disjoint sets. Such sets could be also non perfectly\nknown a priori. An example is a control input allowed to switch only between\ntwo values. Under these peculiarities, we derive the necessary and sufficient\nconditions that guarantee sliding-mode control effectiveness for a class of\ntime-varying continuous-time linear systems that includes all the stationary\nstate-space linear models. Our analysis covers several scientific fields. It is\nonly apparently confined to the linear setting and allows also to study an\nimportant set of nonlinear models.

In\ndiscrete-event systems, based on a standard setting in which an intruder has\nthe complete knowledge of the system's structure, the standard versions of\ncurrent-state opacity and initial-state opacity cannot perfectly characterize\nhigh-level privacy requirements. To overcome such a limitation, in this paper\nwe propose two stronger versions of opacity in partially-observed\ndiscrete-event systems, called \\emph{strong current-state opacity} and\n\\emph{strong initial-state opacity}. Strong current-state opacity describes\nthat an intruder never makes for sure whether a system is in a secret state at\nthe current time, that is, if a system satisfies this property, then for each\nrun of the system ended by a secret state, there exists a non-secret run whose\nobservation is the same as that of the previous run. Strong initial-state\nopacity captures that the visit of a secret state at the initial time cannot be\ninferred by an intruder at any instant. Specifically, a system is said to be\nstrongly initial-state opaque if for each run starting from a secret state,\nthere exists a non-secret run of the system that has the same observation as\nthe previous run has.

Several studies introduced\nDNA based storage systems with high information density (petabytes/gram).\nHowever, DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies yield erroneous outputs.\nAlgorithmic approaches for correcting these errors depend on reading multiple\ncopies of each sequence and result in excessive reading costs. The\nunprecedented success of Transformers as a deep learning architecture for\nlanguage modeling has led to its repurposing for solving a variety of tasks\nacross various domains. In this work, we propose a novel approach for\nsingle-read reconstruction using an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture\nfor DNA based data storage.

To\ndemonstrate our proposed approach, we encode text, image and code-script files\nto DNA, produce errors with high-fidelity error simulator, and reconstruct the\noriginal files from the noisy reads. Our model achieves lower error rates when\nreconstructing the original data from a single read of each DNA strand compared\nto state-of-the-art algorithms using 2-3 copies. This is the first\ndemonstration of using deep learning models for single-read reconstruction in\nDNA based storage which allows for the reduction of the overall cost of the\nprocess.

Current diagnosis of FAS is typically done by identifying a set of\nfacial characteristics, which are often obtained by manual examination.\nAnatomical landmark detection, which provides rich geometric information, is\nimportant to detect the presence of FAS associated facial anomalies. This\nimaging application is characterized by large variations in data appearance and\nlimited availability of labeled data. Current deep learning-based heatmap\nregression methods designed for facial landmark detection in natural images\nassume availability of large datasets and are therefore not wellsuited for this\napplication. To address this restriction, we develop a new regularized transfer\nlearning approach that exploits the knowledge of a network learned on large\nfacial recognition datasets. In contrast to standard transfer learning which\nfocuses on adjusting the pre-trained weights, the proposed learning approach\nregularizes the model behavior.

In real-world scenario, the entity may\nnot be included by the knowledge base or suffer from the precision of knowledge\nretrieval. To deal with this problem, instead of introducing knowledge base as\nthe input, we force the model to learn a better semantic representation by\npredicting the information in the knowledge base, only based on the input\ncontext. Specifically, with the help of a knowledge base, we introduce two\nauxiliary training objectives: 1) Interpret Masked Word, which conjectures the\nmeaning of the masked entity given the context; 2) Hypernym Generation, which\npredicts the hypernym of the entity based on the context. Experiment results on\ntwo dialogue corpus verify the effectiveness of our methods under both\nknowledge available and unavailable settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2021 11:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

However, most previous\nReinforcement Learning (RL) works only demonstrate the success in controlling\nwith either discrete or continuous action space, while seldom take into account\nthe hybrid action space. One naive way to address hybrid action RL is to\nconvert the hybrid action space into a unified homogeneous action space by\ndiscretization or continualization, so that conventional RL algorithms can be\napplied. However, this ignores the underlying structure of hybrid action space\nand also induces the scalability issue and additional approximation\ndifficulties, thus leading to degenerated results. In this paper, we propose\nHybrid Action Representation (HyAR) to learn a compact and decodable latent\nrepresentation space for the original hybrid action space. HyAR constructs the\nlatent space and embeds the dependence between discrete action and continuous\nparameter via an embedding table and conditional Variantional Auto-Encoder\n(VAE). To further improve the effectiveness, the action representation is\ntrained to be semantically smooth through unsupervised environmental dynamics\nprediction. Finally, the agent then learns its policy with conventional DRL\nalgorithms in the learned representation space and interacts with the\nenvironment by decoding the hybrid action embeddings to the original action\nspace.

The results demonstrate the superiority of HyAR when compared\nwith previous baselines, especially for high-dimensional action spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2021 11:26:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 06:04:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 08:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

This task is challenging because of many essential factors,\nsuch as cooperation among neighboring intersections and dynamic traffic\nscenarios. First, to facilitate cooperation of traffic signals, existing work\nadopts graph neural networks to incorporate the temporal and spatial influences\nof the surrounding intersections into the target intersection, where\nspatial-temporal information is used separately. However, one drawback of these\nmethods is that the spatial-temporal correlations are not adequately exploited\nto obtain a better control scheme. Second, in a dynamic traffic environment,\nthe historical state of the intersection is also critical for predicting future\nsignal switching. Previous work mainly solves this problem using the current\nintersection's state, neglecting the fact that traffic flow is continuously\nchanging both spatially and temporally and does not handle the historical\nstate.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel neural network framework named DynSTGAT,\nwhich integrates dynamic historical state into a new spatial-temporal graph\nattention network to address the above two problems. More specifically, our\nDynSTGAT model employs a novel multi-head graph attention mechanism, which aims\nto adequately exploit the joint relations of spatial-temporal information.\nThen, to efficiently utilize the historical state information of the\nintersection, we design a sequence model with the temporal convolutional\nnetwork (TCN) to capture the historical information and further merge it with\nthe spatial information to improve its performance.

Recently, the visual attention mechanism has become a\npromising way to improve the performance of CNNs for some computer vision\ntasks. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Layer-wise External\nAttention Network (LEA-Net) for efficient image anomaly detection. The core\nidea relies on the integration of unsupervised and supervised anomaly detectors\nvia the visual attention mechanism. Our strategy is as follows: (i) Prior\nknowledge about anomalies is represented as the anomaly map generated by\nunsupervised learning of normal instances, (ii) The anomaly map is translated\nto an attention map by the external network, (iii) The attention map is then\nincorporated into intermediate layers of the anomaly detection network.\nNotably, this layer-wise external attention can be applied to any CNN model in\nan end-to-end training manner. For a pilot study, we validate LEA-Net on color\nanomaly detection tasks. Through extensive experiments on PlantVillage, MVTec\nAD, and Cloud datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed layer-wise visual\nattention mechanism consistently boosts anomaly detection performances of an\nexisting CNN model, even on imbalanced datasets.

Here we consider an intermediate case of how a simple microswimmer,\nthe tangential spherical squirmer, behaves adjacent to singly- and\ndoubly-periodic sinusoidal surface topographies that spatially oscillate with\nan amplitude that is an order of magnitude less than the swimmer size and\nwavelengths within an order of magnitude of this scale. The nearest neighbour\nregularised Stokeslet method is used for numerical explorations after\nvalidating its accuracy for a spherical tangential squirmer that swims stably\nnear a flat surface. The same squirmer is then introduced to the different\nsurface topographies. The key governing factor in the resulting swimming\nbehaviour is the size of the squirmer relative to the surface topography\nwavelength. When the squirmer is much larger, or much smaller, than the surface\ntopography wavelength then directional guidance is not observed. Once the\nsquirmer size is on the scale of the topography wavelength limited guidance is\npossible, often with local capture in the topography troughs. However, complex\ndynamics can also emerge, especially when the initial configuration is not\nclose to alignment along topography troughs or above topography crests. In\ncontrast to sensitivity in alignment and the topography wavelength, reductions\nin the amplitude of the surface topography or variations in the shape of the\nperiodic surface topography do not have extensive impacts on the squirmer\nbehaviour. Our findings more generally highlight that detailed numerical\nexplorations are necessary to determine how surface topographies may interact\nwith a given swimmer that swims stably near a flat surface and whether surface\ntopographies may be designed to provide such swimmers with directional\nguidance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2021 14:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

Empirical research with fruit flies\nstrongly supports that a randomized representational architecture is used in\nolfactory processing in insect brains.

As the symbol\nrates of coherent transponders are increased to 100 Gbaud and beyond,\nmaintaining a high SPRR in a cost-effective manner becomes more and more\nchallenging. One potential approach for solving this problem is to leverage the\nconcept of single-ended coherent receiver (SER) where single-ended PDs are used\ninstead of the balanced PDs. In this case, the resulting SSBI should be\nmitigated in the digital domain. In this paper, we show that SSBI can be\neffectively mitigated using various low-complexity techniques, such as the\ndirect filed reconstruction (DFR), clipped iterative SSBI cancellation (CIC)\nand gradient decent (GD). In addition, we present a self-calibration technique\nfor SERs which can be extended for characterizing the optical-to-electrical\n(O/E) response of a conventional balanced coherent receiver (BR). Using the\ndeveloped techniques, we then experimentally demonstrate a 90 Gbaud\nprobabilistically constellation shaped 64-QAM (PCS-64QAM) transmission using a\nSER, achieving a net data rate of 882 Gb/s over 100 km of standard single mode\nfiber (SSMF). The sensitivity penalty compared to the BR is below 0.5 dB. We\nexpect that when the symbol rate is increased further, a SER can potentially\noutperform a BR, especially when applied to cost-sensitive commercial pluggable\ncoherent transceivers\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2021 15:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

In this paper, I report the results of the application of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs), specifically video-to-video translation\nnetworks, to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The purpose of\nthis research is to reduce the computational cost of CFD simulations with GANs.\nThe architecture of GANs in this research is a combination of the\nimage-to-image translation networks (the so-called \"pix2pix\") and Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM). It is shown that the results of high-cost and\nhigh-accuracy simulations (with high-resolution computational grids) can be\nestimated from those of low-cost and low-accuracy simulations (with\nlow-resolution grids). In particular, the time evolution of density\ndistributions in the cases of a high-resolution grid is reproduced from that in\nthe cases of a low-resolution grid through GANs, and the density inhomogeneity\nestimated from the image generated by GANs recovers the ground truth with good\naccuracy. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the results of the\nproposed method with those of several super-resolution algorithms are also\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2021 02:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

It is therefore important to conduct user studies to\ncorrect models' inference biases and improve the model in a life-long learning\nmanner in the future according to the user feedback. In this paper, we present\nFaxPlainAC, a tool that gathers user feedback on the output of explainable\nfact-checking models. FaxPlainAC outputs both the model decision, i.e., whether\nthe input fact is true or not, along with the supporting/refuting evidence\nconsidered by the model. Additionally, FaxPlainAC allows for accepting user\nfeedback both on the prediction and explanation. Developed in Python,\nFaxPlainAC is designed as a modular and easily deployable tool.

However, our empirical studies indicate that these\nframeworks are not suitable for lightweight models such as TextCNN, LSTM and\netc. In this work, we develop a new SSL framework called FLiText, which stands\nfor Faster and Lighter semi-supervised Text classification. FLiText introduces\nan inspirer network together with the consistency regularization framework,\nwhich leverages a generalized regular constraint on the lightweight models for\nefficient SSL. As a result, FLiText obtains new SOTA performance for\nlightweight models across multiple SSL benchmarks on text classification.\nCompared with existing SOTA SSL methods on TextCNN, FLiText improves the\naccuracy of lightweight model TextCNN from 51.00% to 90.49% on IMDb, 39.8% to\n58.06% on Yelp-5, and from 55.3% to 65.08% on Yahoo.
