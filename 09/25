The topology of an\nundirected graph G can be captured by an adjacency matrix; this matrix in turn\ncan be visualized directly to give insight into the graph structure. Which\nvisual patterns appear in such a matrix visualization depends on the ordering\nof its rows and columns. Formally defining the quality of an ordering and then\nautomatically computing a high-quality ordering are both challenging problems;\nhowever, effective heuristics exist and are used in practice.\n  Often, graphs exist as part of a collection of graphs on the same set of\nvertices. To visualize such graph collections, we need a single ordering that\nworks well for all matrices simultaneously. The current state-of-the-art solves\nthis problem by taking a (weighted) union over all graphs and applying existing\nheuristics. However, this union leads to a loss of information, specifically in\nthose parts of the graphs which are different. We propose a collection-aware\napproach to avoid this loss of information and apply it to two popular\nheuristic methods: leaf order and barycenter.\n  The de-facto standard computational quality metrics for matrix ordering\ncapture only block-diagonal patterns (cliques). Instead, we propose to use\nMoran's I, a spatial auto-correlation metric, which captures the full range of\nestablished patterns. The popular leaf order method heuristically optimizes a\nsimilar measure which supports the use of Moran's I in this context.\n  We evaluated our methods for simultaneous orderings on real-world datasets\nusing Moran's I as the quality metric. Our results show that our\ncollection-aware approach matches or improves performance compared to the union\napproach, depending on the similarity of the graphs in the collection.\nSpecifically, our Moran's I-based collection-aware leaf order implementation\nconsistently outperforms other implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 16:17:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

The human may\ncontrol platoons of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground\nvehicles (UGVs) to search a partially observable environment during the target\nsearch mission.

Several federated learning\nframeworks employ differential privacy to prevent private data leakage to\nunauthorized parties and malicious attackers.

To solve this problem, we introduce a\nvision-language embedding alignment method that transfers the generalization\ncapabilities of a pretrained model such as CLIP to an object detector like\nYOLOv5. We formulate a loss function that allows us to align the image and text\nembeddings from the pretrained model CLIP with the modified semantic prediction\nhead from the detector. With this method, we are able to train an object\ndetector that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COCO, ILSVRC, and\nVisual Genome zero-shot detection benchmarks.

In many machine learning or optimization\nproblems the relevant matrices are often sparse. Several prior coded\ncomputation methods operate with dense linear combinations of the original\nsubmatrices; this can significantly increase the worker node computation times\nand consequently the overall job execution time. Moreover, several existing\ntechniques treat the stragglers as failures (erasures) and discard their\ncomputations. In this work, we present a coding approach which operates with\nlimited encoding of the original submatrices and utilizes the partial\ncomputations done by the slower workers. While our scheme can continue to have\nthe optimal threshold of prior work, it also allows us to trade off the\nstraggler resilience with the worker computation speed for sparse input\nmatrices.

For a pair of code snippets, SEED constructs a\nsemantic graph of each code snippet based on intermediate representation to\nrepresent the code semantic more precisely compared to the representations\nbased on lexical and syntactic analysis. To accommodate the characteristics of\nType-4 clones, a semantic graph is constructed focusing on the operators and\nAPI calls instead of all tokens. Then, SEED generates the feature vectors by\nusing the graph match network and performs clone detection based on the\nsimilarity among the vectors. Extensive experiments show that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms two baseline approaches over two public datasets and\none customized dataset. Especially, SEED outperforms other baseline methods by\nan average of 25.2% in the form of F1-Score. Our experiments demonstrate that\nSEED can reach state-of-the-art and be useful for Type-4 clone detection in\npractice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 17:09:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 03:40:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

A great deal of phenomenological works have shown\nin the last few years that this option (sometimes accompanied with a running\ngravitational coupling) may cure some of the tensions afflicting the\n$\\Lambda$CDM.

In\nparallel, there has been great progress in learning generalizable semantic\nrepresentations for vision and language by training on large-scale internet\ndata, however these representations lack the spatial understanding necessary\nfor fine-grained manipulation. To this end, we propose a framework that\ncombines the best of both worlds: a two-stream architecture with semantic and\nspatial pathways for vision-based manipulation.

However,\nfine-tuned causal models (which permit causation without correlation) play a\ncrucial role in cryptography, and cyclic causal models can be used to model\nphysical processes involving feedback and may also be relevant in exotic\nsolutions of general relativity. Here we develop a causal modelling framework\ncapable of dealing with these general scenarios. The key feature of our\nframework is that it allows operational and relativistic notions of causality\nto be independently defined and for connections between them to be established\nin a theory-independent manner. The framework first gives an operational way to\nstudy causation that allows for cyclic, fine-tuned and non-classical causal\ninfluences. We then consider how a causal model can be embedded in a space-time\nstructure (modelled as a partial order) and propose a compatibility condition\nfor ensuring that the embedded causal model does not allow signalling outside\nthe space-time future. We identify several distinct classes of causal loops\nthat can arise in our framework, showing that compatibility with a space-time\ncan rule out only some of them. We discuss conditions for preventing\nsuperluminal signalling within arbitrary (and possibly cyclic) causal\nstructures and consider models of causation in post-quantum theories admitting\nso-called jamming correlations.

We use petitRadTRANS and PandExo\nto model planet atmospheres and simulate JWST observations under different\nscenarios by varying cloud conditions, mean molecular weights (MMWs), and\nNH$_{3}$ mixing ratios. A metric is defined to quantify detection significance\nand provide a ranked list for JWST observations in search of biosignatures in\ngas dwarf planets. It is very challenging to search for the 10.3--10.8 $\\mu$m\nNH$_{3}$ feature using eclipse spectroscopy with MIRI in the presence of photon\nand a systemic noise floor of 12.6 ppm for 10 eclipses. NIRISS, NIRSpec, and\nMIRI are feasible for transmission spectroscopy to detect NH$_{3}$ features\nfrom 1.5 $\\mu$m to 6.1 $\\mu$m under optimal conditions such as a clear\natmosphere and low MMWs for a number of gas dwarf planets. We provide examples\nof retrieval analyses to further support the detection metric that we use. Our\nstudy shows that searching for potential biosignatures such as NH$_{3}$ is\nfeasible with a reasonable investment of JWST time for gas dwarf planets given\noptimal atmospheric conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 18:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Recent results have shown\nthat, following the shock-induced collapse of pores with circular\ncross-sections, more energy is localized as internal potential energy (PE) than\ncan be inferred from the kinetic energy (KE) distribution. This leads to a\ncomplex thermo-mechanical state that is typically overlooked. The mechanisms\nassociated with pore collapse and hotspot formation and the resulting energy\nlocalization are known to be highly dependent on material properties,\nespecially its ability to deform plastically and alleviate strain energy, as\nwell as the size and shape of the pore. Therefore, we use molecular dynamics\nsimulations to characterize shock-induced pore collapse and the subsequent\nformation of hotspots in TATB, a highly anisotropic molecular crystal, for\nvarious defect shapes, shock strengths and crystallographic orientations. We\nfind that the the localization of energy as PE is consistently higher and its\nextent larger than as localized as KE. A detailed analysis of the MD\ntrajectories reveal the underlying molecular process that govern the effect of\norientation and pore shape on the resulting hotspots. We find that the regions\nof highest PE for a given KE relate to not the impact front of the collapse,\nbut the areas of maximum plastic deformation, while KE is maximized at the\npoint of impact. A comparison with previous results in HMX reveal less energy\nlocalization in TATB which could be a contributing factor to its insensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 18:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

The principle challenge for spatiotemporal\nkriging is how to effectively model and leverage the spatiotemporal\ndependencies within the data. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown\ngreat promise for spatiotemporal kriging tasks. However, standard GNNs often\nrequire a carefully designed adjacency matrix and specific aggregation\nfunctions, which are inflexible for general applications/problems. To address\nthis issue, we present SATCN -- Spatial Aggregation and Temporal Convolution\nNetworks -- a universal and flexible framework to perform spatiotemporal\nkriging for various spatiotemporal datasets without the need for model\nspecification. Specifically, we propose a novel spatial aggregation network\n(SAN) inspired by Principal Neighborhood Aggregation, which uses multiple\naggregation functions to help one node gather diverse information from its\nneighbors. To exclude information from unsampled nodes, a masking strategy that\nprevents the unsampled sensors from sending messages to their neighborhood is\nintroduced to SAN. We capture temporal dependencies by the temporal\nconvolutional networks, which allows our model to cope with data of diverse\nsizes. To make SATCN generalizable to unseen nodes and even unseen graph\nstructures, we employ an inductive strategy to train SATCN.

In this work we investigate this prediction by analyzing\nXMM-Newton X-ray counterparts of FUV-detected intergalactic OVI absorbers known\nfrom FUSE and HST/STIS data, and compare this information to the predictions of\nsimulations. We study the X-ray absorption at the redshift of the only\nsignificantly detected OVI absorber in the TonS180 sightline's FUV spectrum,\nfound at $z=0.04579\\pm0.00001$. We characterize the spectral properties of the\nOVI-OVIII absorbers and explore the ionization processes behind the measured\nabsorption. The observational results are compared to the predicted warm-hot\ngas properties in the EAGLE simulation to infer the physical conditions of the\nabsorber. We detect both OVI and OVII absorption at a $5\\sigma$ confidence\nlevel, whereas OVIII absorption is not detected.

In most earlier studies, all\ncomponents of the velocity were assumed to be given on the entire boundary of\nthe flow domain. Our aim is to study the effect of different boundary\nconditions on the stability of such flows. We focus on the following boundary\nconditions: at the inflow part if the boundary (which may be either inner or\nouter cylinder) all components of the velocity are known; at the outflow part\nof the boundary (the other cylinder), the normal stress and either the\ntangential velocity or the tangential stress are prescribed. Both types of\nboundary conditions are relevant to certain real flows: the first one - to\nporous cylinders, the second - to flows, where the fluid leaves the flow domain\nto an ambient fluid which is at rest. It turns out that both sets of boundary\nconditions make the corresponding steady flows more unstable (compared with\nearlier works where all components of the velocity are prescribed on the entire\nboundary). In particular, it is demonstrated that even the classical (purely\nazimuthal) Couette-Taylor flow becomes unstable to two-dimensional\nperturbations if one of the cylinders is porous and the normal stress (rather\nthan normal velocity) is prescribed on that cylinder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 19:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

The safety of these vehicles while they complete their objectives\nis of paramount importance. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a promising\ntool for guaranteeing safety for low-dimensional systems. However, due to its\nexponential complexity in computation time, no reachability-based methods have\nbeen able to guarantee safety for more than three vehicles successfully in\nunstructured scenarios. For systems with four or more vehicles,we can only\nempirically validate their safety performance.While reachability-based safety\nmethods enjoy a flexible least-restrictive control strategy, it is challenging\nto reason about long-horizon trajectories online because safety at any given\nstate is determined by looking up its safety value in a pre-computed table that\ndoes not exhibit favorable properties that continuous functions have. This\nmotivates the problem of improving the safety performance of unstructured\nmulti-vehicle systems when safety cannot be guaranteed given any\nleast-restrictive safety-aware collision avoidance algorithm while avoiding\nonline trajectory optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel approach\nusing supervised learning to enhance the safety of vehicles by proposing new\ninitial states in very close neighborhood of the original initial states of\nvehicles.

Hence, it is of\ninterest to compare and further investigate the performance of the two methods.\nIn the paper at hand, we contrast the two approaches via theoretical analysis\nand numerical experiments with a focus on conditional coverage of prediction\nintervals. We discuss suitable scenarios for applying each algorithm,\nunderscore the importance of conditional vs. unconditional coverage, and show\nthat, under mild conditions, the Model-free bootstrap yields prediction\nintervals with guaranteed better conditional coverage compared to quantile\nestimation. We also extend the concept of `pertinence' of prediction intervals\nin Politis (2015) to the nonparametric regression setting, and give concrete\nexamples where its importance emerges under finite sample scenarios.

We combine this mechanical model with an enthalpy\nmethod which conserves energy across phase change interfaces on a fixed\ncomputational grid. The force balance and enthalpy model together determine the\nevolution of the frozen fringe thickness and our simulations predict frost\nheave rates and ice lens spacing. Our model accounts for premelting at\nice-sediment contacts, partial ice saturation of the pore space, water flow\nthrough the fringe, the thermodynamics of the ice-water-sediment interface, and\nvertical force balance. We explicitly account for the formation of ice lenses,\nregions of pure ice that cleave the fringe at the depth where the interparticle\nforce vanishes. Our model results allow us to predict the thickness of a frozen\nfringe and the spacing of ice lenses at the base of glaciers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 20:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

We extend previous analyses in two main ways: we include\ndata from the Virgo detector and we allow for more unequal mass systems, with\nmass ratio $q \\geq 0.1$. We do not report any gravitational-wave candidates.\nThe most significant trigger has a false alarm rate of 0.14 $\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.\nThis implies an upper limit on the merger rate of subsolar binaries in the\nrange $[220-24200] \\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, depending on the chirp\nmass of the binary. We use this upper limit to derive astrophysical constraints\non two phenomenological models that could produce subsolar-mass compact\nobjects. One is an isotropic distribution of equal-mass primordial black holes.\nUsing this model, we find that the fraction of dark matter in primordial black\nholes is $f_\\mathrm{PBH} \\equiv \\Omega_\\mathrm{PBH} / \\Omega_\\mathrm{DM}\n\\lesssim 6\\%$. The other is a dissipative dark matter model, in which fermionic\ndark matter can collapse and form black holes.

We use this validated\ngalaxy mock catalog to forecast the photometric completeness of H$\\alpha$ and\n[OIII] emission lines as a function of line flux cut and H band magnitdue cut,\nfor both Roman and Euclid-like surveys. Our prediction for the photometric\ncompleteness of a Euclid-like survey is in good agreement with previous work\nbased on WISP data. Our predictions for the photometric completeness of\npossible implementations of the Roman High Latitude Wide Area Spectroscopic\nSurvey (HLWASS) provides key input for the planning of such a survey. We find\nthat at H = 24, a Euclid-like survey to the line flux limit of 2$\\times\n10^{-16}\\,$erg/s/cm$^2$ is 97\\% complete, while a Roman HLWASS to the line flux\nlimit of $10^{-16}\\,$erg/s/cm$^2$ is only 94.6\\% complete (it becomes 98\\%\ncomplete at H = 25).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 21:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

These\nnonpharmaceutical interventions were mandated based on prior experiences, such\nas the 1918 influenza epidemic. Hence, we decided to study the impact of\nrestrictions on mobility on reducing COVID-19 transmission. Methods: We\ndesigned an ecological time series study with our exposure variable as Mobility\npatterns in the state of Maryland for March- December 2020 and our outcome\nvariable as the COVID-19 hospitalizations for the same period. We built an\nExtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ensemble machine learning model and\nregressed the lagged COVID-19 hospitalizations with Mobility volume for\ndifferent regions of Maryland.

The\ninnovation of small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAVs) has provided additional\nhigh-resolution imaging capabilities with low cost for mapping a relatively\nlarge area of interest. These cutting-edge technologies have caught the US Army\nand Navy's attention for the purpose of rapid 3D battlefield reconstruction,\nvirtual training, and simulations. Our previous works have demonstrated the\nimportance of information extraction from the derived photogrammetric data to\ncreate semantic-rich virtual environments (Chen et al., 2019). For example, an\nincrease of simulation realism and fidelity was achieved by segmenting and\nreplacing photogrammetric trees with game-ready tree models. In this work, we\nfurther investigated the semantic information extraction problem and focused on\nthe ground material segmentation and object detection tasks. The main\ninnovation of this work was that we leveraged both the original 2D images and\nthe derived 3D photogrammetric data to overcome the challenges faced when using\neach individual data source. For ground material segmentation, we utilized an\nexisting convolutional neural network architecture (i.e., 3DMV) which was\noriginally designed for segmenting RGB-D sensed indoor data. We improved its\nperformance for outdoor photogrammetric data by introducing a depth pooling\nlayer in the architecture to take into consideration the distance between the\nsource images and the reconstructed terrain model. To test the performance of\nour improved 3DMV, a ground truth ground material database was created using\ndata from the One World Terrain (OWT) data repository.

Unlike those obtained in most splitting methods, these\nsubproblems can generally be solved efficiently because they involve simple\noperations such as matrix-vector multiplications or proximal mappings that are\nfast to evaluate numerically. This advantage comes at the price that the linear\nPDHG method requires precise stepsize parameters for the problem at hand to\nachieve an optimal convergence rate. Unfortunately, these stepsize parameters\nare often prohibitively expensive to compute for large-scale optimization\nproblems, such as those in machine learning. This issue makes the otherwise\nsimple linear PDHG method unsuitable for such problems, and it is also shared\nby most first-order optimization methods as well. To address this issue, we\nintroduce accelerated nonlinear PDHG methods that achieve an optimal\nconvergence rate with stepsize parameters that are simple and efficient to\ncompute.

This\npaper focus on effects of mass cascade on halo energy, momentum, dispersion,\nsize, and density. Halo with fast mass accretion has an expanding core. Mass\ncascade forms a new layer of mass that deforms the original halo and induces\nnonzero radial flow (outwards in core and inwards in outer regions). The\ninward/outward flow leads to an extra length scale (scale radius) that is not\npresent in isothermal profile. Halo concentration c=3.5 can be derived for fast\ngrowing halos. For cusp-core controversy, a double-power-law density is\nproposed as a result of nonzero radial flow. The inner/outer density are\ncontrolled by halo deformation rate and halo growth, respectively. The slower\ndeformation at center, the steeper density. For fast growing halos, radial flow\nat center is simply Hubble flow that leads to the existence of central core.\nMass cascade leads to nonzero halo surface energy/tension and radial flow that\nenhances dispersion in outer region. An effective exponent of gravity\n$n_e$=-1.3 (not -1) is obtained due to halo surface energy. Halo size follows a\ngeometric Brownian motion and lognormal distribution. Brownian motion of\nparticles in evolving halos leads to Fokker-Planck equations for particle\ndistribution that is dependent on the radial and osmotic flow. Complete\nsolutions of particle distribution are presented based on a simple model of\nosmotic flow. The proposed model agrees with N-body simulation for various halo\ngroup sizes. With reference pressure/density defined at center, equation of\nstate can be established for relative pressure/density. Pressure, density, and\ndispersion at halo center are presented.

Utilizing full-spectrum fitting, we find\nsubstantial age and metallicity gradients within the central 0.\"9 (16~pc) of\nthe NSC in NGC 5102 where populations near the center are young/metal-rich (age\n~400~Myr and [M/H] ~-0.4) and become older/metal-poor at larger radii (mean age\n~1~Gyr and mean [M/H] ~-1.6 in the radial range [0.\"3, 0.\"9]).

Statically stable solutions for emitting menisci are found to be\nconstrained to a set of conditions: a minimum hydraulic impedance, a maximum\ncurrent output, and a narrow range of background fields that maximizes at\nmenisci sizes of 0.5-3 microns in radius. Static stability is lost when the\nelectric field adjacent to the electrode that holds the meniscus corresponds to\nan electric pressure that exceeds twice the surface tension stress of a sphere\nof the same size as the meniscus.

Numerical examples are presented\nto validate the proposed method for solving 2D waveguide problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2021 05:45:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 09:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

Most of these methods focus on\nextracting more discriminative view-level features and effectively aggregating\nthe multi-view images of a 3D model, but the latent relationship among these\nmulti-view images is not fully explored. Thus, we tackle this problem from the\nperspective of exploiting the relationships between patch features to capture\nlong-range associations among multi-view images. To capture associations among\nviews, in this work, we propose a novel patch convolutional neural network\n(PCNN) for view-based 3D model retrieval. Specifically, we first employ a CNN\nto extract patch features of each view image separately. Secondly, a novel\nneural network module named PatchConv is designed to exploit intrinsic\nrelationships between neighboring patches in the feature space to capture\nlong-range associations among multi-view images. Then, an adaptive weighted\nview layer is further embedded into PCNN to automatically assign a weight to\neach view according to the similarity between each view feature and the\nview-pooling feature. Finally, a discrimination loss function is employed to\nextract the discriminative 3D model feature, which consists of softmax loss\nvalues generated by the fusion lassifier and the specific classifier. Extensive\nexperimental results on two public 3D model retrieval benchmarks, namely, the\nModelNet40, and ModelNet10, demonstrate that our proposed PCNN can outperform\nstate-of-the-art approaches, with mAP alues of 93.67%, and 96.23%,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2021 07:18:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

Given a multi-modal case consisting of a color fundus photo (CFP)\nand an array of OCT B-scan images acquired during an eye examination, we aim to\nbuild a deep neural network that recognizes multiple vision-threatening\ndiseases for the given case. As the diagnostic efficacy of CFP and OCT is\ndisease-dependent, the network's ability of being both selective and\ninterpretable is important. Moreover, as both data acquisition and manual\nlabeling are extremely expensive in the medical domain, the network has to be\nrelatively lightweight for learning from a limited set of labeled multi-modal\nsamples. Prior art on retinal disease recognition focuses either on a single\ndisease or on a single modality, leaving multi-modal fusion largely\nunderexplored.

Neither supposing convexity of the control state space\nnor differentiability of the coefficients with respect to the control variable,\nwe study Peng's stochastic maximum principle for our control problem. The\nnovelty and the difficulty of our work stem from the fact that, given an\nadmissible control $u$, the solution of the associated control problem is only\na weak one. This has as consequence that also the probability measure in the\nsolution $P^{u}=L^{u}_TQ$ depends on $u$ and has a density $L^{u}_T$ with\nrespect to a reference measure $Q$.

We studied the electronic structure\nof IrO$_2$ at different temperatures employing high resolution photoemission\nspectroscopy with photon energies spanning from ultraviolet to hard $x$-ray\nrange. Experimental spectra exhibit a signature of enhancement of Ir-O\ncovalency in the bulk compared to the surface electronic structure. The\nbranching ratio of the spin-orbit split Ir core level peaks is found to be\nlarger than its atomic values and it enhances further in the bulk electronic\nstructure. Such deviation from the atomic description of the core level\nspectroscopy manifests the enhancement of the orbital moment due to the solid\nstate effects. The valence band spectra could be captured well within the\ndensity functional theory. The photon energy dependence of the features in the\nvalence band spectra and their comparison with the calculated results show\ndominant Ir 5$d$ character of the features near the Fermi level; O 2$p$ peaks\nappear at higher binding energies. Interestingly, the O 2$p$ contributions of\nthe feature at the Fermi level is significant and it enhances at low\ntemperatures.

The use of high level programming allows to perform simulations\nwith ease and minimum human work. On the other hand, the Computational Fluid\nDynamics code of choice has efficient lower level functions that provide a\nquick turnaround time.

The empirical study\nshows that binarization causes a great loss of information in the forward and\nbackward propagation. We present a novel Distribution-sensitive Information\nRetention Network (DIR-Net) that retains the information in the forward and\nbackward propagation by improving internal propagation and introducing external\nrepresentations. The DIR-Net mainly relies on three technical contributions:\n(1) Information Maximized Binarization (IMB): minimizing the information loss\nand the binarization error of weights/activations simultaneously by weight\nbalance and standardization; (2) Distribution-sensitive Two-stage Estimator\n(DTE): retaining the information of gradients by distribution-sensitive soft\napproximation by jointly considering the updating capability and accurate\ngradient; (3) Representation-align Binarization-aware Distillation (RBD):\nretaining the representation information by distilling the representations\nbetween full-precision and binarized networks.

We suggest that the quality\nof the identified failure types can be validated through measuring the intra-\nand inter-type generalisation after fine-tuning and introduce metrics to\ncompare different subtyping methods. Furthermore, we argue that a model can be\nconsidered repaired if it achieves high accuracy on the failure types while\nretaining performance on the previously correct data.

In particular, the\nmechanical response of elastomeric composites where the reinforcement is\ncomposed by cords with helically wound fibres is heavily compromised by fatigue\nand delamination phenomena occurring at cord-rubber as well as at the ply\ninterfaces, since rubber and polymeric matrices are mainly vulnerable to the\naccumulation of deviatoric energy due to the shear stresses transferred across\nthe surfaces. Despite the large diffusion of composites in a vast field of\napplications and the mature knowledge of their behaviour, some key mechanical\naspects underlying failure mechanisms are still partially unclear. For example,\nstress amplification and strain localization are often difficult to predict by\nmeans of analytical solutions and averaging techniques that usually conceal\nstress gradients. In this work, we analyse coupling between torsional and\ntensile loads in twisted cords, which are adopted in many cases to reinforce\ncomposites and rubbers in tire applications. We provide a model characterized\nby an enriched cord-matrix mechanical interplay able to theoretically explain\nand predict actual stress distributions responsible for the onset of\ndelamination and fatigue-guided phenomena that are experimentally observed in\nthese composites. In particular, we demonstrate that the assumption of a\nmonoclinic/trigonal behaviour for the mechanical response of the hierarchical\nstrands allows to estimate, by means of analytical formulas and a\nhomogenization approach, hitherto neglected shear stresses at the\nmatrix-reinforcement interface. These stresses are transferred to the\nneighbouring regions, leading to post-elastic behaviour and failure events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2021 12:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

Our grid of progenitor models is derived from He\nstars that were subsequently evolved under the influence of wind mass loss.\nThese He stars, which most likely form through binary mass exchange, synthesize\nless oxygen than their single-star counterparts with the same zero-age main\nsequence (ZAMS) mass. This reduction is greater in He-star models evolved with\nan enhanced mass loss rate. We obtain a wide range of spectral properties at\n200d. In models from He stars with an initial mass >6Msun, the [OI] 6300, 6364\nis of comparable or greater strength than [CaII] 7291,7323 -- the strength of\n[OI] 6300, 6364 increases with He-star initial mass. In contrast, models from\nlower mass He stars exhibit a weak [OI] 6300, 6364, strong [CaII] 7291,7323,\nbut also strong NII lines and FeII emission below 5500A. The ejecta density,\nmodulated by the ejecta mass, the explosion energy, and clumping, has a\ncritical impact on the gas ionization, line cooling, and the spectral\nproperties. FeII dominates the emission below 5500A and is stronger at earlier\nnebular epochs. It ebbs as the SN ages, while the fractional flux in [OI] 6300,\n6364 and [CaII] 7291,7323 increases, with a similar rate, as the ejecta\nrecombine. Although the results depend on the adopted wind mass loss rate and\npre-SN mass, we find that He stars of 6-8Msun initially (ZAMS mass of\n23-28Msun) match adequately the properties of standard SNe Ibc. Our results for\nless massive He stars are more perplexing, since the predicted spectra are not\nseen in nature. They may be missed by current surveys or associated with Type\nIbn SNe in which interaction dominates over decay power.

Hamilton's principle\ncompletely characterizes many high-dimensional models in mathematical physics,\nresulting in rich geometric structures, with examples in fluid dynamics,\nquantum mechanics, optical systems, and epidemiological models. MOR reduces the\ncomputational burden associated with the approximation of complex systems by\nintroducing low-dimensional surrogate models, enabling efficient multi-query\nnumerical simulations. However, standard reduction approaches do not guarantee\nthe conservation of the delicate dynamics of Hamiltonian problems, resulting in\nreduced models plagued by instability or accuracy loss over time. By\napproaching the reduction process from the geometric perspective of symplectic\nmanifolds, the resulting reduced models inherit stability and conservation\nproperties of the high-dimensional formulations. We first introduce the general\nprinciples of symplectic geometry, including symplectic vector spaces, Darboux'\ntheorem, and Hamiltonian vector fields.

In this paper, we argue that\nthose efforts are not mutually exclusive, and propose a unified framework for\nrobust brain MRI registration in both progressive and coarse-to-fine manners\nsimultaneously. Specifically, building on a dual-encoder U-Net, the\nfixed-moving MRI pair is encoded and decoded into multi-scale deformation\nsub-fields from coarse to fine. Each decoding block contains two proposed novel\nmodules: i) in Deformation Field Integration (DFI), a single integrated\nsub-field is calculated, warping by which is equivalent to warping\nprogressively by sub-fields from all previous decoding blocks, and ii) in\nNon-rigid Feature Fusion (NFF), features of the fixed-moving pair are aligned\nby DFI-integrated sub-field, and then fused to predict a finer sub-field.\nLeveraging both DFI and NFF, the target deformation field is factorized into\nmulti-scale sub-fields, where the coarser fields alleviate the estimate of a\nfiner one and the finer field learns to make up those misalignments insolvable\nby previous coarser ones.

Our technique approximates the $\\textit{kinematics}$ by\napproximating the deformation map using an implicit neural representation that\nrestricts deformation trajectories to reside on a low-dimensional manifold. By\nexplicitly approximating the deformation map, its spatiotemporal gradients --\nin particular the deformation gradient and the velocity -- can be computed via\nanalytical differentiation. In contrast to typical model-reduction techniques\nthat construct a linear or nonlinear manifold to approximate the (finite number\nof) degrees of freedom characterizing a given spatial discretization, the use\nof an implicit neural representation enables the proposed method to approximate\nthe $\\textit{continuous}$ deformation map. This allows the kinematic\napproximation to remain agnostic to the discretization. Consequently, the\ntechnique supports dynamic discretizations -- including resolution changes --\nduring the course of the online reduced-order-model simulation.\n  To generate $\\textit{dynamics}$ for the generalized coordinates, we propose a\nfamily of projection techniques.

Such simulation based methodologies have\nproven to be particularly powerful for systems with control loops and complex\ninteractions between its elements, be they hardware, software, or human, as\nthey provide a natural probabilistic environment to include physical models of\nsystem behavior (e.g., coupled neutronics and thermal hydraulic codes for\nnuclear power plants), mechanistic models of materials or hardware systems to\npredict failure, and those of natural hazards. Despite the advancements in\nsimulation based methodologies, the fundamental challenge still persists as the\nspace of possible probabilistic system trajectories is nearly infinite in size\nin simulating even systems of relatively low complexity. In this paper, a\nframework is developed to identify rare and extreme events and enabling the use\nof reverse trajectories to trace failures (or other system states) to causes\nfor potential mitigation actions. This framework consists of an Intelligent\nGuidance module, Trajectory Generation module and Physical Simulation module.\nThe Intelligent Guidance module provides planning information to the Trajectory\nGeneration module that creates scenarios by interacting with the Physical\nSimulation in its environment. In turn, system trajectories or scenarios are\ncreated and post processed to provide updating information to the Intelligent\nGuidance module or aggregate the results when stopping criteria are met. The\nobjective of guided simulation is to control the growth of the scenario tree\nand to efficiently identify important scenarios that meet single or multiple\ncriteria. We present several solution strategies, both qualitative and data\ndriven for each module.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 16:27:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

Classical cryptographic\nprotocols mainly depend on the mathematical complicacy of encoding functions\nand the shared key, like RSA protocol in which security depends upon the fact\nthat factoring a big number is a hard problem to the current computers. This\nmeans that high computing power can help you crack traditional encryption\nmethods. Quantum machines claim to have this kind of power in many instances.\nFactorization of big numbers may be possible with Shor's algorithm with quantum\nmachines in considerable time. Apart from this, the main problem is key sharing\ni.e., how to securely share the key the first time to validate the encryption.\nHere comes quantum key distribution. Two parties who are interested in\ncommunication with each other, create a process, which claims considerable\nsecurity against an eavesdropper, by encoding and decoding information in\nquantum states to construct and share a secret key.

As most harmful memes are highly satirical and\nabstruse without appropriate contexts, off-the-shelf multimodal models may not\nbe adequate to understand their underlying semantics.

Humans encounter uncertainty in different kinds of activity, from\nsensory-motor control to dynamics in financial markets, what has been subject\nof extensive studies. Representation of uncertainty with normal or lognormal\ndistribution is a common feature of many of those studies. For example,\nproposed Bayessian integration of Gaussian multisensory input in the brain or\nlog-normal distribution of future asset price in renowned Black-Scholes-Merton\n(BSM) model for pricing contingent claims.\n  Standard deviation of log(future asset price) scaled by square root of time\nin the BSM model is called implied volatility. Actually, log(future asset\nprice) is not normally distributed and traders account for that to avoid\nlosses. Nevertheless the BSM formula derived under the assumption of constant\nvolatility remains a major uniform framework for pricing options in financial\nmarkets. I propose that one of the reasons for such a high popularity of the\nBSM formula could be its ability to translate uncertainty measured with implied\nvolatility into price in a way that is compatible with human intuition for\nmeasuring uncertainty.\n  The present study deals with mathematical relationship between uncertainty\nand the BSM implied volatility. Examples for a number of common probability\ndistributions are presented. Overall, this work proposes that representation of\nvarious probability distributions in terms of the BSM implied volatility\nprofile may be meaningful in both biological and financial worlds.
