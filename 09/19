Few\neffective multi-scale techniques are applied in transformer and there are two\nmain limitations in the current methods. On one hand, self-attention module in\nvanilla transformer fails to sufficiently exploit the diversity of semantic\ninformation because of its rigid mechanism. On the other hand, it is hard to\nbuild attention and interaction among different levels due to the heavy\ncomputational burden. To alleviate this problem, we first revisit multi-scale\nproblem in dense prediction, verifying the significance of diverse semantic\nrepresentation and multi-scale interaction, and exploring the adaptation of\ntransformer to pyramidal structure. Inspired by these findings, we propose a\nnovel Semantic-aware Decoupled Transformer Pyramid (SDTP) for dense image\nprediction, consisting of Intra-level Semantic Promotion (ISP), Cross-level\nDecoupled Interaction (CDI) and Attention Refinement Function (ARF). ISP\nexplores the semantic diversity in different receptive space. CDI builds the\nglobal attention and interaction among different levels in decoupled space\nwhich also solves the problem of heavy computation. Besides, ARF is further\nadded to refine the attention in transformer. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe validity and generality of the proposed method, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art by a significant margin in dense image prediction tasks.\nFurthermore, the proposed components are all plug-and-play, which can be\nembedded in other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 16:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

To\ndetermine appropriate regularization parameters for given discretization\nchoices in MIRS, we conducted dynamically similar macroscopic experiments and\nfit the simulations to the data.

Most existing\nsolutions to this preference-aware path planning problem use semantic\nsegmentation to classify terrain types from camera images, and then ascribe\ncosts to each type. Unfortunately, there are three key limitations of such\napproaches -- they 1) require pre-enumeration of the discrete terrain types, 2)\nare unable to handle hybrid terrain types (e.g., grassy dirt), and 3) require\nexpensive labelled data to train visual semantic segmentation. We introduce\nVisual Representation Learning for Preference-Aware Path Planning (VRL-PAP), an\nalternative approach that overcomes all three limitations: VRL-PAP leverages\nunlabeled human demonstrations of navigation to autonomously generate triplets\nfor learning visual representations of terrain that are viewpoint invariant and\nencode terrain types in a continuous representation space.

In massive data settings, however, DA algorithms are\nprohibitively slow because they pass through the full data in any iteration,\nimposing serious restrictions on their usage despite the advantages. Addressing\nthis problem, we develop a framework for extending any DA that exploits\nasynchronous and distributed computing. The extended DA algorithm is indexed by\na parameter $r \\in (0, 1)$ and is called Asynchronous and Distributed (AD) DA\nwith the original DA as its parent. Any ADDA starts by dividing the full data\ninto $k$ smaller disjoint subsets and storing them on $k$ processes, which\ncould be machines or processors. Every iteration of ADDA augments only an\n$r$-fraction of the $k$ data subsets with some positive probability and leaves\nthe remaining $(1-r)$-fraction of the augmented data unchanged. The parameter\ndraws are obtained using the $r$-fraction of new and $(1-r)$-fraction of old\naugmented data. For many choices of $k$ and $r$, the fractional updates of ADDA\nlead to a significant speed-up over the parent DA in massive data settings, and\nit reduces to the distributed version of its parent DA when $r=1$. We show that\nthe ADDA Markov chain is Harris ergodic with the desired stationary\ndistribution under mild conditions on the parent DA algorithm.

SC codes are constructed by partitioning\nan underlying block code, followed by rearranging and concatenating the\npartitioned components in a convolutional manner. The number of partitioned\ncomponents determines the memory of SC codes. In this paper, we investigate the\nrelation between the performance of SC codes and the density distribution of\npartitioning matrices. While adopting higher memories results in improved SC\ncode performance, obtaining finite-length, high-performance SC codes with high\nmemory is known to be computationally challenging. We break this computational\nbottleneck by developing a novel probabilistic framework that obtains (locally)\noptimal density distributions via gradient descent.

In this work, we\npropose a hierarchical and compositional planning framework that learns a\nGeometric Task Network (GTN) from exhaustive planners, without any manual\ninputs. A GTN is a goal-dependent task graph that encapsulates both the\ntransition relations among skill representations and the geometric constraints\nunderlying these transitions. This framework has shown to improve dramatically\nthe offline learning efficiency, the online performance and the transparency of\ndecision process, by leveraging the task-parameterized models.

In recent\nyears there has been growing interest in a natural generalization of\n$\\mathrm{Hilb}^n(S)$, the nested Hilbert scheme $\\mathrm{Hilb}^{(n_1,n_2)}(S)$,\nwhich parametrizes nested pairs of zero-dimensional subschemes $Z_1 \\supseteq\nZ_2$ of $S$ with $\\mathrm{deg} (Z_i)=n_i$.

In this paper we aim to advance the knowledge of\nthe geometry of these nested Hilbert schemes.

We present a new association method,\nthe Gaussian Mixture Model Association (GaMMA), that combines the Gaussian\nmixture model for phase measurements (both time and amplitude), with earthquake\nlocation, origin time, and magnitude estimation. We treat earthquake phase\nassociation as an unsupervised clustering problem in a probabilistic framework,\nwhere each earthquake corresponds to a cluster of P and S phases with\nhyperbolic moveout of arrival times and a decay of amplitude with distance.

We carry out the pick assignment for each\nearthquake and determine earthquake parameters (i.e., earthquake location,\norigin time, and magnitude) under the maximum likelihood criterion using the\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The GaMMA method does not require the\ntypical association steps of other algorithms, such as grid-search or\nsupervised training.

For example, lexicon-based\nmodels allow researchers to readily determine which words and phrases\ncontribute most to a change in measured sentiment. A challenge for any\nlexicon-based approach is that the lexicon needs to be routinely expanded with\nnew words and expressions. Here, we propose two models for automatic lexicon\nexpansion. Our first model establishes a baseline employing a simple and\nshallow neural network initialized with pre-trained word embeddings using a\nnon-contextual approach. Our second model improves upon our baseline, featuring\na deep Transformer-based network that brings to bear word definitions to\nestimate their lexical polarity. Our evaluation shows that both models are able\nto score new words with a similar accuracy to reviewers from Amazon Mechanical\nTurk, but at a fraction of the cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 20:59:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 04:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-10"}

The production of hydraulic power plants based on water\nreservoirs varies based on different parameters. For this reason, the\nestimation of hydraulic production gains importance in terms of the planning of\nelectricity generation. In this article, the estimation of Turkey's monthly\nhydroelectricity production has been made with the long-short-term memory\n(LSTM) network-based deep learning model. The designed deep learning model is\nbased on hydraulic production time series and future production planning for\nmany years. By using real production data and different LSTM deep learning\nmodels, their performance on the monthly forecast of hydraulic electricity\ngeneration of the next year has been examined. The obtained results showed that\nthe use of time series based on real production data for many years and deep\nlearning model together is successful in long-term prediction. In the study, it\nis seen that the 100-layer LSTM model, in which 120 months (10 years)\nhydroelectric generation time data are used according to the RMSE and MAPE\nvalues, are the highest model in terms of estimation accuracy, with a MAPE\nvalue of 0.1311 (13.1%) in the annual total and 1.09% as the monthly average\ndistribution. In this model, the best results were obtained for the 100-layer\nLSTM model, in which the time data of 144 months (12 years) hydroelectric\ngeneration data are used, with a RMSE value of 29,689 annually and 2474.08 in\nmonthly distribution. According to the results of the study, time data covering\nat least 120 months of production is recommended to create an acceptable\nhydropower forecasting model with LSTM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 21:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

Forward-swept wings generate wakes\nthat are significantly different from those of backward-swept wings.

Prior works quantified this intrinsic\nrobustness for vanilla DNNs trained on unperturbed inputs.

The main goal is to make models robust so\nthat similar inputs derive in semantically similar outcomes, which is not a\ntrivial problem since there is no objective measure of semantic similarity in\nlanguage. Previous works use an external pre-trained NLP model to tackle this\nchallenge, introducing an extra training stage with huge memory consumption\nduring training. However, the recent popular approach of contrastive learning\nin language processing hints a convenient way of obtaining such similarity\nrestrictions. The main advantage of the contrastive learning approach is that\nit aims for similar data points to be mapped close to each other and further\nfrom different ones in the representation space. In this work, we propose\nadversarial training with contrastive learning (ATCL) to adversarially train a\nlanguage processing task using the benefits of contrastive learning. The core\nidea is to make linear perturbations in the embedding space of the input via\nfast gradient methods (FGM) and train the model to keep the original and\nperturbed representations close via contrastive learning. In NLP experiments,\nwe applied ATCL to language modeling and neural machine translation tasks.

For atmospheric dynamics, a critical part of the\nclimate system, no well established metric exists and visual inspection is\ncurrently still often used in practice.

Our approach, called AtmoDist, trains a neural network on\na simple, auxiliary task: predicting the temporal distance between elements of\na randomly shuffled sequence of atmospheric fields (e.g. the components of the\nwind field from reanalysis or simulation). The task forces the network to learn\nimportant intrinsic aspects of the data as activations in its layers and from\nthese hence a discriminative metric can be obtained.

We designed 8 different\nocclusion masks which were applied to the input images. This caused a\nsignificant drop in the classifier performance: its error rate for each mask\nbecame at least two times worse than before. In order to increase robustness\nunder occlusions, we followed two approaches. The first is image inpainting\nusing the pre-trained pluralistic image completion network. The second is\nCutmix, a regularization strategy consisting of mixing training images and\ntheir labels using rectangular patches, making the classifier more robust\nagainst input corruptions. Both strategies revealed effective and interesting\nresults were observed. In particular, the Cutmix approach makes the network\nmore robust without requiring additional steps at the application time, though\nits training time is considerably longer.

These equations\ninvolve the pair radial distribution function (similar to the two-point\ncorrelation function), similarly to the interaction energy and equation of\nstate in liquids. Small-scale correlations lead to a non-ideal amplification of\nthe gravitational interaction energy, whose omission leads to a missing mass\nproblem, e.g., in galaxies and galaxy clusters. We also propose an extension of\nthe Friedmann equations in the non-ideal regime. We estimate the non-ideal\namplification factor of the gravitational interaction energy of the baryons to\nlie between 5 and 20, potentially explaining the observed value of the Hubble\nparameter. Within this framework, the acceleration of the expansion emerges\nnaturally because of the increasing number of sub-structures induced by\ngravitational collapse, which increases their contribution to the total\ngravitational energy. A simple estimate predicts a non-ideal deceleration\nparameter qni~-1;this is potentially the first determination of the observed\nvalue based on an intuitively physical argument.

However, symmetry selection\nrules for the energy transfer between nonlinear vibrational modes of different\nsymmetry, which lead to the possibility of excitation of some bushes of such\nmodes, were not revealed. Each bush determines an exact solution of nonlinear\ndynamical equations of the considered system. The collection of modes of a\ngiven bush does not change in time, while there is a continuous energy exchange\nbetween these modes. Bushes of nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) are constructed\nwith the aid of group-theoretical methods and therefore they can exist for the\ncase of large amplitude atomic vibrations and for any type of interatomic\ninteractions. In most publications, bushes of NNMs or similar dynamical objects\nin one-dimensional systems are investigated under periodic boundary conditions.\nIn this paper, we present a detailed study of the bushes of NNMs in monoatomic\nchains for the case of fixed boundary conditions, which sheds light on a series\nof new properties of the intermode interactions in such systems. We prove some\ntheorems that justify a method for constructing bushes of NNMs by continuation\nof conventional normal modes to the case of large atomic oscillations. Our\nstudy was carried out for FPU chains, for the chains with the Lennard-Jones\ninteratomic potential, as well as for the carbon chains (carbynes) in the\nframework of the density functional theory. For one-dimensional bushes\n(Rosenberg nonlinear normal modes), the amplitude-frequency diagrams are\npresented and the possibility of their modulational instability is briefly\ndiscussed. We also argue in favor of the fact that our methods and main results\nare valid for any monoatomic chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2021 10:50:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

No existing machine learning algorithms have been developed to create\ncomic illustrations based on descriptions of illustrations, or the dialogue in\ncomics. Moreover, it is not known if a generative adversarial network (GAN) can\ngenerate original comics that correspond to the dialogue and/or descriptions.\nGANs are successful in producing photo-realistic images, but this technology\ndoes not necessarily translate to generation of flawless comics. What is more,\ncomic evaluation is a prominent challenge as common metrics such as Inception\nScore will not perform comparably, as they are designed to work on photos. In\nthis paper: 1. We implement ComicGAN, a novel text-to-comic pipeline based on a\ntext-to-image GAN that synthesizes comics according to text descriptions. 2. We\ndescribe an in-depth empirical study of the technical difficulties of comic\ngeneration using GAN's. ComicGAN has two novel features: (i) text description\ncreation from labels via permutation and augmentation, and (ii) custom image\nencoding with Convolutional Neural Networks. We extensively evaluate the\nproposed ComicGAN in two scenarios, namely image generation from descriptions,\nand image generation from dialogue. Our results on 1000 Dilbert comic panels\nand 6000 descriptions show synthetic comic panels from text inputs resemble\noriginal Dilbert panels. Novel methods for text description creation and custom\nimage encoding brought improvements to Frechet Inception Distance, detail, and\noverall image quality over baseline algorithms. Generating illustrations from\ndescriptions provided clear comics including characters and colours that were\nspecified in the descriptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2021 13:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

Then we present optimization techniques on loss\nconstruction, data sampling, and task scheduling to properly train a multi-task\nmodel. After presenting applications of MTL in a variety of NLP tasks, we\nintroduce some benchmark datasets. Finally, we make a conclusion and discuss\nseveral possible research directions in this field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2021 14:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

A huge literature exists on this topic. A\ncommon approach is to model KBs as graphs decorated with labels and reduce the\nproblem of KB matching to that of matching these two elements, \\textit{viz.},\nlabels and structure of the graph. However, labels of etypes are often\nmisplaced, e.g., they are more general or specific than the correct etype, as\ndefined by its properties. Structure-based matching may also lead to wrong\nconclusions as the properties assigned to an etype in an inheritance hierarchy\ndo not depend on the order by which they are assigned and, therefore, on the\nspecific structure of the graph. In this paper, we propose a novel etype graph\nmatching approach, dealing with the two problems highlighted above, based on\ntwo key ideas. The first is to implement matching as a classification task\nwhere etypes are characterized by the associated properties. The second is we\npropose two \\textit{property-based} etype similarity metrics, which model the\nroles that properties have in the definition of an etype.

However, few clinical\nalgorithms used to non-invasively analyze lung physiology have undergone\nrigorous validation in a clinical setting, and are often validated either using\nmechanical devices, or with small clinical validation datasets using 2-8\npatients. This work aims to improve this situation by first, establishing an\nopen, and clinically validated dataset comprising data from both mechanical\nlungs and nearly 40,000 breaths from 18 intubated patients. Next, we use this\ndata to evaluate 15 different algorithms that use the \"single chamber\" model of\nestimating respiratory compliance. We evaluate these algorithms under varying\nclinical scenarios patients typically experience during hospitalization. In\nparticular, we explore algorithm performance under four different types of\npatient ventilator asynchrony. We also analyze algorithms under varying\nventilation modes to benchmark algorithm performance and to determine if\nventilation mode has any impact on the algorithm. Our approach yields several\nadvances by 1) showing which specific algorithms work best clinically under\nvarying mode and asynchrony scenarios, 2) developing a simple mathematical\nmethod to reduce variance in algorithmic results, and 3) presenting additional\ninsights about single-chamber model algorithms. We hope that our paper,\napproach, dataset, and software framework can thus be used by future\nresearchers to improve their work and allow future integration of \"single\nchamber\" algorithms into clinical practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2021 07:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

Our goal is to devise the\ncharacteristics of games to teach and exercise non-easily quantifiable tasks\ncrucial to the math-modeling process. A computerized game to exercise the\nmath-modeling process and optimization problem formulation is introduced. The\ngame is named The Formula 1 Championship, and models of the game were developed\nin the computerized simulation platform MoNet. It resembles some situations in\nwhich team managers must make crucial decisions to enhance their racing cars up\nto the feasible, most advantageous conditions. This paper describes the game's\nrules, limitations, and five Formula 1 circuit simulators used for the\nchampionship development. We present several formulations of this situation in\nthe form of optimization problems. Administering the budget to reach the best\ncar adjustment to a set of circuits to win the respective races can be an\napproach. Focusing on the best distribution of each Grand Prix's budget and\nthen deciding how to use the assigned money to improve the car is also the\nright approach. In general, there may be a degree of conflict among these\napproaches because they are different aspects of the same multi-scale\noptimization problem. Therefore, we evaluate the impact of assigning the\nhighest priority to an element, or another, when formulating the optimization\nproblem. Studying the effectiveness of solving such optimization problems turns\nout to be an exciting way of evaluating the advantages of focusing on one scale\nor another. Another thread of this research directs to the meaning of the game\nin the teaching-learning process.

Borne out by the spatio-temporal dynamics of visual sensitivity to\nprobe stimuli in primates, I build on top of this static account with the\nintroduction of a new computational field of research, retinotopic mechanics.\nAt its core, retinotopic mechanics assumes that during active sensing receptive\nfields are not static but can shift beyond their classical extent.\nSpecifically, the canonical computations and the neural architecture that\nsupports these computations are inherently mediated by a neurobiologically\ninspired force field (e.g.,$R_s\\propto \\sim 1 /\\Delta M$). For example, when\nthe retina is displaced because of a saccadic eye movement from one point in\nspace to another, cells across retinotopic brain areas are tasked with\ndiscounting the retinal disruptions such active surveillance inherently\nintroduces. This neural phenomenon is known as spatial constancy. Using\nretinotopic mechanics, I propose that to achieve spatial constancy or any\nactive visually mediated task, retinotopic cells, namely their receptive\nfields, are constrained by eccentricity dependent elastic fields. I propose\nthat elastic fields are self-generated by the visual system and allow receptive\nfields the ability to predictively shift beyond their classical extent to\nfuture post-saccadic location such that neural sensitivity which would\notherwise support intermediate eccentric locations likely to contain retinal\ndisruptions is transiently blunted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 19:03:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2022 12:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

The distribution was found\nto be slightly (be few percent) smoother, less clumpy than predicted by the\ngeneral relativity. This result was considered as a hint of some new physical\nlaws. In the present paper we offer a relatively simple model that could\nexplain the above result without resorting to any new physical laws. The model\ndeals with the dynamics of a system consisting of a large number of gravitating\nneutral particles, whose mass is equal to the mass of hydrogen atoms. The\ncentral point of the model is a partial inhibition of the gravitation for a\nrelatively small subsystem of the entire system. It would be sufficient for\nthis subsystem to constitute just about few percent of the total ensemble of\nthe particles for explaining the few percent more smooth distribution of dark\nmatter (observed by the DES team) compared to the prediction of the general\nrelativity. The most viable candidate for the dark matter particles in this\nmodel is the second flavor of hydrogen atoms (SFHA) that has only S-states and\ntherefore does not couple to the electric dipole radiation or even to higher\nmultipole radiation, so that the SFHA is practically dark. The SFHA has the\nexperimental confirmation from atomic experiments, it does not go beyond the\nStandard Model, it is based on the standard quantum mechanics, and it explains\nthe puzzling astrophysical observations of the redshifted line 21 cm from the\nearly Universe. Thus, our model explaining the DES result of a little too\nsmooth distribution of dark matter without resorting to any new physical laws\nseems to be self-consistent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 16:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

Due to the inherent complexity of this type of\ndata, caused by its dynamic (context evolves rapidly), nuanced (misinformation\ntypes are often ambiguous), and diverse (skewed, fine-grained, and overlapping\ncategories) nature, it is imperative for an effective model to capture both the\nlocal and global context of the target domain. By conducting a systematic\ninvestigation, we show that: (i) the deep Transformer-based pre-trained models,\nutilized via the mixed-domain transfer learning, are only good at capturing the\nlocal context, thus exhibits poor generalization, and (ii) a combination of\nshallow network-based domain-specific models and convolutional neural networks\ncan efficiently extract local as well as global context directly from the\ntarget data in a hierarchical fashion, enabling it to offer a more\ngeneralizable solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2021 15:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}
