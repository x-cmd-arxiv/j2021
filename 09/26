In this paper we tackle a component of this question by examining\nrobustness of models' ability to deploy relevant context information in the\nface of distracting content. We present models with cloze tasks requiring use\nof critical context information, and introduce distracting content to test how\nrobustly the models retain and use that critical information for prediction. We\nalso systematically manipulate the nature of these distractors, to shed light\non dynamics of models' use of contextual cues. We find that although models\nappear in simple contexts to make predictions based on understanding and\napplying relevant facts from prior context, the presence of distracting but\nirrelevant content has clear impact in confusing model predictions. In\nparticular, models appear particularly susceptible to factors of semantic\nsimilarity and word position. The findings are consistent with the conclusion\nthat LM predictions are driven in large part by superficial contextual cues,\nrather than by robust representations of context meaning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2021 16:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

For instance, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\n(UAVs) require the information of the position precisely for an adequate\ncontrol strategy. This problem is handled very efficiently with integrated GPS\nunits for outdoor applications. However, indoor applications require special\ntreatment due to the unavailability of GPS signals. Another aspect of mobile\nrobots such as UAVs is that there is constant wireless communication between\nthe mobile robot and a computational unit. This communication is mainly done\nfor obtaining telemetry information or computation of control actions directly.\nThe responsible integrated units for this transmission are commercial wireless\ncommunication chipsets. These units on the receiver side are responsible for\ngetting rid of the diverse effects of the communication channel with various\nmathematical techniques. These techniques mainly require the Channel State\nInformation (CSI) of the current channel to compensate the channel itself.\nAfter the compensation, the chipset has nothing to do with CSI. However, the\nlocations of both the transmitter and receiver have a direct impact on CSI.\nEven though CSI contains such rich information about the environment, the\naccessibility of these data is blocked by the commercial wireless chipsets\nsince they are manufactured to provide only the processed information data bits\nto the user. However, with the IEEE 802.11n standardization, certain chipsets\nprovide access to CSI. Therefore, CSI data became processible and integrable to\nlocalization schemes.

When the views are acquired and stored at different\ncomputing agents (e.g., organizations and edge devices) and data sharing is\nundesired due to privacy or communication cost considerations, federated\nlearning-based GCCA is well-motivated. In federated learning, the views are\nkept locally at the agents and only derived, limited information exchange with\na central server is allowed.

This work puts forth a communication-efficient federated learning\nframework for both linear and deep GCCA under the maximum variance (MAX-VAR)\nformulation.

The defacto allocation policies are max-min fairness (MMF) for single\nresources and dominant resource fairness (DRF) for multiple resources which\nguarantee properties like incentive compatibility, envy-freeness, and Pareto\nefficiency, assuming user demands are static (time-independent). However, in\nreal-world systems, user demands are dynamic, i.e. time-dependant. As a result,\nthere is now a fundamental mismatch between the goals of computer systems and\nthe properties enabled by classic resource allocation policies. We aim to\nbridge this mismatch. When demands are dynamic, instant-by-instant MMF can be\nextremely unfair over longer periods of time, i.e. lead to unbalanced user\nallocations as previous allocations have no effect in the present. We consider\na natural generalization of MMF and DRF for multiple resources and users with\ndynamic demands: this algorithm ensures that user allocations are as max-min\nfair as possible up to any time instant, given past allocations. This dynamic\nmechanism remains Pareto optimal and envy-free, but not incentive compatible.\nHowever, our results show that the possible increase in utility by misreporting\nis bounded and, since this can lead to significant decrease in overall useful\nallocation, this suggests that it is not a useful strategy. Our main result is\nto show that our dynamic DRF algorithm is $(1+\\rho)$-incentive compatible,\nwhere $\\rho$ quantifies the relative importance of a resource for different\nusers; we show that this factor is tight even with only two resources. We also\npresent a $3/2$ upper bound and a $\\sqrt 2$ lower bound for incentive\ncompatibility when there is only one resource. We also offer extensions for the\ncase when users are weighted to prioritize them differently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2021 16:57:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 04:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

Most thermal\nmanagement research takes place using simulations, given the challenges of\nmeasuring temperature in real processors. Since core and memory are fabricated\non separate packages in most existing processors, with the memory having lower\npower densities, thermal management research in processors has primarily\nfocused on the cores.\n  Memory bandwidth limitations associated with 2D processors lead to\nhigh-density 2.5D and 3D packaging technology. 2.5D packaging places cores and\nmemory on the same package. 3D packaging technology takes it further by\nstacking layers of memory on the top of cores themselves.

We first operationalize computational fairness by equality of\nopportunity, then differentiate between the bias inherent in data and the bias\nintroduced by modeling. We then demonstrate the prediction disparities in\ntravel behavior modeling using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS)\nand the 2018-2019 My Daily Travel Survey in Chicago. Empirically, deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) and discrete choice models (DCM) reveal consistent prediction\ndisparities across multiple social groups: both over-predict the false negative\nrate of frequent driving for the ethnic minorities, the low-income and the\ndisabled populations, and falsely predict a higher travel burden of the\nsocially disadvantaged groups and the rural populations than reality. Comparing\nDNN with DCM, we find that DNN can outperform DCM in prediction disparities\nbecause of DNN's smaller misspecification error. To mitigate prediction\ndisparities, this study introduces an absolute correlation regularization\nmethod, which is evaluated with synthetic and real-world data. The results\ndemonstrate the prevalence of prediction disparities in travel behavior\nmodeling, and the disparities still persist regarding a variety of model\nspecifics such as the number of DNN layers, batch size and weight\ninitialization. Since these prediction disparities can exacerbate social\ninequity if prediction results without fairness adjustment are used for\ntransportation policy making, we advocate for careful consideration of the\nfairness problem in travel behavior modeling, and the use of bias mitigation\nalgorithms for fair transport decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2021 19:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

Compared to standard RPA calculations, the staggered mesh method\nintroduces negligible additional computational cost. It avoids a significant\nportion of the finite-size error, and can be asymptotically advantageous for\nquasi-1D systems and certain quasi-2D and 3D systems with high symmetries. We\ndemonstrate the applicability of the method using two different formalisms: the\ndirect ring coupled cluster doubles (drCCD) theory, and the\nadiabatic-connection (AC) fluctuation-dissipation theory. In the drCCD\nformalism, the second order screened exchange (SOSEX) correction can also be\nreadily obtained using the staggered mesh method. In the AC formalism, the\nstaggered mesh method naturally avoids the need of performing \"head/wing\"\ncorrections to the dielectric operator. The effectiveness of the staggered mesh\nmethod for insulating systems is theoretically justified by investigating the\nfinite-size error of each individual perturbative term in the RPA correlation\nenergy, expanded as an infinite series of terms associated with ring diagrams.\nAs a side contribution, our analysis provides a proof that the finite-size\nerror of each perturbative term of standard RPA and SOSEX calculations scales\nas $\\mathcal{O}(N_{\\mathbf{k}}^{-1})$, where $N_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is the number of\ngrid points in a Monkhorst-Pack mesh.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2021 20:06:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 18:58:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 18:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

Contrastive\nUnpaired Translation is one of the existing methods for solving such problems.\nSignificant advantage of this method, compared to competitors, is the ability\nto train and perform well in cases where both input and output domains are only\na single image. Another key thing that differentiates this method from its\npredecessors is the usage of image patches rather than the whole images. It\nalso turns out that sampling negatives (patches required to calculate the loss)\nfrom the same image achieves better results than a scenario where the negatives\nare sampled from other images in the dataset. This type of approach encourages\nmapping of corresponding patches to the same location in relation to other\npatches (negatives) while at the same time improves the output image quality\nand significantly decreases memory usage as well as the time required to train\nthe model compared to CycleGAN method used as a baseline.

OWC systems are directional and\ncan naturally provide multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) configurations\nserving multiple users using a high number of transmitters in the indoor\nenvironment to ensure coverage.

Several aspects of this remarkable behavior have\nbeen studied in detail in many experimental studies. Here, we take a\ncomplementary in silico approach, using artificial agents trained with\nreinforcement learning to develop an integrated understanding of the behaviors\nand neural computations that support plume tracking. Specifically, we use deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) to train recurrent neural network (RNN) agents to\nlocate the source of simulated turbulent plumes. Interestingly, the agents'\nemergent behaviors resemble those of flying insects, and the RNNs learn to\nrepresent task-relevant variables, such as head direction and time since last\nodor encounter. Our analyses suggest an intriguing experimentally testable\nhypothesis for tracking plumes in changing wind direction -- that agents follow\nlocal plume shape rather than the current wind direction. While reflexive\nshort-memory behaviors are sufficient for tracking plumes in constant wind,\nlonger timescales of memory are essential for tracking plumes that switch\ndirection. At the level of neural dynamics, the RNNs' population activity is\nlow-dimensional and organized into distinct dynamical structures, with some\ncorrespondence to behavioral modules.

For this purpose, the\nsame $\\text{V}_{3}\\text{Si}$ crystal was sequentially irradiated by 2.5 MeV\nelectrons three times, repeating the measurement between the irradiation runs.\nA total dose of 10 C/cm$^{2}$ ($6.24\\times10^{19}$ electrons/$\\textrm{cm}^{2}$)\nwas accumulated, for which $T_{c}$ has changed from 16.4 K in a pristine state\nto 14.7 K (9.3 $\\%$). This substantial suppression is impossible for a single\nisotropic gap, but also it is not large enough for a sign-changing $s_{\\pm}$\npairing state. Our electronic band-structure calculations show how five bands\ncrossing the Fermi energy can be naturally grouped to support two effective\ngaps, not dissimilar from the iron pnictides physics. We analyze the results\nusing two-gap models for both, $\\lambda(T)$ and $T_{c}$, which describe the\ndata very well. Thus, the experimental results and theoretical analysis provide\nstrong support for an $s_{++}$ superconductivity with two unequal gaps,\n$\\Delta_{1}\\left(0\\right)\\approx2.53\\;\\textrm{meV}$ and\n$\\Delta_{2}\\left(0\\right)\\approx1.42\\;\\textrm{meV}$, and a very weak inter-band\ncoupling in $\\text{V}_{3}\\text{Si}$ superconductor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2021 22:03:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 13:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Due to\nthe resulting complexity of the underlying Markov chain, a traffic intensity\ncondition is difficult to obtain via conventional means. We thus employ a novel\ntechnique that utilizes a matrix-analytic drift approach to obtain a\nclosed-form drift condition for the stability of the process. Estimates of the\nsteady-state distribution of such models are then used to compute various\nsystem performance measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Sep 2021 00:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

Therefore, estimating velocity\nfrom potentially wrapped phase measurements is the task of solving a system of\nnoisy congruence equations. We propose Phase Recovery from Multiple Wrapped\nMeasurements (PRoM) as a fast, approximate maximum likelihood estimator of\nvelocity from multi-coil data with possible amplitude attenuation due to\ndephasing. The estimator can recover the fullest possible extent of unambiguous\nvelocities, which can greatly exceed twice the highest venc. The estimator uses\nall pairwise phase differences and the inherent correlations among them to\nminimize the estimation error. Correlations are directly estimated from\nmulti-coil data without requiring knowledge of coil sensitivity maps, dephasing\nfactors, or the actual per-voxel signal-to-noise ratio. Derivation of the\nestimator yields explicit probabilities of unwrapping errors and the\nprobability distribution for the velocity estimate; this, in turn, allows for\noptimized design of the phase-encoded acquisition. These probabilities are also\nincorporated into spatial post-processing to further mitigate wrapping errors.\nSimulation, phantom, and in vivo results for three-point PC-MRI acquisitions\nvalidate the benefits of reduced estimation error, increased recovered velocity\nrange, optimized acquisition, and fast computation. A phantom study at 1.5T\ndemonstrates 48.5% decrease in root mean squared error using PRoM with\npost-processing versus a conventional \"dual-venc\" technique.

To address this\nissue, this paper develops a physics-informed convolutional neural network\n(CNN) for the thermal simulation surrogate. The network can learn a mapping\nfrom heat source layout to the steady-state temperature field without labeled\ndata, which equals solving an entire family of partial difference equations\n(PDEs). To realize the physics-guided training without labeled data, we employ\nthe heat conduction equation and finite difference method to construct the loss\nfunction.

Despite the achieved inspiring results,\nthe optimization of these methods commonly relies on the fully-sampled\nreference data, which are time-consuming and difficult to collect. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method. Specifically,\nduring model optimization, two subsets are constructed by randomly selecting\npart of k-space data from the undersampled data and then fed into two parallel\nreconstruction networks to perform information recovery. Two reconstruction\nlosses are defined on all the scanned data points to enhance the network's\ncapability of recovering the frequency information. Meanwhile, to constrain the\nlearned unscanned data points of the network, a difference loss is designed to\nenforce consistency between the two parallel networks. In this way, the\nreconstruction model can be properly trained with only the undersampled data.\nDuring the model evaluation, the undersampled data are treated as the inputs\nand either of the two trained networks is expected to reconstruct the\nhigh-quality results. The proposed method is flexible and can be employed in\nany existing deep learning-based method. The effectiveness of the method is\nevaluated on an open brain MRI dataset.

Although this\nrepresentation has advanced our understanding of brain function, it represents\na simplified model of brain connectivity that has a complex dynamic\nspatio-temporal nature. Oversimplification of the data may hinder the merits of\napplying advanced non-linear feature extraction algorithms. To this end, we\npropose a dynamic adaptive spatio-temporal graph convolution (DAST-GCN) model\nto overcome the shortcomings of pre-defined static correlation-based graph\nstructures. The proposed approach allows end-to-end inference of dynamic\nconnections between brain regions via layer-wise graph structure learning\nmodule while mapping brain connectivity to a phenotype in a supervised learning\nframework. This leverages the computational power of the model, data and\ntargets to represent brain connectivity, and could enable the identification of\npotential biomarkers for the supervised target in question. We evaluate our\npipeline on the UKBiobank dataset for age and gender classification tasks from\nresting-state functional scans and show that it outperforms currently adapted\nlinear and non-linear methods in neuroimaging. Further, we assess the\ngeneralizability of the inferred graph structure by transferring the\npre-trained graph to an independent dataset for the same task. Our results\ndemonstrate the task-robustness of the graph against different scanning\nparameters and demographics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Sep 2021 07:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

In this task,\nthe sender Alice and the receiver Bob share an entangled state.

The decoder is\nlimited to a measurement to satisfy a certain locality condition on the\nbipartite system composed of the receiving system and the preshared\nentanglement half. Our contributions are summarized as follows: First, we\nderive an achievable transmission rate for this task dependently of conditions\nof encoder and decoder. Surprisingly, we show that the obtained rate cannot be\nimproved even when the decoder is relaxed to local measurements, two-way LOCCs,\nseparable measurements, or partial transpose positive (PPT) measurements for\nthe bipartite system. Moreover, depending on the class of allowed measurements\nwith a locality condition, we relax the class of encoding operations to\nsuper-quantum encoders in the framework of general probability theory (GPT).\nThat is, when our decoder is restricted to a separable measurement,\ntheoretically, a positive operation is allowed as an encoding operation.\nSurprisingly, even under this type of super-quantum relaxation, the\ntransmission rate cannot be improved.

Benefiting from\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs), recent studies have promoted the\ndevelopment of SISR by recovering photo-realistic images. However, there are\nstill undesired structural distortions in the recovered images. In this paper,\nwe propose a structure-preserving super-resolution (SPSR) method to alleviate\nthe above issue while maintaining the merits of GAN-based methods to generate\nperceptual-pleasant details. Firstly, we propose SPSR with gradient guidance\n(SPSR-G) by exploiting gradient maps of images to guide the recovery in two\naspects. On the one hand, we restore high-resolution gradient maps by a\ngradient branch to provide additional structure priors for the SR process. On\nthe other hand, we propose a gradient loss to impose a second-order restriction\non the super-resolved images, which helps generative networks concentrate more\non geometric structures. Secondly, since the gradient maps are handcrafted and\nmay only be able to capture limited aspects of structural information, we\nfurther extend SPSR-G by introducing a learnable neural structure extractor\n(NSE) to unearth richer local structures and provide stronger supervision for\nSR. We propose two self-supervised structure learning methods, contrastive\nprediction and solving jigsaw puzzles, to train the NSEs.

To overcome the curse of dimensionality, we\npropose a low-complexity suboptimal policy by using additive separable\nstructure of value function. Furthermore, the processing preemption mechanism\nis considered to handle the status updates more flexible, and the consistency\nproperty is proved. On this basis, a numerical example is provided. The\nsimulation results illustrate that the controller selection is related to the\ntimeliness of process and show the performance of the suboptimal policy. We\nalso find that the optimal policy will become a static policy in which the\ndestination of status update is fixed when the wireless channel is error free.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Sep 2021 09:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

Existing methods mainly extract\nuser interests from user historical behaviors. However, behavioral sequences\nonly contain users' directly interacted items, which are limited by the\nsystem's exposure, thus they are often not rich enough to reflect all the\npotential interests. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Dynamic\nSequential Graph Learning (DSGL), to enhance users or items' representations by\nutilizing collaborative information from the local sub-graphs associated with\nusers or items. Specifically, we design the Dynamic Sequential Graph (DSG),\ni.e., a lightweight ego subgraph with timestamps induced from historical\ninteractions. At every scoring moment, we construct DSGs for the target user\nand the candidate item respectively. Based on the DSGs, we perform graph\nconvolutional operations iteratively in a bottom-up manner to obtain the final\nrepresentations of the target user and the candidate item. As for the graph\nconvolution, we design a Time-aware Sequential Encoding Layer that leverages\nthe interaction time information as well as temporal dependencies to learn\nevolutionary user and item dynamics. Besides, we propose a Target-Preference\nDual Attention Layer, composed of a preference-aware attention module and a\ntarget-aware attention module, to automatically search for parts of behaviors\nthat are relevant to the target and alleviate the noise from unreliable\nneighbors.

Here, positive semidefiniteness is not inherent for\nsigned Laplacians, which renders the stability and consensus of this category\nof networks intricate. First, we examine the stability of signed networks by\nintroducing a novel graph-theoretic objective negative cut set, which implies\nthat manipulating negative edge weights cannot change a unstable network into a\nstable one. Then, inspired by the diagonal dominance and stability of matrices,\na local state damping mechanism is introduced using self-loop compensation. The\nself-loop compensation is only active for those agents who are incident to\nnegative edges and can stabilize signed networks in a fully distributed manner.\nQuantitative connections between self-loop compensation and the stability of\nthe compensated signed network are established for a tradeoff between\ncompensation efforts and network stability. Necessary and/or sufficient\nconditions for predictable cluster consensus of compensated signed networks are\nprovided. The optimality of self-loop compensation is discussed. Furthermore,\nwe extend our results to directed signed networks where the symmetry of signed\nLaplacian is not free. The correlation between the stability of the compensated\ndynamics obtained by self-loop compensation and eventually positivity is\nfurther discussed.

This field theory is strongly coupled in the UV and\ncould serve as a toy model to study nonperturbative features of theories with a\nperturbative Landau pole.\n  We begin with a Lagrangian and a pair of Hamiltonian formulations based on\ncompatible degenerate nilpotent and Euclidean Poisson brackets.

The model is compared and contrasted with those of Neumann and\nKirchhoff.\n  Common level sets of conserved quantities are generically 2-tori, though horn\ntori, circles and points also arise. On the latter, conserved quantities\ndevelop relations and solutions degenerate from elliptic to hyperbolic,\ncircular and constant functions.

The size of a galaxy, $D_{\\rm r,~25}$, is characterized by the\ndiameter at which the $r-$band surface brightness reaches $\\mu_{\\rm r}=25.0~\\rm\nmag~arcsec^{-2}$. We find that the positions of galaxies in the size ($D_{\\rm\nr,~25}$)$-$stellar mass ($M_{\\ast}$) plane strongly depend on their\nHI-to-stellar mass ratio ($M_{\\rm HI}/M_{\\ast}$). In the HI-rich regime,\ngalaxies that are more rich in HI tend to have larger sizes. Such a trend is\nnot seen in the HI-poor regime, suggesting that size growth is barely affected\nby the HI content when it has declined to a sufficiently low level. An\ninvestigation of the relations between size, $M_{\\rm HI}/M_{\\ast}$ and star\nformation rate (SFR) suggests that size is more intrinsically linked with\n$M_{\\rm HI}/M_{\\ast}$, rather than SFR.

However, as the\nsemantic textual similarity is commonly measured through the element-wise\ndistance metrics (e.g. cosine and L2 distance), such architecture yields a\nlarge gap between training and evaluating.

DialogueCSE first introduces a novel matching-guided embedding (MGE)\nmechanism, which generates a context-aware embedding for each candidate\nresponse embedding (i.e. the context-free embedding) according to the guidance\nof the multi-turn context-response matching matrices. Then it pairs each\ncontext-aware embedding with its corresponding context-free embedding and\nfinally minimizes the contrastive loss across all pairs.

An important notion in the quantum\nrandom walk is the transfer of a quantum state from one vertex to another. If\nthe fidelity of the transfer is unity, we call it a perfect state transfer.\nMany graph families have been shown to admit PST or periodicity, including\ncubelike graphs.

Despite the\ncomplexity of neurons and the synaptic interactions in between, the rate models\nare often adapted to describe neural encoding with modest success. However, it\nis not clear whether the firing rate, the reciprocal of the time interval\nbetween spikes, is sufficient to capture the essential feature for the neuronal\ndynamics. Going beyond the usual relaxation dynamics in Ginzburg-Landau theory\nfor statistical systems, we propose the neural activities can be captured by\nthe U(1) dynamics, integrating the action potential and the ``phase\" of the\nneuron together. The gain function of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron and the\ncorresponding dynamical phase transitions can be described within the U(1)\nneuron framework. In addition, the phase dependence of the synaptic\ninteractions is illustrated and the mapping to the Kinouchi-Copelli neuron is\nestablished. It suggests that the U(1) neuron is the minimal model for\nsingle-neuron activities and serves as the building block of the neuronal\nnetwork for information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Sep 2021 13:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

Compared with the 2D counterparts, 3D\nconvolutions can capture the spatial context in three dimensions. Nevertheless,\nmodels employing 3D convolutions introduce more trainable parameters and are\nmore computationally complex, which may lead easily to model overfitting\nespecially for medical applications with limited available training data. This\npaper aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of 3D convolutions by\nintroducing a novel Group Shift Pointwise Convolution (GSP-Conv). GSP-Conv\nsimplifies 3D convolutions into pointwise ones with 1x1x1 kernels, which\ndramatically reduces the number of model parameters and FLOPs (e.g. 27x fewer\nthan 3D convolutions with 3x3x3 kernels). Na\\\"ive pointwise convolutions with\nlimited receptive fields cannot make full use of the spatial image context. To\naddress this problem, we propose a parameter-free operation, Group Shift (GS),\nwhich shifts the feature maps along with different spatial directions in an\nelegant way. With GS, pointwise convolutions can access features from different\nspatial locations, and the limited receptive fields of pointwise convolutions\ncan be compensated. We evaluate the proposed methods on two datasets, PROMISE12\nand BraTS18. Results show that our method, with substantially decreased model\ncomplexity, achieves comparable or even better performance than models\nemploying 3D convolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Sep 2021 15:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

An essential step of RT planning is the accurate\nsegmentation of various organs-at-risks (OARs) in HaN CT images. Nevertheless,\nsegmenting OARs manually is time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone\nconsidering that typical HaN CT images contain tens to hundreds of slices.\nAutomated segmentation algorithms are urgently required. Recently,\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been extensively investigated on this\ntask. Particularly, 3D CNNs are frequently adopted to process 3D HaN CT images.\nThere are two issues with na\\\"ive 3D CNNs. First, the depth resolution of 3D CT\nimages is usually several times lower than the in-plane resolution. Direct\nemployment of 3D CNNs without distinguishing this difference can lead to the\nextraction of distorted image features and influence the final segmentation\nperformance. Second, a severe class imbalance problem exists, and large organs\ncan be orders of times larger than small organs. It is difficult to\nsimultaneously achieve accurate segmentation for all the organs. To address\nthese issues, we propose a novel hybrid CNN that fuses 2D and 3D convolutions\nto combat the different spatial resolutions and extract effective edge and\nsemantic features from 3D HaN CT images. To accommodate large and small organs,\nour final model, named OrganNet2.5D, consists of only two instead of the\nclassic four downsampling operations, and hybrid dilated convolutions are\nintroduced to maintain the respective field.

More critically, they can be vulnerable to adversarial\nexamples. Thus, we believe that developing ML systems that take into account\npredictive uncertainties and are robust against adversarial examples is a must\nfor critical, real-world tasks. We start with a case study in retailing. We\npropose a robust implementation of the Nerlove-Arrow model using a Bayesian\nstructural time series model. Its Bayesian nature facilitates incorporating\nprior information reflecting the manager's views, which can be updated with\nrelevant data. However, this case adopted classical Bayesian techniques, such\nas the Gibbs sampler. Nowadays, the ML landscape is pervaded with neural\nnetworks and this chapter also surveys current developments in this sub-field.\nThen, we tackle the problem of scaling Bayesian inference to complex models and\nlarge data regimes. In the first part, we propose a unifying view of two\ndifferent Bayesian inference algorithms, Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo (SG-MCMC) and Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD), leading to\nimproved and efficient novel sampling schemes. In the second part, we develop a\nframework to boost the efficiency of Bayesian inference in probabilistic models\nby embedding a Markov chain sampler within a variational posterior\napproximation. After that, we present an alternative perspective on adversarial\nclassification based on adversarial risk analysis, and leveraging the scalable\nBayesian approaches from chapter 2.

Many existing supervised learning methods for the\nKIE task need to feed a large number of labeled samples and learn separate\nmodels for different types of documents. However, collecting and labeling a\nlarge dataset is time-consuming and is not a user-friendly requirement for many\ncloud platforms. To overcome these challenges, we propose a deep end-to-end\ntrainable network for one-shot KIE using partial graph matching.

The commonly used asymmetric algorithms include public key\nencryption, key exchange and identity-based encryption(IBE). However, the\nnetwork security protocols based on classic identity-based encryption do not\nhave perfect forward security. To solve the problem, we construct the first\nquantum IBE (QIBE) scheme based on the learning with errors problem, and prove\nthat our scheme is fully secure under the random oracle. Moreover, we construct\nthe quantum circuit of our QIBE scheme and give an estimate of the quantum\nresource of our circuit including the numbers of Hadamard gate, phase gate, T\ngate, CNOT gate and the total qubits used in the circuit, and conclude that the\nquantum resources required by our scheme increase linearly with the number of\nbits of the encrypted quantum plaintext. Our scheme exhibits the following\nadvantages: (i) The classic key generation center (KGC) system still can be\nused for our QIBE scheme to generate and distribute the secret identity keys so\nthat the cost can be reduced when the scheme is implemented. The reason why the\nclassic KGC can be used is that the public and private keys are in the form of\nclassic bits. (ii) The network security protocols using a handshake with our\nQIBE scheme can provide perfect forward security. In our scheme, the ciphertext\nis transmitted in the form of a quantum state that is unknown to the adversary\nand therefore cannot be copied and stored. Thus, in the network security\nprotocols based on our QIBE construction, the adversary cannot decrypt the\nprevious quantum ciphertext to threat the previous session keys even if the\nidentity secret key is threatened.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Sep 2021 13:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}
