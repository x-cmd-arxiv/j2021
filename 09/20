Current works in the\nliterature formulate it as a Sense-And-Avoid (SAA) problem and address it by\neither developing new sensing capabilities or small form-factor processors.\nHowever, the SAA, with the high-speed operation, remains an open problem. The\nsignificant complexity arises due to the computational latency, which is\ncritical for fast-moving quadcopters. In this paper, a novel Fast Obstacle\nAvoidance Motion (FOAM) algorithm is proposed to perform SAA operations. FOAM\nis a low-latency perception-based algorithm that uses multi-sensor fusion of a\nmonocular camera and a 2-D LIDAR. A 2-D probabilistic occupancy map of the\nsensing region is generated to estimate a free space for avoiding obstacles.\nAlso, a local planner is used to navigate the high-speed quadcopter towards a\ngiven target location while avoiding obstacles. The performance evaluation of\nFOAM is evaluated in simulated environments in Gazebo and AIRSIM. Real-time\nimplementation of the same has been presented in outdoor environments using a\ncustom-designed quadcopter operating at a speed of $4.5$ m/s. The FOAM\nalgorithm is implemented on a low-cost computing device to demonstrate its\nefficacy.

Cosserat rods are a more detailed version of the classic wormlike-chain\n(WLC) model, which we show to be more appropriate in short-length scale, or\nstiff, regimes, where the contributions of extension and shear deformations are\nnot negligible and lead to noteworthy high values for the cyclization\nprobabilities (or J-factors).

Deep learning methods recently have gained\ngrowing interests and extensively applied in the data-driven bearing fault\ndiagnosis. However, current deep learning methods perform the bearing fault\ndiagnosis in the form of deterministic classification, which overlook the\nuncertainties that inevitably exist in actual practice. To tackle this issue,\nin this research we develop a probabilistic fault diagnosis framework that can\naccount for the uncertainty effect in prediction, which bears practical\nsignificance. This framework fully leverages the probabilistic feature of\nGaussian process classifier (GPC). To facilitate the establishment of\nhigh-fidelity GPC, the tailored feature extraction with dimensionality\nreduction method can be optimally determined through the cross validation-based\ngrid search upon a prespecified method pool consisting of various kernel\nprincipal component analysis (KPCA) methods and stacked autoencoder.

Furthermore, the sensor fusion concept\nis adopted to enhance the diagnosis performance. As compared with the\ntraditional deep learning methods, this proposed framework usually requires\nless labeled data and less effort for parameter tuning. Systematic case studies\nusing the publicly accessible experimental rolling bearing dataset are carried\nout to validate this new framework. Various influencing factors on fault\ndiagnosis performance also are thoroughly investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2021 18:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

However, we argue that\nricher information about personal social structure of individuals might lead to\nbetter predictions. In this paper, we propose to leverage well-established\nsocial cognitive theories to improve link prediction performance. According to\nthese theories, individuals arrange their social relationships along, on\naverage, five concentric circles of decreasing intimacy. We postulate that\nrelationships in different circles have different importance in predicting new\nlinks. In order to validate this claim, we focus on popular feature-extraction\nprediction algorithms (both unsupervised and supervised) and we extend them to\ninclude social-circles awareness.

In the existing routing procedures, capsules produce\npredictions (termed votes) for capsules of the next layer. In a nutshell, the\nnext-layer capsule's input is a weighted sum over all the votes it receives. In\nthis paper, we propose non-iterative cluster routing for capsule networks. In\nthe proposed cluster routing, capsules produce vote clusters instead of\nindividual votes for next-layer capsules, and each vote cluster sends its\ncentroid to a next-layer capsule. Generally speaking, the next-layer capsule's\ninput is a weighted sum over the centroid of each vote cluster it receives. The\ncentroid that comes from a cluster with a smaller variance is assigned a larger\nweight in the weighted sum process. Compared with the state-of-the-art capsule\nnetworks, the proposed capsule networks achieve the best accuracy on the\nFashion-MNIST and SVHN datasets with fewer parameters, and achieve the best\naccuracy on the smallNORB and CIFAR-10 datasets with a moderate number of\nparameters.

As analysis of\nelectroencephalogram allows us exploring properties and association among brain\nregions, we exploited it to address our query. We have recorded the frontal and\noccipital cortical EEG from surgically prepared chronic freely moving, normally\nbehaving rats and classified their vigilance states and vigilance\nstate-transitions. The complexity analysis carried out by computing\nmultifractal spectrum width categorized VST as highly non-linear and complex\nthan their participating vigilance states. The EEG signals were decomposed into\nfrequency ranges as that of classical human Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma\noscillations. The dynamic network attributes of these oscillations has shown\ncompelling topological correlation between the frontal and occipital regions of\nthe brain during conscious states. The topological trends of the underlying\nhierarchical network organization have been characterized by the percentage of\nthe hub and non-hub nodes, that further determines the global and local\nconnectivity trends. This has revealed interesting insights of functional\ndisconnection during NREMS due to decrease in their number of hub-nodes as\ncompared to waking state.

We use Raman thermometry\nmeasurements on suspended crystals, where we identify and eliminate crucial\nartefacts, and perform $ab$ $initio$ simulations with phonons at finite, rather\nthan zero, temperature. We find that phonon dispersions and lifetimes change\nstrongly with thickness, yet (sub)nanometer thin TMD films exhibit a similar\nin-plane thermal conductivity ($\\sim$20~Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$) as bulk crystals\n($\\sim$40~Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$). This is the result of compensating phonon\ncontributions, in particular low-frequency modes with a surprisingly long mean\nfree path of several micrometers that contribute significantly to thermal\ntransport for monolayers.

It is sometimes assumed that\nthe governing view requires a fundamental / intrinsic direction of time: to\ngovern, laws must be dynamical, producing later states of the world from\nearlier ones, in accord with the fundamental direction of time in the universe.\nIn this paper, we propose a minimal primitivism about laws of nature (MinP)\naccording to which there is no such requirement. On our view, laws govern by\nconstraining the physical possibilities. Our view captures the essence of the\ngoverning view without taking on extraneous commitments about the direction of\ntime or dynamic production.

Thus, they\nare widely applicable in various domains where data is sensitive, such as\nlarge-scale medical image classification, internet-of-medical-things, and\ncross-organization phishing email detection. SFL is developed on the confluence\npoint of FL and SL. It brings the best of FL and SL by providing parallel\nclient-side machine learning model updates from the FL paradigm and a higher\nlevel of model privacy (while training) by splitting the model between the\nclients and server coming from SL. However, SFL has communication and\ncomputation overhead at the client-side due to the requirement of client-side\nmodel synchronization. For the resource-constrained client-side, removal of\nsuch requirements is required to gain efficiency in the learning. In this\nregard, this paper studies SFL without client-side model synchronization. The\nresulting architecture is known as Multi-head Split Learning. Our empirical\nstudies considering the ResNet18 model on MNIST data under IID data\ndistribution among distributed clients find that Multi-head Split Learning is\nfeasible.

The\npaper constructs a Simple Closed Model, or an SCM, for short, for closed\neconomies, in which the consumption and the production parts are clearly\nseparated and yet coupled. The model is established as a specialization of the\nArrow-Debreu model and its equilibria correspond directly with those of the\ngeneral Arrow-Debreu model. The formulation allows us to identify the\ncombinatorial data which link parameters of the economic system with its\nequilibria, in particular, the impact of consumer preferences on wages. The SCM\nmodel also allows the formulation and explicit construction of the consumer\nchoice game, where expressed utilities of various labor classes serve as\nstrategies with total or relative wages as the pay-offs. We illustrate, through\nexamples, the mathematical details of the consumer choice game. We show that\nconsumer preferences, expressed through modified utility functions, do indeed\npercolate through the economy, and influence not only prices but also\nproduction and wages.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transients with millisecond\nduration.

In\nthis paper, we first apply the normalised cross-correlation algorithm to search\nand identify candidates of lensed FRBs in the latest public FRB observations,\ni.e. $593$ FRBs which mainly consist of the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity\nMapping Experiment FRB catalog, and then derive constraints on the abundance of\nPBHs from the null search result of lensing signature. For a monochromatic mass\ndistribution, the fraction of dark matter made up of PBHs could be constrained\nto $\\leq87\\%$ for $\\geq500~M_{\\odot}$ at 95\\% confidence level by assuming flux\nratio thresholds dependent signal-to-noise ratio for each FRB and that\napparently one-off events are intrinsic single bursts.

Moreover, we derive constraints on PBHs with a\nlog-normal mass function naturally predicted by some popular inflation models\nand often investigated with gravitational wave detections. We find that, in\nthis mass distribution scenario, the constraint from currently public FRB\nobservations is relatively weaker than the one from gravitational wave\ndetections. It is foreseen that upcoming complementary multi-messenger\nobservations will yield considerable constraints on the possibilities of PBHs\nin this intriguing mass window.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:04:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 12:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

Three types of tides are considered: equilibrium\ntide, inertial waves, and gravity waves. We combine the results of our\nsimulations with the observed distribution of stellar and planetary parameters\nto evaluate the infall rate of hot Jupiters in the Milky Way galaxy.

A clear ``hourglass'' magnetic field\nmorphology was inferred from the polarized dust emission which is also directly\nseen from the polarized CS emission across velocity, where the polarization\nappears to be parallel to the field. By considering previous findings, the\nfield retains a pinched shape which can be traced to clump length-scales from\nthe envelope scales traced by ALMA, suggesting that the field is dynamically\nimportant across multiple length-scales in this region.

The map is the core component to achieve this. Most map\nrepresentations rely on drift-free state estimation and provide a global metric\nmap to navigate. However, in large-scale real-world applications, it's hard to\nprohibit drifts and compose a globally consistent map quickly. In this paper, a\nnovel representation named, HiTMap, is proposed to enhance the existing map\nrepresentations. The central idea is to adopt a submap-based hierarchical\ntopology rather than a global metric map so that only a local metric map is\nmaintained for obstacle avoidance which ensures the lightweight of the\nrepresentation. To guide the robots navigate into unknown spaces, frontiers are\ndetected and attached to the map as an attribute. We also develop a path\nplanning module to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of our map\nrepresentation. The system is validated in a simulation environment and a\ndemonstration in the real world is conducted.

A key challenge lies\nin finding the exact correspondences between the dense keypoints in multiple\nviews since the inverse of keypoint mapping can be neither analytically derived\nnor differentiated. This limits applying existing multiview supervision\napproaches on sparse keypoint detection that rely on the exact correspondences.\nTo address this challenge, we derive a new probabilistic epipolar constraint\nthat encodes the two desired properties. (1) Soft correspondence: we define a\nmatchability, which measures a likelihood of a point matching to the other\nimage's corresponding point, thus relaxing the exact correspondences'\nrequirement. (2) Geometric consistency: every point in the continuous\ncorrespondence fields must satisfy the multiview consistency collectively. We\nformulate a probabilistic epipolar constraint using a weighted average of\nepipolar errors through the matchability thereby generalizing the\npoint-to-point geometric error to the field-to-field geometric error. This\ngeneralization facilitates learning a geometrically coherent dense keypoint\ndetection model by utilizing a large number of unlabeled multiview images.\nAdditionally, to prevent degenerative cases, we employ a distillation-based\nregularization by using a pretrained model. Finally, we design a new neural\nnetwork architecture, made of twin networks, that effectively minimizes the\nprobabilistic epipolar errors of all possible correspondences between two view\nimages by building affinity matrices. Our method shows superior performance\ncompared to existing methods, including non-differentiable bootstrapping in\nterms of keypoint accuracy, multiview consistency, and 3D reconstruction\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 04:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

However, it turns out to be difficult to train an\naccurate PINN model for many problems in practice. In this paper, we present a\nnovel perspective of the merits of learning in sinusoidal spaces with PINNs. By\nanalyzing behavior at model initialization, we first show that a PINN of\nincreasing expressiveness induces an initial bias around flat output functions.\nNotably, this initial solution can be very close to satisfying many physics\nPDEs, i.e., falling into a local minimum of the PINN loss that only minimizes\nPDE residuals, while still being far from the true solution that jointly\nminimizes PDE residuals and the initial and/or boundary conditions. It is\ndifficult for gradient descent optimization to escape from such a local minimum\ntrap, often causing the training to stall. We then prove that the sinusoidal\nmapping of inputs, in an architecture we label as sf-PINN, is effective to\nincrease input gradient variability, thus avoiding being trapped in such\ndeceptive local minimum. The level of variability can be effectively modulated\nto match high-frequency patterns in the problem at hand.

In this\npaper, we formulate a minimal model of the evolution of proto-chromosomes\nwithin protocells. We model a simple protocell composed of two types of genes:\na \"fast gene\" with an advantage for gene-level self-replication and a \"slow\ngene\" that replicates more slowly at the gene level, but which confers an\nadvantage for protocell-level reproduction. Protocell-level replication\ncapacity depends on cellular composition of fast and slow genes. We use a\npartial differential equation to describe how the composition of genes within\nprotocells evolves over time under within-cell and between-cell competition. We\nfind that the gene-level advantage of fast replicators casts a long shadow on\nthe multilevel dynamics of protocell evolution: no level of between-protocell\ncompetition can produce coexistence of the fast and slow replicators when the\ntwo genes are equally needed for protocell-level reproduction. By introducing a\n\"dimer replicator\" consisting of a linked pair of the slow and fast genes, we\nshow analytically that coexistence between the two genes can be promoted in\npairwise multilevel competition between fast and dimer replicators, and provide\nnumerical evidence for coexistence in trimorphic competition between fast,\nslow, and dimer replicators. Our results suggest that dimerization, or the\nformation of a simple chromosome-like dimer replicator, can help to overcome\nthe shadow of lower-level selection and work in concert with deterministic\nmultilevel selection to allow for the coexistence of two genes that are\ncomplementary at the protocell-level but compete at the level of individual\ngene-level replication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 08:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

Main novelty of our method, which can be classified as an early fusion\nmethod, i.e., a method in which additional information on vertices are fused to\nthe structure information before applying clustering, is the interpretation of\nattributes as new realizations of graph vertices, which can be dealt with as\ncoordinate vectors in a related Euclidean space.

Therefore, quantifying uncertainty is\nparticularly important in critical applications such as lesion detection and\nclinical diagnosis, where a realistic assessment of uncertainty is essential in\ndetermining surgical margins, disease status and appropriate treatment. In this\nwork, we propose a novel approach that uses quantile regression for quantifying\naleatoric uncertainty in both supervised and unsupervised lesion detection\nproblems. The resulting confidence intervals can be used for lesion detection\nand segmentation. In the unsupervised setting, we combine quantile regression\nwith the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). Here we address the problem of\nquantifying uncertainty in the images that are reconstructed by the VAE as the\nbasis for principled outlier or lesion detection. The VAE models the output as\na conditionally independent Gaussian characterized by its mean and variance.\nUnfortunately, joint optimization of both mean and variance in the VAE leads to\nthe well-known problem of shrinkage or underestimation of variance. Here we\ndescribe an alternative Quantile-Regression VAE (QR-VAE) that avoids this\nvariance shrinkage problem by directly estimating conditional quantiles for the\ninput image. Using the estimated quantiles, we compute the conditional mean and\nvariance for the input image from which we then detect outliers by thresholding\nat a false-discovery-rate corrected p-value. In the supervised setting, we\ndevelop binary quantile regression (BQR) for the supervised lesion segmentation\ntask.

While recent methods provide\nconsiderable semantic control over the (re-)generated images, they can only\ngenerate a limited set of viewpoints and cannot explicitly control the camera.\nSuch 3D camera control is required for 3D virtual and mixed reality\napplications. In our solution, we use a few images of a face to perform 3D\nreconstruction, and we introduce the notion of the GAN camera manifold, the key\nelement allowing us to precisely define the range of images that the GAN can\nreproduce in a stable manner. We train a small face-specific neural implicit\nrepresentation network to map a captured face to this manifold and complement\nit with a warping scheme to obtain free-viewpoint novel-view synthesis. We show\nhow our approach - due to its precise camera control - enables the integration\nof a pre-trained StyleGAN into standard 3D rendering pipelines, allowing e.g.,\nstereo rendering or consistent insertion of faces in synthetic 3D environments.\nOur solution proposes the first truly free-viewpoint rendering of realistic\nfaces at interactive rates, using only a small number of casual photos as\ninput, while simultaneously allowing semantic editing capabilities, such as\nfacial expression or lighting changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 08:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

We propose that multi-agent\nenvironments, where agents do not have access to the observations of others but\ncan communicate within a limited range, guarantees a common context that can be\nleveraged in individual representation learning. The reason is that subjective\nobservations necessarily refer to the same subset of the underlying\nenvironmental states and that communication about these states can freely offer\na supervised signal. To highlight the importance of communication, we refer to\nour setting as \\textit{socially supervised representation learning}.

The\nterminal soft gripper is effective for disposable swab pinch and replacement.\nThe OP sampling force is easy to be maintained in a safe and comfortable range\n(throat sampling comfortable region) under a hybrid motion and stiffness\nvirtual fixture-based controller. A dedicated 3 DOFs RCM platform is used for\nTSS hand global positioning. Design, modeling, and control of the TSS hand are\ndiscussed in detail with dedicated experimental validations.

Transfer learning (TL) approach is utilized in the\ntraining process by using the weights of the LSTM/BLSTM NN that are used to\npredict the POD time coefficients of the planes at lower elevations to\ninitialize the weights of the networks at higher elevations along the height of\nthe obstacle. The use of TL results in a remarkable improvement in the\ncapability of the LSTM/BLSTM NN prediction compared with the one when the\nnetwork is initialized with random weights. BLSTM NN shows better results\ncompared with LSTM NN in terms of training and prediction error, indicating\nthat the BLSTM-POD model is more suitable to be used as a ROM for predicting\nthe turbulent wake. Furthermore, the temporal behavior of the time coefficients\nis carefully examined using the phase space plots and Poincar$\\acute{e}$\nsections. The results of using different lengths of the prediction time window\nshowed that the prediction error of the POD time coefficients increases as the\nprediction time window increases and the error increasing rate decreases with\nthe ranking of the POD time coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 10:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

The recent state-of-the-art face\nrecognition solutions proposed to incorporate a fixed penalty margin on\ncommonly used classification loss function, softmax loss, in the normalized\nhypersphere to increase the discriminative power of face recognition models, by\nminimizing the intra-class variation and maximizing the inter-class variation.\nMarginal penalty softmax losses, such as ArcFace and CosFace, assume that the\ngeodesic distance between and within the different identities can be equally\nlearned using a fixed penalty margin. However, such a learning objective is not\nrealistic for real data with inconsistent inter-and intra-class variation,\nwhich might limit the discriminative and generalizability of the face\nrecognition model. In this paper, we relax the fixed penalty margin constrain\nby proposing elastic penalty margin loss (ElasticFace) that allows flexibility\nin the push for class separability.

In this study, we take an initial step towards understanding how\nand when XPINNs outperform PINNs.

Moreover,\nbased on our bounds, we analyze the conditions under which XPINNs improve\ngeneralization. Concretely, our theory shows that the key building block of\nXPINN, namely the domain decomposition, introduces a tradeoff for\ngeneralization. On the one hand, XPINNs decompose the complex PDE solution into\nseveral simple parts, which decreases the complexity needed to learn each part\nand boosts generalization. On the other hand, decomposition leads to less\ntraining data being available in each subdomain, and hence such model is\ntypically prone to overfitting and may become less generalizable.

Due to these properties, normally incident and\nlinear-polarized waves can be transformed in the transmitted and reflected\nwaves with changed polarizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 12:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Compared\nto WSSS, WSIS requires instance-wise localization, which is difficult to\nextract from image-level labels. To tackle the problem, most WSIS approaches\nuse off-the-shelf proposal techniques that require pre-training with instance\nor object level labels, deviating the fundamental definition of the\nfully-image-level supervised setting. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach including two innovative components. First, we propose a semantic\nknowledge transfer to obtain pseudo instance labels by transferring the\nknowledge of WSSS to WSIS while eliminating the need for the off-the-shelf\nproposals. Second, we propose a self-refinement method to refine the pseudo\ninstance labels in a self-supervised scheme and to use the refined labels for\ntraining in an online manner. Here, we discover an erroneous phenomenon,\nsemantic drift, that occurred by the missing instances in pseudo instance\nlabels categorized as background class. This semantic drift occurs confusion\nbetween background and instance in training and consequently degrades the\nsegmentation performance. We term this problem as semantic drift problem and\nshow that our proposed self-refinement method eliminates the semantic drift\nproblem.

The use of evolutionary clustering\nalgorithms may help to effectively cluster these diseases. On this presumption,\nwe improved the current evolutionary clustering algorithm star (ECA*), called\niECA*, in three manners: (i) utilising the elbow method to find the correct\nnumber of clusters; (ii) cleaning and processing data as part of iECA* to apply\nit to multivariate and domain-theory datasets; (iii) using iECA* for real-world\napplications in clustering COVID-19 and medical disease datasets. Experiments\nwere conducted to examine the performance of iECA* against state-of-the-art\nalgorithms using performance and validation measures (validation measures,\nstatistical benchmarking, and performance ranking framework). The results\ndemonstrate three primary findings. First, iECA* was more effective than other\nalgorithms in grouping the chosen medical disease datasets according to the\ncluster validation criteria. Second, iECA* exhibited the lower execution time\nand memory consumption for clustering all the datasets, compared to the current\nclustering methods analysed. Third, an operational framework was proposed to\nrate the effectiveness of iECA* against other algorithms in the datasets\nanalysed, and the results indicated that iECA* exhibited the best performance\nin clustering all medical datasets. Further research is required on real-world\nmulti-dimensional data containing complex knowledge fields for experimental\nverification of iECA* compared to evolutionary algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 12:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

Since the decay of $\\Lambda_b \\to\n\\Lambda \\phi$ in the standard model~(SM) is dictated by the single weak phase\nfrom the product of CKM elements, $V_{tb}V_{ts}^*$, the true T and CP\nasymmetries are suppressed, providing a clean background to test the SM and\nsearch for new physics. In the factorization approach, as the helicity\namplitudes in the SM share the same complex phase, T-violating effects are\nabsent. Nonetheless, the experimental branching ratio of $Br(\\Lambda_b \\to\n\\Lambda \\phi) = (5.18\\pm 1.29 )\\times 10^{-6}$ suggests that the\nnonfactorizable effects or some new physics play an important role. By\nparametrizing the nonfactorizable contributions with the effective color\nnumber, we calculate the branching ratios and direct CP asymmetries. We also\nexplore the possible T-violating effects from new physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 13:13:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 05:26:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

Automating this process could\nincrease the use of static architecture conformance checking methods, such as\nreflexion modeling, in industry. Current techniques rely on user\nparameterization and a highly cohesive design. A machine learning approach\nwould potentially require fewer parameters and better use of the available\ninformation to aid in automatic mapping. Aim: We investigate how a classifier\ncan be trained to map from source code to architecture modules automatically.\nThis classifier is trained with semantic and syntactic dependency information\nextracted from the source code and from architecture descriptions. The\nclassifier is implemented using multinomial naive Bayes and evaluated. Method:\nWe perform experiments and compare the classifier with three state-of-the-art\nmapping functions in eight open-source Java systems with known\nground-truth-mappings.

Adopting\nthe Bayesian viewpoint, the impulse response is modeled as a zero mean Gaussian\nprocess whose covariance function (kernel) is estimated from the data. The most\npopular kernels used in system identification are the tuned-correlated (TC),\nthe diagonal-correlated (DC) and the stable spline (SS) kernel. TC and DC\nkernels admit a closed form factorization of the inverse. The SS kernel induces\nmore smoothness than TC and DC on the estimated impulse response, however, the\naforementioned property does not hold in this case. In this paper we propose a\nsecond-order extension of the TC and DC kernel which induces more smoothness\nthan TC and DC, respectively, on the impulse response and a\ngeneralized-correlated kernel which incorporates the TC and DC kernels and\ntheir second order extensions. Moreover, these generalizations admit a closed\nform factorization of the inverse and thus they allow to design efficient\nalgorithms for the search of the optimal kernel hyperparameters.

Until now, CH$_2$CN had only been observed at earlier\nevolutionary stages, in the giant molecular clouds TMC-1 and Sgr 2, and the\nprestellar core L1544. We detect six transitions of ortho-CH$_2$CN towards the\ndisk around nearby T Tauri star TW Hya. An excitation analysis reveals that the\ndisk-averaged column density, $N$, for ortho-CH$_2$CN is $(6.3\\pm\n0.5)\\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is rescaled to reflect a 3:1 ortho-para\nratio, resulting in a total column density, $N_{\\rm tot}$, of $(8.4\\pm\n0.7)\\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. We calculate a disk-average rotational\ntemperature, $T_{\\rm{rot}}$ = $40 \\pm 5$ K, while a radially resolved analysis\nshows that $T_{\\rm{rot}}$ remains relatively constant across the radius of the\ndisk. This high rotation temperature suggests that in a static disk and if\nvertical mixing can be neglected,CH$_2$CN is largely formed through gas-phase\nreactions in the upper layers of the disk, rather than solid-state reactions on\nthe surface of grains in the disk midplane. The integrated intensity radial\nprofiles show a ring structure consistent with molecules such as CN and DCN. We\nnote that this is also consistent with previous lower-resolution observations\nof centrally peaked CH$_3$CN emission towards the TW Hya disks, since the\nobserved emission gap disappears when convolving our observations with a larger\nbeam size. We obtain a CH$_2$CN/CH$_3$CN ratio ranging between 4 and 10. This\nhigh CH$_2$CN/CH$_3$CN is reproduced in a representative chemical model of the\nTW Hya disk that employs standard static disk chemistry model assumptions, i.e.\nwithout any additional tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 14:19:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

Update: revised version","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.SC","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  Holonomic functions play an essential role in Computer Algebra since they\nallow the application of many symbolic algorithms. Among all algorithmic\nattempts to find formulas for power series, the holonomic property remains the\nmost important requirement to be satisfied by the function under consideration.\nThe targeted functions mainly summarize that of meromorphic functions. However,\nexpressions like $\\tan(z)$, $z/(\\exp(z)-1)$, $\\sec(z)$, etc., particularly,\nreciprocals, quotients and compositions of holonomic functions, are generally\nnot holonomic. Therefore their power series are inaccessible by the holonomic\nframework. From the mathematical dictionaries, one can observe that most of the\nknown closed-form formulas of non-holonomic power series involve another\nsequence whose evaluation depends on some finite summations. In the case of\n$\\tan(z)$ and $\\sec(z)$ the corresponding sequences are the Bernoulli and Euler\nnumbers, respectively. Thus providing a symbolic approach that yields complete\nrepresentations when linear summations for power series coefficients of\nnon-holonomic functions appear, might be seen as a step forward towards the\nrepresentation of non-holonomic power series.\n  By adapting the method of ansatz with undetermined coefficients, we build an\nalgorithm that computes least-order quadratic differential equations with\npolynomial coefficients for a large class of non-holonomic functions. A\ndifferential equation resulting from this procedure is converted into a\nrecurrence equation by applying the Cauchy product formula and rewriting powers\ninto polynomials and derivatives into shifts. Finally, using enough initial\nvalues we are able to give normal form representations to characterize several\nnon-holonomic power series and prove non-trivial identities.

One can view the bilevel problem as formalizing hyperparameter\noptimization, as bridging machine learning and cost function based optimization\nmethods, or as a method to learn variables best suited to a specific task. More\nformally, bilevel problems attempt to minimize an upper-level loss function,\nwhere variables in the upper-level loss function are themselves minimizers of a\nlower-level cost function.\n  This review contains a running example problem of learning tuning parameters\nand the coefficients for sparsifying filters used in a regularizer.

The template-to-melody module is trained in a self-supervised way\n(i.e., the source template is extracted from the target melody) that does not\nneed any lyric-melody paired data. The lyric-to-template module is made up of\nsome rules and a lyric-to-rhythm model, which is trained with paired\nlyric-rhythm data that is easier to obtain than paired lyric-melody data.\nSecond, it is controllable. The design of template ensures that the generated\nmelodies can be controlled by adjusting the musical elements in template. Both\nsubjective and objective experimental evaluations demonstrate that TeleMelody\ngenerates melodies with higher quality, better controllability, and less\nrequirement on paired lyric-melody data than previous generation systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:19:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 03:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

As the data changes, the y-axis\nmay need to be rescaled as the domain of the data changes.

In contrast to static visualizations, where there is\nconsiderable literature to help choose the appropriate y-axis scale, there is a\nlack of guidance about how and when rescaling should be used in dynamic\nvisualizations. Existing visualization systems and libraries adapt a fixed\nglobal y-axis, or rescale every time the data changes. Yet, professional\nvisualizations, such as in data journalism, do not adopt either strategy. They\ninstead carefully and manually choose when to rescale based on the analysis\ntask and data. To this end, we conduct a series of Mechanical Turk experiments\nto study the potential of dynamic axis rescaling and the factors that affect\nits effectiveness. We find that the appropriate rescaling policy is both task-\nand data-dependent, and we do not find one clear policy choice for all\nsituations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

First,\nwe assume that the IR receive and transmit antennas can coordinate with each\nother, where the transmitted signal of each transmit antenna can depend on the\nreceived signals of all receive antennas, and we derive an achievable DoF for\nthis model. In our interference alignment scheme, we divide receivers into two\ngroups, called clean and dirty receivers. We design our scheme such that a part\nof the message of clean receivers can be demultiplexed at the IR. Thus, the IR\ncan use these message streams for interference cancelation at the clean\nreceivers. Next, we consider an IR, whose antennas do not have coordination\nwith each other, where the transmitted signal of each transmit antenna only\ndepends on the received signal of its corresponding receive antenna, and we\nderive an achievable DoF for it. We show that the achievable DoF decreases\nconsiderably compared with the coordinated case.

It features a\nunique absorption spectrum that is capable of sharply cutting off solar energy\nirradiated in the range of wavelength from 300 to 650 nm, making it a perfect\ncandidate for simultaneous harvesting of both photovoltaic and thermal\ncomponents of solar energy. The proposed composite revealed outstanding\nstability and facile synthesize root, which are the two main obstacles for\napplicability of nanofluids. It was shown experimentally that the additives of\nfullerene to tetralin do not alter significantly it's thermophysical properties\napart from viscosity that increases moderately. Besides, tetralin/fullerene\nsolutions show similar thermohydraulics performance to that of pure tetralin in\nlaminar flow regime or insignificantly lower in transient and turbulent flow\nregimes. A new figure of merit was proposed to analyze the thermohydraulics\nperformance that consider not only exergy losses due to the kinetic energy\ndissipation, but also exergy losses associated with a finite temperature\ndifference in the heat exchanger. As a result, the proposed figure of merit\nindicates the decrease of the heat transfer performance of tetralin/fullerene\nsolutions that directly proportional to fullerene concentration. The performed\nsimulation suggests that the total energy efficiency of flat-plate\nphotovoltaic/thermal solar collector goes up to 60.4 % estimated according\nregulation (EU) No. 811/2013. Finally, life cycle analysis revealed further\nimprovement root in view of environmental impact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

This is demonstrated in contrast to previous highly\nsimplified parametric models of the redshift distribution uncertainty. In\nhyperrank the set of proposed redshift distributions is ranked according to a\nsmall (in this work between one and four) number of summary values, which are\nthen sampled along with other nuisance parameters and cosmological parameters\nin the Monte Carlo chain used for inference. This can be regarded as a general\nmethod for marginalising over discrete realisations of data vector variation\nwith nuisance parameters, which can consequently be sampled separately to the\nmain parameters of interest, allowing for increased computational efficiency.\nWe focus on the case of weak lensing cosmic shear analyses and demonstrate our\nmethod using simulations made for the Dark Energy Survey (DES).

This causes a number of effects\nleading to either underestimation or overestimation of the Hubble parameter\nwhen using any methods of statistical processing, primarily the least squares\nmethod (LSM). The value of the Hubble constant is underestimated when\nprocessing a whole sample; when the sample is constrained by distance,\nespecially when constrained from above, it is significantly overestimated due\nto data selection. The bias significantly exceeds the values of the error the\nHubble constant calculated by the LSM formulae.\n  These effects are demonstrated both analytically and using Monte Carlo\nsimulations, which introduce deviations in both velocities and estimated\ndistances to the original dataset described by the Hubble law. The\ncharacteristics of the deviations are similar to real observations. Errors in\nestimated distances are up to 20%.

Traditionally, these surrogates have\nbeen trained using datasets which map strain inputs to stress outputs directly.\nData-driven constitutive models for elastic and inelastic materials have\ncommonly been developed based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which\nrecently enabled the incorporation of physical laws in the construction of\nthese models. However, ANNs do not offer convergence guarantees and are reliant\non user-specified parameters. In contrast to ANNs, Gaussian process regression\n(GPR) is based on nonparametric modeling principles as well as on fundamental\nstatistical knowledge and hence allows for strict convergence guarantees. GPR\nhowever has the major disadvantage that it scales poorly as datasets get large.\nIn this work we present a physics-informed data-driven constitutive modeling\napproach for isostropic and anisotropic materials based on probabilistic\nmachine learning that can be used in the big data context. The trained GPR\nsurrogates are able to respect physical principles such as material frame\nindifference, material symmetry, thermodynamic consistency, stress-free\nundeformed configuration, and the local balance of angular momentum.\nFurthermore, this paper presents the first sampling approach that directly\ngenerates space-filling points in the invariant space corresponding to bounded\ndomain of the gradient deformation tensor. Overall, the presented approach is\ntested on synthetic data from isotropic and anisotropic constitutive laws and\nshows surprising accuracy even far beyond the limits of the training domain,\nindicating that the resulting surrogates can efficiently generalize as they\nincorporate knowledge about the underlying physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2021 16:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

The emergence and\nsustenance of cooperation in such a population is a highly researched topic in\nthe evolutionary game theory. If the individuals in every deme are considered\nto be either cooperators or defectors, the migration dilemma can be envisaged:\nThe cooperators would not want to migrate to a defector-rich deme as they fear\nof facing exploitation; but without migration, cooperation can not be\nestablished throughout the network of demes. With a view to studying the\naforementioned scenario, in this paper, we set up a theoretical model\nconsisting of a coupled map lattice of replicator maps based on\ntwo-player--two-strategy games. The replicator map considered is capable of\nshowing a variety of evolutionary outcomes, like convergent (fixed point)\noutcomes and nonconvergent (periodic and chaotic) outcomes. Furthermore, this\ncoupled network of the replicator maps undergoes the phenomenon of amplitude\ndeath leading to non-oscillatory stable synchronized states.

Natural biochemical\nsystems are typically modeled by chemical reaction networks (CRNs), and CRNs\ncan be used as a specification language for synthetic chemical computation. In\nthis paper, we identify a class of CRNs called non-competitive (NC) whose\nequilibria are absolutely robust to reaction rates and kinetic rate law,\nbecause their behavior is captured solely by their stoichiometric structure.\nUnlike prior work on rate-independent CRNs, checking non-competition and using\nit as a design criterion is easy and promises robust output. We also present a\ntechnique to program NC-CRNs using well-founded deep learning methods, showing\na translation procedure from rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks to\nNC-CRNs. In the case of binary weight ReLU networks, our translation procedure\nis surprisingly tight in the sense that a single bimolecular reaction\ncorresponds to a single ReLU node and vice versa. This compactness argues that\nneural networks may be a fitting paradigm for programming rate-independent\nchemical computation. As proof of principle, we demonstrate our scheme with\nnumerical simulations of CRNs translated from neural networks trained on\ntraditional machine learning datasets (IRIS and MNIST), as well as tasks better\naligned with potential biological applications including virus detection and\nspatial pattern formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

While the analysis of the stationary states demonstrates\nthe onset of a symmetry broken state for some degree of nonlinearity, the full\ndynamics maps the system into an effective $\\phi^4$ model. In this latter\ncontext, the self-trapping transition is an initial condition dependent\ntransfer of a classical particle over a barrier set by the nonlinear term. This\ntransition has been investigated analytically and mathematically it is\nexpressed through the hyperbolic limit of Jacobian elliptic functions. The aim\nof the present work is to recapture this transition through the use of methods\nof Artificial Intelligence (AI). Specifically, we used a physics motivated\nmachine learning model that is shown to be able to capture the original dynamic\nself-trapping transition and its dependence on initial conditions. Exploitation\nof this result in the case of the non-degenerate nonlinear dimer gives\nadditional information on the more general dynamics and helps delineate linear\nfrom nonlinear localization. This work shows how AI methods may be embedded in\nphysics and provide useful tools for discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

Prior works are constrained mainly by the assumption that\nall agents act simultaneously, and asynchronous action coordination between\nagents is rarely considered. This paper introduces a bi-level multi-agent\ndecision hierarchy for coordinated behavior planning. We propose a novel\nelection mechanism in which we adopt a graph convolutional network to model the\ninteraction among agents and elect a first-move agent for asynchronous\nguidance. We also propose a dynamically weighted mixing network to effectively\nreduce the misestimation of the value function during training. This work is\nthe first to explicitly model the asynchronous multi-agent action coordination,\nand this explicitness enables to choose the optimal first-move agent.

We analyse the loss of\nperformance regarding the use of human transcriptions (measured using\ntranscriptions from the 2020 ADReSS Challenge). Furthermore, we study the\ninfluence of a language model -- which tends to correct non-standard sequences\nof words -- with the lack of language model to decode the hypothesis from the\nASR. This aims at studying the language bias and get more meaningful\ntranscriptions based only on the acoustic information from patients. The\nproposed system combines acoustic -- based on prosody and voice quality -- and\nlexical features based on the first occurrence of the most common words. The\nreported results show the effect of using automatic transcripts with or without\nlanguage model. The best fully automatic system achieves up to 76.06 % of\naccuracy (without language model), significantly higher, 3 % above, than a\nsystem employing word transcriptions decoded using general purpose language\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 10:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}
