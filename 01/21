However, not much is known about the resulting GW amplitudes and their\ndependence on the details of the generation mechanism. Here we treat magnetic\nfield generation through the chiral magnetic effect (CME) as a generic\nmechanism and explore its dependence on the speed of generation (the product of\nmagnetic diffusivity and characteristic wavenumber) and the speed\ncharacterizing the maximum magnetic field strength expected from the CME. When\nthe latter exceeds the former (regime I), the regime applicable to the early\nuniverse, we obtain an inverse cascade with moderate GW energy that scales with\nthe third power of the magnetic energy. When the generation speed exceeds the\nCME limit (regime II), the GW energy continues to increase without a\ncorresponding increase of magnetic energy. In the early kinematic phase, the GW\nenergy spectrum (per linear wavenumber interval) has opposite slopes in both\nregimes and is characterized by an inertial range spectrum in regime I and a\nwhite noise spectrum in regime II. The occurrence of these two slopes is shown\nto be a generic consequence of a nearly monochromatic exponential growth of the\nmagnetic field. The resulting GW energy is found to be proportional to the\nfifth power of the limiting CME speed and the first power of the generation\nspeed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 17:59:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 15:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

However, uncertainty bands on GMST\nprojections are often calculated heuristically and have several potential\nshortcomings. In particular, the uncertainty bands shown in IPCC plume\nprojections of GMST are based on the distribution of GMST anomalies from\nclimate model runs and so are strongly determined by model characteristics with\nlittle influence from observations of the real-world. Physically motivated\ntime-series approaches are proposed based on fitting energy balance models\n(EBMs) to climate model outputs and observations in order to constrain future\nprojections. It is shown that EBMs fitted to one forcing scenario will not\nproduce reliable projections when different forcing scenarios are applied. The\nerrors in the EBM projections can be interpreted as arising due to a\ndiscrepancy in the effective forcing felt by the model. A simple time-series\napproach to correcting the projections is proposed based on learning the\nevolution of the forcing discrepancy so that it can be projected into the\nfuture. These approaches give reliable projections of GMST when tested in a\nperfect model setting, and when applied to observations lead to well\nconstrained projections with lower mean warming and narrower projection bands\nthan previous estimates. Despite the reduced uncertainty, the lower warming\nleads to a greatly reduced probability of exceeding the 2.0 K warming target.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 16:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-21"}

Our approach enables at least 18% throughput gains compared\nto a pilot and CP-based baseline, and at least 4% gains compared to a system\nthat uses a neural receiver with pilots but no CP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 16:53:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 09:11:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 14:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

In a causally inspired perspective on OOD generalization, the\ntest data arise from a specific class of interventions on exogenous random\nvariables of the DGP, called anchors.

Relative to a pod-scale DC, the\nresults show that physical disaggregation at rack-scale is sufficient for\noptimal efficiency when the optical network topology is adopted and resource\ncomponents are allocated in a suitable manner. The optical network topology\nalso enables optimal energy efficiency in composable DCs. The paper also\nstudies logical disaggregation of traditional DC servers over an optical\nnetwork topology.

As a neutron star\ninspirals within the envelope of a primary massive star, it accretes and spins\nup. Because neutron stars are in the strong-gravity regime, they have a\nsubstantial relativistic mass deficit, i.e., their gravitational mass is less\nthan their baryonic mass. This effect causes some fraction of the accreted\nbaryonic mass to convert into neutron star binding energy. The relativistic\nmass deficit also depends on the nuclear equation of state, since more compact\nneutron stars will have larger binding energies. We model the mass growth and\nspin-up of neutron stars inspiraling within common-envelope environments and\nquantify how different initial binary conditions and hadronic equations of\nstate affect the post-common-envelope neutron star's mass and spin. From these\nmodels, we find that neutron star mass growth is suppressed by $\\approx\n15-30\\%$. We also find that for a given amount of accreted baryonic mass, more\ncompact neutron stars will spin-up faster while gaining less gravitational\nmass, and vice versa. This work demonstrates that a neutron star's strong\ngravity and nuclear microphysics plays a role in neutron-star-common-envelope\nevolution, in addition to the macroscopic astrophysics of the envelope. Strong\ngravity and the nuclear equation of state may thus affect both the population\nproperties of neutron star binaries and the cosmic double neutron star merger\nrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 19:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Here, we demonstrate how inclusion of new atomic data\nin synthetic spectra calculations can provide insights and constraints on the\nproduction of the heaviest elements. We employ theoretical atomic data\n(obtained using GRASP$^0$) for neutral, singly- and doubly-ionised platinum and\ngold, to generate photospheric and simple nebular phase model spectra for\nkilonova-like ejecta properties. We make predictions for the locations of\nstrong transitions, which could feasibly appear in the spectra of kilonovae\nthat are rich in these species. We identify low-lying electric quadrupole and\nmagnetic dipole transitions that may give rise to forbidden lines when the\nejecta becomes optically thin. The strongest lines lie beyond $8000\\,\\r{A}$,\nmotivating high quality near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up of kilonova\ncandidates. We compare our model spectra to the observed spectra of AT2017gfo,\nand conclude that no platinum or gold signatures are prominent in the ejecta.\nFrom our nebular phase modelling, we place tentative upper limits on the\nplatinum and gold mass of $\\lesssim$ a few $10^{-3}\\,\\rm{M}_{\\odot}$, and\n$\\lesssim 10^{-2}\\,\\rm{M}_{\\odot}$, respectively.

Given the high level of expertise required for navigation and\ninterpretation of ultrasound images, computational simulations can facilitate\nthe training of such skills in virtual reality. With ray-tracing based\nsimulations, realistic ultrasound images can be generated. However, due to\ncomputational constraints for interactivity, image quality typically needs to\nbe compromised.\n  Methods. We propose herein to bypass any rendering and simulation process at\ninteractive time, by conducting such simulations during a non-time-critical\noffline stage and then learning image translation from cross-sectional model\nslices to such simulated frames. We use a generative adversarial framework with\na dedicated generator architecture and input feeding scheme, which both\nsubstantially improve image quality without increase in network parameters.\nIntegral attenuation maps derived from cross-sectional model slices,\ntexture-friendly strided convolutions, providing stochastic noise and input\nmaps to intermediate layers in order to preserve locality are all shown herein\nto greatly facilitate such translation task.\n  Results. Given several quality metrics, the proposed method with only tissue\nmaps as input is shown to provide comparable or superior results to a\nstate-of-the-art that uses additional images of low-quality ultrasound\nrenderings. An extensive ablation study shows the need and benefits from the\nindividual contributions utilized in this work, based on qualitative examples\nand quantitative ultrasound similarity metrics. To that end, a local histogram\nstatistics based error metric is proposed and demonstrated for visualization of\nlocal dissimilarities between ultrasound images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 21:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-22"}

Methods: Five\nordinary differential equation models for tear film thinning were designed that\nmodel evaporation, osmosis, and various types of flow. Eight tear film breakup\ninstances of five healthy subjects that were identified in fluorescence images\nin previous work were fit with these five models. The fitting procedure used a\nnonlinear least squares optimization that minimized the difference of the\ncomputed theoretical fluorescent intensity from the models and the experimental\nfluorescent intensity from the images.

While diverse in its many incarnations and generally\nunsuspected, the cause of reentrance at the microscopic level is often not\ninvestigated thoroughly. Here, through detailed characterization and\ntheoretical modeling, we uncover the microscopic mechanism behind reentrance in\nthe strongly frustrated pyrochlore antiferromagnet Er$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. Taking\nadvantage of the recent advance in rare earth stannate single crystal\nsynthesis, we use heat capacity measurements to expose that Er$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$\nexhibits multiple instances of reentrance in its magnetic field $B$ vs.\ntemperature $T$ phase diagram for magnetic fields along three cubic high\nsymmetry directions. Through classical Monte Carlo simulations, mean field\ntheory and classical linear spin-wave expansions, we argue that the origins of\nthe multiple occurrences of reentrance observed in Er$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ are linked\nto soft modes. Depending on the field direction, these arise either from a\ndirect $T=0$ competition between the field-evolved ground states, or from a\nfield-induced enhancement of the competition with a distinct zero-field\nantiferromagnetic phase. In both scenarios, the phase competition enhances\nthermal fluctuations which entropically stabilize a specific ordered phase.\nThis results in an increased transition temperature for certain field values\nand thus the reentrant behavior. Our work represents a detailed examination\ninto the mechanisms responsible for reentrance in a frustrated magnet and may\nserve as a template for the interpretation of reentrant phenomena in other\nphysical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 23:26:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

The scale dependence of flow in porous\nmedia is attributed to small- and large-scale heterogeneities, such as pore\nsize distribution, pore connectivity, long-range correlations, fractures and\nfaults orientations, and spatial and temporal variations. The main objective of\nthis study was to investigate how permeability (k) and formation factor (F)\nvary with sample dimension at small scales by means of a combination of\npore-network modeling and percolation theory. For this purpose, the\npermeability and formation factor were simulated in twelve three-dimensional\npore networks with different levels of pore-scale heterogeneities. Simulations\nwere carried out at five different network sizes, i.e., 1130, 2250, 3380, 4510\nand 6770 microns. Four theoretical models were also developed based on\npercolation theory to estimate the scale dependence of permeability and\nformation factor from the pore-throat radius distribution.

However, as the high density of BSs is\ndesigned to accommodate peak traffic, it would consume an unnecessarily large\namount of energy if BSs are on during off-peak time. To save the energy\nconsumption of cellular networks, an effective way is to deactivate some idle\nbase stations that do not serve any traffic demand. In this paper, we develop a\ntraffic-aware dynamic BS sleep control framework, named DeepBSC, which presents\na novel data-driven learning approach to determine the BS active/sleep modes\nwhile meeting lower energy consumption and satisfactory Quality of Service\n(QoS) requirements. Specifically, the traffic demands are predicted by the\nproposed GS-STN model, which leverages the geographical and semantic\nspatial-temporal correlations of mobile traffic. With accurate mobile traffic\nforecasting, the BS sleep control problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process\nthat is solved by Actor-Critic reinforcement learning methods.

As algorithmic\nstablecoins have been growing rapidly in recent years, they become much more\nvolatile than expected. In this paper, we took a deep dive into the core of\nalgorithmic stablecoins and shared our answer to two fundamental research\nquestions, i.e., Are algorithmic stablecoins volatile by design? Are they\nvolatile in practice? Specifically, we introduced an in-depth study on three\npopular types of algorithmic stablecoins and developed a modeling framework to\nformalize their key design protocols. Through formal verification, the\nframework can identify critical conditions under which stablecoins might become\nvolatile. Furthermore, we performed a systematic empirical analysis on real\ntransaction activities of the Basis Cash stablecoin to relate theoretical\npossibilities to market observations. Lastly, we highlighted key design\ndecisions for future development of algorithmic stablecoins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 03:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-22"}

We find that the thermoelectric properties of STTG can be much\nbetter than those of the anomalous Nernst effect by increasing the Seebeck\ncoefficient and anomalous Hall angle of the thermoelectric and magnetic\nmaterials, respectively, as well as by optimizing their dimensions. We also\nformulate the electronic cooling performance in the STTG system, confirming the\nreciprocal relation for the hybrid transverse thermoelectric conversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 05:08:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 May 2021 03:25:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 08:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

Among them,\nequipping unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with real time robust visual trackers\nfor all day aerial maneuver, is currently attracting incremental attention and\nhas remarkably broadened the scope of applications of object tracking. However,\nprior tracking methods have merely focused on robust tracking in the\nwell-illuminated scenes, while ignoring trackers' capabilities to be deployed\nin the dark. In darkness, the conditions can be more complex and harsh, easily\nposing inferior robust tracking or even tracking failure. To this end, this\nwork proposed a novel discriminative correlation filter based tracker with\nillumination adaptive and anti dark capability, namely ADTrack. ADTrack firstly\nexploits image illuminance information to enable adaptability of the model to\nthe given light condition. Then, by virtue of an efficient and effective image\nenhancer, ADTrack carries out image pretreatment, where a target aware mask is\ngenerated. Benefiting from the mask, ADTrack aims to solve a dual regression\nproblem where dual filters, i.e., the context filter and target focused filter,\nare trained with mutual constraint. Thus ADTrack is able to maintain\ncontinuously favorable performance in all-day conditions. Besides, this work\nalso constructed one UAV nighttime tracking benchmark UAVDark135, comprising of\nmore than 125k manually annotated frames, which is also very first UAV\nnighttime tracking benchmark. Exhaustive experiments are extended on\nauthoritative daytime benchmarks, i.e., UAV123 10fps, DTB70, and the newly\nbuilt dark benchmark UAVDark135, which have validated the superiority of\nADTrack in both bright and dark conditions on a single CPU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 05:12:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2021 13:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

Therefore utilizing this feature of\nactive systems requires harnessing and directing the macroscopic dynamics to\nachieve specific functions; which in turn necessitates understanding the\nunderlying mechanisms of active forces.

However, for images taken in real-world, the\nillumination is not uniformly distributed over whole image which brings model\nmismatch and possibly results in color shift of the deep models using ASM.\nBearing this in mind, in this study, first, a new non-homogeneous atmospheric\nscattering model (NH-ASM) is proposed for improving image modeling of hazy\nimages taken under complex illumination conditions. Second, a new U-Net based\nfront white balance module (FWB-Module) is dedicatedly designed to correct\ncolor shift before generating dehazing result via atmospheric light estimation.\nThird, a new FWB loss is innovatively developed for training FWB-Module, which\nimposes penalty on color shift.

In the UM-MIMO\nsystems, hybrid beamforming stands out for its great potential in promisingly\nhigh data rate and reduced power consumption. In this paper, challenges and\nfeatures of the THz hybrid beamforming design are investigated, in light of the\ndistinctive THz peculiarities.

Though analytical solutions have been found for special\ncases, the general problem remains unsolved; the solutions that do exist are\nimpractical. Fortunately, for many applications, we may not need to solve the\nproblem completely, i.e., predicting with reasonable accuracy for some time\nsteps, may be sufficient. Recently, Breen et al attempted to approximately\nsolve the three body problem using a simple neural network. Although their\nmethods appear to achieve some success in reducing the computational overhead,\ntheir model is extremely restricted, applying to a specialized 2D case. The\nauthors do not provide explanations for critical decisions taken in their\nexperimental design, no details on their model or architecture, and nor do they\npublish their code. Moreover, the model does not generalize well to unseen\ncases.

One of the biggest limiting\nfactors affecting the parameter scanning speed of these detectors is the noise\nadded by the components in the signal detection chain. Since the first\namplifier in the chain limits the minimum noise, low-noise amplification is of\nparamount importance. This paper reports on the operation of a flux-driven\nJosephson parametric amplifier (JPA) operating at around 2.3 GHz with added\nnoise approaching the quantum limit. The JPA was employed as a first stage\namplifier in an experimental setting similar to the ones used in haloscope\naxion detectors.

Synchronisation of these rhythms promotes sleep and brain\nclearance and is critical for human health. Conversely, their desynchrony is\nlinked to impaired performance and disease. We find that the default state of\nthe model corresponds to the endogenous homeostatic period that is far from ~24\nh of the circadian and light-dark cycles. Combined action of light and\ncircadian oscillator on the homeostatic rhythm is required to achieve the\ntypical sleep-wake pattern of healthy people. Change of homeostatic clearance\nis found to induce two types of desynchronisation: (i) fast clearance rates\ndesynchronise the homeostatic oscillator from the circadian, while the\ncircadian rhythm remains entrained to light, and (ii) slow clearance maintains\nsynchronisation between the homeostatic and circadian oscillators, but the\nperiod is different from that of the light-dark cycle. Between these regimes,\nall three rhythms are synchronised under the studied conditions. The system is\nhighly sensitive to external inputs to the neuronal populations of the\nsleep-wake switch, which can lead to complete loss of sleep. The model shows\nthat loss of synchronisation can be caused by changes in the homeostatic\nclearance rate or external input to the neuronal populations of the sleep-wake\nswitch.

Therefore, minimizing the adverse\neffects of color deviation on the prediction is one of the main goals of vision\ntask. Current solutions focus on using generative models to augment training\ndata to enhance the invariance of input variation. However, such methods often\nintroduce new noise, which limits the gain from generated data. To this end,\nthis paper proposes a strategy eliminate deviation with deviation, which is\nnamed Random Color Dropout (RCD). Our hypothesis is that if there are color\ndeviation between the query image and the gallery image, the retrieval results\nof some examples will be better after ignoring the color information.\nSpecifically, this strategy balances the weights between color features and\ncolor-independent features in the neural network by dropouting partial color\ninformation in the training data, so as to overcome the effect of color\ndevitaion. The proposed RCD can be combined with various existing ReID models\nwithout changing the learning strategy, and can be applied to other computer\nvision fields, such as object detection. Experiments on several ReID baselines\nand three common large-scale datasets such as Market1501, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17\nhave verified the effectiveness of this method. Experiments on Cross-domain\ntests have shown that this strategy is significant eliminating the domain gap.\nFurthermore, in order to understand the working mechanism of RCD, we analyzed\nthe effectiveness of this strategy from the perspective of classification,\nwhich reveals that it may be better to utilize many instead of all of color\ninformation in visual tasks with strong domain variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 10:33:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 08:26:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 15:15:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 01:30:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 14:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

When there are as many\nsources as microphones (i.e., the determined case), BSS can be performed\ncomputationally efficiently by independent component analysis (ICA).\nUnfortunately, however, ICA is basically inapplicable to the underdetermined\ncase. Another BSS approach using the multichannel Wiener filter (MWF) is\napplicable even to this case, and encompasses full-rank spatial covariance\nanalysis (FCA) and multichannel non-negative matrix factorization (MNMF).\nHowever, these methods require massive numbers of matrix inversions to design\nthe MWF, and are thus computationally inefficient. To overcome this drawback,\nwe exploit the well-known property of diagonal matrices that matrix inversion\namounts to mere inversion of the diagonal elements and can thus be performed\ncomputationally efficiently. This makes it possible to drastically reduce the\ncomputational cost of the above matrix inversions based on a joint\ndiagonalization (JD) idea, leading to computationally efficient BSS.\nSpecifically, we restrict the N spatial covariance matrices (SCMs) of all N\nsources to a class of (exactly) jointly diagonalizable matrices.

Explicit marching\nschemes are efficient but suffer from severe stability constraints, while\nnonlinear systems of equations have to be solved in implicit schemes though\nthey are unconditionally stable. A better compromise between stability and\nefficiency is the semi-implicit scheme, such as the Gauss-Seidel projection\nmethod (GSPM) and the second-order backward differentiation formula scheme\n(BDF2). At each marching step, GSPM solves several linear systems of equations\nwith constant coefficients and updates the stray field several times, while\nBDF2 updates the stray field only once but solves a larger linear system of\nequations with variable coefficients and a nonsymmetric structure.

Traditional approaches generally\nmisidentify the normal dynamic deviations as faults and thus lead to high false\nalarms. Besides, they generally consider single relatively steady operating\ncondition and suffer from the catastrophic forgetting issue when learning\nsuccessive operating conditions. In this paper, recursive cointegration\nanalysis (RCA) is first proposed to distinguish the real faults from normal\nsystems changes, where the model is updated once a new normal sample arrives\nand can adapt to slow change of cointegration relationship. Based on the\nlong-term equilibrium information extracted by RCA, the remaining short-term\ndynamic information is monitored by recursive principal component analysis\n(RPCA). Thus a comprehensive monitoring framework is built. When the system\nenters a new operating condition, the RCA-RPCA model is rebuilt to deal with\nthe new condition. Meanwhile, elastic weight consolidation (EWC) is employed to\nsettle the `catastrophic forgetting' issue inherent in RPCA, where significant\ninformation of influential parameters is enhanced to avoid the abrupt\nperformance degradation for similar modes. The effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod is illustrated by a practical industrial system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 12:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-22"}

One\nof the major challenges of clustering such massive amount of text is to cluster\nthem within a reasonable amount of time. The existing state-of-the-art short\ntext stream clustering methods can not cluster such massive amount of text\nwithin a reasonable amount of time as they compute similarities between a text\nand all the existing clusters to assign that text to a cluster. To overcome\nthis challenge, we propose a fast short text stream clustering method (called\nFastStream) that efficiently index the clusters using inverted index and\ncompute similarity between a text and a selected number of clusters while\nassigning a text to a cluster. In this way, we not only reduce the running time\nof our proposed method but also reduce the running time of several\nstate-of-the-art short text stream clustering methods. FastStream assigns a\ntext to a cluster (new or existing) using the dynamically computed similarity\nthresholds based on statistical measure.

Despite its success in various topology optimization fields, the\nrobust formulation presents some drawbacks. This paper addresses one in\nparticular, which concerns the imposition of the minimum length scale. In the\ndensity framework, the minimum size of the solid and void phases must be\nimposed implicitly through the parameters that define the density filter and\nthe smoothed Heaviside projection. Finding these parameters can be time\nconsuming and cumbersome, hindering a general code implementation of the robust\nformulation.

The expressions are validated on a density-based framework. To\nfacilitate the reproduction of results, MATLAB codes are provided.\n  As a side finding, this paper shows that to obtain simultaneous control over\nthe minimum size of the solid and void phases, it is necessary to involve the 3\nfields (eroded, intermediate and dilated) in the topology optimization problem.\nTherefore, for the compliance minimization problem subject to a volume\nrestriction, the intermediate and dilated designs can be excluded from the\nobjective function, but the volume restriction has to be applied to the dilated\ndesign in order to involve all 3 designs in the formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 13:44:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 14:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

These clutter intensities spatially vary\nover several orders of magnitude, and vary across different arrays, which makes\ndirect comparison of these raw intensities difficult. However, by gathering\nstatistics on these intensities and their spatial variation, a variety of\nmetrics can be determined. In this study, the clutter distribution is found to\nfit better to a two-parameter Weibull distribution than Gaussian or lognormal\ndistributions. Based upon the spatial variation of the two Weibull parameters,\nscale and shape, more information may be gleaned from these data. How well the\nGPR array is illuminating various parts of the ground, in depth and\ncross-track, may be determined from the spatial variation of the Weibull scale\nparameter, which may in turn be used to estimate an effective attenuation\ncoefficient in the soil. The transition in depth from clutter-limited to\nnoise-limited conditions (which is one possible definition of GPR penetration\ndepth) can be estimated from the spatial variation of the Weibull shape\nparameter. Finally, the underlying clutter distributions also provide an\nopportunity to standardize image intensities to determine when a statistically\nsignificant deviation from background (clutter) has occurred, which is\nconvenient for buried threat detection algorithm development which needs to be\nrobust across multiple different arrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 14:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-22"}

Moreover, we introduce a model for a non-Hermitian quantum\nsingle-molecule junction (nHQSMJ). In this model the leads are mapped to a\ntunneling two-level system, which is in turn coupled to a harmonic mode (i.e.,\nthe molecule). A decay operator acting on the two-level system describes\nphenomenologically probability losses. Finally, the temperature of the molecule\nis controlled by means of a Nos\\'e-Hoover chain thermostat. A numerical study\nof the quantum dynamics of this toy model at different temperatures is\nreported. We find that the combined action of probability losses and thermal\nfluctuations assists quantum transport through the molecular junction.

GMOMatch, which is an iterative two-step\nmethod, provides high service quality and is efficient in terms of\ncomputational complexity. It starts with a one-to-one matching in Step 1 and is\nfollowed by solving a maximum weight matching problem in Step 2 to combine the\ntravel requests. To evaluate the performance, it is compared with a\nride-matching algorithm developed by Simonetto et al. (2019). Both algorithms\nare implemented in a micro-traffic simulator to assess their performance and\ntheir impact on traffic congestion in Downtown, Toronto road network. In\ncomparison to the Simonetto, GMOMatch improved the service rate, vehicle\nkilometer traveled and traffic travel time by 32%, 16.07%, and 4%,\nrespectively. The sensitivity analysis indicated that utilizing vehicles with a\ncapacity of 10 can achieve 25% service rate improvement compared to a capacity\nof 4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:02:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 23:47:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 20:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

At a high\nlevel, neural compression is based on an autoencoder that tries to reconstruct\nthe input instance from a (quantized) latent representation, coupled with a\nprior that is used to losslessly compress these latents. Due to limitations on\nmodel capacity and imperfect optimization and generalization, such models will\nsuboptimally compress test data in general. However, one of the great strengths\nof learned compression is that if the test-time data distribution is known and\nrelatively low-entropy (e.g. a camera watching a static scene, a dash cam in an\nautonomous car, etc.), the model can easily be finetuned or adapted to this\ndistribution, leading to improved $RD$ performance. In this paper we take this\nconcept to the extreme, adapting the full model to a single video, and sending\nmodel updates (quantized and compressed using a parameter-space prior) along\nwith the latent representation. Unlike previous work, we finetune not only the\nencoder/latents but the entire model, and - during finetuning - take into\naccount both the effect of model quantization and the additional costs incurred\nby sending the model updates.

Furthermore, we\nanalyze the performances of the selected algorithms by discussing and comparing\nthe experimental results that where provided in the original articles. The goal\nof this paper is to provide a comprehensive and homogeneous reconstruction of\nthe state-of-the-art which is currently fragmented across many papers that use\ndifferent notations and where the proposed methods are not organized according\nto a classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 14:01:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 13:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is developed to predict the\nmodified k-value based on finite element (FE) analysis.

A suitable infinite-dimensional generalization of this\nformalism is applicable to a certain class of Quantum Field Theories (QFT)\nendowed with supersymmetry. In this thesis we review the formalism of\nequivariant localization and some of its applications in Quantum Mechanics (QM)\nand QFT. We start from the mathematical description of equivariant cohomology\nand related localization theorems of finite-dimensional integrals in the case\nof an Abelian group action, and then we discuss their formal application to\ninfinite-dimensional path integrals in QFT. We summarize some examples from the\nliterature of computations of partition functions and expectation values of\nsupersymmetric operators in various dimensions. For 1-dimensional QFT, that is\nQM, we review the application of the localization principle to the derivation\nof the Atiyah-Singer index theorem applied to the Dirac operator on a twisted\nspinor bundle. In 3 and 4 dimensions, we examine the computation of expectation\nvalues of certain Wilson loops in supersymmetric gauge theories and their\nrelation to 0-dimensional theories described by \"matrix models\".

It succeeds to\ndistinguish states of varying dynamical complexity in the presence of noise and\nnon-stationarity, even when the time series is of short length.

Deep Extreme Learning machines (Deep ELM)\nclassifier model is one of the fastest and effective way to meet fast\nclassification problems. In this study, Deep ELM model, its superiorities and\nweaknesses are discussed, the problems that are more suitable for the\nclassifiers against Convolutional neural network based DL algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 08:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

To tackle these three challenges, we propose a novel deep\nlearning approach using black-box knowledge distillation for both accurate and\nefficient transmission dynamics prediction in a practical manner. First, we\nleverage mixture models to develop an accurate, comprehensive, yet impractical\nsimulation system. Next, we use simulated observation sequences to query the\nsimulation system to retrieve simulated projection sequences as knowledge.\nThen, with the obtained query data, sequence mixup is proposed to improve query\nefficiency, increase knowledge diversity, and boost distillation model\naccuracy. Finally, we train a student deep neural network with the retrieved\nand mixed observation-projection sequences for practical use. The case study on\nCOVID-19 justifies that our approach accurately projects infections with much\nlower computation cost when observation data are limited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 19:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

There is a steadily growing energy\ndemand from remote consumers, and the capacity of existing lines may become\ninadequate soon. Furthermore, high impedance arcing faults (HIF) from SWER\nlines can cause catastrophic bushfires such as the 2009 Black Saturday event.\nAs a solution, reliable remote electricity networks can be established through\nbreaking the existing systems down into microgrids, and existing SWER lines can\nbe utilised to interconnect those microgrids. The development of such reliable\nnetworks with better energy demand management will rely on having an integrated\nnetwork-wide condition monitoring system. As the first contribution of this\nthesis, a distributed online monitoring platform is developed that incorporates\npower quality monitoring, real-time HIF identification and transient\nclassification in SWER network. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques\nare developed to classify faults and transients. The proposed approach\ndemonstrates higher HIF detection accuracy (98.67%) and reduced detection\nlatency (115.2 ms). Secondly, a remote consumer load identification methodology\nis developed to detect the load type from its transients. An edge\ncomputing-based architecture is proposed to facilitate the high-frequency\nanalysis for load identification. The proposed approach is evaluated in\nreal-time, and it achieves an average accuracy of 98% in identifying different\nloads. Finally, a deep neural network-based energy disaggregation framework is\ndeveloped to separate the load specific energy usage from an aggregated signal.\nThe proposed framework is evaluated using a real-world data set. It improves\nthe signal aggregate error by 44% and mean aggregate error by 19% in comparison\nwith the state-of-the-art techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 07:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}
