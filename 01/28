However, the exact thermal radiative transfer problem\nis still difficult to solve and requires massive simulation capabilities.\nHence, there still exists a need for adequate approximations that are\ncomparatively easy to carry out. Classic approximations, such as the classic\ndiffusion and classic $P_1$, fail to describe the correct heat wave velocity,\nwhen the optical depth is not sufficiently high. Therefore, we use the recently\ndeveloped discontinuous asymptotic $P_1$ approximation, which is a\ntime-dependent analogy for the adjustment of the discontinuous asymptotic\ndiffusion for two different zones. This approximation was tested via several\nbenchmarks, showing better results than other common approximations, and has\nalso demonstrated a good agreement with a main Marshak wave experiment and its\nMonte-Carlo gray simulation.

Polytropic\nmagnetohydrodynamic wind models are thermally driven, while Alfv\\'en waves act\nas additional acceleration and heating mechanisms in the Alfv\\'en wave driven\nmodel. We confirm that an AW-driven model is required to reproduce the observed\nbimodality of slow and fast solar winds.

Indeed, solar surface magnetic field topology plays an\nimportant role in the Alfv\\'en wave driven wind model, as it enters directly\ninto the input energy sources via the Poynting flux. On the other hand, the\npolytropic wind model is driven by an assumed pressure gradient; thus it is\nrelatively less sensitive to the surface magnetic field topology.

The counting of plaques or foci at a given dilution intuitively and\ndirectly provides the concentration of infectious doses in the undiluted\nsample. However, it has many technical and experimental limitations. For\nexample, it relies on one's judgement in distinguishing between two merged\nplaques and a larger one, or between small plaques and staining artifacts. In\nthis regard, ED assays are more robust because one need only determine whether\ninfection occurred. The output of the ED assay, the 50% infectious dose\n(ID$_{50}$), is calculated using either the Spearman-Karber (SK, 1908,1931) or\nReed-Muench (RM, 1938) mathematical approximations. However, these are often\nmiscalculated and their ID$_{50}$ approximation is biased. We propose that the\nPFU and FFU assays be abandoned, and that the measured output of the ED assay,\nthe ID$_{50}$, be replaced by a more useful measure we coined Specific\nINfections (SIN). We introduce a free, open-source web-application, midSIN,\nthat computes the SIN concentration in a virus sample from a standard ED assay,\nrequiring no changes to current experimental protocols. We demonstrate that the\nSIN/mL of a sample reliably corresponds to the number of infections the sample\nwill cause per unit volume, and directly relates to the multiplicity of\ninfection. midSIN estimates are shown to be more accurate and robust than those\nusing the RM and SK approximations. The impact of ED plate design choices\n(dilution factor, replicates per dilution) on measurement accuracy is also\nexplored. The simplicity of SIN as a measure and the greater accuracy of midSIN\nmake them an easy, superior replacement for the PFU, FFU, and ID$_{50}$\nmeasures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 16:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Existing methods for detecting periodicity in an\nearthquake catalogue typically require the prior removal of these clustered\nevents. Declustering is a highly uncertain process, so declustering methods are\ninherently non-unique.

With the help of\nthis characterization, we obtain an infinite family of APN functions for $ n=2m\n$ with $m$ being an odd positive integer: $ f(x)=a{\\rm\nTr}^{n}_{m}(bx^3)+a^q{\\rm Tr}^{n}_{m}(b^3x^9) $, where $ a\\in \\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$\nsuch that $ a+a^q\\neq 0 $ and $ b $ is a non-cube in $ \\mathbb{F}_{2^n} $.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 16:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-28"}

Their mechanical parts such as electrical engines, rotors, or\nbearings are the major components and any failure in them may result in their\ntotal shutdown. Anomaly detection in such critical systems is very important to\nmonitor the system's health. As the requirement to obtain a dataset from\nrotating machines where all possible faults are explicitly labeled is difficult\nto satisfy, we propose a method that focuses on the normal behavior of the\nmachine instead. We propose an autoencoder model-based method for condition\nmonitoring of rotating machines by using an anomaly detection approach. The\nmethod learns the characteristics of a rotating machine using the normal\nvibration signals to model the healthy state of the machine. A threshold-based\napproach is then applied to the reconstruction error of unseen data, thus\nenabling the detection of unseen anomalies. The proposed method can directly\nextract the salient features from raw vibration signals and eliminate the need\nfor manually engineered features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method by employing two rotating machine datasets and the quality of\nthe automatically learned features is compared with a set of handcrafted\nfeatures by training an Isolation Forest model on either of these two sets.\nExperimental results on two real-world datasets indicate that our proposed\nsolution gives promising results, achieving an average F1-score of 99.6%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 16:49:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-28"}

However, measurement\nof this signal will be very challenging not only because the overall strength\nis weaker than the sensitivity of SKA, but also because of the polarized\nforegrounds from diffuse synchrotron emission, and Faraday rotation which\nmodifies the observed polarization. Nevertheless, the 21 cm linear polarization\nsignal may still likely be detectable through other approaches, e.g. its\ncross-correlation with other probes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 16:58:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 05:21:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 13:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

The difficulty\noriginates from the inherently different peculiarities of the two disciplines,\ne.g., VL understanding tasks capitalize on the unrestricted message passing\nacross modalities, while generation tasks only employ visual-to-textual message\npassing. In this paper, we start with a two-stream decoupled design of\nencoder-decoder structure, in which two decoupled cross-modal encoder and\ndecoder are involved to separately perform each type of proxy tasks, for\nsimultaneous VL understanding and generation pretraining. Moreover, for VL\npretraining, the dominant way is to replace some input visual/word tokens with\nmask tokens and enforce the multi-modal encoder/decoder to reconstruct the\noriginal tokens, but no mask token is involved when fine-tuning on downstream\ntasks. As an alternative, we propose a primary scheduled sampling strategy that\nelegantly mitigates such discrepancy via pretraining encoder-decoder in a\ntwo-pass manner.

The fundamental\ningredients are the presence of collective (i.e. nonlocal) dissipation and\nunbalanced local dissipation rates (the qubits dissipate at different rates).\nThe resulting quantum trajectories show that the measurement backaction changes\nthe system wave function and induces a passage of the excitation from one qubit\nto the other. While similar phenomena have been witnessed for a non-Markovian\nenvironment, here the dissipative quantum state transfer is induced by an\nupdate of the observer knowledge of the wave function in the presence of a\nMarkovian (memoryless) environment -- this is a single quantum trajectory\neffect. Beyond single quantum trajectories and postselection, such an effect\ncan be observed by histogramming the quantum jumps along several realizations\nat different times.

We do this with the goal of\nbetter understanding what type of shape information contained in the network is\ndiscriminative, where shape information is encoded, as well as when the network\nlearns about object shape during training. We show that a network learns the\nmajority of overall shape information at the first few epochs of training and\nthat this information is largely encoded in the last few layers of a CNN.\nFinally, we show that the encoding of shape does not imply the encoding of\nlocalized per-pixel semantic information.

It is\nimportant to provide up-to-date measurement results of LSM for system\npractitioners so that they can make prudent trade-offs between security and\nperformance. This work evaluates the overhead of LSM for file accesses on Linux\nv5.3.0. We build a performance evaluation framework for LSM. It has two parts,\nan extension of LMBench2.5 to evaluate the overhead of file operations for\ndifferent security modules, and a security module with tunable latency for\npolicy enforcement to study the impact of the latency of policy enforcement on\nthe end-to-end latency of file operations.

To do so, methods have to be used that, in principle,\ncan provide numerically exact results for both the dynamics and the excitation\nspectra in a systematic manner. Numerically exact results for the dynamics are\npresented employing the well-established multicongurational time-dependent\nHartree for bosons (MCTDHB) method. The respective excitation spectra are\ncalculated utilizing the more recently introduced linear-response theory atop\nit (LR-MCTDHB). The latter theory gives rise to an, in general, non-hermitian\neigenvalue problem. The theory and its newly developed implementation are\ndescribed in detail and benchmarked towards the exactly-solvable\nharmonic-interaction model. Several applications to BECs in one- and\ntwo-dimensional potential traps are discussed. With respect to dynamics, it is\nshown that both the out-of-equilibrium tunneling dynamics and the dynamics of\ntrapped vortices are of many-body nature. Furthermore, many-body effects in the\nexcitation spectra are presented for BECs in different trap geometries. It is\ndemonstrated that even for essentially-condensed systems, the spectrum of the\nlowest-in-energy excitations computed at the many-body level can differ\nsubstantially from the standard mean-field description. In general, it is shown\nthat bosons carrying angular momentum are more sensitive to many-body effects\nthan bosons without.

These findings instigated models suggesting that either large\nvelocity kicks were imparted to their progenitors, allowing them to propagate\nto large distances and attain their remote locations; or that they formed in\ndense globular clusters residing in the halos. Here we show that instead, the\nlarge spatial-offsets of these transients are naturally explained by the\nobservations of highly extended underlying stellar populations in (mostly early\ntype) galaxy halos, typically missed since they can only be identified through\nultra-deep/stacked images. Consequently, no large velocity kicks, nor halo\nglobular cluster environments are required in order to explain the origin of\nthese transients. These findings support thermonuclear explosions on\nwhite-dwarfs, for the origins of Ca-rich SNe progenitors, and\nno/small-natal-kicks given to sGRB progenitors. Since early-type galaxies\ncontain older stellar populations, transient arising from older stellar\npopulations would have larger fractions of early-type galaxy hosts, and\nconsequently larger fractions of transients at large offsets. This is verified\nby our results for sGRBs and Ca-rich SNe showing different offset distributions\nin early vs. late-type galaxies. Furthermore, once divided between early and\nlate type galaxies, the offsets' distributions of the different transients are\nconsistent with each other.

A relativistic description of the laws of physics hence\nneeds to take into account such quantum reference frames (QRFs), through which\nspacetime can be given an operational meaning. Here, we introduce the notion of\na spacetime QRF, associated to a quantum particle in spacetime. Such\nformulation has the advantage of treating space and time on equal footing, and\nof describing the dynamical evolution of a set of quantum systems from the\nperspective of another quantum system, where the evolution parameter coincides\nwith the proper time of the particle taken as the QRF. Crucially, the proper\ntimes in two different QRFs are not related by a standard transformation, but\nthey might be in a quantum superposition. Concretely, we consider N\nrelativistic quantum particles in a weak gravitational field and introduce a\ntimeless formulation in which the global state of the N particles appears\n\"frozen\", but the dynamical evolution is recovered in terms of relational\nquantities. The position and momentum Hilbert space of the particles is used to\nfix the QRF via a transformation to the local frame of the particle such that\nthe metric is locally inertial at the origin of the QRF. The internal Hilbert\nspace corresponds to the clock space, keeping the proper time in the local\nframe of the particle. This fully relational construction shows how the\nremaining particles evolve from the perspective of the QRF and includes the\nPage-Wootters mechanism for non interacting clocks when the external degrees of\nfreedom are neglected.

To better\nunderstand the complex interplay of different governing equations, and\ntherefore design efficient and safe operations, numerical simulations are\nwidely used. Given the relatively long time-scales of interest, fully-implicit\ntime-stepping schemes are often necessary to avoid time-step stability\nrestrictions. A major computational bottleneck for these methods, however, is\nthe linear solver. These systems are extremely large and ill-conditioned.\nBecause of the wide range of processes and couplings that may be involved--e.g.\nformation and propagation of fractures, deformation of the solid porous medium,\nviscous flow of one or more fluids in the pores and fractures, complicated well\nsources and sinks, etc.--it is difficult to develop general-purpose but\nscalable linear solver frameworks. This challenge is further aggravated by the\nrange of different discretization schemes that may be adopted, which have a\ndirect impact on the linear system structure. To address this obstacle, we\ndescribe a flexible framework based on multigrid reduction that can produce\npurely algebraic preconditioners for a wide spectrum of relevant physics and\ndiscretizations. We demonstrate its broad applicability by constructing\nscalable preconditioners for several problems, notably: a hybrid discretization\nof single-phase flow, compositional multiphase flow with complex wells, and\nhydraulic fracturing simulations. Extension to other systems can be handled\nquite naturally.

In\ncontrast to square pinning arrays, we find no sharp peaks in the critical\ncurrent due to the inherent frustration effect imposed by the Santa Fe ice\ngeometry; however, there are some smoothed peaks when the number of vortices\nmatches the number of pinning sites. For some fillings, the Santa Fe array\nexhibits stronger pinning than the square array due to the suppression of\none-dimensional flow channels when the vortex motion in the Santa Fe lattice\noccurs through the formation of both longitudinal and transverse flow channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 19:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Diffuse\noptical tomography (DOT) is one of the most powerful techniques for imaging\ndeep within tissue -- well beyond the conventional $\\sim$10-15 mean scattering\nlengths tolerated by ballistic imaging techniques such as confocal and\ntwo-photon microscopy. Unfortunately, existing DOT systems are limited,\nachieving only centimeter-scale resolution. Furthermore, they suffer from slow\nacquisition times and slow reconstruction speeds making real-time imaging\ninfeasible. We show that time-of-flight diffuse optical tomography (ToF-DOT)\nand its confocal variant (CToF-DOT), by exploiting the photon travel time\ninformation, allow us to achieve millimeter spatial resolution in the highly\nscattered diffusion regime ($> 50 $ mean free paths). In addition, we\ndemonstrate two additional innovations: focusing on confocal measurements, and\nmultiplexing the illumination sources allow us to significantly reduce the\nmeasurement acquisition time.

Such optimization problems are quite challenging, often involving\nnon-convex functions along with considerations of user preferences in balancing\ntrade-offs. Pareto solutions represent optimal frontiers for jointly optimizing\nmultiple competing objectives. A major obstacle for frequently used\nlinear-scalarization strategies is that the resulting optimization problem\nmight not always converge to a global optimum. Furthermore, such methods only\nreturn one solution point per run. A Pareto solution set is a subset of all\nsuch global optima over multiple runs for different trade-off choices.\nTherefore, a Pareto front can only be guaranteed with multiple runs of the\nlinear-scalarization problem, where all runs converge to their respective\nglobal optima. Consequently, extracting a Pareto front for practical problems\nis computationally intractable with substantial computational overheads,\nlimited scalability, and reduced accuracy. We propose a robust, low cost,\ntwo-stage, hybrid neural Pareto optimization approach that is accurate and\nscales (compute space and time) with data dimensions, as well as number of\nfunctions and constraints. The first stage (neural network) efficiently\nextracts a weak Pareto front, using Fritz-John conditions as the discriminator,\nwith no assumptions of convexity on the objectives or constraints. The second\nstage (efficient Pareto filter) extracts the strong Pareto optimal subset given\nthe weak front from stage 1.

Indeed, privacy\nprotection is one of the main issues handled in the Bluetooth standard. For\ninstance, the current standard forces devices to change the identifier they\nembed within the public and private packets, known as MAC address\nrandomization. Although randomizing MAC addresses is intended to preserve\ndevice privacy, recent literature shows many challenges that are still present.\nOne of them is the correlation between the public packets and the emitters.\nUnfortunately, existing evaluation tools such as NS-3 are not designed to\nreproduce this Bluetooth standard's essential functionality. This makes it\nimpossible to test solutions for different device-fingerprinting strategies as\nthere is a lack of ground truth for large-scale scenarios with the majority of\ncurrent BLE devices implementing MAC address randomization. In this paper, we\nfirst introduce a solution of standard-compliant MAC address randomization in\nthe NS-3 framework, capable of emulating any real BLE device in the simulation\nand generating real-world Bluetooth traces. In addition, since the simulation\nrun-time for trace-collection grows exponentially with the number of devices,\nwe introduce an optimization to linearize public-packet sniffing. This made the\nlarge-scale trace-collection practically feasible. Then, we use the generated\ntraces and associated ground truth to do a case study on the evaluation of a\ngeneric MAC address association available in the literature. Our case study\nreveals that close to 90 percent of randomized addresses could be correctly\nlinked even in highly dense and mobile scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 22:32:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 13:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

Such particles have a de Broglie\nwavelength exceeding the average inter-particle separation in a galaxy like the\nMilky Way, and are well described as classical waves. We outline the particle\nphysics motivations for them, including the QCD axion and ultra-light\naxion-like-particles such as fuzzy dark matter. The wave nature of the dark\nmatter implies a rich phenomenology: (1) Wave interference leads to order unity\ndensity fluctuations on de Broglie scale. A manifestation is vortices where the\ndensity vanishes and around which the velocity circulates. There is one vortex\nring per de Broglie volume on average. (2) For sufficiently low masses, soliton\ncondensation occurs at centers of halos. The soliton oscillates and random\nwalks, another manifestation of wave interference. The halo/subhalo abundance\nis suppressed at small masses, but the precise prediction from numerical wave\nsimulations remains to be determined. (3) For ultra-light ~$10^{-22}$ eV dark\nmatter, the wave interference substructures can be probed by tidal\nstreams/gravitational lensing. The signal can be distinguished from that due to\nsubhalos by the dependence on stream orbital radius/image separation. (4) Axion\ndetection experiments are sensitive to interference substructures for\nmoderately light masses. The stochastic nature of the waves affects the\ninterpretation of experiments and motivates the measurement of correlation\nfunctions.

Adults over the age of 50 are especially at risk and see their\nquality of life diminished because of limited mobility, which can lead to\nisolation and depression. We are developing a robust screening method capable\nof identifying individuals predisposed to hip fracture to address this clinical\nchallenge. The method uses finite element analysis and relies on segmented\ncomputed tomography (CT) images of the hip. Presently, the segmentation of the\nproximal femur requires manual input, which is a tedious task, prone to human\nerror, and severely limits the practicality of the method in a clinical\ncontext. Here we present a novel approach for segmenting the proximal femur\nthat uses a deep convolutional neural network to produce accurate, automated,\nrobust, and fast segmentations of the femur from CT scans. The network\narchitecture is based on the renowned u-net, which consists of a downsampling\npath to extract increasingly complex features of the input patch and an\nupsampling path to convert the acquired low resolution image into a high\nresolution one. Skipped connections allow us to recover critical spatial\ninformation lost during downsampling.

Based on five multi-version-project\ndefect data sets (either widely used or the most up-to-date in the literature)\ncollected by diverse approaches, we find that: (1) most versions in the\ninvestigated defect data sets contain inconsistent labels with varying degrees;\n(2) the existence of inconsistent labels in a training data set may\nconsiderably change the prediction performance of a defect prediction model as\nwell as can lead to the identification of substantially different true\ndefective modules; and (3) the importance ranking of independent variables in a\ndefect prediction model can be substantially shifted due to the existence of\ninconsistent labels. The above findings reveal that inconsistent labels in\ndefect data sets can profoundly change the prediction ability and\ninterpretation of a defect prediction model. Therefore, we strongly suggest\nthat practitioners should detect and exclude inconsistent labels in defect data\nsets to avoid their potential negative influence on defect prediction models.\nWhat is more, it is necessary for researchers to improve existing defect label\ncollection approaches to reduce inconsistent labels.

Structured kernel interpolation (SKI) is among the most\nscalable methods: by placing inducing points on a dense grid and using\nstructured matrix algebra, SKI achieves per-iteration time of O(n + m log m)\nfor approximate inference. This linear scaling in n enables inference for very\nlarge data sets; however the cost is per-iteration, which remains a limitation\nfor extremely large n.

On the other hand,\npeculiarities like the higher stability of the (6,5) CNT over its (6,4)\ncounterpart allow this study to provide a solid platform for further studies on\nthe application of these 1D nanocarbons (including true 1D linear carbon\nchains) at ambient conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 00:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

A quick numerical model prediction based on\nexternal parameters of stratified boundary layers could greatly benefit the\nunderstanding of the interaction between velocity and scalar flux at varying\nscales. For these reasons, here, we use the resolvent framework to investigate\nthe effects of an active scalar on incompressible wall-bounded turbulence. We\nobtain the state of the flow system by applying the linear resolvent operator\nto the nonlinear terms in the governing Navier-Stokes equations with the\nBoussinesq approximation. This extends the formulation to include the scalar\nadvection equation with the scalar component acting in the wall-normal\ndirection in the momentum equations. We use the mean velocity profiles from a\nDNS of a stably-stratified turbulent channel flow at varying friction\nRichardson number. The results obtained from the resolvent analysis are\ncompared to the premultiplied energy spectra, auto-correlation coefficient, and\nthe energy budget terms obtained from the DNS. It is shown that despite using\nonly a very limited range of representative scales, the resolvent model is able\nto reproduce the balance of energy budget terms as well as provide meaningful\ninsight of coherent structures occurring in the flow. Computation of the\nleading resolvent models, despite considering a limited range of scales,\nreproduces the balance of energy budget terms, provides meaningful predictions\nof coherent structures in the flow, and is more cost-effective than performing\nfull-scale simulations.

However, experimental\ninvestigations of solid-state acceleration mechanisms which offer $\\rm\nTVm^{-1}$ acceleration gradients have been hampered by several technological\nconstraints. The primary constraint has been the unavailability of attosecond\nparticle or photon sources suitable for excitation of collective modes in bulk\ncrystals. Secondly, there are significant difficulties with direct\nhigh-intensity irradiation of bulk solids, such as beam instabilities due to\ncrystal imperfections and collisions etc.\n  In this work, we model an experimentally practicable solid-state acceleration\nmechanism using collective electron oscillations in crystals that sustain\npropagating surface waves. These surface waves are driven in the wake of a\nsubmicron long particle beam in tube shaped nanostructured crystals with tube\nwall densities, $n_{\\rm tube}\\sim10^{22-24}\\rm cm^{-3}$. Particle-In-Cell (PIC)\nsimulations carried out under experimental constraints demonstrate the\npossibility of accessing average acceleration gradients of several $\\rm\nTVm^{-1}$ using the solid-state tube wakefield acceleration regime.\nFurthermore, our modeling demonstrates the possibility that as the surface\noscillations and resultantly the surface wave transitions into a nonlinear or\n\"crunch-in\" regime under $n_{\\rm beam}/n_{\\rm tube} \\gtrsim 0.05$, not only\ndoes the average gradient increase but strong transverse focusing fields extend\ndown to the tube axis. This work thus demonstrates the near-term experimental\nrealizability of Solid-State Tube Wakefield Accelerator (SOTWA).

Atmospheric superrotation,\ncharacterized by west-to-east winds over the equator, is a common phenomenon in\nthe atmospheres of Venus, Titan, Saturn, Jupiter, and tidally locked\nexoplanets. The stratospheric atmosphere of Earth is also superrotating during\nthe westerly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). However, whether\nthe same phenomenon can occur in ocean is poorly known. Through numerical\nsimulations, here we show that oceanic superrotation does occur on tidally\nlocked terrestrial planets around low-mass stars. Its formation (spun-up from\nrest) is associated with surface winds, the equatorward momentum convergence by\nRossby waves, and the eastward propagation of Kelvin waves in the ocean. Its\nmaintenance is driven by equatorward momentum transports of coupled\nRossby-Kelvin waves in the ocean excited from the uneven stellar radiation\ndistribution. The width of the superrotation is mainly constrained by the\nRossby deformation radius in the ocean, while its strength is more complex.\nMany factors can influence the strength, including planetary rotation rate,\nstellar flux, greenhouse gas concentration, seawater salinity, bottom drag, and\na scaling theory is lack. This work confirms that superrotation can occur on\ntidally locked terrestrial planets with seawater oceans and suggests that it\nmay also occur on tidally locked hot planets with magma oceans that will\npossibly be observed in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 02:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

To enable robust and\nprivate mobile sensing, DNN tends to be deployed locally on the\nresource-constrained mobile devices via model compression. The current practice\neither hand-crafted DNN compression techniques, i.e., for optimizing\nDNN-relative performance (e.g., parameter size), or on-demand DNN compression\nmethods, i.e., for optimizing hardware-dependent metrics (e.g., latency),\ncannot be locally online because they require offline retraining to ensure\naccuracy.

However, to achieve this, contemporary NMNs need\nstrong supervision in executing the query as a specialized program over\nreasoning modules and fail to generalize to more open-ended settings without\nsuch supervision. Hence we propose Weakly-Supervised Neuro-Symbolic Module\nNetwork (WNSMN) trained with answers as the sole supervision for numerical\nreasoning based MRC. It learns to execute a noisy heuristic program obtained\nfrom the dependency parsing of the query, as discrete actions over both neural\nand symbolic reasoning modules and trains it end-to-end in a reinforcement\nlearning framework with discrete reward from answer matching. On the\nnumerical-answer subset of DROP, WNSMN out-performs NMN by 32% and the\nreasoning-free language model GenBERT by 8% in exact match accuracy when\ntrained under comparable weak supervised settings. This showcases the\neffectiveness and generalizability of modular networks that can handle explicit\ndiscrete reasoning over noisy programs in an end-to-end manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 03:36:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

A two-dimensional numerical study was\nperformed on VIV of a circular cylinder inside a parallel plate channel of\nheight H at Reynolds number 150 to quantify the improvement. The cylinder is\nelastically mounted with a spring such that it is only free to vibrate in the\ndirection transverse to the channel flow and has a fixed mass ratio (m*) of 10.\nThe energy extraction process is modelled as a damper, with spatially constant\ndamping ration ((), attached to the cylinder. The simulations are performed by\nvarying the reduced velocity for a set of fixed mass-damping ({\\alpha} = m*()\nvalues ranging between 0 to 1. The blockage ratio (b = D/H) is varied from 0.25\nto 0.5 by changing the channel height. The quasi-periodic initial branch found\nfor the unconfined cylinder shrinks with the increasing blockage. The extracted\npower is found to increase rapidly with the blockage. For maximum blockage (b =\n0.2), the maximum flow power extracted by the cylinder is an order of magnitude\nlarger as compared to what it would extract in an open domain with free stream\nvelocity equal to the channel mean velocity. The optimal mass-damping\n({\\alpha}c ) for extracting maximum power is found to lie between 0.2 to 0.3.\nAn expression is derived to predict the maximum extracted power from the\nundamped response of a confined/unconfined cylinder. With the assumption\n{\\alpha}c = 0.25, the derived expression can predict the maximum power\nextraction within +-20% of the actual values obtained from present and previous\nnumerical and experimental studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 03:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

One way to reduce the computational effort of simulating\nepidemics on these networks is sparsification, where we select a representative\nsubset of edges based on some measure of their importance. Recently an approach\nwas proposed using an algorithm based on the effective resistance of the edges.\nWe explore how effective resistance is correlated with the probability that an\nedge transmits disease in the SI model. We find that in some cases these two\nnotions of edge importance are well correlated, making effective resistance a\ncomputationally efficient proxy for the importance of an edge to epidemic\nspread. In other cases, the correlation is weaker, and we discuss situations in\nwhich effective resistance is not a good proxy for epidemic importance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 05:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

This can be done using a combination of\ncryptographic and machine learning tools such as Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNN).

Each of these\ntypes can be implemented efficiently using a different cryptographic tool. But\nthese tools require different representations and switching between them is\ntime-consuming and expensive. Recent research suggests that ReLU is responsible\nfor most of the communication bandwidth. ReLU is usually applied at each pixel\n(or activation) location, which is quite expensive. We propose to share ReLU\noperations. Specifically, the ReLU decision of one activation can be used by\nothers, and we explore different ways to group activations and different ways\nto determine the ReLU for such a group of activations. Experiments on several\ndatasets reveal that we can cut the number of ReLU operations by up to three\norders of magnitude and, as a result, cut the communication bandwidth by more\nthan 50%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 06:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

Instead of mining honestly, pools can be\nincentivized to infiltrate their own miners into other pools. These\ninfiltrators report partial solutions but withhold full solutions, share block\nrewards but make no contribution to block mining. The block withholding attack\namong mining pools can be modeled as a non-cooperative game called \"the miner's\ndilemm\", which reduces effective mining power in the system and leads to\npotential systemic instability in the blockchain. However, existing literature\non the game-theoretic properties of this attack only gives a preliminary\nanalysis, e.g., an upper bound of 3 for the pure price of anarchy (PPoA) in\nthis game, with two pools involved and no miner betraying. Pure price of\nanarchy is a measurement of how much mining power is wasted in the miner's\ndilemma game. Further tightening its upper bound will bring us more insight\ninto the structure of this game, so as to design mechanisms to reduce the\nsystemic loss caused by mutual attacks. In this paper, we give a tight bound of\n(1, 2] for the pure price of anarchy. Moreover, we show the tight bound holds\nin a more general setting, in which infiltrators may betray.We also prove the\nexistence and uniqueness of pure Nash equilibrium in this setting.

Here, we\ndetermine the intrinsic and air-aged mechanical properties of mono-, bi-, and\ntrilayer (1-3L) WS$_2$, WSe$_2$ and WTe$_2$ using a complementary suite of\nexperiments and theoretical calculations. High-quality 1L WS$_2$ has the\nhighest Young's modulus (302.4+-24.1 GPa) and strength (47.0+-8.6 GPa) of the\nentire family, overpassing those of 1L WSe$_2$ (258.6+-38.3 and 38.0+-6.0 GPa,\nrespectively) and WTe$_2$ (149.1+-9.4 and 6.4+-3.3 GPa, respectively). However,\nthe elasticity and strength of WS$_2$ decrease most dramatically with increased\nthickness among the three materials. We interpret the phenomenon by the\ndifferent tendencies for interlayer sliding in equilibrium state and under\nin-plane strain and out-of-plane compression conditions in the indentation\nprocess, revealed by finite element method (FEM) and density functional theory\n(DFT) calculations including van der Waals (vdW) interactions. We also\ndemonstrate that the mechanical properties of the high-quality 1-3L WS$_2$ and\nWSe$_2$ are largely stable in the air for up to 20 weeks. Intriguingly, the\n1-3L WSe$_2$ shows increased modulus and strength values with aging in the air.\nThis is ascribed to oxygen doping, which reinforces the structure. The present\nstudy will facilitate the design and use of 2D tungsten dichalcogenides in\napplications, such as strain engineering and flexible field-effect transistors\n(FETs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections),\nincluding the version originally designed by Google (GQUIC) and the version\nstandardized by IETF (IQUIC), as alternatives to the traditional HTTP,\ndemonstrate their unique transmission characteristics: based on UDP for\nencrypted resource transmitting, accelerating web page rendering. However,\nexisting encrypted transmission schemes based on TCP are vulnerable to website\nfingerprinting (WFP) attacks, allowing adversaries to infer the users' visited\nwebsites by eavesdropping on the transmission channel. Whether GQUIC and IQUIC\ncan effectively resist such attacks is worth investigating. In this paper, we\nstudy the vulnerabilities of GQUIC, IQUIC, and HTTPS to WFP attacks from the\nperspective of traffic analysis. Extensive experiments show that, in the early\ntraffic scenario, GQUIC is the most vulnerable to WFP attacks among GQUIC,\nIQUIC, and HTTPS, while IQUIC is more vulnerable than HTTPS, but the\nvulnerability of the three protocols is similar in the normal full traffic\nscenario. Features transferring analysis shows that most features are\ntransferable between protocols when on normal full traffic scenario. However,\ncombining with the qualitative analysis of latent feature representation, we\nfind that the transferring is inefficient when on early traffic, as GQUIC,\nIQUIC, and HTTPS show the significantly different magnitude of variation in the\ntraffic distribution on early traffic. By upgrading the one-time WFP attacks to\nmultiple WFP Top-a attacks, we find that the attack accuracy on GQUIC and IQUIC\nreach 95.4% and 95.5%, respectively, with only 40 packets and just using simple\nfeatures, whereas reach only 60.7% when on HTTPS. We also demonstrate that the\nvulnerability of IQUIC is only slightly dependent on the network environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:53:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 14:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

Text book derivations\noften follow paths similar to Einstein's, or the analysis of the kinematics of\nparticle collisions interpreted from the perspective of different inertial\nframes. All the same, in such derivations the direct dynamical link with\nhypothetical fundamental fields describing matter (e.g. Maxwell theory or\nother) is overshadowed by the use of powerful symmetry arguments, kinematics,\nand the relativity principle.\n  Here we show that the formula can be derived directly form the dynamical\nequations of a massless matter model confined in a box (which can be thought of\nas a toy model of a composite particle). The only assumptions in the derivation\nare that the field equations hold and the energy-momentum tensor admits a\nuniversal interpretation in arbitrary coordinate systems. The mass-energy\nequivalence relation follows from the inertia or (taking the equivalence\nprinciple for granted) weight of confined field radiation.

Here, on a pulsed laser deposited (PLD) MoS2\nthin film, a layer of TiO2 is grown by using both atomic layer deposition (ALD)\nand PLD. These two different techniques emanate TiO2 layers with different\ncrystalline properties, thicknesses and interfacial morphologies, subsequently\ninfluencing the electronic and optical properties of the interfaces.

Density functional analysis of the\nMoS2/Anatase-TiO2 interfaces, for pristine and in presence of a wide range of\ninterfacial defects, could explain the interdependence of doping and the\nterminating atomic-surface of TiO2 on MoS2.

Their settings rule the trajectory\nof the particle when pulled by these two attractors. Different speeds and forms\nof convergence of a particle towards its attractor(s) take place for different\nsettings of the coefficients.

Most auctions are ex-post nondifferentiable, so\ngradients may be unavailable or misleading, and we rely on suitable\npseudogradient estimates instead. Although it is well-known that gradient\ndynamics cannot guarantee convergence to NE in general, we observe fast and\nrobust convergence to approximate BNE in a wide variety of auctions and present\na sufficient condition for convergence\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 11:53:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2021 11:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

The computation is performed as post-processing of the experimental data\nvia proximity measure between particles in frames of reference. However, the\npost-processing step becomes problematic as the motility and density of the\nparticles increases, since the data emerges in extreme rates and volumes.\nMoreover, existing algorithms for PIV either provide sparse estimations of the\nflow or require large computational time frame preventing from on-line use. The\ngoal of this manuscript is therefore to develop an accurate on-line algorithm\nfor estimation of the fine-grained velocity field from PIV data. As the data\nconstitutes a pair of images, we employ computer vision methods to solve the\nproblem. In this work, we introduce a convolutional neural network adapted to\nthe problem, namely Volumetric Correspondence Network (VCN) which was recently\nproposed for the end-to-end optical flow estimation in computer vision. The\nnetwork is thoroughly trained and tested on a dataset containing both synthetic\nand real flow data.

If different agent behaviour is\nrequired in the future, an agent trained in this way must normally be either\nfully or partially retrained, wasting valuable time and resources. In this\nstudy, we leverage multi-objective reinforcement learning to create tunable\nagents, i.e. agents that can adopt a range of different behaviours according to\nthe designer's preferences, without the need for retraining. We apply this\ntechnique to sequential social dilemmas, settings where there is inherent\ntension between individual and collective rationality. Learning a single fixed\npolicy in such settings leaves one at a significant disadvantage if the\nopponents' strategies change after learning is complete. In our work, we\ndemonstrate empirically that the tunable agents framework allows easy adaption\nbetween cooperative and competitive behaviours in sequential social dilemmas\nwithout the need for retraining, allowing a single trained agent model to be\nadjusted to cater for a wide range of behaviours and opponent strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 12:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

The ViT model splits each image into a sequence of tokens with\nfixed length and then applies multiple Transformer layers to model their global\nrelation for classification. However, ViT achieves inferior performance to CNNs\nwhen trained from scratch on a midsize dataset like ImageNet. We find it is\nbecause: 1) the simple tokenization of input images fails to model the\nimportant local structure such as edges and lines among neighboring pixels,\nleading to low training sample efficiency; 2) the redundant attention backbone\ndesign of ViT leads to limited feature richness for fixed computation budgets\nand limited training samples. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new\nTokens-To-Token Vision Transformer (T2T-ViT), which incorporates 1) a\nlayer-wise Tokens-to-Token (T2T) transformation to progressively structurize\nthe image to tokens by recursively aggregating neighboring Tokens into one\nToken (Tokens-to-Token), such that local structure represented by surrounding\ntokens can be modeled and tokens length can be reduced; 2) an efficient\nbackbone with a deep-narrow structure for vision transformer motivated by CNN\narchitecture design after empirical study. Notably, T2T-ViT reduces the\nparameter count and MACs of vanilla ViT by half, while achieving more than\n3.0\\% improvement when trained from scratch on ImageNet. It also outperforms\nResNets and achieves comparable performance with MobileNets by directly\ntraining on ImageNet.

Covering the toilet reduced aerosol levels but did not eliminate them\ncompletely, suggesting that aerosolized droplets escaped through small gaps\nbetween the cover and the seat. In addition to consistent increases in aerosol\nlevels immediately after flushing, there was a notable rise in ambient aerosol\nlevels due to the accumulation of droplets from multiple flushes conducted\nduring the tests.

We\nintroduce a framework for learning and planning in MDPs where the\ndecision-maker commits actions that are executed with a delay of $m$ steps. The\nbrute-force state augmentation baseline where the state is concatenated to the\nlast $m$ committed actions suffers from an exponential complexity in $m$, as we\nshow for policy iteration.

In the last decades,\nadvanced models for representing fluid-elastic coupling have therefore been\ndeveloped by the community of the domain. Those models are nowadays embedded in\nthe methodologies that are used on a regular basis by both steam generators\nproviders and operators, in order to prevent the risk of a tube failure with\nadequate safety margins. From an R&D point of view however, the need still\nremains for more advanced models of fluid-elastic coupling, in order to fully\ndecipher the physics underlying the observed phenomena. As a consequence, new\nexperimental flow-coupling coefficients are also required to specifically feed\nand validate those more sophisticated models. Recent experiments performed at\nCEA-Saclay suggest that the fluid stiffness and damping coefficients depend on\nfurther dimensionless parameters beyond the reduced velocity.\n  In this work, the problem of data reduction is first revisited, in the light\nof dimensional analysis. For single-phase flows, it is underlined that the\nflow-coupling coefficients depend at least on two dimensionless parameters,\nnamely the Reynolds number $Re$ and the Stokes number $Sk$. Therefore, reducing\nthe experimental data in terms of the compound dimensionless quantity\n$V_r=Re/Sk$ necessarily leads to impoverish results, hence the data dispersion.\nIn a second step, experimental data are presented using the dimensionless\nnumbers $Re$ and $Sk$. We report experiments, for a 3x5 square tube bundle\nsubjected to water transverse flow. The bundle is rigid, except for the central\ntube which is mounted on a flexible suspension allowing for translation motions\nin the lift direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 14:37:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

For this purpose, we created new variants of malware using\nReinforcement Learning, which will be misclassified as benign by the existing\nAndroid malware detection models. We propose two novel attack strategies,\nnamely single policy attack and multiple policy attack using reinforcement\nlearning for white-box and grey-box scenario respectively. Putting ourselves in\nthe adversary's shoes, we designed adversarial attacks on the detection models\nwith the goal of maximizing fooling rate, while making minimum modifications to\nthe Android application and ensuring that the app's functionality and behavior\ndo not change. We achieved an average fooling rate of 44.21% and 53.20% across\nall the eight detection models with a maximum of five modifications using a\nsingle policy attack and multiple policy attack, respectively. The highest\nfooling rate of 86.09% with five changes was attained against the decision\ntree-based model using the multiple policy approach. Finally, we propose an\nadversarial defense strategy that reduces the average fooling rate by threefold\nto 15.22% against a single policy attack, thereby increasing the robustness of\nthe detection models i.e. the proposed model can effectively detect variants\n(metamorphic) of malware.

The use\nof entangled sensors in quantum metrology improves the precision limit from the\nstandard quantum limit (SQL) to the Heisenberg limit (HL). To date, most\nexperiments beating the SQL are performed on the sensors which are well\nisolated under extreme conditions. However, it has not been realized in\nsolid-state spin systems at ambient conditions, owing to its intrinsic\ncomplexity for the preparation and survival of pure and entangled quantum\nstates. Here we show a full interferometer sequence beating the SQL by\nemploying a hybrid multi-spin system, namely the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect\nin diamond. The interferometer sequence starts from a deterministic and joint\ninitialization, undergoes entanglement and disentanglement of multiple spins,\nand ends up with projective measurement. In particular, the deterministic and\njoint initialization of NV negative state, NV electron spin, and two nuclear\nspins is realized at room temperature for the first time. By means of optimal\ncontrol, non-local gates are implemented with an estimated fidelity above the\nthreshold for fault-tolerant quantum computation. With these techniques\ncombined, we achieve two-spin interference with a phase sensitivity of 1.79 \\pm\n0.06 dB beyond the SQL and three-spin 2.77 \\pm 0.10 dB.

Video prediction methods based on\nvariational auto-encoders (VAEs) have been a great success, but they require\nthe training data to contain multiple possible futures for an observed video\nsequence. This is hard to be fulfilled when videos are captured in the wild\nwhere any given observation only has a determinate future. As a result,\ntraining a vanilla VAE model with these videos inevitably causes posterior\ncollapse. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel VAE structure, dabbed\nVAE-in-VAE or VAE$^2$. The key idea is to explicitly introduce stochasticity\ninto the VAE. We treat part of the observed video sequence as a random\ntransition state that bridges its past and future, and maximize the likelihood\nof a Markov Chain over the video sequence under all possible transition states.\nA tractable lower bound is proposed for this intractable objective function and\nan end-to-end optimization algorithm is designed accordingly. VAE$^2$ can\nmitigate the posterior collapse problem to a large extent, as it breaks the\ndirect dependence between future and observation and does not directly regress\nthe determinate future provided by the training data. We carry out experiments\non a large-scale dataset called Cityscapes, which contains videos collected\nfrom a number of urban cities. Results show that VAE$^2$ is capable of\npredicting diverse futures and is more resistant to posterior collapse than the\nother state-of-the-art VAE-based approaches. We believe that VAE$^2$ is also\napplicable to other stochastic sequence prediction problems where training data\nare lack of stochasticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

Following prior work, we study systems enduring a loss of control\nauthority over some of their actuators. Such a malfunction results in actuators\nproducing possibly undesirable inputs over which the controller has real-time\nreadings but no control. By definition, a system is resilient if it can still\nreach a target after a loss of control authority. However, after a malfunction\na resilient system might be significantly slower to reach a target compared to\nits initial capabilities. We quantify this loss of performance through the new\nconcept of quantitative resilience. We define this metric as the maximal ratio\nof the minimal times required to reach any target for the initial and\nmalfunctioning systems. Na\\\"ive computation of quantitative resilience directly\nfrom the definition is a time-consuming task as it requires solving four\nnested, possibly nonlinear, optimization problems. The main technical\ncontribution of this work is to provide an efficient method to compute\nquantitative resilience. Relying on control theory and on three novel geometric\nresults we reduce the computation of quantitative resilience to a single linear\noptimization problem. We illustrate our method on two numerical examples: an\nopinion dynamics scenario and a trajectory controller for low-thrust\nspacecrafts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:33:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 00:19:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 18:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

In this paper, in order to adjust for autocorrelated errors, we\npropose to learn the autocorrelation coefficient jointly with the model\nparameters.

While online posting proves very convenient for individual users, it\nalso fosters fast-spreading of various rumors. The rapid and wide percolation\nof rumors can cause persistent adverse or detrimental impacts. Therefore,\nresearchers invest great efforts on reducing the negative impacts of rumors.\nTowards this end, the rumor classification system aims to detect, track, and\nverify rumors in social media. Such systems typically include four components:\n(i) a rumor detector, (ii) a rumor tracker, (iii) a stance classifier, and (iv)\na veracity classifier. In order to improve the state-of-the-art in rumor\ndetection, tracking, and verification, we propose VRoC, a tweet-level\nvariational autoencoder-based rumor classification system. VRoC consists of a\nco-train engine that trains variational autoencoders (VAEs) and rumor\nclassification components. The co-train engine helps the VAEs to tune their\nlatent representations to be classifier-friendly. We also show that VRoC is\nable to classify unseen rumors with high levels of accuracy. For the PHEME\ndataset, VRoC consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques, on\nboth observed and unobserved rumors, by up to 26.9%, in terms of macro-F1\nscores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 03:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

Analytic solutions\nto the system and analytic characterization through governing equations provide\ninsights into the behaviors of DAEs as well as the parametric regions of\noperation for each potential behavior. For each system (DAEs), and choice of\ndependent variable, there is a corresponding governing equation which is\nunivariate ODE or PDE that is typically higher order than the constitutive\nequations of the system. We first introduce a direct formulation for\nrepresenting systems of linear DAEs.

Using\nthis formulation for the system of constitutive equations (DAEs), we develop\nmethods for deriving analytic expressions for the full solution (complementary\nand particular) for all dependent variables of systems that consist of constant\ncoefficient ordinary-DAEs and special cases of partial-DAEs.
