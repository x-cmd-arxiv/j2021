Learning the parameters\nof a kinematic model can be achieved by observing the position of the robot\nlinks during prospective motions and minimising the prediction errors. This\nwork proposes a movement efficient approach for estimating online the\nbody-schema of a humanoid robot arm in the form of Denavit-Hartenberg (DH)\nparameters. A cost-sensitive active learning approach based on the A-Optimality\ncriterion is used to select optimal joint configurations. The chosen joint\nconfigurations simultaneously minimise the error in the estimation of the body\nschema and minimise the movement between samples. This reduces energy\nconsumption, along with mechanical fatigue and wear, while not compromising the\nlearning accuracy. The work was implemented in a simulation environment, using\nthe 7DoF arm of the iCub robot simulator. The hand pose is measured with a\nsingle camera via markers placed in the palm and back of the robot's hand. A\nnon-parametric occlusion model is proposed to avoid choosing joint\nconfigurations where the markers are not visible, thus preventing worthless\nattempts. The results show cost-sensitive active learning has similar accuracy\nto the standard active learning approach, while reducing in about half the\nexecuted movement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 16:01:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 12:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

One\nmodeling approach to study such problems is constrained Markov decision process\n(CMDP). When solving the CMDP to derive good operational policies, there are\ntwo key challenges: one is the prohibitively large state space and action\nspace; the other is the hard-to-compute transition kernel. In this work, we\ndevelop a sampling-based primal-dual algorithm to solve CMDPs. Our approach\nalternatively applies regularized policy iteration to improve the policy and\nsubgradient ascent to maintain the constraints. Under mild regularity\nconditions, we show that the algorithm converges at rate $\nO(\\log(T)/\\sqrt{T})$, where T is the number of iterations. When the CMDP has a\nweakly coupled structure, our approach can substantially reduce the dimension\nof the problem through an embedded decomposition. We apply the algorithm to two\nimportant applications with weakly coupled structures: multi-product inventory\nmanagement and multi-class queue scheduling, and show that it generates\ncontrols that outperform state-of-art heuristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 16:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

In this paper, we study the $r$-NN problem in the light of individual\nfairness and providing equal opportunities: all points that are within distance\n$r$ from the query should have the same probability to be returned. In the\nlow-dimensional case, this problem was first studied by Hu, Qiao, and Tao (PODS\n2014).

Thus, there is a critical need for a trust system to reduce the\nrisk of dealing with fraudulent counterparts in a blockchain network. These\nreasons motivate us to develop a fully decentralised trust framework deployed\non top of a blockchain platform, operating along with DApps in the marketplace\nto demoralise deceptive entities while encouraging trustworthy ones. The trust\nsystem works as an underlying decentralised service providing a feedback\nmechanism for end-users and maintaining trust relationships among them in the\necosystem accordingly.

In mathematical\nmodelling, the impact of environmental elements and the interaction between\nspecies is read into the role of heterogeneity in equations and interactions in\ncoupled systems. In this direction, we investigate three separate problems,\neach corresponding to a chapter of this thesis. The first problem addresses the\nevolution of a single population living in a periodic medium with a fast\ndiffusion line; this corresponds to the study of a reaction-diffusion system\nwith equations in different dimensions. We derive results on asymptotic\nbehaviour through the study of some generalised principal eigenvalues. We find\nthat the road has no impact on the survival chances of the population, despite\nthe deleterious effect expected from fragmentation. The second investigation\nregards a model describing the competition between two populations in a\nsituation of asymmetrically aggressive interactions; this consists of a system\nof two ODEs. The evolution progresses through two possible scenarios, where\nonly one population survives. Then, the interpretation of one of the parameters\nas the aggressiveness of the attacker population naturally raises questions of\ncontrollability. We characterise the set of initial conditions leading to the\nvictory of the attacker through a suitable (possibly time-dependant) strategy.\nThe third and last part of this thesis analyses the time decay of some\nevolution equations with classical and fractional time derivatives.

To do so, a multitude of model-agnostic, nonparametric\nmeta-learners have been proposed in recent years. Such learners decompose the\ntreatment effect estimation problem into separate sub-problems, each solvable\nusing standard supervised learning methods. Choosing between different\nmeta-learners in a data-driven manner is difficult, as it requires access to\ncounterfactual information. Therefore, with the ultimate goal of building\nbetter understanding of the conditions under which some learners can be\nexpected to perform better than others a priori, we theoretically analyze four\nbroad meta-learning strategies which rely on plug-in estimation and\npseudo-outcome regression. We highlight how this theoretical reasoning can be\nused to guide principled algorithm design and translate our analyses into\npractice by considering a variety of neural network architectures as\nbase-learners for the discussed meta-learning strategies. In a simulation\nstudy, we showcase the relative strengths of the learners under different\ndata-generating processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 17:11:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 13:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

However,\nevaluating nonorthogonal matrix elements is conceptually and computationally\nharder then their orthogonal counterparts. While several different approaches\nhave been developed, these are predominantly derived from the first-quantised\ngeneralised Slater-Condon rules and usually require biorthogonal occupied\norbitals to be computed for each matrix element. For coupling terms between\nnonorthogonal excited configurations, a second-quantised approach such as the\nnonorthogonal Wick's theorem is more desirable, but this fails when the two\nreference determinants have a zero many-body overlap. In this contribution, we\nderive an entirely generalised extension to the nonorthogonal Wick's theorem\nthat is applicable to all pairs of determinants with nonorthogonal orbitals.\nOur approach creates a universal methodology for evaluating any nonorthogonal\nmatrix element and allows Wick's theorem and the generalised Slater-Condon\nrules to be unified for the first time. Furthermore, we present a simple\nwell-defined protocol for deriving arbitrary coupling terms between\nnonorthogonal excited configurations.

The design problem\naims at finding a network design for the fixed routes to allow a set of riders\nto travel from their origins to their destinations, while minimizing the sum of\nthe travel costs, the bus operating costs, and rider travel times. The paper\naddresses two gaps in existing tools for designing ODMTS. First, it generalizes\nprior work by including ridesharing in the shuttle rides. Second, it proposes\nnovel fleet-sizing algorithms for determining the number of shuttles needed to\nmeet the performance metrics of the ODMTS design. Both contributions are based\non Mixed-Integer Programs (MIP). For the ODMTS design, the MIP reasons about\npickup and dropoff routes in order to capture ridesharing, grouping riders who\ntravel to/from the same hub. The fleet-sizing optimization is modeled as a\nminimum flow problem with covering constraints. The natural formulation leads\nto a dense graph and computational issues, which is addressed by a\nreformulation that works on a sparse graph. The methodological contributions\nare evaluated on a real case study: the public transit system of the broader\nAnn Arbor and Ypsilanti region in Michigan. The results demonstrate the\nsubstantial potential of ridesharing for ODMTS, as costs are reduced by about\n26% with respect to allowing only individual shuttle rides, at the expense of a\nminimal increase in transit times. Compared to the existing system, the\ndesigned ODMTS also cuts down costs by 35% and reduces transit times by 38%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 18:13:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 01:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

The goal of this\ncontribution is twofold: on one hand, it seeks to reproduce the results of\nprevious experimental reports and, on the other, it aims to determine the\neffects of different temporal correlations -- introduced as a controllable\ntime-delay between the photons to be absorbed -- on the strength of the ETPA\nsignal. In our experiment, the samples are excited by entangled pairs produced\nby type-I SPDC, with a spectral distribution centered at 810 nm. Surprisingly,\nand contrary to what was expected, the time delay did not produce in our\nexperiments any systematic change in the cross-sections when monitoring the\nETPA signal using a transmission measurement scheme. As a plausible cause of\nthis unexpected result, we argue that the photon-pair flux, typically-used in\nthese experiments, is not sufficient to promote the two-photon absorption\nprocess in these molecules.

Through comparisons of the model ability\nto extrapolate to longer simulation timescales and different chemical\ncompositions than the ones used for parameterization, it is demonstrated that\nkinetic models employing atomic features retain the same level of accuracy and\ntransferability as the use of features based on molecular species, while being\nmore compact and parametrized with less data.

In some\nsystems, the measurement of the time-delay is complicated by the fact that the\ndelayed components are unresolved and that the light curves are generated from\na red-noise process. We derive the likelihood function of the observations\ngiven a model of either a combination of time-delayed light curves or a single\nlight curve. This likelihood function is different from the auto-correlation\nfunction. We demonstrate that given a single-band light curve that is a\ncombination of two (or more) time-shifted copies of an original light curve,\ngenerated from a red-noise probability distribution, we can test if the\ntotal-flux light curve is a composition of time-delayed copies or,\nalternatively, is consistent with being the original light curve. Furthermorew,\nin some realistic cases, it is possible to measure the time delays and flux\nratios between these unresolved components even when the flux ratio is about\n1/10. This method is useful for identifying lensed quasars and simultaneously\nmeasuring their time delays, and for estimating the reverberation time scales\nof active galactic nuclei. In a companion paper, we derive a method that uses\nthe center-of-light position (e.g., of a lensed quasar) along with the combined\nflux. This allow us to identify lensed quasars and supernovae and measure their\ntime delays, with higher fidelity compared to the flux-only method. The\nastrometry + flux method, however, is not suitable for quasar reverberation\nmapping. We also comment on the commonly used method of fitting a power-law\nmodel to a power spectrum, and present the proper likelihood function for such\na fit. We test the new method on simulations and provide Python and MATLAB\nimplementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Despite of the success of symplectic\nintegrators for smooth mechanical systems, their construction for the\ndiscontinuous ones is nontrivial, and numerical convergence order can be\nimpaired too. Several rather-usable numerical methods are proposed, including:\na first-order symplectic integrator for general problems, a third-order\nsymplectic integrator for problems with only one linear interface, arbitrarily\nhigh-order reversible integrators for general problems (no longer symplectic),\nand an adaptive time-stepping version of the previous high-order method.\nInterestingly, whether symplecticity leads to favorable long time performance\nis no longer clear due to discontinuity, as traditional Hamiltonian backward\nerror analysis does not apply any more. Therefore, at this stage, our\nrecommended default method is the last one. Various numerical evidence, on the\norder of convergence, long time performance, momentum map conservation, and\nconsistency with the computationally-expensive penalty method, are supplied.

In particular, Higgs Portal Dark Matter (HPDM) features\na scalar coupling to the Higgs via a quartic interaction, and obtaining the\nmeasured relic density via thermal freeze-out gives definite direct detection\npredictions which are now almost entirely excluded. The Twin Higgs solves the\nlittle hierarchy problem without coloured top partners by introducing a twin\nsector related to the Standard Model (SM) by a discrete symmetry. We generalize\nHPDM to arbitrary Twin Higgs models and introduce Twin Higgs Portal Dark Matter\n(THPDM), which features a DM candidate with an $SU(4)$-invariant quartic\ncoupling to the Twin Higgs scalar sector. Given the size of quadratic\ncorrections to the DM mass, its most motivated scale is near the mass of the\nradial mode. In that case, DM annihilation proceeds with the full Twin Higgs\nportal coupling, while direct detection is suppressed by the pNGB nature of the\n125 GeV Higgs. For a standard cosmological history, this results in a predicted\ndirect detection signal for THPDM that is orders of magnitude below that of\nHPDM with very little dependence on the precise details of the twin sector,\nevading current bounds but predicting possible signals at next generation\nexperiments. In many Twin Higgs models, twin radiation contributions to $\\Delta\nN_\\mathrm{eff}$ are suppressed by an asymmetric reheating mechanism. We study\nthis by extending the $\\nu$MTH and $X$MTH models to include THPDM and compute\nthe viable parameter space according to the latest CMB bounds. The injected\nentropy dilutes the DM abundance as well, resulting in additional suppression\nof direct detection below the neutrino floor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 19:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 16:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

LHC searches tend to be highly dependent on the mass of the SU(2)\ncharged partner state, and are effective for very large or very tiny mass\nsplitting between it and the neutral dark matter component. Direct searches are\nvery effective at bounding the Higgs portal coupling, but ineffective once it\nfalls below $\\lambda_{\\text{eff}} \\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Indirect searches suffer\nfrom large astrophysical uncertainties due to the backgrounds and $J$-factors,\nbut do provide key information for $\\sim$ 100 GeV to TeV masses. Synthesizing\nthe allowed parameter space, this example of WIMP dark matter remains viable,\nbut only in miracle-less regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 19:01:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 20:20:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-17"}

The\nparadox is as follows: contrary to expectations, the group velocity of the\nwaves is the same in the comoving and laboratory frames of reference. The\ncondition for the appearance of the paradox is the quadratic dependence of the\nfrequency on the wave number. A paradoxical property manifests itself in the\ntheory of the propagation of radio waves (in particular, whistling\natmospherics), Langmuir waves and Alfv\\'en waves.

The traditional form of the Neupert effect refers to the\ncorrelation between the time-integrated HXR or microwave light curve and the\nSXR light curve. In this paper, instead, we use as the proxy for heating energy\nthe ultraviolet (UV) emission at the foot-points of flare loops, and modify the\nmodel of the Neupert effect by taking into account the discrete nature of flare\nheating as well as cooling. In the modified empirical model, spatially resolved\nUV lightcurves from the transition region or upper chromosphere are each\nconvolved with a kernel function characterizing the decay of the flare loop\nemission. Contributions by all loops are summed to compare with the observed\ntotal SXR emission. The model has successfully reproduced the observed SXR\nemission from its rise to decay. To estimate heating energies in flare loops,\nwe also employ the UV Foot-point Calorimeter (UFC) method that infers heating\nrates in flare loops from these UV light curves and models evolution of flare\nloops with a zero-dimensional hydrodynamic code. The experiments show that a\nmultitude of impulsive heating events do not well reproduce the observed flare\nSXR light curve, but a two-phase heating model leads to better agreement with\nobservations. Comparison of the two models of the Neupert effect further allows\nus to calibrate the UFC method, and improve the estimate of heating rates in\nflare loops continuously formed by magnetic reconnection throughout the flare\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 20:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

In so doing, we consider\na nonfluctuating target embedded in complex white Gaussian noise (CWGN), in\nwhich the amplitude of the target echo and the noise power are assumed to be\nunknown. Important works have analyzed the performance for the referred\nscenario and proposed GLRT-based detectors. Such detectors are projected at an\nearly stage (i.e., prior to the formation of a post-beamforming scalar\nwaveform), thereby imposing high demands on hardware, processing, and data\nstorage. From a hardware perspective, most radar systems fail to meet these\nstrong requirements. In fact, due to hardware and computational constraints,\nmost radars use a combination of analog and digital beamformers (sums) before\nany estimation or further pre-processing. The rationale behind this study is to\nderive a GLRT detector that meets the hardware and system requirements. In this\nwork, we design and analyze a more practical and easy-to-implement GLRT\ndetector, which is projected after the analog beamforming. The performance of\nthe proposed detector is analyzed and the probabilities of detection (PD) and\nfalse alarm (PFA) are derived in closed form. Moreover, we show that in the low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, the post-beamforming GLRT detector performs\nbetter than both the classic pre-beamforming GLRT detector and the square-law\ndetector. This finding suggests that if the signals are weak, instead of\nprocessing the signals separately, we first must to reinforce the overall\nsignal and then assembling the system's detection statistic. At last, the SNR\nlosses are quantified, in which the superiority of the post-beamforming GLRT\ndetector was evidenced as the number of antennas and samples increase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 20:42:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 23:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-12"}

The massive amount of pixels in digitized whole\nslide images were never utilized to their fullest extent due to technological\nconstraints on data processing, forcing decoupled learning. EPIC-Survival\nbridges encoding and aggregation into an end-to-end survival modelling\napproach, while introducing stratification boosting to encourage the model to\nnot only optimize ranking, but also to discriminate between risk groups. In\nthis study we show that EPIC-Survival performs better than other approaches in\nmodelling intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a historically difficult cancer to\nmodel. Further, we show that stratification boosting improves further improves\nmodel performance, resulting in a concordance-index of 0.880 on a held-out test\nset. Finally, we were able to identify specific histologic differences, not\ncommonly sought out in ICC, between low and high risk groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 21:11:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 21:30:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 15:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-12"}

The subsequent fate of the bulge, under continued\ninflation, is critically governed by the end-conditions, and the initial\ntension in the tube. In a tube with one end fixed and a dead weight attached to\nthe other freely moving end, the bulge propagates axially at low initial\ntension, growing in length and the tube relaxes by extension. Rupture occurs\nwhen the tension is high. In contrast, the bulge formed in a tube, initially\nstretched and held fixed at both its ends can buckle or rupture, depending on\nthe amount of initial tension. Experiments on inflated latex rubber tubes are\npresented for different initial tensions and boundary conditions.

The fate of the bulge according to\nthe failure maps deduced from the theory is verified; the underlying\nassumptions are critically assessed.

Perhaps more importantly, humans behave suboptimally in that\ntheir responses are not deterministic, but variable. We show that this\nvariability itself is modulated by the temporal statistics of stimuli. To\nelucidate the cognitive algorithm that yields this behavior, we investigate a\nbroad array of existing and new models that characterize different sources of\nsuboptimal deviations away from Bayesian inference. While models with 'output\nnoise' that corrupts the response-selection process are natural candidates,\nhuman behavior is best described by sampling-based inference models, in which\nthe main ingredient is a compressed approximation of the posterior, represented\nthrough a modest set of random samples and updated over time. This result comes\nto complement a growing literature on sample-based representation and learning\nin humans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 00:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-03"}

This characterization has been\nused to prove several results in classical, i.e., without any computability\nrequirements, analysis. Recent work has shown that algorithmic techniques can\nbe fruitfully applied to Marstrand's projection theorem, a fundamental result\nin fractal geometry.\n  In this paper, we introduce an extension of point-to-set principle - the\nnotion of \\textit{optimal oracles} for subsets $E\\subseteq\\R^n$. One of the\nprimary motivations of this definition is that, if $E$ has optimal oracles,\nthen the conclusion of Marstrand's projection theorem holds for $E$. We show\nthat every analytic set has optimal oracles. We also prove that if the\nHausdorff and packing dimensions of $E$ agree, then $E$ has optimal oracles.\nMoreover, we show that the existence of sufficiently nice outer measures on $E$\nimplies the existence of optimal Hausdorff oracles. In particular, the\nexistence of exact gauge functions for a set $E$ is sufficient for the\nexistence of optimal Hausdorff oracles, and is therefore sufficient for\nMarstrand's theorem. Thus, the existence of optimal oracles extends the\ncurrently known sufficient conditions for Marstrand's theorem to hold.\n  Under certain assumptions, every set has optimal oracles. However, assuming\nthe axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis, we construct sets which do\nnot have optimal oracles. This construction naturally leads to a generalization\nof Davies theorem on projections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 01:11:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 05:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

When estimating\non small samples, the Bayesian estimation approach becomes vulnerable to over\nand under-fitting. This is problematic for investigating the behaviour of\nspecific population sub-groups or market segments with low data availability.\nSimilar challenges arise when transferring an existing model to a new location\nor time period, e.g., when estimating post-pandemic travel behaviour.

Both Q$\\Gamma$ and QK excitons exhibit\npronounced phonon replicas, in which two-phonon replicas outshine the\none-phonon replicas due to the existence of (nearly) resonant exciton-phonon\nscatterings and numerous two-phonon scattering paths. We can simulate the\nreplica spectra by comprehensive theoretical modeling and calculations. The\ngood agreement between theory and experiment for the Stark shifts and phonon\nreplicas strongly supports our assignment of Q$\\Gamma$ and QK excitons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 01:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-28"}

However, the bottleneck in\ndeploying these tools in practice is related to their analog or numerical\nimplementation. Numerical approximations are usually employed in which the\napproximation of fractional differintegrator is the foundation. Generally, the\nfollowing three identical equations always hold, i.e.,\n$\\frac{1}{s^\\alpha}\\frac{1}{s^{1-\\alpha}} = \\frac{1}{s}$, $s^\\alpha\n\\frac{1}{s^\\alpha} = 1$ and $s^\\alpha s^{1-\\alpha} = s$.

However,\nexisting arbitrary-oriented ship detection methods are generally developed on a\nset of predefined rotated anchor boxes. These predefined boxes not only lead to\ninaccurate angle predictions but also introduce extra hyper-parameters and high\ncomputational cost. Moreover, the prior knowledge of ship size has not been\nfully exploited by existing methods, which hinders the improvement of their\ndetection accuracy. Aiming at solving the above issues, in this paper, we\npropose a center-head point extraction based detector (named CHPDet) to achieve\narbitrary-oriented ship detection in remote sensing images. Our CHPDet\nformulates arbitrary-oriented ships as rotated boxes with head points which are\nused to determine the direction. And rotated Gaussian kernel is used to map the\nannotations into target heatmaps. Keypoint estimation is performed to find the\ncenter of ships. Then, the size and head point of the ships are regressed. The\norientation-invariant model (OIM) is also used to produce orientation-invariant\nfeature maps.

The non-equilibrium dynamics is\ntriggered by a quench of the impurity-Bose interaction and is illustrated via\nthe evolution of the population imbalance for the bosons between the two wells.\nWhile the increase of the post-quench interaction strength always facilitates\nthe irregular motion for the bosonic population imbalance, it becomes regular\nagain when the impurity is initially populated in the highly excited states.\nSuch an integrability to chaos (ITC) transition is fully captured by the\ntransient dynamics of the corresponding linear entanglement entropy, whose\ninfinite-time averaged value additionally characterizes the edge of the chaos\nand implies the existence of an effective Bose-Bose attraction induced by the\nimpurity.

This\ncoloring is based on a randomized CSMA approach which does not exploit location\nknowledge.

While distant supervision is the most common way to acquire\nsupervised training data, it brings in label noise, as it assigns type labels\nto the entity mentions irrespective of mentions context. In attempts to deal\nwith the label noise, leading research on the FG-NET assumes that the\nfine-grained entity typing data possesses a euclidean nature, which restraints\nthe ability of the existing models in combating the label noise. Given the fact\nthat the fine-grained type hierarchy exhibits a hierarchical structure, it\nmakes hyperbolic space a natural choice to model the FG-NET data. In this\nresearch, we propose FGNET-RH, a novel framework that benefits from the\nhyperbolic geometry in combination with the graph structures to perform entity\ntyping in a performance-enhanced fashion. FGNET-RH initially uses LSTM networks\nto encode the mention in relation with its context, later it forms a graph to\ndistill/refine the mention encodings in the hyperbolic space. Finally, the\nrefined mention encoding is used for entity typing. Experimentation using\ndifferent benchmark datasets shows that FGNET-RH improves the performance on\nFG-NET by up to 3.5-% in terms of strict accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 05:39:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 16:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 09:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

However, such a wetting transition on\na patterned surface is still not fully understood, e.g., the effects of\nelectro-wetting number, geometry of the patterned surfaces, and droplet volume\non the transition have not been systematically investigated. In this paper, we\npropose a theoretical model for the Cassie-Baxter- Wenzel wetting transition\ntriggered by applying an external voltage on a droplet placed on a\nmircopillared surface or a porous substrate. It is found that the transition is\nrealized by lowering the energy barrier created by the intermediate composite\nstate considerably, which enables the droplet to cross the energy barrier and\ncomplete the transition process. Our calculations also indicate that for fixed\ndroplet volume, the critical electrowetting number (voltage) will increase\n(decrease) along with the surface roughness for a micro-pillar patterned\n(porous) surface, and if the surface roughness is fixed, a small droplet tends\nto ease the critical electrowetting condition for the transition. Besides,\nthree dimensional phase diagrams in terms of electrowetting number, surface\nroughness, and droplet volume are constructed to illustrate the\nCassie-Baxter-Wenzel wetting transition. Our theoretical model can be used to\nexplain the previous experimental results about the Cassie-Baxter-Wenzel\nwetting transition reported in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 05:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

The results indicate that the pristine\naperture configuration exhibits the best separation performance, and the\naddition of ILs prevents the apertures from large swing (i.e. configuration\nvariation). Subsequently, the effect of IL viscosity on the layout variation\nwas investigated. MD simulations also show that the pristine aperture\nconfiguration is more stabilized by ILs with large viscosity (0-87Cp). Further\nincrease of IL viscosity above 87Cp did not result in noticeable changes in the\naperture stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 07:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-28"}

With the development of connected\nand automated vehicle (CAV) technology, cooperative ramp merging has become one\nof the popular solutions to this problem. In a mixed traffic situation, CAVs\nwill not only interact with each other, but also handle complicated situations\nwith human-driven vehicles involved. In this paper, a game theory-based ramp\nmerging strategy has been developed for the optimal merging coordination of\nCAVs in the mixed traffic, which determines dynamic merging sequence and\ncorresponding longitudinal/lateral control. This strategy improves the safety\nand efficiency of the merging process by ensuring a safe inter-vehicle distance\namong the involved vehicles and harmonizing the speed of CAVs in the traffic\nstream. To verify the proposed strategy, mixed traffic simulations under\ndifferent penetration rates and different congestion levels have been carried\nout on an innovative Unity-SUMO integrated platform, which connects a game\nengine-based driving simulator with a traffic simulator. This platform allows\nthe human driver to participate in the simulation, and also equip CAVs with\nmore realistic sensing systems.

VWV and VWT\nmeasurements require the lumen-intima (LIB) and media-adventitia boundaries\n(MAB) at the common and internal carotid arteries (CCA and ICA). However, most\nexisting segmentation techniques were capable of automating only CCA\nsegmentation. An approach capable of segmenting the MAB and LIB from the CCA\nand ICA was required to accelerate VWV and VWT quantification. Methods:\nSegmentation for CCA and ICA were performed independently using the proposed\ntwo-channel U-Net, which was driven by a novel loss function known as the\nadaptive triple Dice loss (ADTL). A test-time augmentation (TTA) approach is\nused, in which segmentation was performed three times based on axial images and\nits flipped versions; the final segmentation was generated by pixel-wise\nmajority voting.

The taxonomy expansion task aims to find a\nposition for a new term in an existing taxonomy to capture the emerging\nknowledge in the world and keep the taxonomy dynamically updated. Previous\ntaxonomy expansion solutions neglect valuable information brought by the\nhierarchical structure and evaluate the correctness of merely an added edge,\nwhich downgrade the problem to node-pair scoring or mini-path classification.\nIn this paper, we propose the Hierarchy Expansion Framework (HEF), which fully\nexploits the hierarchical structure's properties to maximize the coherence of\nexpanded taxonomy. HEF makes use of taxonomy's hierarchical structure in\nmultiple aspects: i) HEF utilizes subtrees containing most relevant nodes as\nself-supervision data for a complete comparison of parental and sibling\nrelations; ii) HEF adopts a coherence modeling module to evaluate the coherence\nof a taxonomy's subtree by integrating hypernymy relation detection and several\ntree-exclusive features; iii) HEF introduces the Fitting Score for position\nselection, which explicitly evaluates both path and level selections and takes\nfull advantage of parental relations to interchange information for\ndisambiguation and self-correction. Extensive experiments show that by better\nexploiting the hierarchical structure and optimizing taxonomy's coherence, HEF\nvastly surpasses the prior state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets by an\naverage improvement of 46.7% in accuracy and 32.3% in mean reciprocal rank.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:57:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

The Fast and Flexible Holomorphic Embedding (FFHE) method\nconverges faster and provides the flexibility to use any state as an initial\nguess. But to investigate the effect and ability of FACTS devices using FFHE\ntechnique, it is necessary to develop an embedded system for these devices.\nTherefore, this paper presents an FFHE-based embedded system for VSC-based\nFACTS controllers, such as SSSC and IPFC. The embedded system is also proposed\nfor their controlling modes.\n  The introduced embedded system is flexible which allows to take any state as\nan initial guess instead of fixed state, which leads towards the reduced\nruntime and decreases the required number of terms, as compared to standard\nHELM. To demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability, the proposed\nFFHE-based models of FACTS devices have been tested for several cases.

This is particularly problematic for the railway\nindustry, in which formal methods are highly recommended by the norms, but no\nactual guidance is provided for the selection of tools. To guide companies in\nthe selection of the most appropriate formal tools to adopt in their contexts,\na clear assessment of the features of the currently available tools is\nrequired.\n  To address this goal, this paper considers a set of 13 formal tools that have\nbeen used for railway system design, and it presents a systematic evaluation of\nsuch tools and a preliminary usability analysis of a subset of 7 tools,\ninvolving railway practitioners.

To address that\nlimitation, this paper proposes and evaluates standard NIDS feature sets based\non the NetFlow network meta-data collection protocol and system. We evaluate\nand compare two NetFlow-based feature set variants, a version with 12 features,\nand another one with 43 features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 11:00:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 01:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

We analyze high\nspatial resolution observations of sunspots in the Balmer H-alpha and H-beta\nlines as well as auxiliary continuum channels obtained with the Swedish 1-m\nSolar Telescope and apply the k-means clustering technique to systematically\ndetect and characterize Ellerman Bombs. Features with all the defining\ncharacteristics of Ellerman bombs are found in large numbers over the entire\npenumbra. The true prevalence of these events is only fully appreciated in the\nH-beta line due to highest spatial resolution and lower chromospheric opacity.\nWe find that the penumbra hosts some of the highest Ellerman bomb densities,\nonly surpassed by the moat in the immediate surroundings of the sunspot. Some\npenumbral Ellerman bombs show flame morphology and rapid dynamical evolution.\nMany penumbral Ellerman bombs are fast moving with typical speed of 3.7 km/s\nand sometimes more than 10 km/s. Many penumbral Ellerman bombs migrate from the\ninner to the outer penumbra over hundreds of km and some continue moving beyond\nthe outer penumbral boundary into the moat. Many penumbral Ellerman bombs are\nfound in the vicinity of regions with opposite magnetic polarity.

The first index involves the strength of each node as a launcher of\nthe message, dividing the nodes into launchers and non-launchers. The second\nindex addresses the potential of each member as a receiver (target) of the\nmessage, dividing the nodes into targets and non-targets.

In this paper, we introduce EnTranNAS that is\ncomposed of Engine-cells and Transit-cells. The Engine-cell is differentiable\nfor architecture search, while the Transit-cell only transits a sub-graph by\narchitecture derivation. Consequently, the gap between the architectures in\nsearch and evaluation is significantly reduced. Our method also spares much\nmemory and computation cost, which speeds up the search process. A feature\nsharing strategy is introduced for more balanced optimization and more\nefficient search. Furthermore, we develop an architecture derivation method to\nreplace the traditional one that is based on a hand-crafted rule.

It has been explored for: I. Constructing nested nets: the nested\nnets are neural networks whose architectures can be adjusted instantly during\ntesting time, e.g., based on computational constraints. The nested dropout\nimplicitly ranks the network parameters, generating a set of sub-networks such\nthat any smaller sub-network forms the basis of a larger one. II. Learning\nordered representation: the nested dropout applied to the latent representation\nof a generative model (e.g., auto-encoder) ranks the features, enforcing\nexplicit order of the dense representation over dimensions.\n  However, the dropout rate is fixed as a hyper-parameter during the whole\ntraining process. For nested nets, when network parameters are removed, the\nperformance decays in a human-specified trajectory rather than in a trajectory\nlearned from data. For generative models, the importance of features is\nspecified as a constant vector, restraining the flexibility of representation\nlearning. To address the problem, we focus on the probabilistic counterpart of\nthe nested dropout. We propose a variational nested dropout (VND) operation\nthat draws samples of multi-dimensional ordered masks at a low cost, providing\nuseful gradients to the parameters of nested dropout. Based on this approach,\nwe design a Bayesian nested neural network that learns the order knowledge of\nthe parameter distributions.

This makes it possible to calculate the second-order self-force using\nmode-sum regularisation rather than the more cumbersome puncture schemes that\nhave been necessary previously.

In this paper, we formulate a general\nconfiguration on describing how individual's opinion evolves in a distinct\nfashion. It consists of two functional networks: interacting network and\nappraisal network. Interacting network inherits the operational properties as\nDeGroot iterative opinion pooling scheme while appraisal network, forming a\nbelief system, quantifies certain cognitive orientation to interested\nindividuals' beliefs, over which the adhered attitudes may have the potential\nto be antagonistic. We explicitly show that cooperative appraisal network\nalways leads to consensus in opinions. Antagonistic appraisal network, however,\ncauses opinion cluster. It is verified that antagonistic appraisal network\naffords to guarantee consensus by imposing some extra restrictions.

The calculated phonon spectrum shows that the system is\nthermodynamically stable unlike other Co halides. We apply two well-known\nmethods for the estimation of the Curie temperature. First, we do DFT+U\ncalculations to calculate exchange couplings, which are subsequently used in a\nclassical Monte Carlo simulation of the resulting Ising spin model. The\ntransition temperature calculated in this way is in the order of 100 K, but\nshows a strong dependence on the choice of interaction parameters. Second, we\napply dynamical mean-field theory to calculate the correlated electronic\nstructure and estimate the transition temperature.This results in a similar\nestimate for a noticeable transition temperature of approximately 100\nK,however, without the strong dependence on the interaction parameters. The\neffect of electron-electron interactions are strongly orbital selective, with\nonly moderate correlations in the three low-lying orbitals (one doublet plus\none singlet), and strong correlations in the doublet at higher energy. This can\nbe traced back to the electronic occupation in DMFT, with five electrons in the\nthree low-lying orbitals and two electrons in the high-energy doublet, making\nthe latter one half-filled. Nevertheless, the overall spectral gap is governed\nby the small gap originating from the low-lying doublet+singlet orbitals, which\nchanges very weakly with interaction U. In that sense,the system is close to a\nMott metal-to-insulator transition, which has been shown previously to be a\nhot-spot for strong magnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 14:14:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 19:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

For\nexample, 6G networks are capable of providing high-speed network access by\nexploiting higher frequency spectrum; high-throughout satellite communication\nservices are also adopted to achieve pervasive coverage in remote and isolated\nareas. In order to enable seamless access, Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial\nCommunication Networks (ISTCN) has emerged as an important research area. ISTCN\naims to provide high speed and pervasive network services by integrating\nbroadband terrestrial mobile networks with satellite communication networks. As\nterrestrial mobile networks began to use higher frequency spectrum (between\n3GHz to 40GHz) which overlaps with that of satellite communication (4GHz to\n8GHz for C band and 26GHz to 40GHz for Ka band), there are opportunities and\nchallenges. On one hand, satellite terminals can potentially access terrestrial\nnetworks in an integrated manner; on the other hand, there will be more\ncongestion and interference in this spectrum, hence more efficient spectrum\nmanagement techniques are required. In this paper, we propose a new technique\nto improve spectrum sharing performance by introducing Non-orthogonal Frequency\nDivision Multiplexing (NOMA) and Cognitive Radio (CR) in the spectrum sharing\nof ISTCN. In essence, NOMA technology improves spectrum efficiency by allowing\ndifferent users to transmit on the same carrier and distinguishing users by\nuser power levels while CR technology improves spectrum efficiency through\ndynamic spectrum sharing. Furthermore, some open researches and challenges in\nISTCN will be discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 14:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-28"}

This work enables the controlling of robotic arms\nmotion only with visual inputs, that is, controlling by showing the videos of\ncorrect movements. This work can broadly be sub-divided into two segments. The\nfirst part of this work is to develop an unsupervised vision-based method to\ncontrol robotic arm in 2-D plane, and the second one is with deep CNN in the\nsame task in 3-D plane. The first method is unsupervised, where our aim is to\nperform mimicking of human arm motion in real-time by a manipulator. We\ndeveloped a network, namely the vision-to-motion optical network (DON), where\nthe input should be a video stream containing hand movements of human, the the\noutput would be out the velocity and torque information of the hand movements\nshown in the videos. The output information of the DON is then fed to the\nrobotic arm by enabling it to generate motion according to the real hand\nvideos. The method has been tested with both live-stream video feed as well as\non recorded video obtained from a monocular camera even by intelligently\npredicting the trajectory of human hand hand when it gets occluded. This is why\nthe mimicry of the arm incorporates some intelligence to it and becomes\nintelligent mimic (i-mimic). Alongside the unsupervised method another method\nhas also been developed deploying the deep neural network technique with CNN\n(Convolutional Neural Network) to perform the mimicking, where labelled\ndatasets are used for training. The same dataset, as used in the unsupervised\nDON-based method, is used in the deep CNN method, after manual annotations.\nBoth the proposed methods are validated with off-line as well as with on-line\nvideo datasets in real-time. The entire methodology is validated with real-time\n1-link and simulated n-link manipulators alongwith suitable comparisons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 14:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-28"}

This work presents\nsolutions of the Einstein equations for the Alcubierre metric having fluid\nmatter as gravity source. The energy-momentum tensor considered two fluid\ncontents, the perfect fluid and the parametrized perfect fluid (PPF), a\ntentative more flexible model whose aim is to explore the possibilities of warp\ndrive solutions with positive matter density content. Santos-Pereira et al.\n(2020; arXiv:2008.06560) have already showed that the Alcubierre metric having\ndust as source connects this geometry to the Burgers equation, which describes\nshock waves moving through an inviscid fluid, but led the solutions back to\nvacuum. The same happened for two out of four solutions subcases for the\nperfect fluid. Other solutions for the perfect fluid indicate the possibility\nof warp drive with positive matter density, but at the cost of a complex\nsolution for the warp drive regulating function. Regarding the PPF, solutions\nwere also obtained indicating that warp speeds could be created with positive\nmatter density. Weak, dominant, strong and null energy conditions were\ncalculated for all studied subcases, being satisfied for the perfect fluid and\ncreating constraints in the PPF quantities such that positive matter density is\nalso possible for creating a warp bubble. Summing up all\nresults,energy-momentum tensors describing more complex forms of matter, or\nfield, distributions generate solutions for the Einstein equations with the\nwarp drive metric where negative matter density might not be a strict\nprecondition for attaining warp speeds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 14:55:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 03:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

Over the last decade, several\noutbreaks of CCHFV have been observed in Europe, mainly in Mediterranean\ncountries. Due to the high case/fatality ratio of CCHFV in human sometimes, it\nis of great importance for public health.

A fully exclusive measurement of the\n17Ne(p,2p)16F->15O+p quasi-free one-proton knockout reaction has been performed\nat GSI at around 500 MeV/nucleon beam energy. All particles resulting from the\nscattering process have been detected. The relevant reconstructed quantities\nare the angles of the two protons scattered in quasi-elastic kinematics, the\ndecay of 16F into 15O (including gamma decays from excited states) and a\nproton, as well as the 15O+p relative-energy spectrum and the 16F momentum\ndistributions. The latter two quantities allow an independent and consistent\ndetermination of the ratio of l=0 and l=2 motion of the valence protons in\n17Ne. With a resulting relatively small l=0 component of only around 35(3)%, it\nis concluded that 17Ne exhibits a rather modest halo character only. The\nquantitative agreement of the two values deduced from the energy spectrum and\nthe momentum distributions supports the theoretical treatment of the\ncalculation of momentum distributions after quasi-free knockout reactions at\nhigh energies by taking into account distortions based on the Glauber theory.\nMoreover, the experimental data allow the separation of valence-proton knockout\nand knockout from the 15O core.

A formulation for a discrete dynamical\nsystem is proposed aiming at reproducing the evolution in time of the density\nof vehicles along a road, as observed in the measurements. This system is\nformulated as a chemical reaction network where road cells are interpreted as\ncompartments, the transfer of vehicles from one cell to the other is seen as a\nchemical reaction between adjacent compartment and the density of vehicles is\nseen as a concentration of reactant. Several degrees of flexibility on the\nparameters of this system, which basically consist of the reaction rates\nbetween the compartments, can be considered: a constant value or a function\ndepending on time and/or space. Density measurements coming from trajectory\ndata are then interpreted as observations of the states of this system at\nconsecutive times. Optimal reaction rates for the system are then obtained by\nminimizing the discrepancy between the output of the system and the state\nmeasurements. This approach was tested both on simulated and real data, proved\nsuccessful in recreating the complexity of traffic flows despite the\nassumptions on the flux-density relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 15:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-28"}

However, few data collectors give upfront privacy guarantees.\nAdditionally, when privacy guarantees are given upfront, they are often vague\nclaims about 'anonymity'. Instead, we propose giving quantifiable privacy\nguarantees through the statistical notion of differential privacy.\nNevertheless, privacy does not come for free. At the heart of differential\nprivacy lies an inherent trade-off between accuracy and privacy that needs to\nbe balanced. Thus, it is vital to properly adjust the accuracy-privacy\ntrade-off before setting out to collect data. Altogether, getting started with\ndifferentially private data collection can be challenging. Ideally, a data\nanalyst should not have to be concerned about all the details of differential\nprivacy, but rather get differential privacy by design. Still, to the best of\nour knowledge, no tools for gathering poll data under differential privacy\nexists.\n  Motivated by the lack of tools to gather poll data under differential\nprivacy, we set out to engineer our own tool. Specifically, to make local\ndifferential privacy accessible for all, in this systems paper we present\nRandori, a set of novel open source tools for differentially private poll data\ncollection. Randori is intended to help data analysts keep their focus on what\ndata their poll is collecting, as opposed to how they should collect it. Our\ntools also allow the data analysts to analytically predict the accuracy of\ntheir poll. Furthermore, we show that differential privacy alone is not enough\nto achieve end-to-end privacy in a server-client setting. Consequently, we also\ninvestigate and mitigate implicit data leaks in Randori.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 15:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-28"}

Entanglement distillation is a means of restoring the quality of such\ndiluted entanglement by concentrating it into a pair of qubits. Conventionally,\nthis would be done by distributing multiple photon pairs and distilling the\nentanglement into a single pair. Here, we turn around this paradigm by\nutilising pairs of single photons entangled in multiple degrees of freedom.\nSpecifically, we make use of the polarisation and the energy-time domain of\nphotons, both of which are extensively field-tested. We experimentally chart\nthe domain of distillable states and achieve relative fidelity gains up to 13.8\n%. Compared to the two-copy scheme, the distillation rate of our single-copy\nscheme is several orders of magnitude higher, paving the way towards\nhigh-capacity and noise-resilient quantum networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 15:59:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 12:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

In addition, we start developing a\nclassification scheme for multiway systems based on their growth class.\nFurthermore, we find that multiway growth functions are not trivially regular\nbut instead \"computationally diverse\", meaning that they are capable of\ncomputing or approximating various commonly encountered mathematical functions.\nWe discuss several implications of these properties as well as their physical\nrelevance. Apart from that, we present and exemplify methods for explicitly\nconstructing multiway systems to yield desired growth functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 19:27:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 15:54:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

We draw on an understanding of ADM as a socio-technical\nprocess involving both human and technical elements, beginning before a\ndecision is made and extending beyond the decision itself. While explanations\nand other model-centric mechanisms may assist some accountability concerns,\nthey often provide insufficient information of these broader ADM processes for\nregulatory oversight and assessments of legal compliance. Reviewability\ninvolves breaking down the ADM process into technical and organisational\nelements to provide a systematic framework for determining the contextually\nappropriate record-keeping mechanisms to facilitate meaningful review - both of\nindividual decisions and of the process as a whole. We argue that a\nreviewability framework, drawing on administrative law's approach to reviewing\nhuman decision-making, offers a practical way forward towards more a more\nholistic and legally-relevant form of accountability for ADM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 18:15:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 11:48:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

Given this, it is a moral obligation for\nthe research community to consider how the contemporary technological\ndevelopments (i.e. Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning, Edge\nComputing)might help reduce crime worldwide. In line with this, this paper\nprovides a discussion of how a sample of contemporary hardware and\nsoftware-based technologies might help further reduce criminal actions. After a\nthorough analysis of a wide array of technologies and a number of workshops\nwith organisations of interest, we believe that the adoption of novel\ntechnologies by vulnerable individuals, victim support organisations and law\nenforcement can help reduce the occurrence of criminal activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 16:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}
