We find that\neven in blackbody volumes as small as 1\\,cm$^3$, this effect is unlikely to\ncontribute meaningfully to transition linewidths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 17:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Full quantum error correction cannot be implemented in these devices\ndue to their limited scale. Therefore instead of relying on engineered code\nsymmetry, symmetry verification was developed which uses the inherent symmetry\nwithin the physical problem we try to solve. In this article, we develop a\ngeneral framework named symmetry expansion which provides a wide spectrum of\nsymmetry-based error mitigation schemes beyond symmetry verification, enabling\nus to achieve different balances between the estimation bias and the sampling\ncost of the scheme. We show that certain symmetry expansion schemes can achieve\na smaller estimation bias than symmetry verification through cancellation\nbetween the biases due to the detectable and undetectable noise components. A\npractical way to search for such a small-bias scheme is introduced. By\nnumerically simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model for energy estimation, the\nsmall-bias symmetry expansion we found can achieve an estimation bias 6 to 9\ntimes below what is achievable by symmetry verification when the average number\nof circuit errors is between 1 to 2.

A key contribution to this study is the consideration of the SMC as a\ntriaxial spheroid, from which we estimate the deprojected distances to the SMC\ncenter of the statistically significant sample of star clusters analyzed. By\nadopting a 3D geometry of the SMC, we avoid the spurious effects caused by\nconsidering that a star cluster observed along the line-of-sight is close to\nthe galaxy center. When inspecting the relationships between the star cluster\nsizes (represented by the 90% light radii), their eccentricities, masses and\nages with the deprojected distances, we find: (i) the star cluster sizes are\nnot visibly affected by tidal effects, because relatively small and large\nobjects are spread through the SMC body. (ii) Star clusters with large\neccentricities (> 0.4) are preferentially found located at deprojected\ndistances smaller than $\\sim$ 7-8 kpc, although many star clusters with smaller\neccentricities are also found occupying a similar volume. (iii) Star clusters\nmore massive than log(M /Mo) $\\sim$ 4.0 are among the oldest star clusters,\ngenerally placed in the outermost SMC region and with a relative small level of\nflattening. These findings contrast with the more elongated, generally younger,\nless massive and innermost star clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 18:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

It is therefore natural\nto use an effective field theory (EFT) to describe its interactions. Loop\nprocesses calculated in the EFT may, however, explicitly depend on the\nultraviolet cutoff. In general the UV cutoff is not uniquely defined, but the\ndimensionful couplings suggest to identify it with the Peccei-Quinn\nsymmetry-breaking scale. An example are $K \\rightarrow \\pi + a$ decays that\nwill soon be tested to improved precision in NA62 and KOTO and whose amplitude\nis dominated by the term logarithmically dependent on the cutoff. In this\npaper, we critically examine the adequacy of using such a naive EFT approach to\nstudy loop processes by comparing EFT calculations with ones performed in\ncomplete QCD axion models. In DFSZ models, for example, the cutoff is found to\nbe set by additional Higgs degrees of freedom and to therefore be much closer\nto the electroweak scale than to the Peccei-Quinn scale. In fact, there are\nnon-trivial requirements on axion models where the cutoff scale of loop\nprocesses is close to the Peccei-Quinn scale, such that the naive EFT result is\nreproduced. This suggests that the existence of a suitable UV embedding may\nimpose restrictions on axion EFTs.

Lord Rayleigh discussed the\nphenomenon called such behavior Breath Figures (BF). Historically, utilizing\ndew as a water source was investigated by several scientists dating back to\nAristotle. However, due to the degrading effects of air as a non-condensable\ngas (NCG) such efforts are limited to small scale water production systems.\nRecently, the concept of BF has been utilized extensively in the generation of\nmicro-scale polymer patterns as a self-assembly process. However, the\ngeneration of BF on surfaces while being impinged by a humid air jet has not\nbeen quantified. In this work, we illustrate that a BF spot generated on a\ncooled surface is a manifestation of a recovery concentration. The concept is\nanalogous to the concept of adiabatic-wall temperature defined for heat\ntransfer applications. Upon closer examination of the vapor concentration\ndistribution on a cooled impinged surface, we found that the distribution\nexhibits distinct regimes depending on the radial location from the center of\nthe impingement region. The first regime is confined within the impingement\nregion, whereas the second regime lies beyond this radial location including\nthe wall jet region. Scaling analysis as well as numerical solution of the\nformer regime shows that the maximum concentration on the surface is equivalent\nto its counterpart of a free unbounded jet with similar geometrical conditions.\nAdditionally, the scaling analysis of the latter regime reveals that the jet\nspeed and standoff distance are not important in determining the recovery\nconcentration. However, the recovery concentration is found to vary\nmonotonically with the radial location. Our conclusions are of great importance\nin optimizing jet impingement where condensation phase change is prevalent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 19:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

We compare the robustness of the\ntransmission protocol against static disorder on the exchange coefficients\nusing different figures of merit, which allow us to conclude that the isotropic\nHeisenberg chain is the best option when compared with anisotropic chains. This\ncomparison is relevant since the method allow us to start with chains that all\nachieve near perfect quantum state transfer, regime that was not available\npreviously in these chains without time-dependent external control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 19:32:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 22:24:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 16:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

Accurate\nestimation of grass and clover biomass yield enables smart decisions in\noptimizing fertilization and seeding density, resulting in increased\nproductivity and positive environmental impact. Grass and clover are usually\nplanted together, since clover is a nitrogen-fixing plant that brings nutrients\nto the soil. Adjusting the right percentages of clover and grass in a field\nreduces the need for external fertilization. Existing approaches for estimating\nthe grass-clover composition of a field are expensive and time consuming -\nrandom samples of the pasture are clipped and then the components are\nphysically separated to weigh and calculate percentages of dry grass, clover\nand weeds in each sample. There is growing interest in developing novel deep\nlearning based approaches to non-destructively extract pasture phenotype\nindicators and biomass yield predictions of different plant species from\nagricultural imagery collected from the field. Providing these indicators and\npredictions from images alone remains a significant challenge. Heavy occlusions\nin the dense mixture of grass, clover and weeds make it difficult to estimate\neach component accurately. Moreover, although supervised deep learning models\nperform well with large datasets, it is tedious to acquire large and diverse\ncollections of field images with precise ground truth for different biomass\nyields. In this paper, we demonstrate that applying data augmentation and\ntransfer learning is effective in predicting multi-target biomass percentages\nof different plant species, even with a small training dataset.

With unprecedented improvements in detector bandwidth and\nsensitivity in advanced-LIGO and Virgo detectors, one expects several orders of\nmagnitude increase in the size of template banks. This poses a formidable\ncomputational challenge in factorizing huge template matrices. Previously, [in\nKulkarni et al. [6]], we introduced the idea of random projection (RP)-based\nmatrix factorization as a computationally viable alternative to SVD, applicable\nfor large template banks. This follow-up paper demonstrates the application of\na block-wise randomized matrix factorization (RMF) algorithm for computing\nlow-rank factorizations at a preset average fractional loss of SNR. This new\nscheme is shown to be more efficient in the context of the LLOID framework of\nthe GstLAL search pipeline. Further, it is well-known that for huge template\nbanks, the total computational cost of the search is dominated by\nreconstructing the detection statistic compared to that of filtering the data.\nHowever, optimizing the reconstruction cost has not been addressed\nsatisfactorily so far in the available literature. We show that it is possible\nto approximately reconstruct the time-series of the matched-filter detection\nstatistic at a fraction of the total cost using the matching pursuit algorithm.\nCombining the two algorithms presented in this paper can handle online searches\ninvolving large template banks more efficiently. We have analyzed the total\ncomputational cost in detail and offer various tips for optimally applying the\nRMF scheme in different parts of the parameter space.

This method is complementary to the\ntraditional morphological image opening method which mimics pressure-based\ninvasion. A key advantage of the volume-based approach is that all saturations\nbetween 0 and 1 can obtained rather than the irregularly and widely spaced\nsaturation steps obtained by pressure-based methods. Because of the incremental\nincreases in saturation, it becomes possible to correctly predict defending\nphase trapping, which is not the case when pressure-based steps are applied.\nThe algorithm is validated against morphological image opening and obtains near\nperfect agreement at equal saturations as expected from theory. It is also\ndemonstrated that a volume-controlled capillary pressure curve can be obtained\nthat displays the characteristic jumps in capillary pressure, and moreover, the\nenvelop of peak pressures yields the pressure-based capillary pressure obtained\nby morphological opening, so in fact the results of the proposed algorithm are\na superset of the morphological approach.

The second protocol does not require a handshake between\ntwo devices, at the expense of relying on real-time communication with a\ncentral server. We stress that digital contact tracing is a form of\ntechnological solutionism that should be used with care, especially given the\ninherent mass surveillance nature of such systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 22:43:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2021 21:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

The exact orientation\nof these filaments with the magnetic fields depends on the strength of these\nfields, the gravitational potential, and the line-of-sight (LOS) relative to\nthe mean field. To disentangle these effects we employ three-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamical numerical simulations that explore a wide range of\ninitial turbulent and magnetic states, i.e., sub-Alfv\\'enic to super-Alfv\\'enic\nturbulence, with and without gravity.

The inclusion\nof gravity increases the number of dense structures perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field, reflected as lower values of the PRS for denser regions,\nregardless of whether the model is sub- or super-Alfv\\'enic.

The implicit function of level set is described by fully\nconnected deep neural networks. A DNN-based level set optimization method is\nproposed, where the Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (PDEs) are\ntransformed into parametrized ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The\nzero-level set of implicit function is updated through updating the weights and\nbiases of networks.

Most GZSL methods\ntypically learn to synthesise visual representations from semantic information\non the unseen classes. However, these types of models are prone to overfitting\nthe seen classes, resulting in distribution overlap between the generated\nfeatures of the seen and unseen classes. The overlapping region is filled with\nuncertainty as the model struggles to determine whether a test case from within\nthe overlap is seen or unseen. Further, these generative methods suffer in\nscenarios with sparse training samples. The models struggle to learn the\ndistribution of high dimensional visual features and, therefore, fail to\ncapture the most discriminative inter-class features. To address these issues,\nin this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages dual variational\nautoencoders with a triplet loss to learn discriminative latent features and\napplies the entropy-based calibration to minimize the uncertainty in the\noverlapped area between the seen and unseen classes. Specifically, the dual\ngenerative model with the triplet loss synthesises inter-class discriminative\nlatent features that can be mapped from either visual or semantic space. To\ncalibrate the uncertainty for seen classes, we calculate the entropy over the\nsoftmax probability distribution from a general classifier.

The evolution is characterized by three stages with\ndistinct dynamics. During the quasi-static stage, the splitting proceeds\ngradually for about 1.5 hrs, with the upper branch rising at a few kilometers\nper second and displaying swirling motions about its axis. During the precursor\nstage that lasts for about 10 min, the upper branch rises at tens of kilometers\nper second, with a pair of conjugated dimming regions starting to develop at\nits footpoints; with the swirling motions turning chaotic, the axis of the\nupper branch whips southward, which drives an arc-shaped EUV front propagating\nin the similar direction.

Our analysis finds that the X-ray\nemissions, not only from the NPS but from the SPS are closer to the Galactic\ncenter by ~5 deg compared with the corresponding radio emission. Furthermore,\nlarger offsets of 10-20 deg are observed in the LASs; however, they are\nattributed to different physical origins. Moreover, the temperature of the\nX-ray emission is kT ~ 0.2 keV for the LAS, which is systematically lower than\nthose of the NPS and SPS (kT ~ 0.3 keV) but consistent with the typical\ntemperature of Galactic halo gas. We argue that the radio/X-ray offset and the\nslightly higher temperature of the NPS/SPS X-ray gas are due to the shock\ncompression/heating of halo gas during a significant Galactic explosion in the\npast, whereas the enhanced X-ray emission from the LAS may be due to the weak\ncondensation of halo gas in the arm potential or star formation activity\nwithout shock heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 06:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

We\ncompare its predictions to those of the coherent phonon model and find that the\nformer fits the MoS$_{2}$-SiO$_{2}$ data from experiments and simulations\nsignificantly better. Our analysis suggests that heat dissipation at the\nTMD-SiO$_{2}$ interface is dominated by phonons scattered diffusely by the\nrough interface although the electronic TBC contribution can be significant\neven at low electron densities ($n\\leq10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$) and may explain some\nof the variation in the experimental TBC data from the literature. The physical\ninsights from our study can be useful for the development of thermally aware\ndesigns in TMD-based nanoelectronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 07:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

For most studies, a log-likelihood\nratio (LLR) score is estimated based on a generative probability model on\nspeaker features and compared with a threshold for making a decision. However,\nthe generative model usually focuses on individual feature distributions, does\nnot have the discriminative feature selection ability, and is easy to be\ndistracted by nuisance features. The SV could be formulated as a binary\ndiscrimination task where neural network-based discriminative learning could be\napplied. In discriminative learning, the nuisance features could be removed\nwith the help of label supervision. However, discriminative learning pays more\nattention to classification boundaries and is prone to overfitting to a\ntraining set which may result in bad generalization on a test set. Thus, we\npropose a hybrid learning framework, i.e., coupling a joint Bayesian (JB)\ngenerative model structure and parameters with a neural discriminative learning\nframework for SV. A two-branch Siamese neural network is built with dense\nlayers that are coupled with factorized affine transforms as used in the JB\nmodel. The LLR score estimation in the JB model is formulated according to the\ndistance metric in the discriminative learning framework. By initializing the\ntwo-branch neural network with the generatively learned model parameters of the\nJB model, we train the model parameters with the pairwise samples as a binary\ndiscrimination task. Moreover, a direct evaluation metric in SV based on\nminimum empirical Bayes risk is designed and integrated as an objective\nfunction in discriminative learning. We carried out SV experiments on Speakers\nin the wild and Voxceleb. Experimental results showed that our proposed model\nimproved the performance with a large margin compared with state-of-art models\nfor SV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 10:10:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 13:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-25"}

Reduction methods can lower complexity by\ncomputing model projections that preserve dynamics of interest to the user.\nResults: We present an exact lumping method for stochastic reaction networks\nwith mass-action kinetics. It hinges on an equivalence relation between the\nspecies, resulting in a reduced network where the dynamics of each\nmacro-species is stochastically equivalent to the sum of the original species\nin each equivalence class, for any choice of the initial state of the system.\nFurthermore, by an appropriate encoding of kinetic parameters as additional\nspecies, the method can establish equivalences that do not depend on specific\nvalues of the parameters. The method is supported by an efficient algorithm to\ncompute the largest species equivalence, thus the maximal lumping.

The codebook design problem for SCMA has also been studied to some\nextent since codebook choices are highly related to the system's error rate\nperformance. In this paper, we approach the SCMA codebook design problem by\nformulating an optimization problem to maximize the minimum Euclidean distance\n(MED) of superimposed codewords under power constraints. While SCMA codebooks\nwith a larger MED are expected to obtain a better BER performance, no optimal\nSCMA codebook in terms of MED maximization, to the authors' best knowledge, has\nbeen reported in the SCMA literature yet. In this paper, a new iterative\nalgorithm based on alternating maximization with exact penalty is proposed for\nthe MED maximization problem. The proposed algorithm, when supplied with\nappropriate initial points and parameters, achieves a set of codebooks of all\nusers whose MED is larger than any previously reported results. A Lagrange dual\nproblem is derived which provides an upper bound of MED of any set of\ncodebooks. Even though there is still a nonzero gap between the achieved MED\nand the upper bound given by the dual problem, simulation results demonstrate\nclear advantages in error rate performances of the proposed set of codebooks\nover all existing ones not only in AWGN channels but also in some downlink\nscenarios that fit in 5G/NR applications, making it a good codebook candidate\nthereof. The proposed set of SCMA codebooks, however, are not shown to\noutperform existing ones in uplink channels or in the case where\nnon-consecutive OFDMA subcarriers are used. The correctness and accuracy of\nerror curves in the simulation results are further confirmed by the\ncoincidences with the theoretical upper bounds of error rates derived for any\ngiven set of codebooks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 13:10:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 12:23:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 07:55:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 1 May 2022 10:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Herein, we introduce the iterative power algorithm (IPA) for\nglobal optimization and a formal proof of convergence for both discrete and\ncontinuous global search problems, which is essential for applications in\nchemistry such as molecular geometry optimization. IPA implements the power\niteration method in quantics tensor train (QTT) representations. Analogous to\nthe imaginary time propagation method with infinite mass, IPA starts with an\ninitial probability distribution and iteratively applies the recurrence\nrelation $\\rho_{k+1}({\\bf x})=U({\\bf x})\\rho_k({\\bf x})/\\|U\\rho_k\\|_{L^1}$,\nwhere $U({\\bf x})=e^{-V({\\bf x})}$ is defined in terms of the potential energy\nsurface (PES) $V({\\bf x})$. Upon convergence, the probability distribution\nbecomes a delta function, so the global minimum can be obtained as the position\nexpectation value. QTT representations are generated by fast adaptive\ninterpolation of multidimensional arrays to bypass the curse of dimensionality\nand the need to evaluate $V({\\bf x})$ for all possible ${\\bf x}$. We illustrate\nthe capabilities of IPA for global search optimization of two multidimensional\nPESs, including a differentiable model PES of a DNA chain and a discrete\nnon-differentiable PES, $V(p)=\\text{mod}(N,p)$, that resolves the prime factors\nof an integer $N$, with $p$ in the space of prime numbers folded as a\n$d$-dimensional $2_1 \\times 2_2 \\times \\cdots \\times 2_d$ tensor. We find that\nIPA resolves multiple degenerate global minima even when separated by large\nenergy barriers in the highly rugged landscape of the potentials. Therefore,\nIPA should be of great interest for a wide range of other optimization problems\nubiquitous in molecular and electronic structure calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 15:22:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 19:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

A wide array of interesting features, such as high light\noutput, fast decay times, almost non-existent intrinsic background and\nrobustness, make GAGG:Ce an interesting candidate as a component of new\nspace-based gamma-ray detectors. As a consequence of its novelty, literature on\nGAGG:Ce is still lacking on points crucial to its applicability in space\nmissions. In particular, GAGG:Ce is characterized by unusually high and\nlong-lasting delayed luminescence. This afterglow emission can be stimulated by\nthe interactions between the scintillator and the particles of the near-Earth\nradiation environment.

To\nrecover such an image, a dehazing algorithm should localize and recover\naffected regions while ensuring consistency between recovered and its\nneighboring regions. However owing to fixed receptive field of convolutional\nkernels and non uniform haze distribution, assuring consistency between regions\nis difficult. In this paper, we utilize an encoder-decoder based network\narchitecture to perform the task of dehazing and integrate an spatially aware\nchannel attention mechanism to enhance features of interest beyond the\nreceptive field of traditional conventional kernels. To ensure performance\nconsistency across diverse range of haze densities, we utilize greedy localized\ndata augmentation mechanism. Synthetic datasets are typically used to ensure a\nlarge amount of paired training samples, however the methodology to generate\nsuch samples introduces a gap between them and real images while accounting for\nonly uniform haze distribution and overlooking more realistic scenario of\nnon-uniform haze distribution resulting in inferior dehazing performance when\nevaluated on real datasets. Despite this, the abundance of paired samples\nwithin synthetic datasets cannot be ignored. Thus to ensure performance\nconsistency across diverse datasets, we train the proposed network within an\nadversarial prior-guided framework that relies on a generated image along with\nits low and high frequency components to determine if properties of dehazed\nimages matches those of ground truth. We preform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the dehazing and domain invariance performance of proposed framework\nacross diverse domains and report state-of-the-art (SoTA) results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 14:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}
