The second gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-2)\nfrom LIGO/Virgo contains BBH events out to redshifts $z \\sim 1$, with component\nmasses in the range $\\sim5$--$80\\,M_\\odot$. In this catalog, the biggest black\nholes, with $m_1 \\gtrsim 45\\,M_\\odot$, are only found at the highest redshifts,\n$z \\gtrsim 0.4$. We ask whether the absence of high-mass BBH observations at\nlow redshift indicates that the astrophysical BBH mass distribution evolves:\nthe biggest BBHs only merge at high redshift, and cease merging at low\nredshift. Alternatively, this feature might be explained by gravitational-wave\nselection effects. Modeling the BBH primary mass spectrum as a power law with a\nsharp maximum mass cutoff (Truncated model), we find that the cutoff increases\nwith redshift ($> 99.9\\%$ credibility). An abrupt cutoff in the mass spectrum\nis expected from (pulsational) pair instability supernova simulations; however,\nGWTC-2 is only consistent with a Truncated mass model if the location of the\ncutoff increases from $45^{+13}_{-5}\\,M_\\odot$ at $z < 0.4$ to\n$80^{+16}_{-13}\\,M_\\odot$ at $z > 0.4$. Alternatively, if the primary mass\nspectrum has a break in the power law (Broken power law) at\n${38^{+15}_{-8}\\,M_\\odot}$, rather than a sharp cutoff, the data are consistent\nwith a non-evolving mass distribution. In this case, the overall rate of\nmergers, at all masses, increases with increasing redshift. Future observations\nwill confidently distinguish between a sharp maximum mass cutoff that evolves\nwith redshift and a non-evolving mass distribution with a gradual taper, such\nas a Broken power law. After $\\sim 100$ BBH merger observations, a continued\nabsence of high-mass, low-redshift events would provide a clear signature that\nthe mass distribution evolves with redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 16:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 17:45:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

To reduce the computation\noverhead, previous works have proposed various neighbor sampling methods that\nestimate the aggregation result based on a small number of sampled neighbors.\nAlthough these methods have successfully accelerated the training, they mainly\nfocus on the single-machine setting. As real-world graphs are large, training\nGCNs in distributed systems is desirable. However, we found that the existing\nneighbor sampling methods do not work well in a distributed setting.\nSpecifically, a naive implementation may incur a huge amount of communication\nof feature vectors among different machines. To address this problem, we\npropose a communication-efficient neighbor sampling method in this work. Our\nmain idea is to assign higher sampling probabilities to the local nodes so that\nremote nodes are accessed less frequently.

If successful, web-based\nmental health conversations could improve access to treatment and reduce the\nglobal disease burden. Psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated that empathy,\nthe ability to understand and feel the emotions and experiences of others, is a\nkey component leading to positive outcomes in supportive conversations.\nHowever, recent studies have shown that highly empathic conversations are rare\nin online mental health platforms.\n  In this paper, we work towards improving empathy in online mental health\nsupport conversations. We introduce a new task of empathic rewriting which aims\nto transform low-empathy conversational posts to higher empathy. Learning such\ntransformations is challenging and requires a deep understanding of empathy\nwhile maintaining conversation quality through text fluency and specificity to\nthe conversational context. Here we propose PARTNER, a deep reinforcement\nlearning agent that learns to make sentence-level edits to posts in order to\nincrease the expressed level of empathy while maintaining conversation quality.\nOur RL agent leverages a policy network, based on a transformer language model\nadapted from GPT-2, which performs the dual task of generating candidate\nempathic sentences and adding those sentences at appropriate positions. During\ntraining, we reward transformations that increase empathy in posts while\nmaintaining text fluency, context specificity and diversity. Through a\ncombination of automatic and human evaluation, we demonstrate that PARTNER\nsuccessfully generates more empathic, specific, and diverse responses and\noutperforms NLP methods from related tasks like style transfer and empathic\ndialogue generation.

A substantial number of these tumors are\nnever surgically removed but rather monitored over time. Automatic and precise\nmeningioma segmentation is therefore beneficial to enable reliable growth\nestimation and patient-specific treatment planning. In this study, we propose\nthe inclusion of attention mechanisms over a U-Net architecture: (i)\nAttention-gated U-Net (AGUNet) and (ii) Dual Attention U-Net (DAUNet), using a\n3D MRI volume as input. Attention has the potential to leverage the global\ncontext and identify features' relationships across the entire volume. To limit\nspatial resolution degradation and loss of detail inherent to encoder-decoder\narchitectures, we studied the impact of multi-scale input and deep supervision\ncomponents. The proposed architectures are trainable end-to-end and each\nconcept can be seamlessly disabled for ablation studies. The validation studies\nwere performed using a 5-fold cross validation over 600 T1-weighted MRI volumes\nfrom St. Olavs University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway. For the best performing\narchitecture, an average Dice score of 81.6% was reached for an F1-score of\n95.6%. With an almost perfect precision of 98%, meningiomas smaller than 3ml\nwere occasionally missed hence reaching an overall recall of 93%. Leveraging\nglobal context from a 3D MRI volume provided the best performances, even if the\nnative volume resolution could not be processed directly. Overall, near-perfect\ndetection was achieved for meningiomas larger than 3ml which is relevant for\nclinical use. In the future, the use of multi-scale designs and refinement\nnetworks should be further investigated to improve the performance. A larger\nnumber of cases with meningiomas below 3ml might also be needed to improve the\nperformance for the smallest tumors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 16:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

While the black hole mass (MBH) can be robustly measured with\ndynamical methods in bright type 1 AGN, where the variable primary emission and\nthe broad line region (BLR) are directly observed, a direct measurement is\nconsiderably more challenging if not impossible for the vast majority of\nheavily obscured type 2 AGN. In this work, we tested the validity of an\nX-ray-based scaling method to constrain the MBH in heavily absorbed AGN. To\nthis end, we utilized a sample of type 2 AGN with good-quality hard X-ray data\nobtained by the nuSTAR satellite and with MBH dynamically constrained from\nmegamaser measurements. Our results indicate that, when the X-ray broadband\nspectra are fitted with physically motivated self-consistent models that\nproperly account for absorption, scattering, and emission line contributions\nfrom the putative torus and constrain the primary X-ray emission, then the\nX-ray scaling method yields MBH values that are consistent with those\ndetermined from megamaser measurements within their respective uncertainties.\nWith this method we can therefore systematically determine the MBH in any type\n2 AGN, provided that they possess good-quality X-ray data and accrete at a\nmoderate to high rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 17:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

It has also been\nproposed that the SGI might lead to the formation of planetesimals during the\nnon-linear phase of the instability. In this context, we employ two-fluid\nhydrodynamical simulations with self-gravity to study the non-axisymmetric,\nnon-linear evolution of ringed perturbations that grow under the action of the\nSGI. We find that the non-linear evolution outcome of the SGI depends mainly on\nthe initial linear growth rate. For SGI growth rates smaller than typically\n$\\sigma \\gtrsim 10^{-4}-10^{-5}\\Omega$, dissipation resulting from dust\nfeedback introduces a $m=1$ spiral wave in the gas, even for Toomre gas\nstability parameters $Q_g>2$ for which non-axisymmetric instabilities appear in\na purely gaseous disc. This one-armed spiral subsequently traps dust particles\nuntil a dust-to-gas ratio $\\epsilon \\sim 1$ is achieved. For higher linear\ngrowth rates, the dust ring is found to undergo gravitational collapse until\nthe bump in the surface density profile becomes strong enough to trigger the\nformation of dusty vortices through the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI).\nEnhancements in dust density resulting from this process are found to scale\nwith the linear growth rate, and can be such that the dust density is higher\nthan the Roche density, leading to the formation of bound clumps.

The intrinsic absence of (conventional or parton-like) mean-field\nconstruction also means that, within the traditional approaches, it will be\ndifficult to decide whether a non-Lagrangian state can actually emerge from a\nspecific UV system (such as a lattice spin system). For this purpose we\nhypothesize that a quantum state is emergible from a lattice system if its\nquantum anomalies match with the constraints from the (generalized)\nLieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems.

Without accounting for\nionization and dust depletion effects, we find that the HI-weighted gas-phase\nmetallicity evolution of subDLAs are consistent with damped Lyman alpha systems\n(DLAs). When ionization corrections are included, subDLAs are systematically\nmore metal-poor than DLAs (between ~0.5 sigma and ~3 sigma significance) by up\nto ~1.0 dex over the redshift range 3<=z<=4.3. The correlation of gas-phase\n[Si/Fe] with metallicity in subDLAs appears to be consistent with that of DLAs,\nsuggesting that the two classes of absorbers have a similar relative dust\ndepletion pattern.

Since star formation history and the phase-space characteristics of the\nstars are important for the evolution of the discs, we start simulating the\nevolution of the star cluster with the results of molecular cloud collapse\nsimulations. In the simulation we form stars with circumstellar discs, which\ncan be affected by different processes.

These late formed discs have a better chance of\nsurvival because the cluster gradually expands with time, and a lower local\nstellar density reduces the effects of photoevaporation and dynamical\ntruncation. Late formed discs can then be present in regions of high UV\nradiation, solving the proplyd lifetime problem.

A pair of cubic test masses is hosted inside the LISA-Pathfinder\nspacecraft and shielded from any force other than the interplanetary\ngravitational field. The purity of the shielding gives the performance of the\nmission.\n  There are a number of aspects that had to be confirmed in-flight. One of them\nis the transition phase from the launch configuration, when the test masses are\nlocked, to the science free-falling configuration. Each test mass is initially\nreleased from the mechanical constraints via a dedicated mechanism and then\ncaptured by an electrostatic control system. In fact, each test mass is\nsurrounded by a set of electrodes for actuation and sensing purposes. The\nperformance criterion of the release is the final velocity of the test mass\nrelative to the spacecraft, with an upper threshold set to 5 $\\mu m/s$. The\nLISA-Pathfinder first in-flight release velocities highlighted an unexpected\ndynamics with large linear and angular velocities. The electrostatic control\nwas successful, but only relying on a manual procedure that cannot be\nconsidered as baseline for LISA.\n  This paper helps investigating the in-flight non-compliance by dealing with\nthe modeling of the electrostatic environment around each test mass and its\ncontribution to the release and capture dynamics. The electrostatic model is\nbased on the method of moments, a boundary element numerical technique suitable\nfor estimating forces and capacitances between conductors.

Due to their rapid increase in capacity, contemporary wind\nfarms need to adhere to strict constraints on power output to ensure stability\nof the electricity grid. Specifically, a wind farm controller is required to\nmatch the farm's power production with a power demand imposed by the grid\noperator. This is a non-trivial optimization problem, as complex dependencies\nexist between the wind turbines. State-of-the-art wind farm control typically\nrelies on physics-based heuristics that fail to capture the full load spectrum\nthat defines a turbine's health status. When this is not taken into account,\nthe long-term viability of the farm's turbines is put at risk. Given the\ncomplex dependencies that determine a turbine's lifetime, learning a flexible\nand optimal control strategy requires a data-driven approach. However, as wind\nfarms are large-scale multi-agent systems, optimizing control strategies over\nthe full joint action space is intractable. We propose a new learning method\nfor wind farm control that leverages the sparse wind farm structure to\nfactorize the optimization problem. Using a Bayesian approach, based on\nmulti-agent Thompson sampling, we explore the factored joint action space for\nconfigurations that match the demand, while considering the lifetime of\nturbines. We apply our method to a grid-like wind farm layout, and evaluate\nconfigurations using a state-of-the-art wind flow simulator. Our results are\ncompetitive with a physics-based heuristic approach in terms of demand error,\nwhile, contrary to the heuristic, our method prolongs the lifetime of high-risk\nturbines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 20:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-21"}

However, most\nexisting works are dedicated to improve the prediction accuracy through either\ncreating new model architectures, increasing model complexity, or refining\nmodel parameters by training on larger datasets. Here, we propose an\nalternative idea, differing from existing work, to increase model accuracy and\nalso to shape model predictions to align with human understandings through\nautomatically creating higher-level summarizing labels for similar groups of\nhuman activities. First, we argue the importance and feasibility of\nconstructing a hierarchical labeling system for human activity recognition.\nThen, we utilize the predictions of a black box HAR model to identify\nsimilarities between different activities. Finally, we tailor hierarchical\nclustering methods to automatically generate hierarchical trees of activities\nand conduct experiments. In this system, the activity labels on the same level\nwill have a designed magnitude of accuracy and reflect a specific amount of\nactivity details. This strategy enables a trade-off between the extent of the\ndetails in the recognized activity and the user privacy by masking some\nsensitive predictions; and also provides possibilities for the use of formerly\nprohibited invasive models in privacy-concerned scenarios. Since the hierarchy\nis generated from the machine's perspective, the predictions at the upper\nlevels provide better accuracy, which is especially useful when there are too\ndetailed labels in the training set that are rather trivial to the final\nprediction goal. Moreover, the analysis of the structure of these trees can\nreveal the biases in the prediction model and guide future data collection\nstrategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 20:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

Reproducing these steps correctly is central for the\ndescription of dissociation and charge-transfer processes in density functional\ntheory (DFT): The steps align the KS eigenvalues of the dissociating subsystems\nrelative to each other and determine where electrons localize. While the step\nheight can be calculated from the asymptotic behavior of the KS orbitals, this\nprovides limited insight into what causes the steps. We give an explanation of\nthe steps with an exact mapping of the many-electron problem to a one-electron\nproblem, the exact electron factorizaton (EEF). The potentials appearing in the\nEEF have a clear physical meaning that translates to the DFT potentials by\nreplacing the interacting many-electron system with the KS system. With a\nsimple model of a diatomic, we illustrate that the steps are a consequence of\nspatial electron entanglement and are the result of a charge transfer. From\nthis mechanism, the step height can immediately be deduced. Moreover, two\nmethods to approximately reproduce the potentials during dissociation suggest\nthemselves. One is based on the states of the dissociated system, while the\nother one is based on an analogy to the Born-Oppenheimer treatment of a\nmolecule. The latter method also shows that the steps connect adiabatic\npotential energy surfaces.

To this end, the InAs/GaSb interface is\ncompared and contrasted with the HgTe/CdTe interface. Density functional theory\n(DFT) simulations of these interfaces are performed using a machine-learned\nHubbard U correction [npj Comput. Mater. 6, 180 (2020)]. For the HgTe/CdTe\ninterface our simulations show that band crossing is achieved and an inverted\ngap is obtained at a critical thickness of 5.1 nm of HgTe, in agreement with\nexperiment and previous DFT calculations. In contrast, for InAs/GaSb the gap\nnarrows with increasing thickness of InAs; however the gap does not close for\ninterfaces with up to 50 layers (about 15 nm) of each material. When an\nexternal electric field is applied across the InAs/GaSb interface, the\nGaSb-derived valence band maximum is shifted up in energy with respect to the\nInAs-derived conduction band minimum until eventually the bands cross and an\ninverted gap opens. Our results show that it may be possible to reach the\ntopological regime at the InAs/GaSb interface under the right conditions.\nHowever, it may be challenging to realize these conditions experimentally,\nwhich explains the difficulty of experimentally demonstrating an inverted gap\nin InAs/GaSb.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 21:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

These electric energies\nare calculated as a function of the ion concentration of the electrolyte. The\nwork needed to build up the charged sphere (i.e. the total charge-charge\ninteraction energy) decreases with increasing ion concentration of the\nelectrolyte because of the screening effect of the electrolyte on the\ncharge-charge interaction.

Although quite a few recent works have been performed on testing of\nDNNs in the context of image and speech processing, limited progress has been\nachieved so far on DNN testing in the context of source code processing, that\nexhibits rather unique characteristics and challenges.\n  In this paper, we propose a search-based testing framework for DNNs of source\ncode embedding and its downstream processing tasks like Code Search. To\ngenerate new test inputs, we adopt popular source code refactoring tools to\ngenerate the semantically equivalent variants. For more effective testing, we\nleverage the DNN mutation testing to guide the testing direction. To\ndemonstrate the usefulness of our technique, we perform a large-scale\nevaluation on popular DNNs of source code processing based on multiple\nstate-of-the-art code embedding methods (i.e., Code2vec, Code2seq and\nCodeBERT).

Supervisory control and data acquisition\n(SCADA) makes it possible to train networks through continuously providing not\nonly operation parameters and performance parameters of wind turbines but also\nenvironmental parameters and operation modes. This paper explores the\npossibility that using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) and domain adaption learning to establish\nintelligent diagnosis frameworks under different training scenarios.\nSpecifically, PGANC and PGANT are proposed for sufficient and non-sufficient\ntarget wind turbine labeled data, respectively.

Model validation on three\nwind turbine SCADA data shows that two-stage training can effectively improve\nthe model performance. Besides, if there is no sufficient labeled data for a\ntarget turbine, which is an extremely common phenomenon in real industrial\npractices, the addition of domain adaption learning makes the trained model\nshow better performance.

By systematizing\npower system related experiences of historical earthquakes, and collecting\npractical and innovative ideas from other regions on how to enhance network\ndesign, construction, and operation, important steps are being taken toward a\nmore resilient, earthquake-resistant grid. This paper presents relevant\nfindings in an effort to be an overview and a useful guideline for those who\nare also working towards greater electrical grid resilience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 02:17:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 12:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

The training process in these methods is\nformulated into two steps. They firstly train a neural network under weak\nsupervision to generate pseudo ground truths (PGTs). Then, these PGTs are used\nto train another network under full supervision. Compared with fully supervised\nmethods, the training process in weakly supervised methods becomes more complex\nand time-consuming. Furthermore, overwhelming negative proposals are involved\nat the first step. This is neglected by most methods, which makes the training\nnetwork biased towards to negative proposals and thus degrades the quality of\nthe PGTs, limiting the training network performance at the second step. Online\nproposal sampling is an intuitive solution to these issues. However, lacking of\nadequate labeling, a simple online proposal sampling may make the training\nnetwork stuck into local minima. To solve this problem, we propose an Online\nActive Proposal Set Generation (OPG) algorithm. Our OPG algorithm consists of\ntwo parts: Dynamic Proposal Constraint (DPC) and Proposal Partition (PP). DPC\nis proposed to dynamically determine different proposal sampling strategy\naccording to the current training state. PP is used to score each proposal,\npart proposals into different sets and generate an active proposal set for the\nnetwork optimization. Through experiments, our proposed OPG shows consistent\nand significant improvement on both datasets PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012, yielding\ncomparable performance to the state-of-the-art results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 02:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-21"}

Ultra-massive (UM) MIMO with hybrid beamforming\narchitectures are widely investigated to provide a high array gain to overcome\nthe huge propagation loss. However, most of the existing hybrid beamforming\narchitectures can only utilize the multiplexing offered by the multipath\ncomponents, i.e., inter-path multiplexing, which is very limited due to the\nspatially sparse THz channel. In this paper, a widely-spaced multi-subarray\n(WSMS) hybrid beamforming architecture is proposed, which improves the\nmultiplexing gain by exploiting a new type of intra-path multiplexing provided\nby the spherical-wave propagation among k widely-spaced subarrays, in addition\nto the inter-path multiplexing. The resulting multiplexing gain of WSMS\narchitecture is k times of the existing architectures. To harness WSMS hybrid\nbeamforming, a novel design problem is formulated by optimizing the number of\nsubarrays, subarray spacing, and hybrid beamforming matrices to maximize the\nspectral efficiency, which is decomposed into two subproblems. An optimal\nclosed-form solution is derived for the first hybrid beamforming subproblem,\nwhile a dominant-line-of-sight-relaxation algorithm is proposed for the second\narray configuration subproblem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that\nthe WSMS architecture and proposed algorithms substantially enhance the\nspectral efficiency and energy efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 02:42:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 11:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

The current state-of-the-art\napproaches for medical image classification rely on using the de-facto method\nfor ConvNets - fine-tuning. However, there are fundamental differences between\nnatural images and medical images, which based on existing evidence from the\nliterature, limits the overall performance gain when designed with algorithmic\napproaches. In this paper, we propose to go beyond fine-tuning by introducing a\nnovel framework called MorphHR, in which we highlight a new transfer learning\nscheme. The idea behind the proposed framework is to integrate\nfunction-preserving transformations, for any continuous non-linear activation\nneurons, to internally regularise the network for improving mammograms\nclassification. The proposed solution offers two major advantages over the\nexisting techniques. Firstly and unlike fine-tuning, the proposed approach\nallows for modifying not only the last few layers but also several of the first\nones on a deep ConvNet. By doing this, we can design the network front to be\nsuitable for learning domain specific features. Secondly, the proposed scheme\nis scalable to hardware. Therefore, one can fit high resolution images on\nstandard GPU memory. We show that by using high resolution images, one prevents\nlosing relevant information. We demonstrate, through numerical and visual\nexperiments, that the proposed approach yields to a significant improvement in\nthe classification performance over state-of-the-art techniques, and is indeed\non a par with radiology experts.

However, training GNNs on very large graphs that do not fit in GPU\nmemory is still a challenging task. Unlike conventional neural networks,\nmini-batching input samples in GNNs requires complicated tasks such as\ntraversing neighboring nodes and gathering their feature values. While this\nprocess accounts for a significant portion of the training time, we find\nexisting GNN implementations using popular deep neural network (DNN) libraries\nsuch as PyTorch are limited to a CPU-centric approach for the entire data\npreparation step. This \"all-in-CPU\" approach has negative impact on the overall\nGNN training performance as it over-utilizes CPU resources and hinders GPU\nacceleration of GNN training. To overcome such limitations, we introduce\nPyTorch-Direct, which enables a GPU-centric data accessing paradigm for GNN\ntraining. In PyTorch-Direct, GPUs are capable of efficiently accessing\ncomplicated data structures in host memory directly without CPU intervention.\nOur microbenchmark and end-to-end GNN training results show that PyTorch-Direct\nreduces data transfer time by 47.1% on average and speeds up GNN training by up\nto 1.6x. Furthermore, by reducing CPU utilization, PyTorch-Direct also saves\nsystem power by 12.4% to 17.5% during training. To minimize programmer effort,\nwe introduce a new \"unified tensor\" type along with necessary changes to the\nPyTorch memory allocator, dispatch logic, and placement rules.

Due to the characteristic volume-surface coupling, global existence\nof solutions to general systems is a challenging issue. In particular, the\nduality method, which is powerful in dealing with mass conserved systems in\ndomains, is not applicable on its own. In this paper, we introduce a new family\nof $L^p$-energy functions and combine them with a suitable duality method for\nvolume-surface systems, to ultimately obtain global existence of classical\nsolutions under a general assumption called the \\textit{intermediate sum\ncondition}. For systems that conserve mass, but do not satisfy this condition,\nglobal solutions are shown under a quasi-uniform condition, that is, under the\nassumption that the diffusion coefficients are close to each other. In the case\nof mass dissipation, we also show that the solution is bounded uniformly in\ntime by studying the system on each time-space cylinder of unit size, and\nshowing that the solution is sup-norm bounded independently of the cylinder.\nApplications of our results include global existence and boundedness for\nsystems arising from membrane protein clustering or activation of Cdc42 in cell\npolarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-21"}

The survey revealed distinctive\napproaches, including one where fans gathered at a venue but were isolated from\nthe idol member by an acrylic plate and talked via a video call. Then the\ninterviews not only provided answers to why such an approach would be\nreasonable but also suggested the existence of a large gap between conventional\noffline events and emerging online events in their perceptions. Based on the\nresults, I discussed how we can develop interaction techniques to support this\ntransition and how we can apply it to other situations outside idol culture,\nsuch as computer-mediated performing arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 07:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-21"}

Specifically, for the former problem, we introduce a control\nsignal which can control the macroscopic sentence attributes, such as sentence\nquality, sentence length, sentence tense and number of nouns etc. With such a\ncontrol signal, the controllability and diversity of existing captioning models\nare enhanced.

The limitation\nis due to the restricted model architecture related to fixed input and output\ndimensions. This hinders the experience accumulation and transfer of the\nlearned agent over tasks with diverse levels of difficulty (e.g. 3 vs 3 or 5 vs\n6 multi-agent games). In this paper, we make the first attempt to explore a\nuniversal multi-agent reinforcement learning pipeline, designing one single\narchitecture to fit tasks with the requirement of different observation and\naction configurations. Unlike previous RNN-based models, we utilize a\ntransformer-based model to generate a flexible policy by decoupling the policy\ndistribution from the intertwined input observation with an importance weight\nmeasured by the merits of the self-attention mechanism. Compared to a standard\ntransformer block, the proposed model, named as Universal Policy Decoupling\nTransformer (UPDeT), further relaxes the action restriction and makes the\nmulti-agent task's decision process more explainable. UPDeT is general enough\nto be plugged into any multi-agent reinforcement learning pipeline and equip\nthem with strong generalization abilities that enables the handling of multiple\ntasks at a time. Extensive experiments on large-scale SMAC multi-agent\ncompetitive games demonstrate that the proposed UPDeT-based multi-agent\nreinforcement learning achieves significant results relative to\nstate-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating advantageous transfer capability in\nterms of both performance and training speed (10 times faster).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 07:24:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 05:12:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2021 10:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

As a solution\nstrategy, first, we propose optimal polynomial time algorithms for the power\ncontrol problem considering constant and continuous rate models based on the\nevaluation of Perron-Frobenius conditions and usage of bisection method,\nrespectively.

Therefore, this\npaper focuses on a small (<=200) number of Devices, with the purpose to\nidentify the limits of each approach in terms of number of devices.\nSpecifically, to identify where it is beneficial to form a cluster, investigate\nthe critical point that gains increases rapidly and at the end examine the\napplicability of 5G requirements. Additionally, prior work presented a\nDistributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) Solution/Framework in D2D and a DAIS\nTransmission Mode Selection (TMS) plan was proposed. In this paper DAIS is\nfurther examined, improved in terms of thresholds evaluation, evaluated, and\ncompared with other approaches (AI/ML). The results obtained demonstrate the\nexceptional performance of DAIS, compared to all other related approaches in\nterms of SE, PC, execution time and cluster formation efficiency. Also, results\nshow that the investigated AI/ML approaches are also beneficial for\nTransmission Mode Selection (TMS) in 5G D2D communication, even with a smaller\n(i.e., >=5 D2D Relay,>=50 D2D Multi Hop Relay) numbers of devices as a lower\nlimits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 08:11:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 10:59:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 16:22:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 05:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-29"}

Most existing approaches use inner-product of node embedding to\nmeasure the similarity between nodes leading to the fact that they lack the\ncapacity to capture complex relationships among nodes. Besides, they take the\npath in the network just as structural auxiliary information when inferring\nnode embeddings, while paths in the network are formed with rich user\ninformations which are semantically relevant and cannot be ignored. In this\npaper, We propose a novel method called Network Embedding on the Metric of\nRelation, abbreviated as NEMR, which can learn the embeddings of nodes in a\nrelational metric space efficiently. First, our NEMR models the relationships\namong nodes in a metric space with deep learning methods including variational\ninference that maps the relationship of nodes to a gaussian distribution so as\nto capture the uncertainties. Secondly, our NEMR considers not only the\nequivalence of multiple-paths but also the natural order of a single-path when\ninferring embeddings of nodes, which makes NEMR can capture the multiple\nrelationships among nodes since multiple paths contain rich user information,\ne.g., age, hobby and profession.

The\nphysical boundaries of domains in numerical simulations of multiphase flows are\ngenerally defined by a conformal unstructured mesh which, depending on the\ncomplexity of the physical system, results in time-consuming mesh generation\nwhich frequently requires user-intervention.

The\ndiffuse-interface approach allows for the use of a simple structured meshes to\nbe used while still capturing the desired physical (e.g., solid-fluid)\nboundaries. In this work, a novel diffuse-interface method for the imposition\nof physical boundaries is developed for the incompressible two-fluid multiphase\nflow model. This model is appropriate for dispersed multiphase flows which are\npervasive in chemical engineering processes, in that this flow regime results\nin high levels of mass and energy transfer between phases.

The most important factor in\ncomparing this effect is Linear Energy Transfer (LET). Protons and carbons are\nheavy ions with high LET. Since these ions lose energy through collisions as\nthey move through the tissue, their range is not long. This loss of energy\nincreases along the way, and the maximum energy loss is reached at the end of\nthe range. This whole process is represented by the Bragg curve. The input dose\nof the Bragg curve, full width at half maximum (FWHM) value, Bragg peak\namplitude and position, and Penumbra thickness are important factors in\ndetermining which particle is advantageous in tumor treatment. While heavy ions\nmove through the tissue, small deviations occur in their direction of travel\ndue to Coulomb collisions. These small deviations cause lateral straggle in the\ndose profile. Lateral straggle is important in determining the type and energy\nof the particle used in tumor treatments close to critical organs.

A remarkable finding is\na nonmonotonic behavior of the peak aggregation density with respect to the\nadaptation time; more specifically, aggregation is the most enhanced when the\nadaptation time is comparable to or moderately larger than the mean run time of\nbacteria. Another curious observation is the formation of a trapezoidal\naggregation profile occurring at a very large adaptation time, where the biased\nmotion of individual cells is rather hindered at the plateau regimes due to the\nboundedness of the tumbling frequency modulation. Asymptotic analysis of the\nkinetic transport system is also carried out, and a novel asymptotic equation\nis obtained at the large adaptation-time regime while the Keller-Segel type\nequations are obtained when the adaptation time is moderate.

In this work, a data-driven meal bolus\ndecision method is proposed without the need of subject-specific glucose\nmanagement parameters. The postprandial glucose dynamics is learnt using\nGaussian process regression. Considering the asymmetric risks of hyper- and\nhypoglycemia and the uncertainties in the predicted glucose trajectories, an\nasymmetric risk-sensitive cost function is designed. Bayesian optimization is\nutilized to solve the optimization problem, since the gradient of the cost\nfunction is unavailable. The proposed approach is evaluated using the 10-adult\ncohort of the FDA-accepted UVA/Padova T1DM simulator and compared with the\nstandard insulin bolus calculator. For the case of announced meals, the\nproposed method achieves satisfactory and similar performance in terms of mean\nglucose and percentage time in [70, 180] mg/dL without increasing the risk of\nhypoglycemia. Similar results are observed for the case without the meal\ninformation (assuming that the patient follows a consistent diet) and the case\nof basal rate mismatches. In addition, advisory-mode analysis is performed\nbased on clinical data, which indicates that the method can determine safe and\nreasonable meal boluses in real clinical settings.

Failure to ignore the\nrandom effects can result in misinterpreted spectra and, consequently, in\nmisleading diagnostic reasoning. This fact has not been often addressed in the\nresearch so far. In this paper, we propose an approach to the quantification of\nthe spectral uncertainty, which relies on evaluating the uncertainty of the\nequivalent circuit model (ECM). We apply the computationally efficient\nvariational Bayes (VB) method and compare the quality of the results with those\nobtained with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Namely, MCMC\nalgorithm returns accurate distributions of the estimated model parameters,\nwhile VB approach provides the approximate distributions. By using simulated\nand real data we show that approximate results provided by VB approach,\nalthough slightly over-optimistic, are still close to the more realistic MCMC\nestimates. A great advantage of the VB method for online monitoring is low\ncomputational load, which is several orders of magnitude lower compared to\nMCMC. The performance of VB algorithm is demonstrated on a case of ECM\nparameters estimation in a 6 cell solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack.

In this\npaper, we overcome both limitations by proposing a new Prototype-centered\nAttentive Learning (PAL) model composed of two novel components. First, a\nprototype-centered contrastive learning loss is introduced to complement the\nconventional query-centered learning objective, in order to make full use of\nthe limited training samples in each episode. Second, PAL further integrates a\nhybrid attentive learning mechanism that can minimize the negative impacts of\noutliers and promote class separation. Extensive experiments on four standard\nfew-shot action benchmarks show that our method clearly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods, with the improvement particularly significant (10+\\%)\non the most challenging fine-grained action recognition benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 11:48:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 23:39:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 16:22:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 17:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

If, after eliminating all non-gravitational interactions between\nthem, the particles become entangled, one can conclude that the gravitational\npotential is induced via a quantum mediator, i.e. a virtual graviton. In this\npaper, we examine a range of different experimental set-ups, considering\ndifferent geometries and the number of spatially superposed states taken, in\norder to determine which would generate entanglement faster. We conclude that\nwithout decoherence, and given a maximum distance $\\Delta x$ between any two\nspatial states of a superposition, a set of two qubits placed in spatial\nsuperposition parallel to one another will outperform all other models given\nrealistic experimental parameters. Furthermore, when a sufficiently high\ndecoherence rate is introduced, multi-component superpositions can outperform\nthe two-qubit set-up. This is further verified with an experimental simulation,\nshowing that $O(10^3)$ measurements are required to reject the no entanglement\nhypothesis with a parallel qubits set-up without decoherence at a 99.9$\\%$\nconfidence level. The number of measurements increases when decoherence is\nintroduced. When the decoherence rate reaches $0.125$~Hz, 6-dimensional qudits\nare required as the two-qubit system entanglement cannot be witnessed anymore.\nHowever, in this case, $O(10^6)$ measurements will be required. One can group\nthe witness operators to measure in order to reduce the number of measurements\n(up to ten-fold). However, this may be challenging to implement experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 11:50:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 13:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

To characterize such critical dynamics, the established 'structural\ntheory' of criticality uses automata network connectivity and node bias (to be\non or off) as tuning parameters. This parsimony in the number of parameters\nneeded sometimes leads to uncertain predictions about the dynamical regime of\nboth random and systems biology models of biochemical regulation. We derive a\nmore accurate theory of criticality by accounting for canalization, the\nexistence of redundancy that buffers automata response to inputs -- a known\nmechanism that buffers the expression of traits, keeping them close to optimal\nstates despite genetic and environmental perturbations. The new 'canalization\ntheory' of criticality is based on a measure of effective connectivity. It\ncontributes to resolving the problem of finding precise ways to design or\ncontrol network models of biochemical regulation for desired dynamical\nbehavior. Our analyses reveal that effective connectivity significantly\nimproves the prediction of critical behavior in random automata network\nensembles. We also show that the average effective connectivity of a large\nbattery of systems biology models is much lower than the connectivity of their\noriginal interaction structure. This suggests that canalization has been\nselected to dynamically reduce and homogenize the seemingly heterogeneous\nconnectivity of biochemical networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 13:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

In conclusion, researchers\ntechnological competency, along with meticulous methods and reports pertinent\nto software, hardware, and VRISE, are paramount to ensure the health and safety\nstandards and the reliability of neuroscientific results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 13:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-21"}

However, NAS is typically compute-intensive\nbecause multiple models need to be evaluated before choosing the best one. To\nreduce the computational power and time needed, a proxy task is often used for\nevaluating each model instead of full training. In this paper, we evaluate\nconventional reduced-training proxies and quantify how well they preserve\nranking between multiple models during search when compared with the rankings\nproduced by final trained accuracy. We propose a series of zero-cost proxies,\nbased on recent pruning literature, that use just a single minibatch of\ntraining data to compute a model's score. Our zero-cost proxies use 3 orders of\nmagnitude less computation but can match and even outperform conventional\nproxies. For example, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between final\nvalidation accuracy and our best zero-cost proxy on NAS-Bench-201 is 0.82,\ncompared to 0.61 for EcoNAS (a recently proposed reduced-training proxy).\nFinally, we use these zero-cost proxies to enhance existing NAS search\nalgorithms such as random search, reinforcement learning, evolutionary search\nand predictor-based search. For all search methodologies and across three\ndifferent NAS datasets, we are able to significantly improve sample efficiency,\nand thereby decrease computation, by using our zero-cost proxies.

These phase transitions are initiated by the\nnucleation of a drop in a supersaturated vapor and of a bubble in an\noverstretched liquid respectively. The surface tension between both phases,\nliquid and vapor, is a key parameter in the development of such nucleation\nstage. Whereas the surface tension can be readily measured for a flat\ninterface, there are technical and conceptual limitations to obtain it for the\ncurved interface of the nucleus. On the technical side, it is quite difficult\nto observe a critical nucleus in experiments. From a conceptual point of view,\nthe interfacial free energy depends on the choice of the dividing surface,\nbeing the surface of tension the one relevant for nucleation. We bypass the\ntechnical limitation by performing simulations of a Lennard Jones fluid where\nwe equilibrate critical nuclei (both drops and bubbles). Regarding the\nconceptual hurdle, we find the relevant cluster size by searching the radius\nthat correctly predicts nucleation rates and nucleation free energy barriers\nwhen combined with Classical Nucleation Theory. With such definition of the\ncluster size we find the same value of the surface tension for drops and\nbubbles of a given radius. Thus, condensation and boiling can be viewed as two\nsides of the same coin. Finally, we combine the data coming from drops and\nbubbles to obtain, via two different routes, estimates of the Tolman length, a\nparameter that allows describing the curvature dependence of the surface\ntension in a theoretical framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 14:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-21"}

Motivated by how humans\ndistinguish good exploration behaviors by looking into the entire episode, we\nintroduce RAPID, a simple yet effective episode-level exploration method for\nprocedurally-generated environments.

(ii) Most of\nthe loss functions ignore the imbalance problem in BBR that the large number of\nanchor boxes which have small overlaps with the target boxes contribute most to\nthe optimization of BBR. To mitigate the adverse effects caused thereby, we\nperform thorough studies to exploit the potential of BBR losses in this paper.\nFirstly, an Efficient Intersection over Union (EIOU) loss is proposed, which\nexplicitly measures the discrepancies of three geometric factors in BBR, i.e.,\nthe overlap area, the central point and the side length. After that, we state\nthe Effective Example Mining (EEM) problem and propose a regression version of\nfocal loss to make the regression process focus on high-quality anchor boxes.\nFinally, the above two parts are combined to obtain a new loss function, namely\nFocal-EIOU loss.

This study offers guidelines for the development of VR\nsoftware in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology, by describing and\ndiscussing the stages of the development of Virtual Reality Everyday Assessment\nLab (VR-EAL), the first neuropsychological battery in immersive VR. Techniques\nfor evaluating cognitive functions within a realistic storyline are discussed.\nThe utility of various assets in Unity, software development kits, and other\nsoftware are described so that cognitive scientists can overcome challenges\npertinent to VRISE and the quality of the VR software. In addition, this pilot\nstudy attempts to evaluate VR-EAL in accordance with the necessary criteria for\nVR software for research purposes. The VR neuroscience questionnaire (VRNQ;\nKourtesis et al., 2019b) was implemented to appraise the quality of the three\nversions of VR-EAL in terms of user experience, game mechanics, in-game\nassistance, and VRISE. Twenty-five participants aged between 20 and 45 years\nwith 12-16 years of full-time education evaluated various versions of VR-EAL.\nThe final version of VR-EAL achieved high scores in every sub-score of the VRNQ\nand exceeded its parsimonious cut-offs. It also appeared to have better in-game\nassistance and game mechanics, while its improved graphics substantially\nincreased the quality of the user experience and almost eradicated VRISE. The\nresults substantially support the feasibility of the development of effective\nVR research and clinical software without the presence of VRISE during a\n60-minute VR session.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 14:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-21"}

Qualitatively, we\nfind that FSSH is able to reproduce the trends in the MCTDH dynamics with (and\nwithout) an explicit external field; however, no set of FSSH parameters is\nideal. An adequate treatment of the overcoherence in FSSH is identified as the\ndriving factor to improve the description of the excitation process with\nrespect to the MCTDH reference.

Refinement for such abstractions is crucial as it allows improvements\nof a given component without compromising its compatibility with the rest of\nthe system. In the context of session types, the most general notion of\nrefinement is the asynchronous session subtyping, which allows to anticipate\nmessage emissions but only under certain conditions. In particular,\nasynchronous session subtyping rules out candidates subtypes that occur\nnaturally in communication protocols where, e.g., two parties simultaneously\nsend each other a finite but unspecified amount of messages before removing\nthem from their respective buffers. To address this shortcoming, we study fair\ncompliance over asynchronous session types and fair refinement as the relation\nthat preserves it. This allows us to propose a novel variant of session\nsubtyping that leverages the notion of controllability from service contract\ntheory and that is a sound characterisation of fair refinement.

First, using\nthe positive frequency Wightman function from the Minkowski modes with a\nRindler transformation we provide the transition probabilities for the\ntransitions from maximally entangled symmetric and anti-symmetric Bell states\nto the collective excited state in $(1+1)$ and $(1+3)$ dimensions. We observe a\npossible case of \\emph{anti-Unruh-like} event in these transition\nprobabilities, though the $(1+1)$ and $(1+3)$ dimensional results are not\ncompletely equivalent. We infer that thermal bath plays a major role in the\noccurrence of the anti-Unruh-like effect, as it is also present in the\ntransition probabilities corresponding to a single detector in this case.\nSecond, we have considered the Green's functions in terms of the Rindler modes\nwith the vacuum of Unruh modes for estimating the same. Here the anti-Unruh\neffect appears only for the transition from the anti-symmetric state to the\ncollective excited state. It is noticed that here the $(1+1)$ and $(1+3)$\ndimensional results are equivalent, and for a single detector, we do not\nobserve any anti-Unruh effect. This suggests that the entanglement between the\nstates of the atoms is the main cause for the observed anti-Unruh effect in\nthis case. In going through the investigation, we find that the transition\nprobability for a single detector case is symmetric under the interchange\nbetween the thermal bath's temperature and the Unruh temperature for Rindler\nmode analysis; whereas this is not the case for Minkowski mode. We further\ncomment on whether this observation may shed light on the analogy between an\naccelerated observer and a real thermal bath.

As the bandwidth of the DOb increases, not only the\nperformance but also the frequency range of disturbance estimation improves yet\nthe motion controller becomes more sensitive to the noise of measurement\nsystem. This trade-off is generally explained by considering only the noise of\nsensors such as encoders. However, the digital implementation of the robust\nmotion controller may significantly influence the noise sensitivity and\nperformance of disturbance estimation in practice. This paper shows that the\nconventional DOb implemented by estimating velocity is subject to waterbed\neffect when the design parameters (i.e., sampling-time, nominal plant\nparameters and the bandwidth of the DOb) are not properly tuned in the digital\nmotion controller synthesis. Therefore, the bandwidth of disturbance estimation\nis limited by waterbed effect in addition to the noise of velocity measurement\nsystem. To facilitate the digital motion controller synthesis, the design\nconstraints of the conventional DOb are analytically derived in this paper.\nWhen the digital motion controller is implemented by estimating acceleration,\nwaterbed effect does not occur, and good robust stability and performance can\nbe achieved for all values of the design parameters of the acceleration\nmeasurement-based DOb. The bandwidth of disturbance estimation, however, cannot\nbe freely increased due to the noise of acceleration sensors in practice.

They interact globally with mean-field diffusive coupling in a certain\nvicinity and behave like uncoupled oscillators with self-feedback in the\nremaining complementary subspace. Interestingly due to this occasional\ninteraction, we find that the system shows an abrupt explosive transition from\noscillatory to death state. Further, in the explosive death transitions, the\noscillatory state and the death state coexist over a range of coupling\nstrengths near the transition point.

Due to this trend, many\ndevice manufacturers have been able to adopt more attractive user interfaces\nand high-performance applications for better user experiences on the multicore\nsystems. In this paper, we describe how to improve the real-time performance by\nreducing the user waiting time on multicore systems that use a partitioned\nper-CPU run queue scheduling technique. Rather than focusing on naive\nload-balancing scheme for equally balanced CPU usage, our approach tries to\nminimize the cost of task migration by considering the importance level of\nrunning tasks and to optimize per-CPU utilization on multicore embedded\nsystems.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and World Health\nOrganization report that one in three adults over the age of 65 and half of the\nadults over 80 fall each year. In recent years, an ever-increasing range of\napplications have been developed to help deliver more effective falls\nprevention interventions. All these applications rely on a huge elderly\npersonal database collected from hospitals, mutual health, and other\norganizations in caring for elderly. The information describing an elderly is\ncontinually evolving and may become obsolete at a given moment and contradict\nwhat we already know on the same person. So, it needs to be continuously\nchecked and updated in order to restore the database consistency and then\nprovide better service. This paper provides an outline of an Obsolete personal\nInformation Update System (OIUS) designed in the context of the elderly-fall\nprevention project. Our OIUS aims to control and update in real-time the\ninformation acquired about each older adult, provide on-demand consistent\ninformation and supply tailored interventions to caregivers and fall-risk\npatients. The approach outlined for this purpose is based on a polynomial-time\nalgorithm build on top of a causal Bayesian network representing the elderly\ndata. The result is given as a recommendation tree with some accuracy level. We\nconduct a thorough empirical study for such a model on an elderly personal\ninformation base. Experiments confirm the viability and effectiveness of our\nOIUS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

In PConv, perturbed features are\ngenerated by randomly disturbing an input tensor before performing the\nconvolution operation. This approach is simple but surprisingly effective.\nFirst, to produce a similar output even with the perturbed tensor, each layer\nin the discriminator should learn robust features having a small local\nLipschitz value. Second, since the input tensor is randomly perturbed during\nthe training procedure like the dropout in neural networks, the memorization\nproblem could be alleviated.
