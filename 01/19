Especially Jupiter type exoplanets orbiting their\nhost star in close orbits, the so-called hot and ultra-hot Jupiters, have been\nstudied in detail due to their enhanced atmospheric signature. Due to their\ntidally locked status, the temperature difference between the day- and\nnightside triggers atmospheric winds which can lead to various fingerprints in\nthe observations. Spatially resolved absorption lines during transit such as\nsodium (Na) could be a good tracer for such winds. Different works resolved the\nNa$^-$ absorption lines on different exoplanets which show different line\nwidths. Assuming that this could be attributed to such zonal jet streams, this\nwork models the effect of such winds on synthetic absorption lines. For this,\ntransiting Jupiter type planets with rotational velocities similar to hot and\nultra-hot Jupiter are considered. The investigation shows that high wind\nvelocities could reproduce the broadening of Na-line profiles inferred in\ndifferent high-resolution transit observations. There is a tendency that the\nbroadening values decrease for planets with lower equilibrium temperature.

We prove that\nentangled weights are completely and stably approximated by an efficient and\nrobust algorithm as soon as $\\mathcal O(D^2 \\times m)$ nonadaptive input-output\nsamples of the network are collected, where $D$ is the input dimension and $m$\nis the number of neurons of the network.

To circumvent a lack of\nshort-term guarantees, the {\\em broadcast approach} provides principles for\ndesigning transmission schemes that benefit from both short- and long-term\nperformance guarantees. This paper provides an overview of how to apply the\nbroadcast approach to various channels and network models under various\noperational constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 17:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

Soft moderation interventions refer to warning labels\nattached to potentially questionable or harmful content to inform other users\nabout the content and its nature while the content remains accessible, hence\nalleviating concerns related to censorship and free speech. In this work, we\nperform one of the first empirical studies on soft moderation interventions on\nTwitter.

By analyzing\ncontent engagement, we find that tweets with warning labels had more engagement\ncompared to tweets without warning labels. Also, we qualitatively analyze how\nusers interact with content that has warning labels finding that the most\npopular interactions are related to further debunking false claims, mocking the\nauthor or content of the disputed tweet, and further reinforcing or resharing\nfalse claims.

In this paper, we take a\ncomprehensive approach to close this gap by establishing a so-called notion of\n\"disaggregation difficulty metric (DDM),\" which quantifies how difficult it is\nto monitor the events of any given group of appliances based on both their\npower values and the consumer's usage behavior. Thus, DDM in essence quantifies\nhow much is expected to be gained in terms of disaggregation accuracy of a\ngeneric event-based algorithm by installing meters on the blocks of any\npartition of the appliances. Experimental results based on the REDD dataset\nillustrate the practicality of the proposed approach in addressing the\naforementioned trade-off.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 17:50:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

Our studies clearly indicate the presence of a low temperature\nferromagnetic coupling, which despite a reasonably high Mn contents of 6\\% is\nlimited only to below 30~K. A set of dedicated measurements shows that despite\na high structural quality of the material the magnetic order has a granular\nform, which gives rise to the dynamical slow-down characteristic to blocked\nsuperparamagnets. The lack of the long range order has been assigned to a very\nlow hole density, caused primarily by numerous compensation donors, arsenic\nantisites, formed in the material due to a specific geometry of the growth of\nthe shells on the nanowire template. The associated electrostatic disorder has\nformed a patchwork of spontaneously magnetized (macrospin) and nonmagnetic\n(paramagnetic) volumes in the material. Using high field results it has been\nevaluated that the total volume taken by the macrospins constitute about 2/3 of\nthe volume of the (Ga,Mn)As whereas in the remaining 1/3 only paramagnetic Mn\nions reside. By establishing the number of the uncoupled ions the two\ncontributions were separated. The Arrott plot method applied to the\nsuperparamagnetic part yielded the first experimental assessment of the\nmagnitude of the spin-spin coupling temperature within the macrospins in\n(Ga,Mn)As, $T_{\\mathrm{C}}=28$~K.

This model is\nparametrized by a dozen of free (intuitive, physically motivated) parameters,\nwhich control the statistics of the fields (density, velocity and magnetic\nfields). The present study is a proof of concept study: (i) we restrict\nourselves to the incompressible hydrodynamical part of the model, (ii) we\nconsider as data centroid velocity maps, and (iii) we let only three of the\nfree parameters vary (namely the correlation length, the Hurst parameter and\nthe intermittency parameter).

In our models, all binaries are initially\nprograde with respect to the galaxy sense of rotation. But, binaries that form\nwith a high eccentricity, $e\\gtrsim 0.7$, quickly reverse their sense of\nrotation and become almost perfectly retrograde at the moment of binary\nformation.

A system admits a finite local order only if the ground state is\ndegenerate, with at least two elements whose momenta differ, in the\nthermodynamic limit, by $\\pi$, and this order breaks translational symmetry. In\nall other cases, any local order decays to zero, algebraically (or faster) in\nthe chain length. Moreover, we show that, in some cases, which of the two\npossibilities is realized, may depend on the sequence of chain lengths with\nwhich the thermodynamic limit is reached. These results are established both\nanalytically and by exact diagonalization and illustrated through examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 19:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 17:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

Such configuration brings a new trade-off among scheduling UDs\nto transmitting UDs, selecting the coding decisions and the transmission\nrate/power. Therefore, we consider the completion time minimization problem\nthat involves scheduling multiple transmitting UDs, determining their\ntransmission rates/powers and file combinations. The problem is shown to be\nintractable because it involves all future coding decisions. To tackle the\nproblem at each transmission slot, we first design a graph called herein the\nD2D Rate-Aware IDNC graph where its vertices have weights that judiciously\nbalance between the rates/powers of the transmitting UDs and the number of\ntheir scheduled UDs. Then, we propose an innovative and efficient CLNC solution\nthat iteratively selects a set of transmitting UDs only if the interference\ncaused by the transmissions of the newly selected UDs does not significantly\nimpact the overall completion time.

The EU's General Daten\nProtection Regulation (GDPR) requires controllers to carry out a data\nprotection impact assessment (DPIA) where their data processing is likely to\nresult in a high risk to the rights and freedoms (Art. 35 GDPR). A DPIA is a\nstructured risk analysis that identifies and evaluates possible consequences of\ndata processing relevant to fundamental rights and describes the measures\nenvisaged to address these risks or expresses the inability to do so. Based on\nthe Standard Data Protection Model (SDM), we present a scientific DPIA which\nthoroughly examines three published contact tracing app designs that are\nconsidered to be the most \"privacy-friendly\": PEPP-PT, DP-3T and a concept\nsummarized by Chaos Computer Club member Linus Neumann, all of which process\npersonal health data. The DPIA starts with an analysis of the processing\ncontext and some expected use cases. Then, the processing activities are\ndescribed by defining a realistic processing purpose. This is followed by the\nlegal assessment and threshold analysis. Finally, we analyse the weak points,\nthe risks and determine appropriate protective measures. We show that even\ndecentralized implementations involve numerous serious weaknesses and risks.\nLegally, consent is unfit as legal ground hence data must be processed based on\na law. We also found that measures to realize the rights of data subjects and\naffected people are not sufficient. Last but not least, we show that\nanonymization must be understood as a continuous process, which aims at\nseparating the personal reference and is based on a mix of legal,\norganizational and technical measures. All currently available proposals lack\nsuch an explicit separation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 19:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

OpenUVR significantly improves UX through a redesign of the\nsystem stack and addresses the most time-sensitive issues associated with\nredundant memory copying in modern computing systems. OpenUVR presents a\ncross-layered VR datapath to avoid redundant data operations and computation\namong system components, OpenUVR customizes the network stack to eliminate\nunnecessary memory operations incurred by mismatching data formats in each\nlayer, and OpenUVR uses feedback from mobile devices to remove memory buffers.\n  Together, these modifications allow OpenUVR to reduce VR application delays\nto 14.32 ms, meeting the 20 ms minimum latency in avoiding motion sickness. As\nan open-source system that is fully compatible with commodity hardware, OpenUVR\noffers the research community an opportunity to develop, investigate, and\noptimize applications for untethered, high-performance VR architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 21:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

Both the\nidentification of objects of interest as well as the estimation of their pose\nremain important capabilities in order for robots to provide effective\nassistance for numerous robotic applications ranging from household tasks to\nindustrial manipulation. This problem is particularly challenging because of\nthe heterogeneity of objects having different and potentially complex shapes,\nand the difficulties arising due to background clutter and partial occlusions\nbetween objects. As the main contribution of this work, we propose a system\nthat performs real-time object detection and pose estimation, for the purpose\nof dynamic robot grasping. The robot has been pre-trained to perform a small\nset of canonical grasps from a few fixed poses for each object. When presented\nwith an unknown object in an arbitrary pose, the proposed approach allows the\nrobot to detect the object identity and its actual pose, and then adapt a\ncanonical grasp in order to be used with the new pose. For training, the system\ndefines a canonical grasp by capturing the relative pose of an object with\nrespect to the gripper attached to the robot's wrist. During testing, once a\nnew pose is detected, a canonical grasp for the object is identified and then\ndynamically adapted by adjusting the robot arm's joint angles, so that the\ngripper can grasp the object in its new pose. We conducted experiments using a\nhumanoid PR2 robot and showed that the proposed framework can detect\nwell-textured objects, and provide accurate pose estimation in the presence of\ntolerable amounts of out-of-plane rotation. The performance is also illustrated\nby the robot successfully grasping objects from a wide range of arbitrary\nposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 22:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

An update on the genetic and epigenetic etiology of GDM then\nbecomes imperative to better understand and stem the rising incidence of the\ndisease. This review, therefore, articulated GDM candidate genes and their\npathophysiology for the awareness of stakeholders. Main body (genetic and\nepigenetic etiology, GDM): The search discovered 83 GDM candidate genes, of\nwhich TCF7L2, MTNR1B, CDKAL1, IRS1, and KCNQ1 are the most prevalent. Certain\npolymorphisms of these genes can modulate beta-cell dysfunction, adiposity,\nobesity, and insulin resistance through several mechanisms. Environmental\ntriggers such as diets, pollutants, and microbes may also cause epigenetic\nchanges in these genes, resulting in a loss of insulin-boosting and glucose\nmetabolism functions. Early detection and adequate management may resolve the\ncondition after delivery; otherwise, it will progress to maternal type 2\ndiabetes mellitus (T2DM) and fetal configuration to future obesity and DM. This\nshows that GDM is a strong risk factor for T2DM and, in rare cases, type 1\ndiabetes mellitus (T1DM) and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). This\nfurther shows that GDM significantly contributes to the rising incidence and\nburden of DM worldwide and its prevention may reverse the trend.

Our analysis\nhighlights novel insights on the impact of different metrics and high-level\napproach characteristics on different aspects of performance. We also discuss\ngeneral principles for choosing approaches suitable for different practical\nsettings, and identify areas where data-management-centric solutions are likely\nto have the most impact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 22:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 06:52:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2021 23:05:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2022 02:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

For idealised\nmicrostructures, the mathematical framework of homogenisation theory can be\nused for this purpose. Here, we consider a two-dimensional microstructure\ncomprising an array of obstacles of smooth but arbitrary shape, the size and\nspacing of which can vary along the length of the porous medium. We use\nhomogenisation via the method of multiple scales to systematically upscale a\nnovel problem involving cells of varying area to obtain effective continuum\nequations for macroscale flow and transport. The equations are characterised by\nthe local porosity, a local anisotropic flow permeability, an effective local\nanisotropic solute diffusivity, and an effective local adsorption rate. These\nmacroscale properties depend nontrivially on the two degrees of microstructural\ngeometric freedom in our problem: obstacle size, and obstacle spacing. We\nexploit this dependence to construct and compare scenarios where the same\nporosity profile results from different combinations of obstacle size and\nspacing. We focus on a simple example geometry comprising circular obstacles on\na rectangular lattice, for which we numerically determine the macroscale\npermeability and effective diffusivity. We investigate scenarios where the\nporosity is spatially uniform but the permeability and diffusivity are not. Our\nresults may be useful in the design of filters, or for studying the impact of\ndeformation on transport in soft porous media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 22:56:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 20:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

Using an integral approach to estimate\ngradients has proven to enhance accuracy substantially. Such approach retains\nthe Lagrangian structure of SPH equations and is fully conservative. But, in\npractice, it is difficult to make the Lagrangian formulation totally consistent\nto an exact partition of the unity.\n  In this paper we study, among other things, the connection between the choice\nof the volume elements (VEs), which enters in the SPH summations, and the\naccuracy in the gradient estimation within the integral approach scheme (ISPH).\nA new variant of VEs are proposed which improve the partition of the unity and\nis fully compatible with the Lagrangian formulation of SPH, including the\ngrad-h corrections. Using analytic considerations, simple static toy models in\n1D, and a few full 3D test cases, we show that any improvement in the partition\nof the unity also leads to a better calculation of gradients when the integral\napproach is used jointly. Additionally, we propose an easy-to-implement\nmodification of the ISPH scheme, which makes it more flexible and better suited\nto handle sharp density contrasts.\n  The ISPH code built with the proposed scheme has been validated with a good\nnumber of standard tests, some of them involving contact discontinuities. The\nperformance of the code was excellent in all of them, showing that an\nimprovement in the partition of the unity is not detrimental of the good\nconservation of energy, momentum, and entropy typical of Lagrangian schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 23:04:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 13:05:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 19:12:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 09:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

Global soils may provide a stable, sizeable reservoir to help\nachieve this goal by sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide as soil organic\ncarbon (SOC). In turn, SOC can support healthy soils and provide a multitude of\necosystem benefits. To support SOC sequestration, researchers and policy makers\nmust be able to precisely measure the amount of SOC in a given plot of land.\nSOC measurement is typically accomplished by taking soil cores selected at\nrandom from the plot under study, mixing (compositing) some of them together,\nand analyzing (assaying) the composited samples in a laboratory. Compositing\nreduces assay costs, which can be substantial. Taking samples is also costly.\nGiven uncertainties and costs in both sampling and assay along with a desired\nestimation precision, there is an optimal composite size that will minimize the\nbudget required to achieve that precision. Conversely, given a fixed budget,\nthere is a composite size that minimizes uncertainty. In this paper, we\ndescribe and formalize sampling and assay for SOC and derive the optima for\nthree commonly used assay methods: dry combustion in an elemental analyzer,\nloss-on-ignition, and mid-infrared spectroscopy. We demonstrate the utility of\nthis approach using data from a soil survey conducted in California.

Structure and\ngeometry optimization of nanopores on such materials is beneficial for their\nperformances in real-world engineering applications, like water desalination.\nHowever, the optimization process often involves very large number of\nexperiments or simulations which are expensive and time-consuming. In this\nwork, we propose a graphene nanopore optimization framework via the combination\nof deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for\nefficient water desalination. The DRL agent controls the growth of nanopore by\ndetermining the atom to be removed at each timestep, while the CNN predicts the\nperformance of nanoporus graphene for water desalination: the water flux and\nion rejection at a certain external pressure. With the synchronous feedback\nfrom CNN-accelerated desalination performance prediction, our DRL agent can\noptimize the nanoporous graphene efficiently in an online manner. Molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations on promising DRL-designed graphene nanopores show\nthat they have higher water flux while maintaining rival ion rejection rate\ncompared to the normal circular nanopores. Semi-oval shape with rough edges\ngeometry of DRL-designed pores is found to be the key factor for their high\nwater desalination performance.

This criterion is\nconsistent with the separability definition and thus endows SVG with broad\napplicability and high accuracy. To reduce the fitness evaluation requirement,\nSVG seeks the optimum of a variable with the help of a surrogate model rather\nthan the original expensive high-dimensional model. Moreover, it converts the\nvariable grouping process into a dynamic-binary-tree search one, which\nfacilitates reutilizing historical separability detection information and thus\nreducing detection times. To evaluate the performance of SVG, a suite of\nbenchmark functions with up to 2000 dimensions, including additively and\nnon-additively separable ones, were designed. Experimental results on these\nfunctions indicate that, compared with six state-of-the-art decomposition\nalgorithms, SVG possesses broader applicability and competitive efficiency.\nFurthermore, it can significantly enhance the optimization performance of CC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 02:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

The incompleteness of the baroclinic modes is related to the presence\nof two previously unnoticed stationary step-wave solutions of the Rossby wave\nproblem with flat boundaries. These step-waves are the limit of surface\nquasigeostrophic waves as boundary buoyancy gradients vanish. A complete normal\nmode basis for quasigeostrophic theory is obtained by considering the\ntraditional Rossby wave problem with prescribed buoyancy gradients at the lower\nand upper boundaries. The presence of these boundary buoyancy gradients\nactivates the previously inert boundary degrees of freedom. These Rossby waves\nhave several novel properties such as the presence of multiple modes with no\ninternal zeros, a finite number of modes with negative norms, and their\nvertical structures form a basis capable of representing any quasigeostrophic\nstate with a differentiable series expansion.

We model the DL-PBS system from the\nperspective of CPS and use deep learning to predict the layout of bicycle\nparking spots and the dynamic demand of bicycle dispatching. We define the\nmulti-route bicycle dispatching problem as a multi-objective optimization\nproblem by considering the optimization objectives of dispatching costs,\ndispatch truck's initial load, workload balance among the trucks, and the\ndynamic balance of bicycle supply and demand. On this basis, the collaborative\nmulti-route bicycle dispatching problem among multiple dispatch trucks is\nmodeled as a multi-agent MORL model. All dispatch paths between parking spots\nare defined as state spaces, and the reciprocal of dispatching costs is defined\nas a reward. Each dispatch truck is equipped with an agent to learn the optimal\ndispatch path in the dynamic DL-PBS network. We create an elite list to store\nthe Pareto optimal solutions of bicycle dispatch paths found in each action,\nand finally, get the Pareto frontier.

Such a coupling results in a nonlinear\ninteraction between the three pertinent degrees of freedom -- the center of\nmass, internal degree of freedom, and the field.

However, DETR\nsuffers from its slow convergence. Training DETR \\cite{carion2020end} from\nscratch needs 500 epochs to achieve a high accuracy. To accelerate its\nconvergence, we propose a simple yet effective scheme for improving the DETR\nframework, namely Spatially Modulated Co-Attention (SMCA) mechanism. The core\nidea of SMCA is to conduct regression-aware co-attention in DETR by\nconstraining co-attention responses to be high near initially estimated\nbounding box locations. Our proposed SMCA increases DETR's convergence speed by\nreplacing the original co-attention mechanism in the decoder while keeping\nother operations in DETR unchanged. Furthermore, by integrating multi-head and\nscale-selection attention designs into SMCA, our fully-fledged SMCA can achieve\nbetter performance compared to DETR with a dilated convolution-based backbone\n(45.6 mAP at 108 epochs vs. 43.3 mAP at 500 epochs). We perform extensive\nablation studies on COCO dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nSMCA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 03:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

We further find that 11\neruptions originate from the collisional PILs (cPILs) formed due to the\ncollision between different bipoles, 6 from the conjoined systems of sPIL and\ncPIL, and 2 from the conjoined systems of sPIL and ePIL (external PIL between\nthe AR and the nearby preexisting polarities).

Though theory suggests that forecast skill\ndegrades with increase in lead-time, CFSv2 shows highest skill with L3 ICs, due\nto predicting 1983 ISMR excess for which other ICs fail. But this correct\nprediction is caused by wrong forecast of La Nina or cooling of equatorial\ncentral Pacific (NINO3.4) during ISM season. In observation, normal sea surface\ntemperatures (SSTs) prevailed over NINO3.4 and ISMR excess was due to variation\nof convection over equatorial Indian Ocean or EQUINOO, which CFSv2 failed to\ncapture with all ICs. Major results are reaffirmed by analysing an optimum\nnumber of 5 experimental reforecasts by current version of CFSv2 with\nlate-April/early-May ICs having short yet useful lead-time. These reforecasts\nshowed least seasonal biases and highest ISMR correlation skill if 1983 is\nexcluded. Model deficiencies such as over-sensitivity of ISMR to SST variation\nover NINO3.4 (ENSO) and unrealistic influence of ENSO on EQUINOO, contribute to\nerrors in ISMR forecasting. Whereas, in observation, ISMR is influenced by both\nENSO and EQUINOO. Forecast skill for Boreal summer ENSO is found to be\ndeficient with lowest skill for L3/L4 ICs, hinting the possible influence of\nlong lead-time induced dynamical drift. The results warrant the need for\nminimisation of bias in SST boundary forcing to achieve improved ISMR\nforecasts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 05:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

Focusing on discrete OvS, this paper proposes a new Bayesian framework\nfor analyzing input model risk of implementing an arbitrary solution, $x$,\nwhere uncertainty about the input models is captured by a posterior\ndistribution. We define the $\\alpha$-level risk set of solution $x$ as the set\nof solutions whose expected performance is better than $x$ by a practically\nmeaningful margin $(>\\delta)$ given common input models with significant\nprobability ($>\\alpha$) under the posterior distribution. The user-specified\nparameters, $\\delta$ and $\\alpha$, control robustness of the procedure to the\ndesired level as well as guards against unnecessary conservatism. An empty risk\nset implies that there is no practically better solution than $x$ with\nsignificant probability even though the real-world input distributions are\nunknown. For efficient estimation of the risk set, the conditional mean\nperformance of a solution given a set of input distributions is modeled as a\nGaussian process (GP) that takes the solution-distributions pair as an input.\nIn particular, our GP model allows both parametric and nonparametric input\nmodels. We propose the sequential risk set inference procedure that estimates\nthe risk set and selects the next solution-distributions pair to simulate using\nthe posterior GP at each iteration. We show that simulating the pair expected\nto change the risk set estimate the most in the next iteration is the\nasymptotic one-step optimal sampling rule that minimizes the number of\nincorrectly classified solutions, if the procedure runs without stopping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 05:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

While taking a journey through the Brillouin\nZone (BZ) from one k-point to another for a fixed CPGS, it is expected that the\nwavevector point group symmetry (WPGS) can change, and consequently a\nqualitative change in the texture of the spin polarization (the expectation\nvalue of spin operator $\\vec{S}^{nk_{0}}$ in Bloch state $u(n,k)$ and the\nwavevector $k_0$). However, the nature of the spin texture (ST) change is\ngenerally unsuspected. In this work, we determine a full classification of the\nlinear-in-$k$ spin texture patterns based on the polarity and chirality\nreflected in the WPGS at $k_0$. The spin-polarization vector $\\vec{S}^{nk_{0}}$\ncontrolling the ST is bound to be parallel to the rotation axis and\nperpendicular to the mirror planes and hence, symmetry operation types in WPGSs\nimpose symmetry restriction to the ST. For instance, the ST is always parallel\nto the wavevector $k$ in non-polar chiral WPGSs since they contain only\nrotational symmetries. Some consequences of the ST classification based on the\nsymmetry operations in the WPGS include the observation of ST patterns that are\nunexpected according to the symmetry of the crystal. For example, it is usually\nestablished that spin-momentum locking effect requires the crystal inversion\nsymmetry breaking by an asymmetric electric potential. However, we find that\npolar WPGS can have this effect even in compounds without electric dipoles or\nexternal electric fields. We use the determined relation between WPGS and ST as\na design principle to select compounds with multiple ST near band edges at\ndifferent $k$-valleys.

By contrast, a pointwise\napproach does not directly solve a ranking problem, and is therefore inferior\nto a pairwise counterpart in top-K ranking tasks; however, it is generally\nadvantageous in regards to the convergence time. This study aims to establish\nan approach to learn personalised ranking from implicit feedback, which\nreconciles the training efficiency of the pointwise approach and ranking\neffectiveness of the pairwise counterpart. The key idea is to estimate the\nranking of items in a pointwise manner; we first reformulate the conventional\npointwise approach based on density ratio estimation and then incorporate the\nessence of ranking-oriented approaches (e.g. the pairwise approach) into our\nformulation. Through experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate\nthat our approach not only dramatically reduces the convergence time (one to\ntwo orders of magnitude faster) but also significantly improving the ranking\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 06:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

The\nresults show that at different vaccine efficacy levels (0.75, 0.85, and 0.95),\nthe curves of active infection vary slightly, indicating that vaccines with\nefficacy above 0.75 would produce the herd immunity required to level the\ncurves. In addition, disparity is significant between implementing or not\nimplementing a vaccination program. Simulation results also show that lowering\nthe reproduction number, R0 is necessary to keep the infection curve flat\ndespite vaccination. This is due to the assumption that vaccination is mostly\ncarried out gradually at the assumed fixed rate. The statement is based on our\nsimulation results with two values of R0: 1.1 and 1.2, indicative of reduction\nof R0 by social distancing. The lower R0 shows a smaller peak amplitude about\nhalf the value simulated with R0=1.2.

By\nconsidering the spatial semantic information of images, we firstly take\nadvantage of the attention map to determine the perturbed pixels. Instead of\nattacking the entire image, reducing the perturbed pixels with the attention\nmechanism can help to avoid the notorious curse of dimensionality and thereby\nimproves the performance of attacking. Secondly, a large-scale multiobjective\nevolutionary algorithm is employed to traverse the reduced pixels in the\nsalient region.

This slip results in\nthe observed \"swimming\" motion of a freely suspended particle even in the\nabsence of externally imposed concentration gradients.Motivated by the\nchemotactic behaviour of their biological counterparts(such as sperm cells,\nneutrophils, macrophages, bacteria etc.), which sense and respond to external\nchemical gradients, the current work aims at developing a theoretical framework\nto study the motion of a Janus particle in an externally imposed linear\nconcentration gradient. The external gradient along with the self-generated\nconcentration gradient determines the swimming velocity and orientation of the\nparticle.The dominance of each of these effects is characterised by a\nnon-dimensional activity number A. The surface of Janus particle is modelled as\nhaving a different activity and mobility coefficient on the two halves.Using\nLorentz Reciprocal theorem, an analytical expression for the rotational and\ntranslational velocity is obtained. The analytical framework helps us divide\nthe parameter space of surface activity and mobility into four regions where\nthe particle exhibits different trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 09:35:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 13:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

These\nmetrics are combined with a linear SVM, and then the assignment problem is\nsolved by the Hungarian algorithm. We also propose an efficient CNN\narchitecture that estimates these metrics. Our multi-frame model accepts two\nconsecutive video frames which are processed individually in the backbone, and\nthen optical flow is estimated on the resulting feature maps. This allows the\nnetwork heads to estimate the displacement vectors. We evaluate our approach on\nthe challenging BDD100K tracking dataset. Our multi-frame model achieves a good\nMOTA value of 39.1% with low localization error of 0.206 in MOTP. Our fast\nsingle-frame model achieves an even lower localization error of 0.202 in MOTP,\nand a MOTA value of 36.8%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 10:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

Typically, NDP architectures support several NDP\nunits, each including multiple simple cores placed close to memory. To fully\nleverage the benefits of NDP and achieve high performance for parallel\nworkloads, efficient synchronization among the NDP cores of a system is\nnecessary. However, supporting synchronization in many NDP systems is\nchallenging because they lack shared caches and hardware cache coherence\nsupport, which are commonly used for synchronization in multicore systems, and\ncommunication across different NDP units can be expensive.\n  This paper comprehensively examines the synchronization problem in NDP\nsystems, and proposes SynCron, an end-to-end synchronization solution for NDP\nsystems. SynCron adds low-cost hardware support near memory for synchronization\nacceleration, and avoids the need for hardware cache coherence support. SynCron\nhas three components: 1) a specialized cache memory structure to avoid memory\naccesses for synchronization and minimize latency overheads, 2) a hierarchical\nmessage-passing communication protocol to minimize expensive communication\nacross NDP units of the system, and 3) a hardware-only overflow management\nscheme to avoid performance degradation when hardware resources for\nsynchronization tracking are exceeded.\n  We evaluate SynCron using a variety of parallel workloads, covering various\ncontention scenarios.

The\ntraditional embedding manner that assigns a uniform size to all features has\ntwo issues. First, the numerous features inevitably lead to a gigantic\nembedding table that causes a high memory usage cost. Second, it is likely to\ncause the over-fitting problem for those features that do not require too large\nrepresentation capacity. Existing works that try to address the problem always\ncause a significant drop in recommendation performance or suffers from the\nlimitation of unaffordable training time cost. In this paper, we proposed a\nnovel approach, named PEP (short for Plug-in Embedding Pruning), to reduce the\nsize of the embedding table while avoiding the drop of recommendation accuracy.\nPEP prunes embedding parameter where the pruning threshold(s) can be adaptively\nlearned from data. Therefore we can automatically obtain a mixed-dimension\nembedding-scheme by pruning redundant parameters for each feature. PEP is a\ngeneral framework that can plug in various base recommendation models.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate it can efficiently cut down embedding\nparameters and boost the base model's performance. Specifically, it achieves\nstrong recommendation performance while reducing 97-99% parameters. As for the\ncomputation cost, PEP only brings an additional 20-30% time cost compared with\nbase models.

Purpose: We study the ground states obtained in a\nTDDM approach for nuclei from $A=12$ to $A=24$, including examples of even and\nodd-even nuclei with and without intrinsic deformation. We overcome previous\nlimitations using three-dimensional simulations and employ density-independent\nSkyrme interactions self-consistently.

No such success, however,\nhas ever been obtained for the specific heat of liquids, which has remained a\nmystery for over a century. A theory of specific heat of liquids is derived\nhere using a recently proposed analytical form of the vibrational density of\nstates (DOS) of liquids, which takes into account saddle points in the liquid\nenergy landscape via the so-called instantaneous normal modes (INMs),\ncorresponding to negative eigenvalues (imaginary frequencies) of the Hessian\nmatrix. The theory is able to explain the typical monotonic decrease of\nspecific heat with temperature observed in liquids, in terms of the average INM\nexcitation lifetime decreasing with T (in accordance with Arrehnius law), and\nprovides an excellent single-parameter fitting to several sets of experimental\ndata for atomic and molecular liquids. It also correlates the height of the\nliquid energy barrier with the slope of the specific heat in function of\ntemperature in accordance with the available data. These findings demonstrate\nthat the specific heat of liquids is controlled by the instantaneous normal\nmodes, i.e. by localized, unstable (exponentially decaying) vibrational\nexcitations, and provide the missing connection between anharmonicity, saddle\npoints in the energy landscape, and the thermodynamics of liquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 12:11:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 13:09:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Current reduction,\nsparse sampling and limited-view scanning can all cause it. Between them,\nlimited-view CT is general in the industry due to inevitable mechanical and\nphysical limitation. However, limited-view CT can cause serious imaging problem\non account of its massive information loss. Thus, we should effectively utilize\nthe scant prior information to perform completion. It is an undeniable fact\nthat CT imaging slices are extremely dense, which leads to high continuity\nbetween successive images. We realized that fully exploit the spatial\ncorrelation between consecutive frames can significantly improve restoration\nresults in video inpainting. Inspired by this, we propose a deep learning-based\nthree-stage algorithm that hoist limited-view CT imaging quality based on\nspatial information.

A series of Ramsey fringes is recorded to track the\nphase evolution of a superposition state in xenon atoms, excited by two\nup-converted frequency-comb pulses. Phase shifts of up to 1 rad induced by HHG\nwere observed at ns timescales and with mrad-level accuracy at $110$ nm.

We propose two simple\nmodifications of Firth-type logistic regression resulting in unbiased predicted\nprobabilities. The first corrects the predicted probabilities by a post-hoc\nadjustment of the intercept. The other is based on an alternative formulation\nof Firth-types estimation as an iterative data augmentation procedure. Our\nsuggested modification consists in introducing an indicator variable which\ndistinguishes between original and pseudo observations in the augmented data.\nIn a comprehensive simulation study these approaches are compared to other\nattempts to improve predictions based on Firth-type penalization and to other\npublished penalization strategies intended for routine use. For instance, we\nconsider a recently suggested compromise between maximum likelihood and\nFirth-type logistic regression. Simulation results are scrutinized both with\nregard to prediction and regression coefficients. Finally, the methods\nconsidered are illustrated and compared for a study on arterial closure devices\nin minimally invasive cardiac surgery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 13:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

A fundamental research question in this\nfield is to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for a simple game to\nbe a weighted majority game. Taylor and Zwicker (1992) showed that a simple\ngame is non-weighted if and only if there exists a trading transform of finite\nsize. They also provided an upper bound on the size of such a trading\ntransform, if it exists. Gvozdeva and Slinko (2011) improved that upper bound;\ntheir proof employed a property of linear inequalities demonstrated by Muroga\n(1971).In this study, we provide a new proof of the existence of a trading\ntransform when a given simple game is non-weighted. Our proof employs Farkas'\nlemma (1894), and yields an improved upper bound on the size of a trading\ntransform.\n  We also discuss an integer-weight representation of a weighted simple game,\nimproving the bounds obtained by Muroga (1971). We show that our bound on the\nquota is tight when the number of players is less than or equal to five, based\non the computational results obtained by Kurz (2012).\n  Furthermore, we discuss the problem of finding an integer-weight\nrepresentation under the assumption that we have minimal winning coalitions and\nmaximal losing coalitions.In particular, we show a performance of a rounding\nmethod.\n  Lastly, we address roughly weighted simple games.

The\nmodel performance can be assessed by measures such as the concordance statistic\n(c-statistic), the discrimination slope and the Brier score. Often, data\nresampling techniques, e.g. crossvalidation, are employed to correct for\noptimism in these model performance criteria. Especially with small samples or\na rare binary outcome variable, leave-one-out crossvalidation is a popular\nchoice. Using simulations and a real data example, we compared the effect of\ndifferent resampling techniques on the estimation of c-statistics,\ndiscrimination slopes and Brier scores for three estimators of logistic\nregression models, including the maximum likelihood and two maximum\npenalized-likelihood estimators. Our simulation study confirms earlier studies\nreporting that leave-one-out crossvalidated c-statistics can be strongly biased\ntowards zero. In addition, our study reveals that this bias is more pronounced\nfor estimators shrinking predicted probabilities towards the observed event\nrate, such as ridge regression. Leave-one-out crossvalidation also provided\npessimistic estimates of the discrimination slope but nearly unbiased estimates\nof the Brier score.

Meanwhile, at the macro\nlevel, the model needs to discover all salient objects in a given image. To\nfacilitate integrity learning for SOD, we design a novel Integrity Cognition\nNetwork (ICON), which explores three important components for learning strong\nintegrity features. 1) Unlike existing models, which focus more on feature\ndiscriminability, we introduce a diverse feature aggregation (DFA) component to\naggregate features with various receptive fields (i.e., kernel shape and\ncontext) and increase feature diversity. Such diversity is the foundation for\nmining the integral salient objects. 2) Based on the DFA features, we introduce\nan integrity channel enhancement (ICE) component with the goal of enhancing\nfeature channels that highlight the integral salient objects, while suppressing\nthe other distracting ones. 3) After extracting the enhanced features, the\npart-whole verification (PWV) method is employed to determine whether the part\nand whole object features have strong agreement. Such part-whole agreements can\nfurther improve the micro-level integrity for each salient object.

There have\nbeen a couple of theoretical explanations of this phenomenon. We investigate\nthis phenomenon based on scattering theory on a normal metal-TI-normal metal\nhybrid structure and calculate the conductances in longitudinal and transverse\ndirections to the applied bias. The transverse conductance depends on the\nspatial location between the two NM-TI junctions where it is calculated. It is\nzero in the drain electrode when the chemical potentials of the top and the\nbottom TI surfaces ($\\mu_t$ and $\\mu_b$ respectively) are equal. The\nlongitudinal conductance is $\\pi$-periodic in $\\phi$-the angle between the bias\ndirection and the direction of the in-plane magnetic field. The transverse\nconductance is $\\pi$-periodic in $\\phi$ when $\\mu_t=\\mu_b$ whereas it is\n$2\\pi$-periodic in $\\phi$ when $\\mu_t\\neq\\mu_b$. As a function of the magnetic\nfield, the magnitude of transverse conductance increases initially and peaks.\nAt higher magnetic fields, it decays for angles $\\phi$ closer to $0,\\pi$\nwhereas oscillates for angles $\\phi$ close to $\\pi/2$. The conductances\noscillate with the length of the TI region. A finite width of the system makes\nthe transport separate into finitely many channels. The features of the\nconductances are similar to those in the limit of infinitely wide system except\nwhen the width is so small that only one channel participates in the transport.\nWhen only one channel participates in transport, the transverse conductance in\nthe region $0<x<L$ is zero for $\\mu_t=\\mu_b$ and the transverse conductance in\nthe region $x>L$ is zero even for the case $\\mu_t\\neq\\mu_b$.

Although, the \\textit{p}-doped two septuple layers exhibit\ntopologically trivial band structure, the increase of layer thickness to three\n(four) septuple layers with Ca (Mg) dopants leads to the formation of the\nquantum anomalous Hall effect. Our proposed \\textit{p}-doping strategy not only\nmakes MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ become an ideal platform to realize the high-temperature\nquantum anomalous Hall effect without external magnetic field, but also can\ncompensate the electrons from the intrinsic \\textit{n}-type defects in\nMnBi$_2$Te$_4$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 15:22:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

Applications in sensitive and\ncritical domains are a strong motivational factor in trying to understand the\nbehavior of black boxes. We propose to address this issue by providing an\ninterpretable layer on top of black box models by aggregating \"local\"\nexplanations. We present GLocalX, a \"local-first\" model agnostic explanation\nmethod. Starting from local explanations expressed in form of local decision\nrules, GLocalX iteratively generalizes them into global explanations by\nhierarchically aggregating them. Our goal is to learn accurate yet simple\ninterpretable models to emulate the given black box, and, if possible, replace\nit entirely. We validate GLocalX in a set of experiments in standard and\nconstrained settings with limited or no access to either data or local\nexplanations. Experiments show that GLocalX is able to accurately emulate\nseveral models with simple and small models, reaching state-of-the-art\nperformance against natively global solutions. Our findings show how it is\noften possible to achieve a high level of both accuracy and comprehensibility\nof classification models, even in complex domains with high-dimensional data,\nwithout necessarily trading one property for the other.

While\nSED can be done using supervised machine learning, where training data is fully\nlabeled with access to per event timestamps and duration, our work focuses on\nweakly-supervised sound event detection (WSSED), where prior knowledge about an\nevent's duration is unavailable. Recent research within the field focuses on\nimproving segment- and event-level localization performance for specific\ndatasets regarding specific evaluation metrics. Specifically, well-performing\nevent-level localization requires fully labeled development subsets to obtain\nevent duration estimates, which significantly benefits localization\nperformance. Moreover, well-performing segment-level localization models output\npredictions at a coarse-scale (e.g., 1 second), hindering their deployment on\ndatasets containing very short events (< 1 second).

A promising alternative to\nmanually specifying reward functions is to enable robots to infer them from\nhuman feedback, like demonstrations or corrections. To interpret this feedback,\nrobots treat as approximately optimal a choice the person makes from a choice\nset, like the set of possible trajectories they could have demonstrated or\npossible corrections they could have made. In this work, we introduce the idea\nthat the choice set itself might be difficult to specify, and analyze choice\nset misspecification: what happens as the robot makes incorrect assumptions\nabout the set of choices from which the human selects their feedback. We\npropose a classification of different kinds of choice set misspecification, and\nshow that these different classes lead to meaningful differences in the\ninferred reward and resulting performance.

This task is non-trivial since it\nis hard to conduct pixel-level matching among different views. To address this\nissue, most existing methods seek to exploit the geometric information to match\npixels. However, when the distinct cameras have a large baseline (i.e., far\naway from each other), severe geometry distortion issues would occur and the\ngeometric information may fail to provide useful guidance, resulting in very\nblurry synthesized images. To address the above issues, in this paper, we\npropose a novel deep generative model, called Self-Consistent Generative\nNetwork (SCGN), which synthesizes novel views from the given input views\nwithout explicitly exploiting the geometric information. The proposed SCGN\nmodel consists of two main components, i.e., a View Synthesis Network (VSN) and\na View Decomposition Network (VDN), both employing an Encoder-Decoder\nstructure. Here, the VDN seeks to reconstruct input views from the synthesized\nnovel view to preserve the consistency of view synthesis. Thanks to VDN, SCGN\nis able to synthesize novel views without using any geometric rectification\nbefore encoding, making it easier for both training and applications. Finally,\nadversarial loss is introduced to improve the photo-realism of novel views.\nBoth qualitative and quantitative comparisons against several state-of-the-art\nmethods on two benchmark tasks demonstrated the superiority of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 10:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

Following a weak interplanetary shock\non 25 August 2018, a magnetic flux rope caused an unexpectedly large\ngeomagnetic storm. It is likely that this event became geoeffective because the\nflux rope was accompanied by a corotating interaction region and compressed by\nhigh-speed solar wind following the flux rope. In fact, a Forbush decrease was\nobserved in cosmic-ray data inside the flux rope as expected, and a significant\ncosmic-ray density increase exceeding the unmodulated level before the shock\nwas also observed near the trailing edge of the flux rope. The cosmic-ray\ndensity increase can be interpreted in terms of the adiabatic heating of cosmic\nrays near the trailing edge of the flux rope, as the corotating interaction\nregion prevents free expansion of the flux rope and results in the compression\nnear the trailing edge. A northeast-directed spatial gradient in the cosmic-ray\ndensity was also derived during the cosmic-ray density increase, suggesting\nthat the center of the heating near the trailing edge is located northeast of\nEarth. This is one of the best examples demonstrating that the observation of\nhigh-energy cosmic rays provides us with information that can only be derived\nfrom the cosmic ray measurements to observationally constrain the\nthree-dimensional macroscopic picture of the interaction between coronal mass\nejections and the ambient solar wind, which is essential for prediction of\nlarge magnetic storms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 09:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

We found that processes such as data compression and\nchannel capacity maximisation can be improved in regions where there is a low\ndensity of states, whereas for high densities our results coincide with\nShannon's formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 00:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

Its application to the derivation of the power law probability\ndistributions of living systems has long been challenging. Recently, a measure\nof efficiency was proposed as a tool of deriving Zipf s and Pareto s laws\ndirectly from the principle of least effort. The present work is a further\ninvestigation of this efficiency measure from a mathematical point of view. The\naim is to get further insight into its properties and usefulness as a metric of\nperformance. We address some key mathematical properties of this efficiency\nsuch as its sign, uniqueness and robustness. We also look at the relationship\nbetween this measure and other properties of the system of interest such as\ninequality and uncertainty, by introducing a new method for calculating\nnon-negative continuous entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 14:31:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 13:14:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 23:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}
