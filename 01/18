Starting with known properties of circumstellar disks, we present\nmodels for the planetary mass distribution over the range $0.1M_J < M_{\\rm p} <\n10M_J$. If the circumstellar disk lifetime is solely responsible for the end of\nplanetary mass accretion, the observed (nearly) exponential distribution of\ndisk lifetime would imprint an exponential fall-off in the planetary mass\nfunction. This result is in apparent conflict with observations, which suggest\nthat the mass distribution has a (nearly) power-law form $dF/dM_{\\rm p}\\sim\nM_{\\rm p}^{-p}$, with index $p\\approx1.3$, over the relevant planetary mass\nrange (and for stellar masses $\\sim0.5-2M_\\odot$). The mass accretion rate onto\nthe planet depends on the fraction of the (circumstellar) disk accretion flow\nthat enters the Hill sphere, and on the efficiency with which the planet\ncaptures the incoming material. Models for the planetary mass function that\ninclude distributions for these efficiencies, with uninformed priors, can\nproduce nearly power-law behavior, consistent with current observations. The\ndisk lifetimes, accretion rates, and other input parameters depend on the mass\nof the host star. We show how these variations lead to different forms for the\nplanetary mass function for different stellar masses.

Whistlers occur highly intermittently and 80% of\nthe whistlers appear continuously for less than 3 s. Occurrence rate of\nwhistler waves was found to be anti-correlated with the solar wind bulk\nvelocity. The study of the duration of the whistler intervals revealed an\nanti-correlation between the duration and the solar wind velocity, as well as\nbetween the duration and the normalized amplitude of magnetic field variations.\nThe pitch-angle widths (PAWs) of the field-aligned electron population referred\nto as the strahl are broader by at least 12 degrees during the presence of\nlarge amplitude narrow band whistler waves. This observation points towards a\nEM wave electron interaction, resulting in pitch-angle scattering.

Parallel cuts through the strahl\nelectron velocity distribution function (VDF) observed during the whistler\nintervals appear to depart from the Maxwellian shape typically found in the\nnear-Sun strahl VDFs (Bercic et al. 2020). The relative decrease of parallel\nelectron temperature and the increase of PAW for the electrons in strahl energy\nrange suggests that the interaction with whistler waves results in a transfer\nof electron momentum from the parallel to the perpendicular direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2021 17:27:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2021 14:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Reliable quantification of this uptake\nrequires accurate segmentation of the considered regions. However, segmentation\nof these regions from DaT-SPECT images is challenging, a major reason being\npartial-volume effects (PVEs), which arise from the limited system resolution\nand reconstruction of images over finite-sized voxel grids. The latter leads to\ntissue-fraction effects (TFEs). Thus, there is an important need for methods\nthat can account for the PVEs, including the TFEs, and accurately segment\nDaT-SPECT images.

The proposed\nmethod estimates the posterior mean of the fractional volumes occupied by the\ncaudate, putamen, and GP within each voxel of a 3-D DaT-SPECT image.

To do so, we performed a controlled experiment where, in\nthe realm of a Python programming contest, a group of developers had the same\nwell-defined set of requirements specifications and a well-defined sprint\nschedule. Events were collected from the PyCharm IDE, and from the Mooshak\nautomatic jury where subjects checked-in their code.\n  Method: We used n-gram language models and text mining to characterize\ndevelopers' profiles, and process mining algorithms to discover their overall\nworkflows and extract the correspondent metrics for further evaluation.\n  Results: Findings show that we can clearly characterize with a coherent\nrationale most developers, and distinguish the top performers from the ones\nwith more challenging behaviors.

It has 20 six- and 12 five-fold coordinated\nvertices, with the former forming a dodecahedron, and each of the latter\nconnected to the vertices of one of the 12 pentagons of the dodecahedron. When\nspins mounted on the vertices of the pentakis dodecahedron interact according\nto the nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, the two different\nvertex types necessitate the introduction of two exchange constants. As the\nrelative strength of the two constants is varied the molecule interpolates\nbetween the dodecahedron and a molecule consisting only of quadrangles. The\ncompetition between the two exchange constants, frustration, and an external\nmagnetic field results in a multitude of ground-state magnetization and\nsusceptibility discontinuities. At the classical level the maximum is ten\nmagnetization and one susceptibility discontinuities when the 12 five-fold\nvertices interact with the dodecahedron spins with approximately one-half the\nstrength of their interaction. When the two interactions are approximately\nequal in strength the number of discontinuities is also maximized, with three\nof the magnetization and eight of the susceptibility. At the full quantum\nlimit, where the magnitude of the spins equals 1/2, there can be up to three\nground-state magnetization jumps that have the total z spin component changing\nby \\Delta S^z=2, even though quantum fluctuations rarely allow discontinuities\nof the magnetization. The full quantum case also supports a \\Delta S^z=3\ndiscontinuity. Frustration also results in nonmagnetic states inside the\nsinglet-triplet gap.

Regularization approaches arise in an\nattempt to address such a shortcoming.

Therefore,\nthis approach does not consider any additional knowledge to decide which units\nshould be disconnected.

This is\ndue to the high turbulence below the LLJ and the downward vertical entrainment\ncreated by the momentum deficit due to the wind farm power production. This\nharvests the jet's energy and aids wake recovery. However, when the LLJ is\nbelow the turbine rotor swept area, the wake recovery is very slow due to the\nlow atmospheric turbulence above the LLJ. The energy budget analysis reveals\nthat the entrainment fluxes are maximum and minimum when the LLJ is above and\nin the middle of the turbine rotor swept area, respectively. Surprisingly, we\nfind that the negative shear creates a significant entrainment flux upward when\nthe LLJ is below the turbine rotor swept area. This facilitates energy\nextraction from the jet, which is beneficial for the performance of downwind\nturbines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2021 18:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

In this study, through a combination of the decoupled phase-field\nformulation -- conservative Allen-Cahn equation -- and a cumulants-based\ncollision operator for a low-Mach pressure-based flow solver, we present an\nalgorithm that can be used for higher Reynolds/Weber numbers.

In all simulations, the solver is shown to correctly capture the\ndynamics of the flow and match reference results very well. As the final\ntest-case, the solver is used to model droplet splashing on a thin liquid sheet\nin 3-D with a density ratio of 1000 and kinematic viscosity ratio of 15 --\nmatching the water/air system -- at We=8000 and Re=1000.

An obvious caveat is that several\nreasons can motivate individuals to seek online information and models that are\nblind to people's motivations are of limited use and can even mislead. This is\nparticularly true during extraordinary public health crisis, such as the\nongoing pandemic, when fear, curiosity and many other reasons can lead\nindividuals to search for health-related information, masking the\ndisease-driven searches. However, health crisis can also offer an opportunity\nto disentangle between different drivers and learn about human behavior.

Since\ntumor region does not match with any ordinary brain tissue, it has been\ndifficult to deformably register a patients brain to a normal one. Many patient\nimages are associated with irregularly distributed lesions, resulting in\nfurther distortion of normal tissue structures and complicating registration's\nsimilarity measure. In this work, we follow a multi-step context-aware image\ninpainting framework to generate synthetic tissue intensities in the tumor\nregion. The coarse image-to-image translation is applied to make a rough\ninference of the missing parts. Then, a feature-level patch-match refinement\nmodule is applied to refine the details by modeling the semantic relevance\nbetween patch-wise features.

This procedure has been used to\ndesign and build mechanical metamaterials with a variety of responses. A\nlong-range 'allosteric' response, where a localized input strain at one site\ngives rise to a localized output strain at a distant site, has been of\nparticular interest. This work presents a novel approach to incorporating\nallosteric responses in experimental systems by pruning disordered networks\n$\\textit{in-situ}$. Previous work has relied on computer simulations to design\nand predict the response of such systems using a cost function where the\nresponse of the entire network to each bond removal is used at each step to\ndetermine which bond to prune. It is not feasible to follow such a design\nprotocol in experiments where one has access only to local response at each\nsite. This paper presents design algorithms that allow determination of what\nbonds to prune based purely on the local stresses in the network without\nemploying a cost function; using only local information, allosteric networks\nare designed in simulations and then built out of real materials. The results\nshow that some pruning strategies work better than others when translated into\nan experimental system. A method is presented to measure local stresses\nexperimentally in disordered networks. This approach is then used to implement\npruning methods to design desired responses $\\textit{in-situ}$. Results from\nthese experiments confirm that the pruning methods are robust and work in a\nreal laboratory material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2021 22:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Despite its success, we found that the\nempirical results of GPT-$3$ depend heavily on the choice of in-context\nexamples. In this work, we investigate whether there are more effective\nstrategies for judiciously selecting in-context examples (relative to random\nsampling) that better leverage GPT-$3$'s few-shot capabilities. Inspired by the\nrecent success of leveraging a retrieval module to augment large-scale neural\nnetwork models, we propose to retrieve examples that are semantically-similar\nto a test sample to formulate its corresponding prompt. Intuitively, the\nin-context examples selected with such a strategy may serve as more informative\ninputs to unleash GPT-$3$'s extensive knowledge. We evaluate the proposed\napproach on several natural language understanding and generation benchmarks,\nwhere the retrieval-based prompt selection approach consistently outperforms\nthe random baseline. Moreover, it is observed that the sentence encoders\nfine-tuned on task-related datasets yield even more helpful retrieval results.\nNotably, significant gains are observed on tasks such as table-to-text\ngeneration (41.9% on the ToTTo dataset) and open-domain question answering\n(45.5% on the NQ dataset).

When a\nsystem prior to a Hopf bifurcation is exposed to a sufficient level of noise,\nits noise-induced dynamics can provide valuable information about the impending\nbifurcation. In this thesis, we present a system identification (SI) framework\nthat exploits the noise-induced dynamics prior to a Hopf bifurcation. The\nframework is novel in that it is capable of predicting the bifurcation point\nand the post-bifurcation dynamics using only pre-bifurcation data.\nSpecifically, we present two different versions of the framework: input-output\nand output-only. For the input-output version, the system is forced with\nadditive noise generated by an external actuator, and its response is measured.\nFor the output-only version, the intrinsic noise of the system acts as the\nnoise source and only the output signal is measured. In both versions, the\nFokker-Planck equations, which describe the probability density function of the\nfluctuation amplitude, are derived from self-excited oscillator models. Then,\nthe coefficients of these models are extracted from the experimental\nprobability density functions characterizing the noise-induced response in the\nfixed-point regime. The SI framework is tested on three different experimental\nsystems: a low-density jet, a flame-driven Rijke tube, and a gas-turbine\ncombustor. For these systems, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can\nidentify the nature of the Hopf bifurcation and the system's order of\nnonlinearity. Moreover, by extrapolating the identified model coefficients, we\nare able to forecast the locations of the bifurcation points and the\nlimit-cycle features after those points. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first time that SI has been performed using data from only the\npre-bifurcation regime, without the need for knowledge of the location of the\nbifurcation point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 01:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

In this work, we compare the transfer performance and parameter\nefficiency of 16 popular convolutional architectures on a large chest X-ray\ndataset (CheXpert) to investigate these assumptions. First, we find no\nrelationship between ImageNet performance and CheXpert performance for both\nmodels without pretraining and models with pretraining. Second, we find that,\nfor models without pretraining, the choice of model family influences\nperformance more than size within a family for medical imaging tasks. Third, we\nobserve that ImageNet pretraining yields a statistically significant boost in\nperformance across architectures, with a higher boost for smaller\narchitectures. Fourth, we examine whether ImageNet architectures are\nunnecessarily large for CheXpert by truncating final blocks from pretrained\nmodels, and find that we can make models 3.25x more parameter-efficient on\naverage without a statistically significant drop in performance.

This effect is\ngenerically attributed to slow environmental fluctuations, which perturb the\nlocal configuration of the suspension medium. To investigate the microscopic\nmechanisms responsible for the NGND phenomenon, we study Brownian diffusion in\nlow dimensional systems, like the free diffusion of ellipsoidal and active\nparticles, the diffusion of colloidal particles in fluctuating corrugated\nchannels and Brownian motion in arrays of planar convective rolls. NGND appears\nto be a transient effect related to the time modulation of the instantaneous\nparticle's diffusivity, which can occur even under equilibrium conditions.\nConsequently, we propose to generalize the definition of NGND to include\ntransient displacement distributions which vary continuously with the\nobservation time. To this purpose, we provide a heuristic one-parameter\nfunction, which fits all time-dependent transient displacement distributions\ncorresponding to the same diffusion constant. Moreover, we reveal the existence\nof low dimensional systems where the NGND distributions are not leptokurtic\n(fat exponential tails), as often reported in the literature, but platykurtic\n(thin sub-Gaussian tails), i.e., with negative excess kurtosis. The actual\nnature of the NGND transients is related to the specific microscopic dynamics\nof the diffusing particle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 05:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

To\nassist consumers to quickly grasp a large number of reviews about an item,\nopinion tags are increasingly being applied by e-commerce platforms. Current\nmechanisms for generating opinion tags rely on either manual labelling or\nheuristic methods, which is time-consuming and ineffective. In this paper, we\npropose the abstractive opinion tagging task, where systems have to\nautomatically generate a ranked list of opinion tags that are based on, but\nneed not occur in, a given set of user-generated reviews.\n  The abstractive opinion tagging task comes with three main challenges: (1)\nthe noisy nature of reviews; (2) the formal nature of opinion tags vs. the\ncolloquial language usage in reviews; and (3) the need to distinguish between\ndifferent items with very similar aspects. To address these challenges, we\npropose an abstractive opinion tagging framework, named AOT-Net, to generate a\nranked list of opinion tags given a large number of reviews. First, a\nsentence-level salience estimation component estimates each review's salience\nscore. Next, a review clustering and ranking component ranks reviews in two\nsteps: first, reviews are grouped into clusters and ranked by cluster size;\nthen, reviews within each cluster are ranked by their distance to the cluster\ncenter. Finally, given the ranked reviews, a rank-aware opinion tagging\ncomponent incorporates an alignment feature and alignment loss to generate a\nranked list of opinion tags.

The target globally models the interaction between the source and\ntarget, and conditions on a probabilistic data predictor made available by an\nindependent local source modeller. Fully probabilistic design is adopted to\nsolve this optimal decision-making problem in the target. By successfully\ntransferring higher moments of the source, the target can reject unreliable\nsource knowledge (i.e. it achieves robust transfer). This dual-modeller\nframework means that the source's local processing of raw data into a\ntransferred predictive distribution -- with compressive possibilities -- is\nenriched by (the possible expertise of) the local source model. In addition,\nthe introduction of the global target modeller allows correlation between the\nsource and target tasks -- if known to the target -- to be accounted for.\nImportant consequences emerge. Firstly, the new scheme attains the performance\nof fully modelled (i.e. conventional) multitask learning schemes in (those\nrare) cases where target model misspecification is avoided.

Unlike conventional methods (e.g., BERT,\nGloVe) that use dense representations for word embedding, our algorithm encodes\nsemantic meaning of words and their context in the form of sparse binary hash\ncodes. The quality of the learned representations is evaluated on word\nsimilarity analysis, word-sense disambiguation, and document classification. It\nis shown that not only can the fruit fly network motif achieve performance\ncomparable to existing methods in NLP, but, additionally, it uses only a\nfraction of the computational resources (shorter training time and smaller\nmemory footprint).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 05:41:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 19:50:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

We propose an algorithm that boosts MARL training using the biased\naction information of other agents based on a friend-or-foe concept. For a\ncooperative and competitive environment, there are generally two groups of\nagents: cooperative-agents and competitive-agents. In the proposed algorithm,\neach agent updates its value function using its own action and the biased\naction information of other agents in the two groups. The biased joint action\nof cooperative agents is computed as the sum of their actual joint action and\nthe imaginary cooperative joint action, by assuming all the cooperative agents\njointly maximize the target agent's value function. The biased joint action of\ncompetitive agents can be computed similarly. Each agent then updates its own\nvalue function using the biased action information, resulting in a biased value\nfunction and corresponding biased policy. Subsequently, the biased policy of\neach agent is inevitably subjected to recommend an action to cooperate and\ncompete with other agents, thereby introducing more active interactions among\nagents and enhancing the MARL policy learning. We empirically demonstrate that\nour algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in various mixed\ncooperative-competitive environments.

However, relying on a\ncentralized server for model aggregation, standard FL is vulnerable to server\nmalfunctions, untrustworthy server, and external attacks. To address this\nissue, we propose a decentralized FL framework by integrating blockchain into\nFL, namely, blockchain assisted decentralized federated learning (BLADE-FL). In\na round of the proposed BLADE-FL, each client broadcasts the trained model to\nother clients, aggregates its own model with received ones, and then competes\nto generate a block before its local training of the next round. We evaluate\nthe learning performance of BLADE-FL, and develop an upper bound on the global\nloss function. Then we verify that this bound is convex with respect to the\nnumber of overall aggregation rounds K, and optimize the computing resource\nallocation for minimizing the upper bound. We also note that there is a\ncritical problem of training deficiency, caused by lazy clients who plagiarize\nothers' trained models and add artificial noises to disguise their cheating\nbehaviors. Focusing on this problem, we explore the impact of lazy clients on\nthe learning performance of BLADE-FL, and characterize the relationship among\nthe optimal K, the learning parameters, and the proportion of lazy clients.\nBased on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, we show that the experimental\nresults are consistent with the analytical ones. To be specific, the gap\nbetween the developed upper bound and experimental results is lower than 5%,\nand the optimized K based on the upper bound can effectively minimize the loss\nfunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 07:19:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 13:41:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

The results of experiments in the Atari game domain with\nunstable reward signals show that our method stabilizes training convergence.\nWe also discuss the extensibility of the model by visualizing feature maps.\nThis approach has the potential to make DRL more practical for use in noisy,\nreal-world scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 07:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

In some cases, precession-induced\nmodulations in the spin-down power may be discernible in the X-ray flux of the\nplateau. In this work, 25 X-ray light curves associated with bursts exhibiting\na plateau are fitted to luminosity profiles appropriate for precessing, oblique\nrotators.

Current interpretation techniques mainly focus on the\nfeature attribution perspective, which are limited in indicating why and how\nparticular explanations are related to the prediction. To this end, an\nintriguing class of explanations, named counterfactuals, has been developed to\nfurther explore the \"what-if\" circumstances for interpretation, and enables the\nreasoning capability on black-box models. However, generating counterfactuals\nfor raw data instances (i.e., text and image) is still in the early stage due\nto its challenges on high data dimensionality and unsemantic raw features. In\nthis paper, we design a framework to generate counterfactuals specifically for\nraw data instances with the proposed Attribute-Informed Perturbation (AIP). By\nutilizing generative models conditioned with different attributes,\ncounterfactuals with desired labels can be obtained effectively and\nefficiently. Instead of directly modifying instances in the data space, we\niteratively optimize the constructed attribute-informed latent space, where\nfeatures are more robust and semantic.

Neurostimulation by Focused Ultrasound (FUS) is a promising\ntechnology with potential to rival other clinically-used techniques for the\ninvestigation of brain function and treatment of numerous neurological\ndiseases. The purpose of this study was to characterize spatial and temporal\naspects of causal electrophysiological signals directly stimulated by short,\nsingle pulses of focused ultrasound (FUS) on ex vivo mouse hippocampal brain\nslices. Approach: MicroElectrode Arrays (MEA) are used to study the\nspatio-temporal dynamics of extracellular neuronal activities both at the\nsingle neuron and neural networks scales. Hence, MEAs provide an excellent\nplatform for characterization of electrical activity generated, modulated and\ntransmitted in response to FUS exposure. In this study, a novel mixed FUS/MEA\nplatform was designed for the spatio-temporal description of the causal\nresponses generated by single 1.78 MHz FUS pulses in ex vivo mouse hippocampal\nbrain slices. Main results: Our results show that FUS pulses can generate local\nfield potentials (LFPs), sustained by synchronized neuronal post-synaptic\npotentials, and reproducing network activities. LFPs induced by FUS stimulation\nwere found to be repeatable to consecutive FUS pulses though exhibiting a wide\nrange of amplitudes (50-600 $\\mu$V), durations (20-200 ms), and response delays\n(10-60 ms). Moreover, LFPs were spread across the hippocampal slice following\nsingle FUS pulses thus demonstrating that FUS may be capable of stimulating\ndifferent neural structures within the hippocampus. Significance: Current\nknowledge on neurostimulation by ultrasound describes neuronal activity\ngenerated by trains of repetitive ultrasound pulses. This novel study details\nthe causal neural responses produced by single-pulse FUS neurostimulation while\nillustrating the distribution and propagation properties of this neural\nactivity along major neural pathways of the hippocampus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 08:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

Players engage in public goods games and\nare allowed to leave their groups if too many defections occur. Both social\ncohesion and task cohesion may prevent players from leaving. While a higher\nlevel of social cohesion increases a player's tolerance towards defections,\ntask cohesion is associated with her group performance in the past. With a\nhigher level of task cohesion, it is more likely that a dissatisfied player\nwill refer to the history and remains in her group if she was satisfied in the\npast. Our results reveal that social cohesion is detrimental to the evolution\nof cooperation while task cohesion facilitates it. This is because social\ncohesion hinders the conditional dissociation mechanism but task cohesion\nimproves the robustness of cooperative groups which are usually vulnerable to\nmistakes. We also discuss other potential aspects of cohesion and how they can\nbe investigated through our modelling.

First, we\ninvestigate different large-scale magnetic fields with their effects on the\nstanding shocks and on the stratified jet morphology.

Specifically, our first\ncontribution is a novel and systematic process of formulating general motion\nmodels and application of this process is to extend our Game-Theoretic Social\nForce Model (GSFM) towards a general model for generating a large variety of\nmotion behaviors of pedestrians and cars from different shared spaces. Our\nsecond contribution is to consider different motion patterns of pedestrians by\ncalibrating motion-related features of individual pedestrian and clustering\nthem into groups. We analyze two clustering approaches. The calibration and\nevaluation of our model are performed on three different shared space data\nsets. The results indicate that our model can realistically simulate a wide\nrange of motion behaviors and interaction scenarios, and that adding different\nmotion patterns of pedestrians into our model improves its performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 10:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

These torques evolve over time\ndue to the long-term variations of its orbit and to the migration of its\nsatellites. With numerical simulations, we explore the future evolution of\nJupiter's spin axis for different values of its moment of inertia and for\ndifferent migration rates of its satellites. Analytical formulas show the\nlocation and properties of all relevant resonances.\n  Results: Because of the migration of the Galilean satellites, Jupiter's\nobliquity is currently increasing, as it adiabatically follows the drift of a\nsecular spin-orbit resonance with the nodal precession mode of Uranus. Using\nthe current estimates of the migration rate of the satellites, the obliquity of\nJupiter can reach values ranging from 6{\\deg} to 37{\\deg} after 5 Gyrs from\nnow, according to the precise value of its polar moment of inertia. A faster\nmigration for the satellites would produce a larger increase in obliquity, as\nlong as the drift remains adiabatic.\n  Conclusions: Despite its peculiarly small current value, the obliquity of\nJupiter is no different from other obliquities in the Solar System: It is\nequally sensitive to secular spin-orbit resonances and it will probably reach\ncomparable values in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 10:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

All-at-once methods offer a number of\nbenefits over separate treatment of space and time, most notably significantly\nincreased parallelism and faster time-to-solution (when applicable).

In\norder to fully exploit the spatial diversity while minimizing the passive\nenergy consumed by radio frequency (RF) components, the BS is equipped with M\nRF chains and N antennas, where M < N. Upon receiving pilot sequences to obtain\nthe channel state information, the BS determines the best subset of M antennas\nfor serving the users. We propose a joint antenna selection and precoding\ndesign (JASPD) algorithm to maximize the system sum rate subject to a transmit\npower constraint and QoS requirements. The JASPD overcomes the non-convexity of\nthe formulated problem via a doubly iterative algorithm, in which an inner loop\nsuccessively optimizes the precoding vectors, followed by an outer loop that\ntries all valid antenna subsets. Although approaching the (near) global\noptimality, the JASPD suffers from a combinatorial complexity, which may limit\nits application in real-time network operations.

Our idea is based on two techniques: preprocessing and very fast edge\npartitioning, called graph edge ordering and chunk-based edge partitioning,\nrespectively. The former converts the graph data into an ordered edge list in\nsuch a way that edges with high locality are closer to each other. The latter\nimmediately divides the ordered edge list into an arbitrary number of\nhigh-quality partitions.

Previous methods have shown their success in\nface parsing, which however overlook the correlation among facial components.\nAs a matter of fact, the component-wise relationship is a critical clue in\ndiscriminating ambiguous pixels in facial area. To address this issue, we\npropose adaptive graph representation learning and reasoning over facial\ncomponents, aiming to learn representative vertices that describe each\ncomponent, exploit the component-wise relationship and thereby produce accurate\nparsing results against ambiguity. In particular, we devise an adaptive and\ndifferentiable graph abstraction method to represent the components on a graph\nvia pixel-to-vertex projection under the initial condition of a predicted\nparsing map, where pixel features within a certain facial region are aggregated\nonto a vertex. Further, we explicitly incorporate the image edge as a prior in\nthe model, which helps to discriminate edge and non-edge pixels during the\nprojection, thus leading to refined parsing results along the edges. Then, our\nmodel learns and reasons over the relations among components by propagating\ninformation across vertices on the graph. Finally, the refined vertex features\nare projected back to pixel grids for the prediction of the final parsing map.\nTo train our model, we propose a discriminative loss to penalize small\ndistances between vertices in the feature space, which leads to distinct\nvertices with strong semantics. Experimental results show the superior\nperformance of the proposed model on multiple face parsing datasets, along with\nthe validation on the human parsing task to demonstrate the generalizability of\nour model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 12:17:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 04:22:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 05:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

Recently, remarkable methods have been proposed in\nthis field. Most of these approaches use encoder-decoder architectures and have\ndifferent limitations such as allowing unique results for a given image and a\nparticular mask. Alternatively, some optimization-based approaches generate\npromising results using different masks with generator networks. However, these\napproaches are computationally more expensive. In this paper, we propose an\nefficient solution to the facial image inpainting problem using the Cyclic\nReverse Generator (CRG) architecture, which provides an encoder-generator\nmodel. We use the encoder to embed a given image to the generator space and\nincrementally inpaint the masked regions until a plausible image is generated;\nwe trained a discriminator model to assess the quality of the generated images\nduring the iterations and determine the convergence. After the generation\nprocess, for the post-processing, we utilize a Unet model that we trained\nspecifically for this task to remedy the artifacts close to the mask\nboundaries. We empirically observed that only a few iterations are sufficient\nto generate realistic images with the proposed model. Since the models are not\ntrained for particular mask types, our method allows applying sketch-based\ninpaintings, using a variety of mask types, and producing multiple and diverse\nresults. We compared our method with the state-of-the-art models both\nquantitatively and qualitatively, and observed that our method can compete with\nthe other models in all mask types; it is particularly better in images where\nlarger masks are utilized.

However, the mechanisms\nunderlying pattern emergence remain unclear. Some theories hypothesize that\npatterns could result from a water-mediated scale-dependent feedback (SDF)\nwhereby interactions favoring plant growth dominate at short distances and\ngrowth-inhibitory interactions dominate in the long range. However, we know\nlittle about how the presence of a focal plant affects the fitness of its\nneighbors as a function of the inter-individual distance, which is expected to\nbe highly ecosystem-dependent. This lack of empirical knowledge and system\ndependency challenge the relevance of SDF as a unifying theory for vegetation\npattern formation. Assuming that plant interactions are always inhibitory and\nonly their intensity is scale-dependent, alternative theories also recover the\ntypical vegetation patterns observed in nature. Importantly, although these\nalternative hypotheses lead to visually indistinguishable patterns, they\npredict contrasting desertification dynamics, which questions the potential use\nof vegetation patterns as ecosystem-state indicators. To help resolve this\nissue, we first review existing theories for vegetation self-organization and\ntheir conflicting predictions about desertification dynamics.

Within the standard Tilman model for a single consumer\nand a single resource, when a very efficient consumer rapidly eats all\navailable food, the resource density becomes zero, but if there is no food, how\ncan the consumer survive? The paradox can be lifted by realising that on the\nshort term indeed rapid consumption may lead to starvation and a decline in the\nconsumer population, but in the long term a finite resource and consumer\ndensity remain. A single consumer living on two essential nutrients leaves the\ndensity of the non-limiting nutrient above its critical level, so what is done\nwith the extra food? We explain that this does not imply extra food is\nconsumed, just for fun, but that in fact the food is left untouched because\nthere is no use for it. For a model with two consumers competing for a single\nnutrient one of the consumers will eventually disappear, even if the food\neconomics of the surviving one is worse and there is still much food wasted.\nBoth are inherent aspects of the model, and the paradox can be avoided if the\ndifference between the consumers is small, in which case it will take very long\nto reach equilibrium. We argue that in general an extended stability analysis,\nin which not only the asymptotically stable state is considered, but also the\nunstable steady states and all time scales involved in the transient dynamics,\ncan help in avoiding apparent contradictions in ecological models, or accepting\nthem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 14:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

New sensitive, high-resolution\nCO(1-0) observations of the Taffy system with the IRAM PdBI are presented.\nAbout 25% of the total interferometric CO luminosity stems from the bridge\nregion. Assuming a Galactic N(H2)/ICO conversion factor for the galactic disks\nand a third of this value for the bridge gas, about 10% of the molecular gas\nmass is located in the bridge region. The giant HII region close to UGC 12915\nis located at the northern edge of the high-surface brightness giant molecular\ncloud association (GMA), which has the highest velocity dispersion among the\nbridge GMAs. The bridge GMAs are clearly not virialized because of their high\nvelocity dispersion. Three dynamical models are presented and while no single\nmodel reproduces all of the observed features, they are all present in at least\none of the models. Most of the bridge gas detected in CO does not form stars.\nWe suggest that turbulent adiabatic compression is responsible for the\nexceptionally high velocity dispersion of the molecular ISM and the suppression\nof star formation in the Taffy bridge. In this scenario the turbulent velocity\ndispersion of the largest eddies and turbulent substructures/clouds increase\nsuch that giant molecular clouds are no longer in global virial equilibrium.\nThe increase of the virial parameter leads to a decrease of the star formation\nefficiency. Most of the low-surface density, CO-emitting gas will disperse\nwithout forming stars but some of the high-density gas will probably collapse\nand form dense star clusters, such as the luminous HII region close to UGC\n12915.

To\novercome this limiting hurdle, a new semiempirical formula for diffuseness that\nis dependent on charge and neutron numbers is proposed in this work. With the\nmodel at hand, half-lives of 218 SHN are computed, for 68 of which there exists\navailable experimental data and 150 of which are predicted.

A particularly interesting case is\nthe fluid dynamic limit that is commonly obtained in the limit of small Knudsen\nnumber. However, in this case the Maxwellian which describes the corresponding\nequilibrium distribution is not necessarily low-rank; because of this, the\nmethods known in the literature are only applicable to the weakly compressible\ncase. In this paper, we propose an efficient dynamical low-rank integrator that\ncan capture the fluid limit -- the Navier-Stokes equations -- of the\nBoltzmann-BGK model even in the compressible regime. This is accomplished by\nwriting the solution as $f=Mg$, where $M$ is the Maxwellian and the low-rank\napproximation is only applied to $g$.

The\nextraction of all $k$-mers and their frequencies is extremely demanding in\nterms of running time and memory, owing to the size of the data and to the\nexponential number of $k$-mers to be considered. However, in several\napplications, only frequent $k$-mers, which are $k$-mers appearing in a\nrelatively high proportion of the data, are required by the analysis. In this\nwork we present SPRISS, a new efficient algorithm to approximate frequent\n$k$-mers and their frequencies in next-generation sequencing data. SPRISS\nemploys a simple yet powerful reads sampling scheme, which allows to extract a\nrepresentative subset of the dataset that can be used, in combination with any\n$k$-mer counting algorithm, to perform downstream analyses in a fraction of the\ntime required by the analysis of the whole data, while obtaining comparable\nanswers. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and\naccuracy of SPRISS in approximating frequent $k$-mers, and shows that it can be\nused in various scenarios, such as the comparison of metagenomic datasets and\nthe identification of discriminative $k$-mers, to extract insights in a\nfraction of the time required by the analysis of the whole dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 15:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

This can be remedied by learning richer objects, such as\na model of the environment, or successor states. Successor states model the\nexpected future state occupancy from any given state for a given policy and are\nrelated to goal-dependent value functions, which learn how to reach arbitrary\nstates. We formally derive the temporal difference algorithm for successor\nstate and goal-dependent value function learning, either for discrete or for\ncontinuous environments with function approximation. Especially, we provide\nfinite-variance estimators even in continuous environments, where the reward\nfor exactly reaching a goal state becomes infinitely sparse.

In the tabular case and with infinitesimal learning\nrates, mixing the usual and backward Bellman operators provably improves\neigenvalues for asymptotic convergence, and the asymptotic convergence of the\nBN operator is provably better than TD, with a rate independent from the\nenvironment. However, the BN method is more complex and less robust to sampling\nnoise. Finally, a forward-backward (FB) finite-rank parameterization of\nsuccessor states enjoys reduced variance and improved samplability, provides a\ndirect model of the value function, has fully understood fixed points\ncorresponding to long-range dependencies, approximates the BN method, and\nprovides two canonical representations of states as a byproduct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 15:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

The calculations demonstrate that\nfor lattice-matched triple-junction solar cells and inverted metamorphic\nquadruple-junction solar cells, high-low refractive index stacks outperform the\noptimum double-layer antireflection coatings. The new design philosophy\nrequires no new optical materials because only two materials are used and\nexhibits excellent performance in broadband spectra. The angle performance of\nthese antireflection coatings is slightly better than classical double-layers\nwhereas the analysis for thickness sensitivity shows that small deviations from\ndeposition targets only slightly impact the performance of antireflection\ncoatings. Finally, some technical solutions for depositing these high-low\nrefractive index multilayers are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 15:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

The Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is the W3C recommendation\nlanguage for integrity constraints over RDF knowledge graphs. Enabling quality\nassements of knowledge graphs, SHACL is rapidly gaining attention in real-world\nscenarios. SHACL models integrity constraints as a network of shapes, where a\nshape contains the constraints to be fullfiled by the same entities. The\nvalidation of a SHACL shape schema can face the issue of tractability during\nvalidation. To facilitate full adoption, efficient computational methods are\nrequired. We present Trav-SHACL, a SHACL engine capable of planning the\ntraversal and execution of a shape schema in a way that invalid entities are\ndetected early and needless validations are minimized. Trav-SHACL reorders the\nshapes in a shape schema for efficient validation and rewrites target and\nconstraint queries for the fast detection of invalid entities. Trav-SHACL is\nempirically evaluated on 27 testbeds executed against knowledge graphs of up to\n34M triples.
