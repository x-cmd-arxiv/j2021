The purpose of this research is to\npropose a methodological and practical framework in order to perform liquidity\nstress testing programs, which comply with regulatory guidelines (ESMA, 2019)\nand are useful for fund managers. The review of the academic literature and\nprofessional research studies shows that there is a lack of standardized and\nanalytical models.

The\nhistorical approach must be complemented by an analytical approach based on\nzero-inflated models if we want to understand the true parameters that\ninfluence the redemption shocks. Moreover, we must also distinguish aggregate\npopulation models and individual-based models if we want to develop behavioral\napproaches. Once these different statistical models are calibrated, the second\nbig issue is the risk measure to assess normal and stressed redemption shocks.\nFinally, the last issue is to develop a factor model that can translate stress\nscenarios on market risk factors into stress scenarios on fund liabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 16:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-07"}

This control method is able to\nachieve drag reduction and even relaminarize the flow under certain control\nparameters at low Reynolds number. Two control parameters, which are velocity\namplitude and wavelength, are considered. An annular boundary layer, called\nSpatial Stokes Layer (SSL), is formed by the wall rotation. Based on the\nthickness of SSL, two types of drag reduction scenarios are identified. When\nthe thickness is low, the SSL acts as a spacer layer, obstructing the impact of\nfluids against the wall and hence reducing the shear stress. The flow\nstructures in the outer layer are less affected and are stretched in streamwise\ndirection due to the increased velocity gradient. Within the SSL, the\nturbulence intensity diminishes dramatically. When the thickness is large, a\nstreamwise wavy pattern of near-wall low-speed streaks is formed. The\norientation of streaks is found to lag behind the direction of local mean\nvelocity in phase and conform to the direction of local resultant shear stress.\nThe streamwise scale of near-wall flow structures is significantly reduced,\nresulting in the disruption of downstream development of flow structures and\nhence leading to the drag reduction. Besides, it is found that it requires both\nlarge enough thickness of SSL and velocity amplitude to relaminarize the\nturbulence. The relaminarization mechanism is that the annular SSL can\ncontinuously absorb energy from wall-normal stress due to the rotation effect,\nthereby the turbulence self-sustaining process could not be maintained. For the\nrelaminarization cases, the laminar state is stable to even extremely large\nperturbations, which possibly makes laminar state the only fixed point for the\nwhole system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 16:10:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 02:56:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 08:04:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 03:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

The security pitfalls of IoT devices have\nmade it easy for hackers to take over IoT devices and use them for malicious\nactivities like botnet attacks. With the rampant emergence of IoT devices,\nbotnet attacks are surging. The botnet attacks are not only catastrophic for\nIoT device users but also for the rest of the world. Therefore, there is a\ncrucial need to identify and mitigate the possible threats in IoT devices\nduring the design phase. Threat modelling is a technique that is used to\nidentify the threats in the earlier stages of the system design activity. In\nthis paper, we propose a threat modelling approach to analyze and mitigate the\nbotnet attacks in an IoT smart home use case. The proposed methodology\nidentifies the development-level and application-level threats in smart home\nuse case using STRIDE and VAST threat modelling methods.

How much communication noise can FL handle and what\nis its impact to the learning performance? This work is devoted to answering\nthese practically important questions by explicitly incorporating both uplink\nand downlink noisy channels in the FL pipeline. We present several novel\nconvergence analyses of FL over simultaneous uplink and downlink noisy\ncommunication channels, which encompass full and partial clients participation,\ndirect model and model differential transmissions, and non-independent and\nidentically distributed (IID) local datasets. These analyses characterize the\nsufficient conditions for FL over noisy channels to have the same convergence\nbehavior as the ideal case of no communication error. More specifically, in\norder to maintain the O(1/T) convergence rate of FedAvg with perfect\ncommunications, the uplink and downlink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for direct\nmodel transmissions should be controlled such that they scale as O(t^2) where t\nis the index of communication rounds, but can stay constant for model\ndifferential transmissions. The key insight of these theoretical results is a\n\"flying under the radar\" principle - stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is an\ninherent noisy process and uplink/downlink communication noises can be\ntolerated as long as they do not dominate the time-varying SGD noise. We\nexemplify these theoretical findings with two widely adopted communication\ntechniques - transmit power control and diversity combining - and further\nvalidating their performance advantages over the standard methods via extensive\nnumerical experiments using several real-world FL tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 18:57:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 21:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

Non-canonical IMFs can greatly affect\nthe evolution of GCs, mainly because the high end determines how many black\nholes (BHs) form. Here we compute a new set of GC models, varying the IMF\nwithin observational uncertainties. We find that GCs with top-heavy IMFs lose\nmost of their mass within a few Gyr through stellar winds and tidal stripping.\nHeating of the cluster through BH mass segregation greatly enhances this\nprocess. We show that, as they approach complete dissolution, GCs with\ntop-heavy IMFs can evolve into 'dark clusters' consisting of mostly BHs by\nmass. In addition to producing more BHs, GCs with top-heavy IMFs also produce\nmany more binary BH (BBH) mergers.

We argue that anomalies can imply an exact\nbose-fermi degeneracy in the Hilbert space, thus revealing a supersymmetric\nspectrum of states; we provide a sharp characterization of when this phenomenon\noccurs and give nontrivial examples in various dimensions, including in\nstrongly coupled QFTs. Unraveling the anomalies of TQFTs leads us to develop\nthe construction of the Hilbert spaces, the action of operators and the modular\ndata in spin TQFTs, material that can be read on its own.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 15:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

In this paper, we will\nintroduce Sigma along with its diverse capabilities and then use three distinct\nproof-of-concept Sigma models to highlight combinations of these capabilities:\n(1) Distributional reinforcement learning models in; (2) A pair of adaptive and\ninteractive agent models that demonstrate rule-based, probabilistic, and social\nreasoning; and (3) A knowledge-free exploration model in which an agent\nleverages only architectural appraisal variables, namely attention and\ncuriosity, to locate an item while building up a map in a Unity environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 19:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

This paper introduces a new framework to model\nand analyze the departure time user equilibrium (DTUE) problem based on the\nso-called Mean Field Games (MFGs) theory. The proposed framework is the\ncombination of two main components including (i) the reaction of travelers to\nthe traffic congestion by choosing their departure times to optimize their\ntravel cost; and (ii) the aggregation of the actions of the travelers, which\ndetermines the system level of service. In this paper, we first present a\ncontinuous departure time choice model and investigate the equilibria of the\nsystem. Specifically, we demonstrate the existence of the equilibrium and\ncharacterize the DTUE. Then, a discrete approximation of the system is provided\nbased on deterministic differential game models to numerically obtain the\nequilibrium of the system. To examine the efficiency of the proposed model, we\ncompare it with the departure time choice models in the literature. We apply\nour framework to a standard test case and observe that the solutions obtained\nbased on our model are 5.6\\% better in terms of relative cost compared to the\nsolutions determined based on models in the literature.

By bending around sensitive anatomical structures,\nsteerable needles have the potential to reduce the invasiveness of many medical\nprocedures. However, inserting these needles with curved trajectories increases\nthe risk of tissue damage due to perpendicular forces exerted on the\nsurrounding tissue by the needle's shaft, potentially resulting in lateral\nshearing through tissue. Such forces can cause significant damage to\nsurrounding tissue, negatively affecting patient outcomes. In this work, we\nderive a tissue and needle force model based on a Cosserat string formulation,\nwhich describes the normal forces and frictional forces along the shaft as a\nfunction of the planned needle path, friction model and parameters, and tip\npiercing force. We propose this new force model and associated cost function as\na safer and more clinically relevant metric than those currently used in motion\nplanning for steerable needles. We fit and validate our model through physical\nneedle robot experiments in a gel phantom. We use this force model to define a\nbottleneck cost function for motion planning and evaluate it against the\ncommonly used path-length cost function in hundreds of randomly generated 3-D\nenvironments. Plans generated with our force-based cost show a 62% reduction in\nthe peak modeled tissue force with only a 0.07% increase in length on average\ncompared to using the path-length cost in planning. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate the ability to plan motions with our force-based cost function in a\nlung tumor biopsy scenario from a segmented computed tomography (CT) scan. By\nplanning motions for the needle that aim to minimize the modeled\nneedle-to-tissue force explicitly, our method plans needle paths that may\nreduce the risk of significant tissue damage while still reaching desired\ntargets in the body.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 19:47:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 17:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

It is widely appreciated that these models can generate random graphs\nthat are small-world, highly clustered and scale-free at the same time; thus,\nreproducing the most fundamental common features of real networks. In the\npresent work, we focus on a less well-known property of the\npopularity-similarity optimisation (PSO) model and the\n$\\mathbb{S}^1/\\mathbb{H}^2$ model from this model family, namely that the\nnetworks generated by these approaches also contain communities for a wide\nrange of the parameters, which was certainly not an intention at the design of\nthe models. We extracted the communities from the studied networks using\nwell-established community finding methods such as Louvain, Infomap and label\npropagation. The observed high modularity values indicate that the community\nstructure can become very pronounced under certain conditions. In addition, the\nmodules found by the different algorithms show good consistency, implying that\nthese are indeed relevant and apparent structural units. Since the appearance\nof communities is rather common in networks representing real systems as well,\nthis feature of hyperbolic models makes them even more suitable for describing\nreal networks than thought before.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 20:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

However, the long-term, continuous, high-precision\nmonitoring data to test this hypothesis for more objects is lacking. By\napplying our novel photometric approach to TESS data, we extract a\nhigh-precision lightcurve of the closest brown dwarfs, which form the binary\nsystem Luhman 16AB. Our observations, that cover about 100 rotations of Luhman\n16B, display continuous lightcurve evolution. The periodogram analysis shows\nthat the rotational period of the component that dominates the lightcurve is\n5.28 h. We also find evidence for periods of 2.5 h, 6.94 h, and 90.8 h. We show\nthat the 2.5 h and 5.28 h periods emerge from Luhman 16B and that they consist\nof multiple, slightly shifted peaks, revealing the presence of high-speed jets\nand zonal circulation in this object. We find that the lightcurve evolution is\nwell fit by the planetary-scale waves model, further supporting this\ninterpretation. We argue that the 6.94 h peak is likely the rotation period of\nLuhman 16A. By comparing the rotational periods to observed v sin(i)\nmeasurements, we show that the two brown dwarfs are viewed at angles close to\ntheir equatorial planes. We also describe a long-period (P~91 h) evolution in\nthe lightcurve, which we propose emerges from the vortex-dominated polar\nregions.

However, it remains unclear whether and how this code could be\nimplemented in neural circuits. Recent advances in Recurrent Neural Networks\n(RNNs), which achieve near-human performance in some language tasks, provide a\ncompelling model to address such questions. Here, we present a new framework to\nstudy recursive processing in RNNs, using subject-verb agreement as a probe\ninto the representations of the neural network. We trained six distinct types\nof RNNs on a simplified probabilistic context-free grammar designed to\nindependently manipulate the length of a sentence and the depth of its\nsyntactic tree. All RNNs generalized to subject-verb dependencies longer than\nthose seen during training. However, none systematically generalized to deeper\ntree structures, even those with a structural bias towards learning nested tree\n(i.e., stack-RNNs). In addition, our analyses revealed primacy and recency\neffects in the generalization patterns of LSTM-based models, showing that these\nmodels tend to perform well on the outer- and innermost parts of a\ncenter-embedded tree structure, but poorly on its middle levels. Finally,\nprobing the internal states of the model during the processing of sentences\nwith nested tree structures, we found a complex encoding of grammatical\nagreement information (e.g. grammatical number), in which all the information\nfor multiple words nouns was carried by a single unit. Taken together, these\nresults indicate how neural networks may extract bounded nested tree\nstructures, without learning a systematic recursive rule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 20:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

Reinforced dual crosslinked\nhydrogel networks were accomplished after 4-week incubation in disodium\nphosphate-supplemented solutions that notably enabled the mineralisation of\nhydroxyapatite (HAp) crystals across the entire hydrogel structure. Hydrogen\nphosphate-cystamine crosslinked HA hydrogen bond interactions were confirmed by\nattenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR)\nand density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

For quantum fluids\nsuch as atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, superfluid helium, and superfluid\nneutron stars, turbulence can also exist in the presence of a chaotic tangle of\nevolving quantized vortex lines. However, due to the lack of suitable\nexperimental tools to directly probe the vortex-tangle motion, so far little is\nknown about possible scaling laws that characterize the velocity correlations\nand trajectory statistics of the vortices in quantum-fluid turbulence (QT).\nAcquiring such knowledge could greatly benefit the development of advanced\nstatistical models of QT.

While most efforts aim at protecting qubits encoded into the\ninfinite dimensional Hilbert space of a bosonic mode, [Phys. Rev.

Although lots\nof defense methods are proposed, many of them are demonstrated to lose\neffectiveness when against properly performed adaptive attacks. How to evaluate\nthe adversarial robustness effectively is important for the realistic\ndeployment of deep models, but yet still unclear. To provide a reasonable\nsolution, one of the primary things is to understand the error (or gap) between\nthe true adversarial robustness and the evaluated one, what is it and why it\nexists. Several works are done in this paper to make it clear. Firstly, we\nintroduce an interesting phenomenon named gradient traps, which lead to\nincompetent adversaries and are demonstrated to be a manifestation of\nevaluation error. Then, we analyze the error and identify that there are three\ncomponents. Each of them is caused by a specific compromise. Moreover, based on\nthe above analysis, we present our evaluation suggestions.

The graph contains attributes\nof all nodes but labels of a few nodes. The classical label propagation (LP)\nmethod and the emerging graph convolutional network (GCN) are two popular\nsemi-supervised solutions to this problem. The LP method is not effective in\nmodeling node attributes and labels jointly or facing a slow convergence rate\non large-scale graphs. GraphHop is proposed to its shortcoming. With proper\ninitial label vector embeddings, each iteration of GraphHop contains two steps:\n1) label aggregation and 2) label update. In Step 1, each node aggregates its\nneighbors' label vectors obtained in the previous iteration. In Step 2, a new\nlabel vector is predicted for each node based on the label of the node itself\nand the aggregated label information obtained in Step 1. This iterative\nprocedure exploits the neighborhood information and enables GraphHop to perform\nwell in an extremely small label rate setting and scale well for very large\ngraphs. Experimental results show that GraphHop outperforms state-of-the-art\ngraph learning methods on a wide range of tasks (e.g., multi-label and\nmulti-class classification on citation networks, social graphs, and commodity\nconsumption graphs) in graphs of various sizes.

Therefore, each state of H2\ndifferently affects not only the chemistry but also the macroscopic gas\ndynamics in space, and thus, the ortho-to-para abundance ratio (OPR) of H2 has\nsignificant impacts on various astronomical phenomena. For a long time, the OPR\nof nascent H2 upon formation on dust grains has been assumed to have a\nstatistical value of three and to gradually equilibrate in the gas phase at the\ntemperature of the circumstances. Recently, NSC of H2 was experimentally\nrevealed to occur on water ice at very low temperatures and thus incorporated\ninto gas-dust chemical models. However, H2 molecules should form well before\ndust grains are coated by water ice. Information about how the OPR of H2\nbehaves on bare silicate dust before ice-mantle formation is lacking. Knowing\nthe influence of the OPR of H2 if the OPR changes even on a bare silicate\nsurface within an astronomically meaningful time scale is desirable. We report\nthe first laboratory measurements of NSC of H2 physisorbed on amorphous\nsilicate (Mg2SiO4) at temperatures up to 18 K. The conversion was found to\noccur very rapidly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 03:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

In the distributed setup, the constituent sub-systems of the joint\nquantum state are measured by two agents, Alice and Bob. A third agent, Charlie\nreceives the measurement outcomes sent by Alice and Bob. Charlie uses local and\npairwise shared randomness to compute a bivariate function of the measurement\noutcomes. The objective of three agents is to faithfully simulate the given\ndistributed quantum measurement acting on the given quantum state while\nminimizing the communication and shared randomness rates. We demonstrate a new\nachievable information-theoretic rate-region that exploits the bivariate\nfunction using random structured POVMs based on asymptotically good algebraic\ncodes. The algebraic structure of these codes is matched to that of the\nbivariate function that models the action of Charlie. The conventional approach\nfor this class of problems has been to reconstruct individual measurement\noutcomes corresponding to Alice and Bob, at Charlie, and then compute the\nbivariate function, achieved using mutually independent approximating POVMs\nbased on random unstructured codes. In the present approach, using algebraic\nstructured POVMs, the computation is performed on the fly, thus obviating the\nneed to reconstruct individual measurement outcomes at Charlie. Using this, we\nshow that a strictly larger rate region can be achieved. One of the challenges\nin analyzing these structured POVMs is that they exhibit only pairwise\nindependence and induce only uniform single-letter distributions. To address\nthis, we use nesting of algebraic codes and develop a covering lemma applicable\nto pairwise-independent POVM ensembles. Combining these techniques, we provide\na multi-party distributed faithful simulation and function computation\nprotocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 04:22:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 21:31:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 20:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

In this paper, we formulate and\ncalculate the evolution of grain size distribution and grain porosity through\nshattering and coagulation. For coagulation, we treat the grain evolution\ndepending on the collision energy. Shattering is treated as a mechanism of\nforming small compact fragments. The balance between these processes are\ndetermined by the dense-gas mass fraction $\\eta_\\mathrm{dense}$, which\ndetermines the time fraction of coagulation relative to shattering. We find\nthat the interplay between shattering supplying small grains and coagulation\nforming porous grains from shattered grains is fundamentally important in\ncreating and maintaining porosity. The porosity rises to 0.7--0.9 (or the\nfilling factor 0.3--0.1) around grain radii $a\\sim 0.1~\\mu$m. We also find\nthat, in the case of $\\eta_\\mathrm{dense}=0.1$ (very efficient shattering with\nweak coagulation) porosity significantly enhances coagulation, creating fluffy\nsubmicron grains with filling factors lower than 0.1. The porosity enhances the\nextinction by 10--20 per cent at all wavelengths for amorphous carbon and at\nultraviolet wavelengths for silicate. The extinction curve shape of silicate\nbecomes steeper if we take porosity into account. We conclude that the\ninterplay between shattering and coagulation is essential in creating porous\ngrains in the interstellar medium and that the resulting porosity can impact\nthe grain size distributions and extinction curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 04:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

Existing deep learning based global descriptors for the\nretrieval task usually consume a large amount of computation resources (e.g.,\nmemory), which may not be suitable for the cases of limited hardware resources.\nIn this paper, we develop an efficient point cloud learning network (EPC-Net)\nto form a global descriptor for visual place recognition, which can obtain good\nperformance and reduce computation memory and inference time. First, we propose\na lightweight but effective neural network module, called ProxyConv, to\naggregate the local geometric features of point clouds. We leverage the spatial\nadjacent matrix and proxy points to simplify the original edge convolution for\nlower memory consumption. Then, we design a lightweight grouped VLAD network\n(G-VLAD) to form global descriptors for retrieval. Compared with the original\nVLAD network, we propose a grouped fully connected (GFC) layer to decompose the\nhigh-dimensional vectors into a group of low-dimensional vectors, which can\nreduce the number of parameters of the network and maintain the discrimination\nof the feature vector. Finally, to further reduce the inference time, we\ndevelop a simple version of EPC-Net, called EPC-Net-L, which consists of two\nProxyConv modules and one max pooling layer to aggregate global descriptors. By\ndistilling the knowledge from EPC-Net, EPC-Net-L can obtain discriminative\nglobal descriptors for retrieval. Extensive experiments on the Oxford dataset\nand three in-house datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance with lower parameters, FLOPs, and runtime per\nframe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 05:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

For example, to describe a musical note, one needs\nseparate tokens to indicate the note's pitch, duration, velocity (dynamics),\nand placement (onset time) along the time grid. While different types of tokens\nmay possess different properties, existing models usually treat them equally,\nin the same way as modeling words in natural languages.

LIS identifies an intrinsic low-dimensional\nlinear subspace where the target distribution differs the most from some\ntractable reference distribution. Such a subspace can be identified using the\nleading eigenvectors of a Gram matrix of the gradient of the log-likelihood\nfunction. Then, the original high-dimensional target distribution is\napproximated through various forms of marginalization of the likelihood\nfunction, in which the approximated likelihood only has support on the\nintrinsic low-dimensional subspace. This approximation enables the design of\ninference algorithms that can scale sub-linearly with the apparent\ndimensionality of the problem. Intuitively, the accuracy of the approximation,\nand hence the performance of the inference algorithms, are influenced by three\nfactors -- the dimension truncation error in identifying the subspace, Monte\nCarlo error in estimating the Gram matrices, and Monte Carlo error in\nconstructing marginalizations. %This work establishes a unified framework to\nanalyze each of these three factors and their interplay.

The main goal of this work is to investigate\nwhether the extended, mildly relativistic jet that is present in black hole\nbinaries in the hard and hard-intermediate states is the hard X-ray source that\nilluminates the accretion disk. We use a Monte Carlo code that simulates the\nprocess of inverse Compton scattering in a mildly relativistic jet. Blackbody\nphotons from the thin accretion disk are injected at the base of the jet and\ninteract with the energetic electrons that move outward. Despite the fact that\nthe jet moves away from the disk at a mildly relativistic speed, we find that\napproximately $15-20$\\% of the input soft photons are scattered back toward the\naccretion disk. The vast majority of the Comptonized, back-scattered photons\nescape very close to the black hole ($h\\lesssim 6 r_g$, where $r_g$ is the\ngravitational radius), but a non-negligible amount escape at a wide range of\nheights. At high heights, $h\\sim 500-2000\\,r_g$, the distribution falls off\nrapidly. The high-height cutoff strongly depends on the width of the jet at its\nbase and is almost insensitive to the optical depth. The disk illumination\nspectrum is softer than the direct jet spectrum of the radiation that escapes\nin directions that do not encounter the disk.

The originality of the approach consists in\napplying the forgetting only in the anticipation module and in keeping the EFS\n(called principal system) learned without any forgetting. Then, when a drift is\ndetected in the stream, a selection mechanism is proposed to replace the\nobsolete parameters of the principal system with more suitable parameters of\nthe anticipation module. An evaluation of the proposed methods is carried out\non benchmark online datasets, with a comparison with state-of-the-art online\nclassifiers (Learn++.NSE, PENsemble, pclass) as well as with the original\nsystem using different forgetting strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 09:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

Most of the\nexisting quaternion-based methods formulate low-rank QMC (LRQMC) as a\nquaternion nuclear norm (a convex relaxation of the rank) minimization\nproblem.The main limitation of these approaches is that the singular values\nbeing minimized simultaneously so that the low-rank property could not be\napproximated well and efficiently. To achieve a more accurate low-rank\napproximation, the matrix-based truncated nuclear norm has been proposed and\nalso been proved to have the superiority. In this paper, we introduce a\nquaternion truncated nuclear norm (QTNN) for LRQMC and utilize the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM) to get the optimization.We further\npropose weights to the residual error quaternion matrix during the update\nprocess for accelerating the convergence of the QTNN method with admissible\nperformance. The weighted method utilizes a concise gradient descent strategy\nwhich has a theoretical guarantee in optimization. The effectiveness of our\nmethod is illustrated by experiments on real visual datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 09:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

As a preliminary step of this examination, sleep stages are\nsystematically determined. In practice, sleep stage classification relies on\nthe visual inspection of 30-second epochs of polysomnography signals. Numerous\nautomatic approaches have been developed to replace this tedious and expensive\ntask. Although these methods demonstrated better performance than human sleep\nexperts on specific datasets, they remain largely unused in sleep clinics. The\nmain reason is that each sleep clinic uses a specific PSG montage that most\nautomatic approaches cannot handle out-of-the-box. Moreover, even when the PSG\nmontage is compatible, publications have shown that automatic approaches\nperform poorly on unseen data with different demographics. To address these\nissues, we introduce RobustSleepNet, a deep learning model for automatic sleep\nstage classification able to handle arbitrary PSG montages. We trained and\nevaluated this model in a leave-one-out-dataset fashion on a large corpus of 8\nheterogeneous sleep staging datasets to make it robust to demographic changes.\nWhen evaluated on an unseen dataset, RobustSleepNet reaches 97% of the F1 of a\nmodel explicitly trained on this dataset. Hence, RobustSleepNet unlocks the\npossibility to perform high-quality out-of-the-box automatic sleep staging with\nany clinical setup. We further show that finetuning RobustSleepNet, using a\npart of the unseen dataset, increases the F1 by 2% when compared to a model\ntrained specifically for this dataset. Therefore, finetuning might be used to\nreach a state-of-the-art level of performance on a specific population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 09:39:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 12:58:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-21"}

Application of a few types of source, which differ\nin the force driving the interface, and two surfactants with different\nrheological properties made it possible to generalize the results and to\ndevelop a unified approach to describing the flow patterns observed in this\nstudy. It is shown that, regardless of source type and surfactant used, the\nproblem under consideration can be completely described in terms of two\nnon-dimensional parameters. The first is the elasticity number introduced\nearlier by Homsy and Meiburg (J. Fluid Mech., v.139, 1984). This parameter is\nthe ratio of two shear stresses formed at the interface by surfactant and\nsource, and it defines the formation of the convective zone at the center\nnearby the source and the size of the stagnant zone at the periphery. The\nsecond, called the surface Rayleigh number, is introduced for the first time in\nthis paper. It is responsible for the appearance of the multi-vortex flow\nstructure within the stagnant zone.

Nevertheless, we present the first research that investigates the\ndiscovery problem of independence in data. In its arguably simplest form,\nindependence is a statement between two sets of columns expressing that for\nevery two rows in a table there is also a row in the table that coincides with\nthe first row on the first set of columns and with the second row on the second\nset of columns. We show that the problem of deciding whether there is an\nindependence statement that holds on a given table is not only NP-complete but\n$W[3]$-complete in its arguably most natural parameter, namely its arity. We\nestablish the first algorithm to discover all independence statement that hold\non a given table. We illustrate in experiments with benchmark data that our\nalgorithm performs well within the limits established by our hardness results.\nIn practice, it is often useful to determine the ratio with which independence\nstatements hold on a given table. For that purpose, we show that our treatment\nof independence and the design of our algorithm enables us to extend our\nfindings to approximate independence. In our final experiments, we provide some\ninsight into the trade-off between run time and the approximation ratio.\nNaturally, the smaller the ratio, the more approximate independence statements\nhold, and the more time it takes to discover all of them. While this research\nestablishes first insight into the computational properties of discovering\nindependence from data, we hope to initiate research into more sophisticated\nnotions of independence, including embedded multivalued dependencies, as well\nas their context-specific and probabilistic variants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 11:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

The networks have been trained with noisy data by creating Gaussian\nrandom realizations to reduce the statistical effects, resulting in similar\nredshift accuracy for both high-SNR (signal to noise ratio) and low-SNR data.\nThe probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the predicted redshifts are\nalso derived via Gaussian random realizations of the testing data, and then the\nbest-fit redshifts and 1-sigma errors also can be obtained. We find that our\nnetworks can provide excellent redshift estimates with accuracies ~0.001 and\n0.01 on spec-z and photo-z, respectively. Compared to existing photo-z codes,\nour MLP has similar accuracy but is more efficient in the training process. The\nfractions of catastrophic redshifts or outliers can be dramatically suppressed\ncomparing to the ordinary template-fitting method. This indicates that the\nneural network method is feasible and powerful for spec-z and photo-z\nestimations in future cosmological surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 13:21:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

To address this problem, we propose a new\nframework, called MRNet, for data-driven sleep staging by integrating a\nmulti-scale feature fusion model and a Markov-based sequential correction\nalgorithm.

The resulting lower limits are all consistent with the DLA metallicities\nfrom the literature. The GRB extinction curve exhibits a very strong 2175 A\nextinction bump. We try to constrain the metallicity of the GRB DLA by modeling\nthe GRB extinction curve using dust models with two (graphite and silicates)\nand three (PAH, hydrogenated amorphous carbon, and silicates) dust components.\nThe two-component model resulted in a metallicity of $Z\\sim$$-$0.45 while the\nthree-component model gives $Z\\sim$$-$0.50.

The amount\nof error induced is known as the effectiveness of the locking technique. \"SAT\nattacks\" provide a strong mathematical formulation to find the correct key of\nlocked circuits. In order to achieve high SAT resilience(i.e. complexity of SAT\nattacks), many conventional logic locking schemes fail to inject sufficient\nerror into the circuit. For example, in the case of SARLock and Anti-SAT, there\nare usually very few (or only one) input minterms that cause any error at the\ncircuit output. The state-of-the-art stripped functionality logic locking\n(SFLL) technique introduced a trade-off between SAT resilience and\neffectiveness. In this work, we prove that such a trade-off is universal in\nlogic locking. In order to attain high effectiveness of locking without\ncompromising SAT resilience, we propose a novel logic locking scheme, called\nStrong Anti-SAT (SAS). In addition to SAT attacks, removal-based attacks are\nalso popular against logic locking. Based on SAS, we propose Robust SAS (RSAS)\nwhich is resilient to removal attacks and maintains the same SAT resilience and\nas effectiveness as SAS. SAS and RSAS have the following significant\nimprovements over existing techniques. (1) SAT resilience of SAS and RSAS\nagainst SAT attack is not compromised by increase in effectiveness.

The most natural\nand consistent possibility is that some bifermion condensates form, breaking\nthe color gauge symmetry dynamically, together with part of the global\nsymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 15:59:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 21:38:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 09:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Accordingly, an appropriate policy approach is\nneeded today. While there has been a wave of scholarship in this field, the\nresearch community at times appears divided amongst those who emphasize\nnear-term concerns, and those focusing on long-term concerns and corresponding\npolicy measures. In this paper, we seek to map and critically examine this\nalleged gulf, with a view to understanding the practical space for\ninter-community collaboration on AI policy. This culminates in a proposal to\nmake use of the legal notion of an incompletely theorized agreement. We propose\nthat on certain issue areas, scholars working with near-term and long-term\nperspectives can converge and cooperate on selected mutually beneficial AI\npolicy projects all the while maintaining divergent perspectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 10:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

In\norder to eliminate the error-prone visual analysis of optical microscopy\nslides, we have investigated automated, fast, and low-cost systems for the\ndiagnosis of human intestinal parasites. In this work, we present a hybrid\napproach that combines the opinion of two decision-making systems with\ncomplementary properties: ($DS_1$) a simpler system based on very fast\nhandcrafted image feature extraction and support vector machine classification\nand ($DS_2$) a more complex system based on a deep neural network, Vgg-16, for\nimage feature extraction and classification. $DS_1$ is much faster than $DS_2$,\nbut it is less accurate than $DS_2$. Fortunately, the errors of $DS_1$ are not\nthe same of $DS_2$. During training, we use a validation set to learn the\nprobabilities of misclassification by $DS_1$ on each class based on its\nconfidence values. When $DS_1$ quickly classifies all images from a microscopy\nslide, the method selects a number of images with higher chances of\nmisclassification for characterization and reclassification by $DS_2$. Our\nhybrid system can improve the overall effectiveness without compromising\nefficiency, being suitable for the clinical routine -- a strategy that might be\nsuitable for other real applications. As demonstrated on large datasets, the\nproposed system can achieve, on average, 94.9%, 87.8%, and 92.5% of Cohen's\nKappa on helminth eggs, helminth larvae, and protozoa cysts, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 05:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

Turbulence plays an important role\nin particle dynamics inside clouds; however, turbulence mechanisms are not yet\nfully understood partly due to the difficulty of measuring clouds at the\nsmallest scales. To address these knowledge gaps, an experimental method for\nmeasuring the influence of fine-scale turbulence in cloud formation in-situ and\nproducing an in-field cloud Lagrangian dataset is being developed by means of\ninnovative ultra-light radioprobes. This paper presents the electronic system\ndesign along with the obtained results from laboratory and field experiments\nregarding these compact (diameter about 30 cm), light-weight (about 20 g), and\nexpendable devices designed to passively float and track small-scale turbulence\nfluctuations inside warm clouds. The fully customized mini radioprobe board (5\ncm x 5 cm) embeds sensors to measure local fluctuations and transmit data to\nthe ground in near real-time. The tests confirm that the newly developed probes\nperform well providing accurate information about atmospheric variables,\nreferenced in space. The integration of multiple radioprobes allows for a\nsystematic and accurate monitoring of atmospheric turbulence and its impact on\ncloud formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 10:55:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

Thus, changes in the livestock behavior are a critical indicator\nfor early detection and prevention of several diseases. Rumination behavior is\na significant variable for tracking the development and yield of animal\nhusbandry. Therefore, various monitoring methods and measurement equipment have\nbeen used to assess cattle behavior. However, these modern attached devices are\ninvasive, stressful and uncomfortable for the cattle and can influence\nnegatively the welfare and diurnal behavior of the animal. Multiple research\nefforts addressed the problem of rumination detection by adopting new methods\nby relying on visual features. However, they only use few postures of the dairy\ncow to recognize the rumination or feeding behavior. In this study, we\nintroduce an innovative monitoring method using Convolution Neural Network\n(CNN)-based deep learning models. The classification process is conducted under\ntwo main labels: ruminating and other, using all cow postures captured by the\nmonitoring camera. Our proposed system is simple and easy-to-use which is able\nto capture long-term dynamics using a compacted representation of a video in a\nsingle 2D image. This method proved efficiency in recognizing the rumination\nbehavior with 95%, 98% and 98% of average accuracy, recall and precision,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 07:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

For example at the individual agent level, more\nrecently acquired information may exert greater influence during\ndecision-making processes. To facilitate further exploration of this effect, we\nintroduce an efficient method for modelling temporally asynchronous opinion\nupdates, where the timing of updates depends on the timing of incoming opinion\nstates received from neighbours. The framework enables the introduction of\ninformation arrival-time lag by means of lag-vectors. These are used to weight\nthe relevance of information received by agents, based on the delay between its\nreceipt and the subsequent opinion update. The temporal dynamics (i.e. the\ntimes at which information is transmitted) are governed by an underlying\nalgebraic structure called max-plus algebra. We investigate the resulting\ncontinuous opinion dynamics under the max-plus regime using a modified\nHegselmann-Krause model, replacing the conventional confidence-interval based\non the distance between opinions with one based instead on the recency of\ninformation received by agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 18:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}
