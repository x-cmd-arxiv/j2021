The current paper proposes a concept that supports\nthe performance of students by analyzing three ways of distance learning,\nnamely text, text and illustrations, including charts, video. An\nelectroencephalogram headset allows the detection of brainwaves and the\ndeveloped web application enhances the process of distance learning. The\nelectrodes of the headset are placed at contact with the user head and monitor\nthe activity of the left and right frontal regions, along with the temporal\nlobe. Mood, focus, stress, relaxation, engagement, excitement and interest are\ntriggered as numerical values by using the headset. The users provide\ninformation about their daily activities, including learning and evaluation\nprocesses. According to the study, users had the highest long term attention\nwhile using text and illustrations, followed by watching videos. This is caused\nby the fact that the text contained the code for the programs which were\npresented in the video. Also, the users feel comfortable while using the\napplication and they started to pay more attention to the connection between\nstress, health, education and well being. The results triggered by the headset\nhad higher values while students studied for the first time using videos. When\nthey wanted to remember the information, the text and illustrations way of\nlearning was the best option. Based on the study outcomes, the instructional\ndesign can be enhanced. Moreover, the results improved as the students became\nmore equilibrated and confident in themselves. Teachers, professors and parents\nare able to collaborate and enhance training. While studying online under\nlockdown, students have found the proposed solution to be good because their\ninner state influences their productivity while solving problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2021 16:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

Motivated by the need for marginal inference in SW-CRTs,\nwe propose a simple and efficient estimating equations approach to analyze\ncluster-period means.

Treatment selection is influenced by clinical diagnosis, which\nrequires delineating the stroke lesion, as well as characterising cerebral\nblood flow dynamics using neuroimaging acquisitions. Nonetheless, predicting\nthe final stroke lesion is an intricate task, due to the variability in lesion\nsize, shape, location and the underlying cerebral haemodynamic processes that\noccur after the ischaemic stroke takes place. Moreover, since elapsed time\nbetween stroke and treatment is related to the loss of brain tissue, assessing\nand predicting the final stroke lesion needs to be performed in a short period\nof time, which makes the task even more complex. Therefore, there is a need for\nautomatic methods that predict the final stroke lesion and support physicians\nin the treatment decision process.

The detection of communities or other meso-scale\nstructures is a prominent topic in network science as it allows the\nidentification of functional building blocks in complex systems. When such\nbuilding blocks may be present in graphons is an open question. In this paper,\nwe define a graphon-modularity and demonstrate that it can be maximised to\ndetect communities in graphons. We then investigate specific synthetic graphons\nand show that they may show a wide range of different community structures. We\nalso reformulate the graphon-modularity maximisation as a continuous\noptimisation problem and so prove the optimal community structure or lack\nthereof for some graphons, something that is usually not possible for networks.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that estimating a graphon from network data as an\nintermediate step can improve the detection of communities, in comparison with\nexclusively maximising the modularity of the network.

This paper introduces a theoretical\nand algorithmic preconditioning framework for solving the systems of equations\nthat arise from IRK methods applied to linear numerical PDEs (without algebraic\nconstraints). This framework also naturally applies to discontinuous Galerkin\ndiscretizations in time. Under quite general assumptions on the spatial\ndiscretization that yield stable time integration, the preconditioned operator\nis proven to have condition number bounded by a small, order-one constant,\nindependent of the spatial mesh and time-step size, and with only weak\ndependence on number of stages/polynomial order; for example, the\npreconditioned operator for 10th-order Gauss IRK has condition number less than\ntwo, independent of the spatial discretization and time step. The new method\ncan be used with arbitrary existing preconditioners for backward Euler-type\ntime stepping schemes, and is amenable to the use of three-term recursion\nKrylov methods when the underlying spatial discretization is symmetric. The new\nmethod is demonstrated to be effective on various high-order finite-difference\nand finite-element discretizations of linear parabolic and hyperbolic problems,\ndemonstrating fast, scalable solution of up to 10th order accuracy.

To\nproperly understand and control this new epidemic, mathematical modelling is\npresented as a very effective tool that can illustrate the mechanisms of its\npropagation. In this regard, the use of compartmental models is the most\nprominent approach adopted in the literature to describe the dynamics of\nCOVID-19. Along the same line, we aim during this study to generalize and\nameliorate many existing works that consecrated to analyse the behaviour of\nthis epidemic. Precisely, we propose an SQEAIHR epidemic system for\nCoronavirus. Our constructed model is enriched by taking into account the media\nintervention and vital dynamics. By the use of the next-generation matrix\nmethod, the theoretical basic reproductive number $R_0$ is obtained for\nCOVID-19. Based on some nonstandard and generalized analytical techniques, the\nlocal and global stability of the disease-free equilibrium are proven when $R_0\n< 1$. Moreover, in the case of $R_0 > 1$, the uniform persistence of COVID-19\nmodel is also shown. In order to better adapt our epidemic model to reality,\nthe randomness factor is taken into account by considering a proportional white\nnoises, which leads to a well-posed stochastic model. Under appropriate\nconditions, interesting asymptotic properties are proved, namely: extinction\nand persistence in the mean. The theoretical results show that the dynamics of\nthe perturbed COVID-19 model are determined by parameters that are closely\nrelated to the magnitude of the stochastic noise.

A\nchallenging task of a sputter depth profile measurement is the determination of\nthe interface contaminations. Interface contaminations are only detectable if\nthe depth profile data were measured with a sufficient depth resolution.\nInterface contaminations are crucial, because they strongly influence the\nmechanical and electrical properties of the whole thin film system. The depth\nresolution of unidirectional sputter depth profiling for polycrystalline\nsamples is limited by the sputter yield differences attributed to grains having\ndifferent crystalline orientations relative to the incoming ion beam. Therefore\ndepth resolution optimized sputter depth profiling of polycrystalline thin\nfilms requires dedicated experimental approaches. If the sample is rotated\nduring ion sputtering the depth profile is recorded with a better depth\nresolution because the ion impact direction relative to the grains orientation\nvaries.

Due to successive resolution loss in the encoding\nphase combined with the inability to recover this lost information in the\ndecoding phase, autoencoding based segmentation approaches are limited in their\nability to extract retinal microvascular structure. We propose RV-GAN, a new\nmulti-scale generative architecture for accurate retinal vessel segmentation to\nalleviate this. The proposed architecture uses two generators and two\nmulti-scale autoencoding discriminators for better microvessel localization and\nsegmentation. In order to avoid the loss of fidelity suffered by traditional\nGAN-based segmentation systems, we introduce a novel weighted feature matching\nloss. This new loss incorporates and prioritizes features from the\ndiscriminator's decoder over the encoder. Doing so combined with the fact that\nthe discriminator's decoder attempts to determine real or fake images at the\npixel level better preserves macro and microvascular structure. By combining\nreconstruction and weighted feature matching loss, the proposed architecture\nachieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9887, 0.9914, and 0.9887 in\npixel-wise segmentation of retinal vasculature from three publicly available\ndatasets, namely DRIVE, CHASE-DB1, and STARE, respectively.

In this paper, novel centralized and\ndistributed resource allocation schemes are proposed to enable IoT devices to\nshare limited communication resources and to transmit IoT messages in a timely\nmanner. In the considered system, the timeliness of information is captured\nusing non-linear age of information (AoI) metrics that can naturally quantify\nthe freshness of information. To model the inherent heterogeneity of the IoT\nsystem, the non-linear aging functions are defined in terms of IoT device types\nand message content. To minimize AoI, the proposed resource management schemes\nallocate the limited communication resources considering AoI. In particular,\nthe proposed centralized scheme enables the base station to learn the device\ntypes and to determine aging functions. Moreover, the proposed distributed\nscheme enables the devices to share the limited communication resources based\non available information on other devices and their AoI. The convergence of the\nproposed distributed scheme is proved, and the effectiveness in reducing the\nAoI with partial information is analyzed. Simulation results show that the\nproposed centralized scheme achieves significantly lower average instantaneous\nAoI when compared to simple centralized allocation without learning, while the\nproposed distributed scheme achieves significantly lower average instantaneous\nAoI when compared to random allocation. The results also show that the proposed\ncentralized scheme outperforms the proposed distributed scheme in almost all\ncases, but the distributed approach is more viable for a massive IoT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 02:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

In this\npaper, we present a novel framework named HAM-Net with a hybrid attention\nmechanism which includes temporal soft, semi-soft and hard attentions to\naddress these issues. Our temporal soft attention module, guided by an\nauxiliary background class in the classification module, models the background\nactivity by introducing an \"action-ness\" score for each video snippet.\nMoreover, our temporal semi-soft and hard attention modules, calculating two\nattention scores for each video snippet, help to focus on the less\ndiscriminative frames of an action to capture the full action boundary. Our\nproposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by at least 2.2%\nmAP at IoU threshold 0.5 on the THUMOS14 dataset, and by at least 1.3% mAP at\nIoU threshold 0.75 on the ActivityNet1.2 dataset.

This reconstruction problem is especially difficult when sensors are\nsparsely positioned in a seemingly random or unorganized manner, which is often\nencountered in a range of scientific and engineering problems. Moreover, these\nsensors can be in motion and can become online or offline over time. The key\nleverage in addressing this scientific issue is the wealth of data accumulated\nfrom the sensors.

From there on, several questions are raised in\nseries to ensure when the target system is immune to the attack of this kind.\nThe first question is: Is the target system secure from zero-dynamics attack if\nit does not have any unstable zeros?

An effective domain generalizable model is expected to be able to learn\nfeature representations that are both generalizable and discriminative. In this\npaper, we design a novel Style Normalization and Restitution module (SNR) to\nsimultaneously ensure both high generalization and discrimination capability of\nthe networks. In the SNR module, particularly, we filter out the style\nvariations (e.g, illumination, color contrast) by performing Instance\nNormalization (IN) to obtain style normalized features, where the discrepancy\namong different samples and domains is reduced. However, such a process is\ntask-ignorant and inevitably removes some task-relevant discriminative\ninformation, which could hurt the performance. To remedy this, we propose to\ndistill task-relevant discriminative features from the residual (i.e, the\ndifference between the original feature and the style normalized feature) and\nadd them back to the network to ensure high discrimination. Moreover, for\nbetter disentanglement, we enforce a dual causality loss constraint in the\nrestitution step to encourage the better separation of task-relevant and\ntask-irrelevant features. We validate the effectiveness of our SNR on different\ncomputer vision tasks, including classification, semantic segmentation, and\nobject detection.

The proposed control\narchitecture contains four cascaded control loops: position control, flight\npath control, attitude control, and optimal multi-objective wing control. Since\nthe position kinematics are not influenced by model uncertainties, the\nnonlinear dynamic inversion control is applied. On the contrary, the flight\npath dynamics are perturbed by both model uncertainties and atmospheric\ndisturbances; thus the incremental sliding mode control is adopted.\nLyapunov-based analyses show that this method can simultaneously reduce the\nmodel dependency and the minimum possible gains of conventional sliding mode\ncontrol methods.

The load\nreferences are realized by the inner-loop optimal wing controller, while the\nexcessive loads are naturalized by flaps without influencing the outer-loop\ntracking performance.

Numerical experiments are provided to verify our theoretical\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 10:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

We also provide explanations and\nconclusions that more accurately describe viral spread dynamics. Drawing from\navailable public data and our simple but rigorous analysis, we show that it is\nnot possible to make clear conclusions about any positive impact of the public\ntesting program in the Slovak Republic. In particular, it is not possible to\nconclude that this testing program forces the curve down for the SARS-CoV-2\nvirus outbreak.

In complex\nspatio-temporal dynamical systems, small spatio-temporal fluctuations can\ndramatically change the dynamics of virus spreading on large scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 12:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

All three expert users found our tool to\nbe comprehensive in supporting their explanation needs while the non-expert\nusers were able to understand the inner workings of a model easily.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 14:39:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2021 03:20:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 03:04:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 05:14:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 04:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

We correct for the interstellar polarization by\npostulating that the SN polarization is naught near the rest wavelength of the\nstrongest lines - this is later confirmed by our modeling. SN2012aw exhibits\nintrinsic polarization, with strong variations across lines, and with a\nmagnitude that grows in the 7000A line-free region from 0.1% at 16d up to 1.2%\nat 120d. This behavior is qualitatively similar to observations gathered for\nother type II SNe. A suitable rotation of Stokes vectors places the bulk of the\npolarization in q, suggesting the ejecta of SN2012aw is predominantly\naxisymmetric. Using an upgraded version of our 2D polarized radiative transfer\ncode, we model the wavelength- and time-dependent polarization of SN2012aw. The\nkey observables may be explained by the presence of a confined region of\nenhanced 56Ni at ~4000km/s, which boosts the electron density in a cone having\nan opening angle of ~50deg and an observer's inclination of ~70deg to the axis\nof symmetry. With this fixed asymmetry in time, the observed evolution of the\nSN2012aw polarization arises from the evolution of the ejecta optical depth,\nionization, and the relative importance of multiple versus single scattering.\nHowever, the polarization signatures exhibit numerous degeneracies.\nCancellation effects at early times imply that a low polarization may occur for\nejecta with a large asymmetry. An axisymmetric ejecta with a latitude-dependent\nexplosion energy can also yield similar polarization signatures as an\nasymmetric 56Ni distribution. Despite these uncertainties, SN2012aw provides\nadditional evidence for the generic asymmetry of type II SN ejecta, of which\nVLT-FORS spectropolarimetric observations are a decisive and exquisite probe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 15:13:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 14:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

To solve this problem, we propose a\nnovel attentional neural network-based model, named AttnMove, to densify\nindividual trajectories by recovering unobserved locations at a fine-grained\nspatial-temporal resolution. To tackle the challenges posed by sparsity, we\ndesign various intra- and inter- trajectory attention mechanisms to better\nmodel the mobility regularity of users and fully exploit the periodical pattern\nfrom long-term history.

In this paper, we develop\nand present a unified architecture of network community-finding methods to\ncharacterize the state-of-the-art of the field of community detection.\nSpecifically, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing community\ndetection methods and introduce a new taxonomy that divides the existing\nmethods into two categories, namely probabilistic graphical model and deep\nlearning. We then discuss in detail the main idea behind each method in the two\ncategories. Furthermore, to promote future development of community detection,\nwe release several benchmark datasets from several problem domains and\nhighlight their applications to various network analysis tasks. We conclude\nwith discussions of the challenges of the field and suggestions of possible\ndirections for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 02:32:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 06:58:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 09:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

The most convenient and\ngood quality - price ratio should be chosen for the feed of animals. Blockchain\nis used in a virtual space to store and share information over a network of\nusers. This is done using the open source Hyperledger Fabric platform. The\ntransactions can be viewed by all the other users in real time. These\ntransactions are stored as JSONs inside CouchDB NoSQL database which supports\nqueries on a large volume of data. When using this technology, the farmer can\nknow with whom the supplier for animal feed collaborated with. The history of\nthe transactions are not saved in just one place. In this way, it is more\ndifficult to hack and provide implausible information. An e-learning platform\nwas created where the farm's user can post information, respectively new blocks\nabout the animal's birth, vaccinations, medicines, including the location of\nthe livestock. The same e-learning platform is accessible from the mobile\nphone. By using the blockchain technology, anyone, including the client from\nthe shop can know a lot about the origin of the products. Fake origins of food\nare much more difficult to hide. Fraud is also limited. The system monitored\nthe traceability of dairy products inside a Romanian farm. Data about fodder\nprovider and quality, cow productive performances and health and dairy products\nprocess were obtained and analyzed by students who will become specialists at\nall the levels of the food chain. Blockchain is the technology which in case of\na dairy products contamination, the origin of the farm is traced in just a\ncouple of seconds. In this way just a batch of dairy products is removed from\ndistribution, leading to the reduction of food waste.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 10:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-07"}

However, one of the foremost\nissues still remaining is the need for the V2X to operate stably in a highly\ndynamic environment. This paper proposes a way to exploit the dynamicity. That\nis, we propose a resource allocation mechanism adaptive to the environment,\nwhich can be an efficient solution for air interface congestion that a V2X\nnetwork often suffers from. Specifically, the proposed mechanism aims at\ngranting a higher chance of transmission to a vehicle with a higher crash risk.\nAs such, the channel access is prioritized to those with urgent needs. The\nproposed framework is established based on reinforcement learning (RL), which\nis modeled as a contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB). Importantly, the framework\nis designed to operate at a vehicle autonomously without any assistance from a\ncentral entity, which, henceforth, is expected to make a particular fit to\ndistributed V2X network such as C-V2X mode 4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 14:21:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}
