To address this issue, this study\ndevelops an activity-based modeling framework for individual mobility\nprediction. Specifically, an input-output hidden Markov model (IOHMM) framework\nis proposed to simultaneously predict the (continuous) time and (discrete)\nlocation of an individual's next trip using transit smart card data. The\nprediction task can be transformed into predicting the hidden activity duration\nand end location. Based on a case study of Hong Kong's metro system, we show\nthat the proposed model can achieve similar prediction performance as the\nstate-of-the-art long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Unlike LSTM, the proposed\nIOHMM model can also be used to analyze hidden activity patterns, which\nprovides meaningful behavioral interpretation for why an individual makes a\ncertain trip. Therefore, the activity-based prediction framework offers a way\nto preserve the predictive power of advanced machine learning methods while\nenhancing our ability to generate insightful behavioral explanations, which is\nuseful for enhancing situational awareness in user-centric transportation\napplications such as personalized traveler information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 16:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

Nonetheless, many of these IIoT-protocols still\nrequire contention-based communication, e.g., for slot allocation and broadcast\ntransmission.

Recently, these methods have been used in various\nimage processing and communications applications, including denoising, spectrum\nsensing, and compression. Notice that estimating the covariance matrix from\ncompressive samples leads to ill-posed minimizations with severe performance\nloss at high compression rates. In this regard, a regularization term is\ntypically aggregated to the cost function to consider prior information about a\nparticular property of the covariance matrix. Hence, this paper proposes an\nalgorithm based on the projected gradient method to recover low-rank or\nToeplitz approximations of the covariance matrix from compressive measurements.\nThe algorithm divides the compressive measurements into data subsets projected\nonto different subspaces and accurately estimates the covariance matrix by\nsolving a single optimization problem assuming that each data subset contains\nan approximation of the signal statistics. Furthermore, gradient filtering is\nincluded at every iteration of the proposed algorithm to minimize the\nestimation error. The error induced by the proposed splitting approach is\nanalytically derived along with the convergence guarantees of the proposed\nmethod. The algorithm estimates the covariance matrix of hyperspectral images\nfrom synthetic and real compressive samples. Extensive simulations show that\nthe proposed algorithm can effectively recover the covariance matrix of\nhyperspectral images from compressive measurements (8-15% approx). Moreover,\nsimulations and theoretical results show that the filtering step reduces the\nrecovery error up to twice the number of eigenvectors.

However,\nDAS-based methods mainly focus on searching for a repeatable cell structure,\nwhich is then stacked sequentially in multiple stages to form the networks.\nThis configuration significantly reduces the search space, and ignores the\nimportance of connections between the cells. To overcome this limitation, in\nthis paper, we propose a Hierarchical Differentiable Architecture Search\n(H-DAS) that performs architecture search both at the cell level and at the\nstage level. Specifically, the cell-level search space is relaxed so that the\nnetworks can learn stage-specific cell structures. For the stage-level search,\nwe systematically study the architectures of stages, including the number of\ncells in each stage and the connections between the cells. Based on insightful\nobservations, we design several search rules and losses, and mange to search\nfor better stage-level architectures. Such hierarchical search space greatly\nimproves the performance of the networks without introducing expensive search\ncost. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed H-DAS. Moreover, the searched stage-level\narchitectures can be combined with the cell structures searched by existing DAS\nmethods to further boost the performance.

This polarization can\nreveal the presence of a circumsubstellar accretion disk, rotation-induced\noblateness of the atmosphere, or an inhomogeneous distribution of atmospheric\ndust clouds. We measured the near-infrared linear polarization of 20 known\ndirectly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarf companions with the high-contrast\nimager SPHERE-IRDIS at the VLT. We reduced the data using the IRDAP pipeline to\ncorrect for the instrumental polarization and crosstalk with an absolute\npolarimetric accuracy <0.1% in the degree of polarization. We report the first\ndetection of polarization originating from substellar companions, with a\npolarization of several tenths of a percent for DH Tau B and GSC 6214-210 B in\nH-band. By comparing the measured polarization with that of nearby stars, we\nfind that the polarization is unlikely to be caused by interstellar dust.\nBecause the companions have previously measured hydrogen emission lines and red\ncolors, the polarization most likely originates from circumsubstellar disks.\nThrough radiative transfer modeling, we constrain the position angles of the\ndisks and find that the disks must have high inclinations. The presence of\nthese disks as well as the misalignment of the disk of DH Tau B with the disk\naround its primary star suggest in situ formation of the companions. For the 18\nother companions, we do not detect significant polarization and place\nsubpercent upper limits on their degree of polarization. These non-detections\nmay indicate the absence of circumsubstellar disks, a slow rotation rate of\nyoung companions, the upper atmospheres containing primarily submicron-sized\ndust grains, and/or limited cloud inhomogeneity.

Early detection and removal of colon polyps\nvia colonoscopy have proved to be an effective approach to prevent colorectal\ncancer. Recently, various CNN-based computer-aided systems have been developed\nto help physicians detect polyps. However, these systems do not perform well in\nreal-world colonoscopy operations due to the significant difference between\nimages in a real colonoscopy and those in the public datasets. Unlike the\nwell-chosen clear images with obvious polyps in the public datasets, images\nfrom a colonoscopy are often blurry and contain various artifacts such as\nfluid, debris, bubbles, reflection, specularity, contrast, saturation, and\nmedical instruments, with a wide variety of polyps of different sizes, shapes,\nand textures. All these factors pose a significant challenge to effective polyp\ndetection in a colonoscopy. To this end, we collect a private dataset that\ncontains 7,313 images from 224 complete colonoscopy procedures.

The rate has been\npreviously estimated in the range of $\\approx10-300$ yr$^{-1}$, either based on\nextrapolations from a handful of very bright optical novae or the nova rates in\nnearby galaxies; both methods are subject to debatable assumptions. The total\ndiscovery rate of optical novae remains much smaller ($\\approx5-10$ yr$^{-1}$)\nthan these estimates, even with the advent of all-sky optical time domain\nsurveys. Here, we present a systematic sample of 12 spectroscopically confirmed\nGalactic novae detected in the first 17 months of Palomar Gattini-IR (PGIR), a\nwide-field near-infrared time domain survey. Operating in $J$-band\n($\\approx1.2$ $\\mu$m) that is relatively immune to dust extinction, the\nextinction distribution of the PGIR sample is highly skewed to large extinction\nvalues ($> 50$% of events obscured by $A_V\\gtrsim5$ mag). Using recent\nestimates for the distribution of mass and dust in the Galaxy, we show that the\nobserved extinction distribution of the PGIR sample is commensurate with that\nexpected from dust models. The PGIR extinction distribution is inconsistent\nwith that reported in previous optical searches (null hypothesis probability $<\n0.01$%), suggesting that a large population of highly obscured novae have been\nsystematically missed in previous optical searches. We perform the first\nquantitative simulation of a $3\\pi$ time domain survey to estimate the Galactic\nnova rate using PGIR, and derive a rate of $\\approx 46.0^{+12.5}_{-12.4}$\nyr$^{-1}$. Our results suggest that all-sky near-infrared time-domain surveys\nare well poised to uncover the Galactic nova population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 17:32:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

The first order phase transition at\ncritical value of chemical potential for 4-cycles into bipartite phase with a\nformation of fixed number of bipartite clusters is found for ensemble of random\nregular graphs (RRG). We consider the similar phase transition in combinatorial\nquantum gravity based of the Ollivier graph curvature for RRG supplemented with\nhard-core constraint and show that a order of a phase transition and the\nstructure of emerging phase depend on a vertex degree d in RRG. For d = 3 the\nbipartite closed ribbon emerges at bipartite phase while for d > 3 the ensemble\nof isolated or weakly interacting hypercubes supplemented with the bipartite\nclosed ribbon gets emerged at the first order phase transition with a clear-cut\nhysteresis.

Despite the relevant\namount of research carried out in the last years, several aspects of this novel\nconfiguration still need further insight to pave the way to future\napplications. Among them, the coupled flight-dynamic and aeroelastic response\nis addressed in this work by means of a dedicated in-house framework. For the\nevaluation of the aerodynamic forces, an enhanced Doublet Lattice Method, able\nto take into account terms typically neglected by classic formulations, is\nemployed. First, flight-dynamic aspects are considered, showing how effects of\ninteraction between Short Period or Dutch Roll with elastic modes remarkably\ndeteriorate the flying qualities. Then, focus is on the aeroelastic stability\nof the aircraft. As observed also in previous literature efforts on this\nconfiguration, flutter onset is considerably different when considering the\naircraft being free in the air or fixed in space. Thanks to the adopted\nformulation it is shown how, for this PrandtlPlane, the aerodynamic coupling of\nelastic and rigid modes has a beneficial effect on flutter onset. However, the\ndifferent modal properties, consequence of the diverse boundary conditions,\nwhen switching from fixed-in-space to free-flying aircraft, also play a\nrelevant role in determining the occurrence of flutter. Whereas for the\nlongitudinal case both effects contribute increasing flutter speed, for the\nlateral-directional case the variation in modal properties has a detrimental\nand dominating effect, leading to a flutter speedwell within the flight\nenvelope.Finally,the work discusses the contributions of the additional terms\nmodeled by the enhanced Doublet Lattice Method, showing how they induce a\nconsiderable effect when modeling the flight dynamics of the flexible aircraft.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 18:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

We also\nsearched for species that might be present in the planetary atmosphere but not\nin the stellar spectra, such as TiO and VO, and obtained a negative result.\nThus, we find no evidence of any planetary absorption, including previously\nreported NaI, in the atmosphere of HD 209458b.

Our algorithm represents body pose and\nshape as a parametric mesh which can be reconstructed from a single image and\neasily reposed. Instead of a colour-based UV texture map, our approach further\nemploys a learned high-dimensional UV feature map to encode appearance. This\nrich implicit representation captures detailed appearance variation across\nposes, viewpoints, person identities and clothing styles better than learned\ncolour texture maps. The body model with the rendered feature maps is fed\nthrough a neural image-translation network that creates the final rendered\ncolour image.

We find that the resolved\nvelocity dispersion is systematically lower by a factor $2.45\\pm0.38$ for the\nmolecular gas compared to the ionized gas, after correcting for thermal\nbroadening. This offset is constant within the galaxy disks and indicates the\nco-existence of a thin molecular and thick ionized gas disks.

In particular, star-forming regions that contain\nmassive stars have strong far ultraviolet (FUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV)\nradiation fields, which can induce mass-loss from protoplanetary discs due to\nphotoevaporation. In this paper we present a parameter-space study of the\nexpected FUV and EUV fields in N-body simulations of star-forming regions with\na range of initial conditions. We then use recently published models to\ndetermine the mass-loss due to photoevaporation from protoplanetary discs.

They then travel backwards to\nreactivate the same populations of neurons that uniquely respond to this\nspecific stimuli during perception, thus recreating \"offline\" an experience\nthat is similar. After stating our hypothesis in details, we challenge its\nassumptions through a thorough literature review. We find abundant evidence\nthat supports most of its assumptions, including the existence of\nbackpropagating signals that have interesting properties. We then leverage\nsimulations based on existing spiking neural network models with STDP learning\nto show the computational feasibility of using such a mechanism to map the\nimage of an object to its name with the same high accuracy as a state of the\nart machine learning classifier. Although not yet a theory, we believe this\nhypothesis presents a paradigm shift that is worth further investigating: it\nopens the way, among others, to new interpretations of language acquisition and\nunderstanding, the interplay between memories encoding and retrieval, as well\nas reconciling the apparently opposed views between sparse coding and\ndistributed representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 19:02:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 14:44:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 21:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Although there is quite a persuasive\nbody of evidence for this conjecture, there are some gaps: there exists a set\nof exceptional subfactors with no known counterpart CFT. Hence, it is necessary\nto develop new techniques for building a CFT from a subfactor. Here, it is\nuseful to study the underlying mathematical structure in more detail: The even\nparts of every subfactor give rise to two Unitary Fusion Categories (UFCs), and\nit is a promising direction to study quantum spin systems constructed from\nthese categories to find a connection to CFTs. The simplest example that\nrequires new techniques for building a CFT is the Haagerup subfactor, since it\nis the smallest subfactor with index larger than 4. In this thesis, we\ninvestigate the question whether there is a CFT corresponding to the Haagerup\nsubfactor via lattice models in one and two dimensions. The first task here is\nto find the F-symbols of the fusion category since these are crucial\ningredients for the construction of a physical model in all of the models we\nconsider in this thesis. We then investigate microscopic models such as the\ngolden chain model and the Levin-Wen model in order to find evidence for a\ncorresponding CFT. We find that there is no evidence for a corresponding CFT\nfrom the investigation of the UFCs directly and it is necessary to expand these\nstudies to the corresponding unitary modular tensor category, which can, for\ninstance, be obtained via the excitations of the Levin-Wen model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 19:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

In this paper, I show that such\nquasi-isothermal evolution out to the Alfven critical point is a generic\nproperty of outflows powered by reflection-driven Alfven-wave (AW) turbulence,\nin which outward-propagating AWs partially reflect, and counter-propagating AWs\ninteract to produce a cascade of fluctuation energy to small scales, which\nleads to turbulent heating. Approximating the sub-Alfvenic region as\nisothermal, I first present a simplified calculation of the mass outflow rate,\nasymptotic wind speed, and coronal temperature that neglects conductive losses\nand the wave pressure force. I then develop a more detailed model of the\ntransition region, corona, and solar wind that accounts for the heat flux from\nthe coronal base into the transition region and momentum deposition by AWs. I\nsolve analytically for this heat flux by balancing, within the transition\nregion, conductive heating against internal-energy losses from radiation, pdV\nwork, and advection. The density at the coronal base is determined by locally\nbalancing turbulent heating and radiative cooling. I solve the equations of the\nmodel analytically in two different parameter regimes.

Recently,\nTransformer has been shown to outperform LSTM on many natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tasks. In this work, we propose a novel architecture that\ncombines Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers with Graph\nTransformer (BERT-GT), through integrating a neighbor-attention mechanism into\nthe BERT architecture. Unlike the original Transformer architecture, which\nutilizes the whole sentence(s) to calculate the attention of the current token,\nthe neighbor-attention mechanism in our method calculates its attention\nutilizing only its neighbor tokens. Thus, each token can pay attention to its\nneighbor information with little noise. We show that this is critically\nimportant when the text is very long, as in cross-sentence or abstract-level\nrelation-extraction tasks. Our benchmarking results show improvements of 5.44%\nand 3.89% in accuracy and F1-measure over the state-of-the-art on n-ary and\nchemical-protein relation datasets, suggesting BERT-GT is a robust approach\nthat is applicable to other biomedical relation extraction tasks or datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 19:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

The emitted seismic waves were\nrecorded using shock accelerometers and the flow dynamics were captured with a\nfast camera. The mechanical characteristics of the particle shocks were\nanalyzed, along with the duration between shocks and the correlations in the\nparticle motion. The high-frequency seismic waves (1-50 kHz) were found to\noriginate from particle shocks and waves trapped in the flowing layer.

In the meanwhile, Differential Privacy\n(DP) emerges as a promising countermeasure to defend against gradient leakage\nattacks. However, the adoption of DP by clients in FL may significantly\njeopardize the model accuracy. It is still an open problem to understand the\npracticality of DP from a theoretic perspective. In this paper, we make the\nfirst attempt to understand the practicality of DP in FL through tuning the\nnumber of conducted iterations. Based on the FedAvg algorithm, we formally\nderive the convergence rate with DP noises in FL. Then, we theoretically\nderive: 1) the conditions for the DP based FedAvg to converge as the number of\nglobal iterations (GI) approaches infinity; 2) the method to set the number of\nlocal iterations (LI) to minimize the negative influence of DP noises. By\nfurther substituting the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms into the derived\nconvergence rate respectively, we show that: 3) The DP based FedAvg with the\nLaplace mechanism cannot converge, but the divergence rate can be effectively\nprohibited by setting the number of LIs with our method; 4) The learning error\nof the DP based FedAvg with the Gaussian mechanism can converge to a constant\nnumber finally if we use a fixed number of LIs per GI. To verify our\ntheoretical findings, we conduct extensive experiments using two real-world\ndatasets.

Three distinct\nboundary conditions are considered; in case 1 the tube's curved surfaces are\ntraction free and under surface tension, whilst in cases 2 and 3 the inner and\nouter surfaces (respectively) are fixed to prevent radial displacement and\nsurface tension. A linear bifurcation analysis is conducted to determine\nnumerically the existence of circumferential mode solutions.

Lack of trust in data integrity and its manipulation has\nhindered fulfilling user satisfaction. Since existing online rating systems\ndeal with a central server, all rating data is stored on the central server.\nTherefore, all rating data can be removed, modified, and manipulated by the\nsystem manager to change the ratings in favor of the service or product\nprovider. In this paper, an online rating system using distributed ledger\ntechnologies has been presented as the proposed system to solve all the\nweaknesses of current systems. Distributed ledger technologies are completely\ndecentralized and there is no centralization on them by any institution.\nDistributed ledger technologies have different variants. Among distributed\nledger technologies, blockchain technology has been used in the proposed rating\nsystem because of its support for smart contracts. In the proposed online\nrating system, the Ethereum platform has been chosen from different blockchain\nplatforms that have a public permission network. In this system, the raters\ncannot rate unless they submit a request to the system and be authorized to\ntake part in the online product rating process. The important feature of the\nEthereum platform is its support for smart contracts, which can be used to\nwrite the rating contract in the Solidity language. Also, using Proof of\nAuthority consensus mechanisms, all rating transactions are approved by the\nsurveyors. Since in the real Ethereum system, each rating transaction is sent\nto the network by the raters, some gas must be paid for each rating\ntransaction. However, since this method is expensive, TestNet blockchain can be\nused in the rating system. Finally, the proposed rating system was used for\nrating the restaurants of a website and its features were tested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 20:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

We use N-body simulations to study the formation of\nsubstructures from white-noise density fluctuations. The density profiles of\nour relaxed axion minihalos can be described by the Navarro-Frenk-White\nprofile, and the minihalos' concentration number agrees well with a simple,\nphysically-motivated model. We develop a semi-analytic formula to fit the mass\nfunction from our simulation, which agrees broadly at different redshifts and\nonly differs at factor of two level from classic halo mass functions. This\nanalytic mass function allows us to consider uncertainties in the\npost-inflation axion scenario, as well as extrapolate our high-redshift\nsimulations results to the present.\n  Our work estimates the present-day abundance of axion substructures, as is\nnecessary for predicting their effect on cosmological microlensing caustics and\npulsar timing.

For pulsar timing, the most\nsignificant caveat is whether axion minihalos are disrupted by stars, which our\nestimates show is mildly important at the most relevant masses.

Each dataset requires tailored NN model architecture, but designing\nstructures by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Neural\narchitecture search (NAS) automates the design of NN architectures. NAS\nattempts to find well-performing NN models for specialized datsets, where\nperformance is measured by key metrics that capture the NN capabilities (e.g.,\naccuracy of classification of samples in a dataset). Existing NAS methods are\nresource intensive, especially when searching for highly accurate models for\nlarger and larger datasets.\n  To address this problem, we propose a performance estimation strategy that\nreduces the resources for training NNs and increases NAS throughput without\njeopardizing accuracy. We implement our strategy via an engine called PEng4NN\nthat plugs into existing NAS methods; in doing so, PEng4NN predicts the final\naccuracy of NNs early in the training process, informs the NAS of NN\nperformance, and thus enables the NAS to terminate training NNs early. We\nassess our engine on three diverse datasets (i.e., CIFAR-100, Fashion MNIST,\nand SVHN). By reducing the training epochs needed, our engine achieves\nsubstantial throughput gain; on average, our engine saves 61% to 82% of\ntraining epochs, increasing throughput by a factor of 2.5 to 5 compared to a\nstate-of-the-art NAS method. We achieve this gain without compromising\naccuracy, as we demonstrate with two key outcomes.

Theoretical and numerical modeling suggest that they are\nproduced by the propagation of shock waves. According to these models and early\nobservations, umbral flashes are associated with upflows. However, recent\nstudies have reported umbral flashes in downflowing atmospheres. We aim to\nunderstand the origin of downflowing umbral flashes. We explore how the\nexistence of standing waves in the umbral chromosphere impacts the generation\nof flashed profiles. We performed numerical simulations of wave propagation in\na sunspot umbra with the code MANCHA. The Stokes profiles of the Ca II 8542\n\\AA\\ line were synthesized with NICOLE. For freely-propagating waves, the\nchromospheric temperature enhancements of the oscillations are in phase with\nvelocity upflows. In this case, the intensity core of the Ca II 8542 \\AA\\\natmosphere is heated during the upflowing stage of the oscillation. If we\nconsider a different scenario with a resonant cavity, the wave reflections at\nthe sharp temperature gradient of the transition region lead to standing\noscillations. In this situation, temperature fluctuations are shifted backward\nand temperature enhancements partially coincide with the downflowing stage of\nthe oscillation. In umbral flashes produced by standing oscillations, the\nreversal of the emission feature is produced when the oscillation is\ndownflowing. The chromospheric temperature keeps increasing while the\natmosphere is changing from a downflow to an upflow. During the appearance of\nflashed Ca II 8542 \\AA\\ cores, the atmosphere is upflowing most of the time,\nand only 38\\% of the flashed profiles are associated with downflows.

Network\nuncertainties caused by natural disasters have dramatically increased in recent\nyears. Several of these disasters (e.g., Hurricane Sandy, Mississippi River\nFlooding, Hurricane Harvey) severely disrupted the U.S. freight transport\nnetwork, and consequently, the supply chain. To account for these network\nuncertainties, a stochastic freight traffic assignment model is formulated. An\nalgorithmic framework, involving the sample average approximation and gradient\nprojection algorithm, is proposed to solve this challenging problem. The\ndeveloped methodology is tested on the U.S. intermodal network with freight\nflow data from the Freight Analysis Framework. The experiments consider four\ntypes of natural disasters that have different risks and impacts on the\ntransportation network: earthquake, hurricane, tornado, and flood. The results\ndemonstrate the feasibility of the model and algorithmic framework to obtain\nfreight flows for a realistic-sized network in reasonable time (between 417 and\n716 minutes). It is found that for all disaster scenarios the freight ton-miles\nare higher compared to the base case without uncertainty. The increase in\nfreight ton-miles is the highest under the flooding scenario; this is due to\nthe fact that there are more states in the flood-risk areas and they are\nscattered throughout the U.S.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 21:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

We then show exponential\nstability and asymptotic stability are in fact equivalent for $F$. We also show\nexponential stability is preserved under small perturbations to the pieces of\n$F$. Such results are well known for homogeneous systems. To prove the results\nhere additional techniques are required because the two components of $F$ have\ndifferent degrees of homogeneity. The primary function of the results is to\nreduce the problem of the stability of $x^*$ from the general Filippov system\n$f$ to the simpler system $F$. Yet in general this problem remains difficult.\nWe provide a four-dimensional example of $F$ for which orbits appear to\nconverge to $x^*$ in a chaotic fashion.

Due to the complex nature of mixing in\nheterogeneous and anisotropic media, the mathematical models related to this\nphenomenon are not analytically tractable. Numerical simulations often provide\na viable route to predict chemical mixing accurately. However, contemporary\nmodeling approaches for mixing cannot utilize available spatial-temporal data\nto improve the accuracy of the future prediction and can be compute-intensive,\nespecially when the spatial domain is large and for long-term temporal\npredictions. To address this knowledge gap, we will present in this paper a\ndeep-learning (DL) modeling framework applied to predict the progress of\nchemical mixing under fast bimolecular reactions. This framework uses\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) for capturing spatial patterns and long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting temporal variations in\nmixing. By careful design of the framework -- placement of non-negative\nconstraint on the weights of the CNN and the selection of activation function,\nthe framework ensures non-negativity of the chemical species at all spatial\npoints and for all times.

Once the tiny capsule is swallowed, it sequentially capture\nimages of the GI tract at about 2 to 6 frames per second (fps).

In such a trap, the ions form a crystalline\nbeam moving along a circular path with a constant velocity determined by the\nfrequency and intensity of the cooling lasers. In this paper we consider a\nlarge leap forward in terms of the number of qubits, from fewer than 100\navailable in state-of-the-art linear ion-trap devices today to an order of 105\ncrystallized ions in the storage-ring setup. This new trap design unifies two\ndifferent concepts: the storage rings of charged particles and the linear ion\ntraps used for QC and mass spectrometry. In this paper we use the language of\nparticle accelerators to discuss the ion state and dynamics. We outline the\ndifferences between the above concepts, analyze challenges of the large ring\nwith a revolving beam of ions, and propose goals for the research and\ndevelopment required to enable future quantum computers with 1000 times more\nqubits than available today. The challenge of creating such a large-scale\nquantum system while maintaining the necessary coherence of the qubits and the\nhigh fidelity of quantum logic operations is significant.

In this work, we propose\na novel and augmented deep learning model, known as CleftNet, for improving\nsynaptic cleft detection from brain EM images. We first propose two novel\nnetwork components, known as the feature augmentor and the label augmentor, for\naugmenting features and labels to improve cleft representations. The feature\naugmentor can fuse global information from inputs and learn common\nmorphological patterns in clefts, leading to augmented cleft features.

Hence, in this paper, we\nhave developed a complete method for determining transmitted wavefronts in a\nbroad bandwidth at any defocused position, enabling wavefront measurements for\nmulti-color systems.

However, the high loss of the\narchetypal PCM Ge2Sb2Te5 in both visible and telecommunication wavelengths has\nfundamentally limited its applications. Sb2S3 has recently emerged as a\nwide-bandgap PCM with transparency windows ranging from 610nm to near-IR. In\nthis paper, the strong optical phase modulation and low optical loss of Sb2S3\nare experimentally demonstrated for the first time in integrated photonic\nplatforms at both 750nm and 1550nm. As opposed to silicon, the thermo-optic\ncoefficient of Sb2S3 is shown to be negative, making the Sb2S3-Si hybrid\nplatform less sensitive to thermal fluctuation. Finally, a Sb2S3 integrated\nnon-volatile microring switch is demonstrated which can be tuned electrically\nbetween a high and low transmission state with a contrast over 30dB.

Hence, it is essential to ensure the\nintegrity and authenticity of CNNs because compromised models can produce\nincorrect outputs and behave maliciously. In this paper, we propose a\nself-contained tamper-proofing method, called DeepiSign, to ensure the\nintegrity and authenticity of CNN models against such manipulation attacks.\nDeepiSign applies the idea of fragile invisible watermarking to securely embed\na secret and its hash value into a CNN model. To verify the integrity and\nauthenticity of the model, we retrieve the secret from the model, compute the\nhash value of the secret, and compare it with the embedded hash value. To\nminimize the effects of the embedded secret on the CNN model, we use a\nwavelet-based technique to transform weights into the frequency domain and\nembed the secret into less significant coefficients. Our theoretical analysis\nshows that DeepiSign can hide up to 1KB secret in each layer with minimal loss\nof the model's accuracy. To evaluate the security and performance of DeepiSign,\nwe performed experiments on four pre-trained models (ResNet18, VGG16, AlexNet,\nand MobileNet) using three datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Imagenet) against\nthree types of manipulation attacks (targeted input poisoning, output\npoisoning, and fine-tuning).

However,\nunder the challenging black-box setting, the attack success rate, i.e., the\ntransferability of adversarial examples, still needs to be improved.

Precise user\ninterest modeling is critical for personalized news recommendation. Existing\nnews recommendation methods usually rely on the implicit feedback of users like\nnews clicks to model user interest. However, news click may not necessarily\nreflect user interests because users may click a news due to the attraction of\nits title but feel disappointed at its content. The dwell time of news reading\nis an important clue for user interest modeling, since short reading dwell time\nusually indicates low and even negative interest. Thus, incorporating the\nnegative feedback inferred from the dwell time of news reading can improve the\nquality of user modeling. In this paper, we propose a neural news\nrecommendation approach which can incorporate the implicit negative user\nfeedback. We propose to distinguish positive and negative news clicks according\nto their reading dwell time, and respectively learn user representations from\npositive and negative news clicks via a combination of Transformer and additive\nattention network. In addition, we propose to compute a positive click score\nand a negative click score based on the relevance between candidate news\nrepresentations and the user representations learned from the positive and\nnegative news clicks. The final click score is a combination of positive and\nnegative click scores. Besides, we propose an interactive news modeling method\nto consider the relatedness between title and body in news modeling. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world dataset validate that our approach can achieve more\naccurate user interest modeling for news recommendation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 07:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

Similarly, the conventional constrained Cramer-Rao bound (CCRB),\nwhich is a lower bound on the mean-squared-error (MSE) of unbiased estimators,\ndoes not provide a relevant bound on the performance for this problem. In this\npaper, we introduce a frequentist, non-Bayesian parametric model of the problem\nof missing-mass estimation.

This is the first part of our paper that attempts to give an\nanswer with focus on solving linear algebraic equations (LAEs) from the\nperspective of systems and control, where it mainly introduces the\ncontrollability-based design results. By proposing an iterative method that\nintegrates a learning control mechanism, a class of tracking problems for\niterative learning control (ILC) is explored for the problem solving of LAEs. A\ntrackability property of ILC is newly developed, by which analysis and\nsynthesis results are established to disclose the equivalence between the\nsolvability of LAEs and the controllability of discrete control systems. Hence,\nLAEs can be solved by equivalently achieving the perfect tracking tasks of\nresulting ILC systems via the classic state feedback-based design and analysis\nmethods. It is shown that the solutions for any solvable LAE can all be\ncalculated with different selections of the initial input. Moreover, the\npresented ILC method is applicable to determining all the least squares\nsolutions of any unsolvable LAE. In particular, a deadbeat design is\nincorporated to ILC such that the solving of LAEs can be completed within\nfinite iteration steps. The trackability property is also generalized to\nconventional two-dimensional ILC systems, which creates feedback-based methods,\ninstead of the common used contraction mapping-based methods, for the design\nand convergence analysis of ILC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 08:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

Many algorithms have been developed over the past\nhalf-century. Recent advances in deep learning have introduced new\npossibilities for a robust and fast PR. An emerging technique called deep\nunfolding provides a systematic connection between conventional model-based\niterative algorithms and modern data-based deep learning. Unfolded algorithms,\nwhich are powered by data learning, have shown remarkable performance and\nconvergence speed improvement over original algorithms. Despite their\npotential, most existing unfolded algorithms are strictly confined to a fixed\nnumber of iterations when layer-dependent parameters are used. In this study,\nwe develop a novel framework for deep unfolding to overcome existing\nlimitations. Our development is based on an unfolded generalized expectation\nconsistent signal recovery (GEC-SR) algorithm, wherein damping factors are left\nfor data-driven learning. In particular, we introduce a hypernetwork to\ngenerate the damping factors for GEC-SR. Instead of learning a set of optimal\ndamping factors directly, the hypernetwork learns how to generate the optimal\ndamping factors according to the clinical settings, thereby ensuring its\nadaptivity to different scenarios. To enable the hypernetwork to adapt to\nvarying layer numbers, we use a recurrent architecture to develop a dynamic\nhypernetwork that generates a damping factor that can vary online across\nlayers. We also exploit a self-attention mechanism to enhance the robustness of\nthe hypernetwork. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm\noutperforms existing ones in terms of convergence speed and accuracy and still\nworks well under very harsh settings, even under which many classical PR\nalgorithms are unstable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 08:36:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 04:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

Generally, the population of\nretrograde asteroids includes mostly Centaurs and transneptunian objects\n(TNOs). A special case is the near-Earth object (343158) 2009 HC82 from the\nApollo group. Another interesting object is the comet 333P/LINEAR, which for\nseveral years was considered the second retrograde object approaching Earth.\nAnother comet in retrograde orbit, 161P Hartley/IRAS appears to be an object of\nsimilar type. Thanks to the large amount of observational data for these two\ncomets, we tested various models of cometary non-gravitational forces applied\nto their dynamics.\n  The goal was to estimate which of non-gravitational perturbations could\naffect the stability of retrograde bodies. In principle, we study the local\nstability by measuring the divergence of nearby orbits.\n  We numerically determined Lyapunov characteristic indicators (LCI) and the\nassociated Lyapunov times (LT). This time, our calculations were extended by\nmore advanced models of non-gravitational perturbations (i.e. Yarkovsky drift\nand in selected cases cometary forces). This allowed us to estimate chaos in\nthe Lyapunov sense.\n  We found that the Yarkovsky effect for obliquities of $\\gamma=0^{\\circ}$ and\n$\\gamma=180^{\\circ}$ can change the LT substantially. In most cases, for the\nprograde rotation, we received more stable solutions. Moreover, we confirmed\nthe role of retrograde resonances in this process. Additionally, the studied\ncometary effects also significantly influence the long-term behaviour of the\nselected comets. The LT can reach values from 100 to over 1000 years.\nConclusions. All of our results indicate that the use of models with\nnon-gravitational effects for retrograde bodies is clearly justified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 09:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

Those are usually based on two-phase flow or Navier-Stokes equations.\nDifferent classes of simplified models exist. Among them, two-layer shallow\nwater models are interesting to address large-scale dispersion. Indeed,\ncompared to conventional multidimensional approaches, 2D simulations are\ncarried out to mimic 3D effects. The computational gain in CPU time is\nconsequently expected to be tremendous. However, such models involve at least\nthree fundamental difficulties. The first one is related to the lack of\nhyperbolicity of most existing formulations, yielding serious consequences\nregarding wave propagation. The second is related to the non-conservative terms\nin the momentum equations. Those terms account for interactions between fluid\nlayers. Recently, these two difficulties have been addressed in Chiapolino and\nSaurel (2018) and an unconditional hyperbolic model has been proposed along\nwith a Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) type Riemann solver dealing with the\nnon-conservative terms. In the same reference, numerical experiments showed\nrobustness and accuracy of the formulation. In the present paper, a third\ndifficulty is addressed. It consists of the determination of appropriate drag\neffect formulation. Such effects also account for interactions between fluid\nlayers and become of particular importance when dealing with heavy-gas\ndispersion. With this aim, the model is compared to laboratory experiments in\nthe context of heavy gas dispersal in quiescent air. It is shown that the model\naccurately reproduces experimental results thanks to an appropriate drag force\ncorrelation. This function expresses drag effects between the heavy and light\ngas layers. It is determined thanks to various experimental configurations of\ndam-break test problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 10:25:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

Our goal is to quantify this\npre-processing, in terms of gas content and SFR, as a function of density in\ncosmic filaments. We have observed the two first CO transitions in 163 galaxies\nwith the IRAM-30m telescope, and added 82 more measurements from the\nliterature, for a sample of 245 galaxies in the filaments around Virgo.

We find a progression from field galaxies to\nfilament and cluster ones for decreasing SFR, increasing fraction of galaxies\nin the quenching phase, increasing proportion of early-type galaxies and\ndecreasing gas content. Galaxies in the quenching phase, defined as having SFR\nbelow 1/3 of the main sequence rate, are only between 0-20\\% in the isolated\nsample, while they are 20-60\\% in the filaments and 30-80\\% in the Virgo\ncluster. Processes that lead to star formation quenching are already at play in\nfilaments. They depend mostly on the local galaxy density, while the distance\nto the filament spine is a secondary parameter. While the HI to stellar mass\nratio decreases with local density by ~1 dex in the filaments, and ~2 dex in\nVirgo with respect to the field, the decrease is much less for the H$_2$ to\nstellar mass ratio. As the environmental density increases, the gas depletion\ntime decreases, since the gas content decreases faster than the SFR. This\nsuggests that gas depletion significantly precedes star formation quenching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 10:30:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 20:34:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 11:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

These small and\nfast-rotating bodies are thought to be monolithic objects because the\ngravitational force due to their small size is not strong enough to counteract\nthe strong centripetal force caused by the fast rotation. Additionally, it is\nnot clear whether the fast spin prevents dust and small particles (regolith)\nfrom being kept on their surface. Aims: We develop a model for constraining the\nthermal conductivity of the surface of the small, fast-rotating near-Earth\nasteroids. This model may suggest whether regolith is likely present on these\nobjects. Methods: Our approach is based on the comparison of the measured\nYarkovsky drift and a predicted value using a theoretical model that depends on\nthe orbital, physical and thermal parameters of the object. The necessary\nparameters are either deduced from statistical distribution derived for\nnear-Earth asteroids population or determined from observations with associated\nuncertainty. With this information, we performed Monte Carlo simulations and\nproduced a probability density distribution for the thermal conductivity.\nResults: Applying our model to the superfast rotator asteroid (499998) 2011 PT,\nwe find that the measured Yarkovsky drift can only be achieved when the thermal\nconductivity $K$ of the surface is low.

One such problem is where to locate ambulances between calls in order\nto minimise time from emergency call to ambulance on-scene. This is known as\nthe Ambulance Location problem.\n  Aim: To develop an OpenAI Gym-compatible framework and simulation environment\nfor testing Deep RL agents.\n  Methods: A custom ambulance dispatch simulation environment was developed\nusing OpenAI Gym and SimPy. Deep RL agents were built using PyTorch. The\nenvironment is a simplification of the real world, but allows control over the\nnumber of clusters of incident locations, number of possible dispatch\nlocations, number of hospitals, and creating incidents that occur at different\nlocations throughout each day.\n  Results: A range of Deep RL agents based on Deep Q networks were tested in\nthis custom environment. All reduced time to respond to emergency calls\ncompared with random allocation to dispatch points. Bagging Noisy Duelling Deep\nQ networks gave the most consistence performance. All methods had a tendency to\nlose performance if trained for too long, and so agents were saved at their\noptimal performance (and tested on independent simulation runs).\n  Conclusions: Deep RL agents, developed using simulated environments, have the\npotential to offer a novel approach to optimise the Ambulance Location problem.\nCreating open simulation environments should allow more rapid progress in this\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 12:10:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 09:07:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

The key steps like the material\nselection of each layer and the top electrode radius to maximize the coupling\nfactor are well-detailed. This approach results in the design of a single cell\nwith a high effective coupling coefficient. Furthermore, compact models are\nused to make the design process less time-consuming for designers. These models\nare based on the equivalent circuit theory for the PMUT. A cell of 107 um in\nradius, 5 um in thickness of Lead Zirconate Titanium (PZT), and 10 um in\nthickness of silicon (Si) is found to have a 4% of effective coupling\ncoefficient among the highest values for a clamped edge boundary conditions.\nSimulation results show a frequency of 2.84 MHz as resonance. In case of an\narray, mutual impedance and numerical modeling are used to estimate the\ndistance between the adjacent cells. In addition, the area of the proposed\ntransducer and the number of cells are computed with the Rayleigh distance and\nneglecting the cross-talk among cells, respectively. The designed transducer\nconsists of 7x7 cells in an area of 3.24 mm2. The transducer is able to deliver\nan acoustic intensity of 7.185 mW/mm2 for a voltage of 19.5 V for powering\nbrain implants seated in the motor cortex and striatum of the mice's brain. The\nmaximum acoustic intensity occurs at a distance of 2.5 mm in the near field\nwhich was estimated with the Rayleigh length equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 12:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

Lack of static typing can cause\nrun-time exceptions and is a major factor for weak IDE support. To alleviate\nthese issues, PEP 484 introduced optional type annotations for Python. As\nretrofitting types to existing codebases is error-prone and laborious, machine\nlearning (ML)-based approaches have been proposed to enable automatic type\ninference based on existing, partially annotated codebases. However, previous\nML-based approaches are trained and evaluated on human-provided type\nannotations, which might not always be sound, and hence this may limit the\npracticality for real-world usage.

Cubification seems to equal LLL; it even outperforms it in\nthe reduction of columnar matrices. We wrote a Python program that is ten times\nfaster than a reference Python LLL code. This work may open new perspectives\nfor lattice reduction and may have implications and applications beyond\ncrystallography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 14:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

How much of a user's experience over time with a recommender\nis caused by the recommender system's choices and biases, and how much is based\non the user's preferences and biases? Popularity bias and filter bubbles are\ntwo of the most well-studied recommender system biases, but most of the prior\nresearch has focused on understanding the system behavior in a single\nrecommendation step. How do these biases interplay with user behavior, and what\ntypes of user experiences are created from repeated interactions?\n  In this work, we offer a simulation framework for measuring the impact of a\nrecommender system under different types of user behavior. Using this\nsimulation framework, we can (a) isolate the effect of the recommender system\nfrom the user preferences, and (b) examine how the system performs not just on\naverage for an \"average user\" but also the extreme experiences under atypical\nuser behavior. As part of the simulation framework, we propose a set of\nevaluation metrics over the simulations to understand the recommender system's\nbehavior. Finally, we present two empirical case studies -- one on traditional\ncollaborative filtering in MovieLens and one on a large-scale production\nrecommender system -- to understand how popularity bias manifests over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 14:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

We make\nthis intuition precise by means of the \"partial evaluations\" sitting in the\nso-called bar construction of monads. The (pseudo)monads of interest for\nforming colimits are the monad of diagrams and the monad of small presheaves,\nboth on the (huge) category CAT of locally small categories. Throughout,\nparticular care is taken to handle size issues, which are notoriously delicate\nin the context of free cocompletion.\n  We spell out, with all 2-dimensional details, the structure maps of these\npseudomonads. Then, based on a detailed general proof of how the\n\"restriction-of-scalars\" construction of monads extends to the case of\npseudoalgebras over pseudomonads, we define a morphism of monads between them,\nwhich we call \"image\". This morphism allows us in particular to generalize the\nidea of \"confinal functors\" i.e. of functors which leave colimits invariant in\nan absolute way. This generalization includes the concept of absolute colimit\nas a special case.\n  The main result of this paper spells out how a pointwise left Kan extension\nof a diagram corresponds precisely to a partial evaluation of its colimit.

DP formalizes this data leakage\nthrough a cryptographic game, where an adversary must predict if a model was\ntrained on a dataset D, or a dataset D' that differs in just one example.If\nobserving the training algorithm does not meaningfully increase the adversary's\nodds of successfully guessing which dataset the model was trained on, then the\nalgorithm is said to be differentially private. Hence, the purpose of privacy\nanalysis is to upper bound the probability that any adversary could\nsuccessfully guess which dataset the model was trained on.In our paper, we\ninstantiate this hypothetical adversary in order to establish lower bounds on\nthe probability that this distinguishing game can be won. We use this adversary\nto evaluate the importance of the adversary capabilities allowed in the privacy\nanalysis of DP training algorithms.For DP-SGD, the most common method for\ntraining neural networks with differential privacy, our lower bounds are tight\nand match the theoretical upper bound. This implies that in order to prove\nbetter upper bounds, it will be necessary to make use of additional\nassumptions. Fortunately, we find that our attacks are significantly weaker\nwhen additional (realistic)restrictions are put in place on the adversary's\ncapabilities.Thus, in the practical setting common to many real-world\ndeployments, there is a gap between our lower bounds and the upper bounds\nprovided by the analysis: differential privacy is conservative and adversaries\nmay not be able to leak as much information as suggested by the theoretical\nbound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 18:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

Most current works focus\non settings where the resolution of images is kept the same. However, the\nresolution is a crucial factor in person ReID, especially when the cameras are\nat different distances from the person or the camera's models are different\nfrom each other. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream network with a\nlightweight resolution association ReID feature transformation (RAFT) module\nand a self-weighted attention (SWA) ReID module to evaluate features under\ndifferent resolutions.

With\nthe discovery of topologically-stable polar skyrmions, it is of both\nfundamental and practical interest to understand the microscopic nature and the\npossibility of temperature- and strain-driven phase transitions in ensembles of\nsuch polar skyrmions. Here, we explore the reversible transition from a\nskyrmion state (topological charge of -1) to a two-dimensional, tetratic\nlattice of merons (with topological charge of -1/2) upon varying the\ntemperature and elastic boundary conditions in [(PbTiO3)16/(SrTiO3)16]8\nlifted-off membranes. This topological phase transition is accompanied by a\nchange in chirality, from zero-net chirality (in meronic phase) to\nnet-handedness (in skyrmionic phase). To map these changes microscopically\nrequired developing new imaging methods. We show how scanning convergent beam\nelectron diffraction provides a robust measure of the local polarization\nsimultaneously with the strain state at sub-nm resolution, while also directly\nmapping the chirality of each skyrmion. Using this, we demonstrate strain as a\ncrucial order parameter to drive isotropic-to-anisotropic structural\ntransitions of chiral polar skyrmions to non-chiral merons, validated with\nX-ray reciprocal space mapping and theoretical phase-field simulations. These\nresults revealed by our new measurement methods provide the first illustration\nof systematic control of rich variety of topological dipole textures by\naltering the mechanical boundary conditions, which may offer a promising way to\ncontrol their functionalities in ferroelectric nanodevices using the local and\nspatial distribution of chirality and order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 15:25:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 20:55:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 19:25:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 23:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

It affects Newtonian fluids\nby concentrating any non-volatile components and viscoelastic materials, which\nhardens up. In both of these cases, solvent evaporation leads to a change in\nthe sample volume, which makes any rheological measurements particularly\nchallenging with traditional shear geometries. Here we show that the\nrheological properties of a sample experiencing `slow' evaporation can be\nmonitored in a time-resolved fashion by using a zero normal-force controlled\nprotocol in a parallel-plate geometry. Solvent evaporation from the sample\nleads to a decrease of the normal force, which is compensated at all times by a\ndecrease of the gap height between the plates. As a result, the sample\nmaintains a constant contact area with the plates despite the significant\ndecrease of its volume. We validate the method under both oscillatory and\ncontinuous shear by accurately monitoring the viscosity of water-glycerol\nmixtures experiencing evaporation and a relative volume decrease as large as\n70%. Moreover, we apply this protocol to dehydrating suspensions. Specifically,\nwe monitor a dispersion of charged silica nanoparticles undergoing a glass\ntransition induced by evaporation. While the decrease in gap height provides a\ndirect estimate of the increasing particle volume fraction, oscillatory and\ncontinuous shear measurements allow us to monitor the suspension's evolving\nviscoelastic properties in real-time.

Without\nspecifying any particular production mechanism, but only postulating that the\nsource distribution follows the matter distribution of the local Universe, a\ngood accounting of the magnitude, direction and energy dependence of the dipole\nanisotropy at energies above $8 \\times 10^{18}$ eV is obtained, after taking\ninto account the impact of energy losses during propagation (the \"GZK\nhorizon\"), diffusion in extragalactic magnetic field and deflections in the\nGalactic magnetic field (GMF). This is a major step toward the long-standing\nhope of using UHECR anisotropies to constrain UHECR composition and magnetic\nfields. The observed dipole anisotropy is incompatible with a pure proton\ncomposition in this scenario.

Understanding how physical rules shape the topological\nstructure of those networks can clarify a system's function and enhance our\nability to design, guide, or control its behavior. In the emerging area of\nquantum network science, a key challenge lies in distinguishing between the\ntopological properties that reflect a system's underlying physics and those\nthat reflect the assumptions of the employed conceptual model. To elucidate and\naddress this challenge, we study networks that represent non-equilibrium\nquantum-electronic transport through quantum antidot devices -- an example of\nan open, mesoscopic quantum system. The network representations correspond to\ntwo different models of internal antidot states: a single-particle,\nnon-interacting model and an effective model for collective excitations\nincluding Coulomb interactions. In these networks, nodes represent accessible\nenergy states and edges represent allowed transitions. We find that both models\nreflect spin conservation rules in the network topology through bipartiteness\nand the presence of only even-length cycles. The models diverge, however, in\nthe minimum length of cycle basis elements, in a manner that depends on whether\nelectrons are considered to be distinguishable. Furthermore, the two models\nreflect spin-conserving relaxation effects differently, as evident in both the\ndegree distribution and the cycle-basis length distribution. Collectively,\nthese observations serve to elucidate the relationship between network\nstructure and physical constraints in quantum-mechanical models. More\ngenerally, our approach underscores the utility of network science in\nunderstanding the dynamics and control of quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 15:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

Unbound electron-positron pairs and positronia can be created by strong\nelectromagnetic fields produced in interactions of electrically charged\nobjects, in particular, in collisions of heavy nuclei. Kinematics of this\nprocess favours abundant creation of the unbound electron-positron pairs with\nvery small masses and the confined parapositronia states which decay directly\nto two 511 keV quanta. Therefore we propose to consider interactions of\nelectromagnetic fields of colliding heavy ions as a source of low-mass pairs\nwhich can transform to 511 keV quanta. Intensity of their creation is enlarged\nby the factor Z$^4$ (Z is the electric charge of a heavy ion) compared to\nprotons with Z=1. These processes are especially important at very high\nenergies of nuclear collisions because their cross sections increase\nproportionally to cube of the logarithm of energy and can even exceed the cross\nsections of strong interactions which may not increase faster than the squared\nlogarithm of energy. Moreover, production of extremely low-mass $e^+e^-$-pairs\nin ultraperipheral nuclear collisions is strongly enhanced due to the\nSommerfeld-Gamow-Sakharov (SGS) factor which accounts for mutual Coulomb\nattraction of non-relativistic electrons to positrons in case of low\npair-masses. This attraction may lead to their annihilation and, therefore, to\nthe increased intensity of 511 keV photons. It is proposed to confront the\nobtained results to forthcoming experimental data at NICA collider.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 08:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

While their creation in light has become a standard\ntechnique, the production of squeezed states of the collective excitations in\ngases of ultracold atoms, the phonons of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), is a\ncomparably recent problem. This task is continuously gaining relevance with a\ngrowing number of proposals for BEC-based quantum metrological devices and the\npossibility to apply them in the detection of gravitational waves. The\nobjective of this thesis is to find whether the recently described effect of an\noscillating external potential on a uniform BEC can be exploited to generate\ntwo-mode squeezed phonon states, given present day technology. This question\nbrings together elements of a range of fields beyond cold atoms, such as\ngeneral relativity and Efimov physics. To answer it, the full transformation\ncaused by the oscillating potential on an initially thermal phononic state is\nconsidered, allowing to find an upper bound for the magnitude of this\nperturbation as well as to quantify the quality of the final state with respect\nto its use in metrology. These findings are then applied to existing\nexperiments to judge the feasibility of the squeezing scheme and while the\nresults indicate that they are not well suited for it, a setup is proposed that\nallows for its efficient implementation and seems within experimental reach. In\nview of the vast parameter space leaving room for optimization, the considered\nmechanism could find applications not only in the gravitational wave detector\nthat originally motivated this work, but more generally in the field of quantum\nmetrology based on ultracold atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 13:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

They facilitate the extraction of natural resources such as oil and\ngas. LWD instruments require real-time inversions of electromagnetic\nmeasurements to estimate the electrical properties of the earth's subsurface\nnear the well and possibly correct the well trajectory. Deep Neural Network\n(DNN)-based methods are suitable for the rapid inversion of borehole\nresistivity measurements as they approximate the forward and inverse problem\noffline during the training phase and they only require a fraction of a second\nfor the evaluation (aka prediction). However, the inverse problem generally\nadmits multiple solutions. DNNs with traditional loss functions based on data\nmisfit are ill-equipped for solving an inverse problem. This can be partially\novercome by adding regularization terms to a loss function specifically\ndesigned for encoder-decoder architectures. But adding regularization seriously\nlimits the number of possible solutions to a set of a priori desirable physical\nsolutions. To avoid this, we use a two-step loss function without any\nregularization. In addition, to guarantee an inverse solution, we need a\ncarefully selected measurement acquisition system with a sufficient number of\nmeasurements. In this work, we propose a DNN-based iterative algorithm for\ndesigning such a measurement acquisition system. We illustrate our DNN-based\niterative algorithm via several synthetic examples. Numerical results show that\nthe obtained measurement acquisition system is sufficient to identify and\ncharacterize both resistive and conductive layers above and below the logging\ninstrument. Numerical results are promising, although further improvements are\nrequired to make our method amenable for industrial purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 12:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

Existing GUI semantic representations are limited to encoding\neither the textual content, the visual design and layout patterns, or the app\ncontexts. Many representation techniques also require significant manual data\nannotation efforts. This paper presents Screen2Vec, a new self-supervised\ntechnique for generating representations in embedding vectors of GUI screens\nand components that encode all of the above GUI features without requiring\nmanual annotation using the context of user interaction traces. Screen2Vec is\ninspired by the word embedding method Word2Vec, but uses a new two-layer\npipeline informed by the structure of GUIs and interaction traces and\nincorporates screen- and app-specific metadata. Through several sample\ndownstream tasks, we demonstrate Screen2Vec's key useful properties:\nrepresenting between-screen similarity through nearest neighbors,\ncomposability, and capability to represent user tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 17:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-28"}

We consider the problem of parsing\ndecimal numbers to the nearest binary floating-point value. The general problem\nrequires variable-precision arithmetic. However, we need at most 17 digits to\nrepresent 64-bit standard floating-point numbers (IEEE 754). Thus we can\nrepresent the decimal significand with a single 64-bit word. By combining the\nsignificand and precomputed tables, we can compute the nearest floating-point\nnumber using as few as one or two 64-bit multiplications. Our implementation\ncan be several times faster than conventional functions present in standard C\nlibraries on modern 64-bit systems (Intel, AMD, ARM and POWER9). Our work is\navailable as open source software used by major systems such as Apache Arrow\nand Yandex ClickHouse.

Given the complex nature of the Internet, detection of deliberate\ndiscrimination is not easy to detect, and tools developed so far suffer from\nvarious limitations. We study challenges in detecting the violations (focusing\non the HTTPS traffic) and discuss possible mitigation approaches. We focus on\n`Wehe,' the most recent tool developed to detect net-neutrality violations.\nWehe hosts traffic from all services of interest in a common server and replays\nthem to mimic the behavior of the traffic from original servers. Despite Wehe's\nvast utility and possible influences over policy decisions, its mechanisms are\nnot yet validated by others. In this work, we highlight critical weaknesses in\nWehe where its replay traffic is not being correctly classified as intended\nservices by the network middleboxes. We validate this observation using a\ncommercial traffic shaper. We propose a new method in which the SNI parameter\nis set appropriately in the initial TLS handshake to overcome this weakness.\nUsing commercial traffic shapers, we validate that SNI makes the replay traffic\ngets correctly classified as the intended traffic by the middleboxes. Our new\napproach thus provides a more realistic method for detecting neutrality\nviolations of HTTPS traffic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 15:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 11:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

However, due to favourable weather conditions, the RES is installed in\nremote locations with limited transmission capacity. As a result, it can lead\nto major curtailments of the free resource when the network is congested.\nTherefore, energy storage system (ESS) is considered as a viable solution to\nstore energy and address the intermittent nature of RES though ESS is often\ndistributed and may not be geographically close to RES. Therefore, ESS may also\nsuffer from limited transmission capacity due to network congestion. Currently,\ngrid operators overlook network flexibility as a congestion management tool in\nday-ahead scheduling. This paper addresses these issues and studies the\nbenefits of introducing network reconfiguration (NR) as a preventive and\ncorrective action for transmission flexibility in day-ahead stochastic\nsecurity-constrained unit-commitment (SSCUC-PC) while considering a\nmulti-scenario RES output. Simulation results demonstrate that NR can lower\ntotal system cost, reduce RES curtailments and utilize ESS for better impact by\nalleviating network congestion in both base-case and post-contingency networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 22:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}
