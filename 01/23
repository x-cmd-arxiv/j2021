Such heterogeneity has been\nobserved in COVID-19 and is recognized as overdispersion (or\n\"super-spreading\"). The model of [8] suggests that super-spreaders contribute\nsignificantly to the effective reproduction factor, R, and that they are likely\nto get infected and immune early in the process. Consequently, under R_0 = 3\n(attributed to COVID-19), the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT) is as low as 5%, in\ncontrast to 67% according to the traditional models [1, 2, 4, 10]. This work\nfollows up on [8] and proposes that heterogeneity of infectiousness\n(susceptibility) has two \"faces\" whose mix affects dramatically the HIT: (1)\nPersonal-Trait-, and (2) Event-Based- Infectiousness (Susceptibility). The\nformer is a personal trait of specific individuals (super-spreaders) and is\nnullified once those individuals are immune (as in [8]). The latter is\nevent-based (e.g cultural super-spreading events) and remains effective\nthroughout the process, even after the super-spreaders immune. We extend [8]'s\nmodel to account for these two factors, analyze it and conclude that the HIT is\nvery sensitive to the mix between (1) and (2), and under R_0 = 3 it can vary\nbetween 5% and 67%.

This method relies on the\nexceptional mass sensing capabilities of nanomechanical resonators. Focused\nelectron beam induced deposition (FEBID) is employed to selectively grow\nplatinum particles at the free end of singly clamped nanotube cantilevers. The\nelectron beam has two functions: it allows both to grow material on the\nnanotube and to track in real time the deposited mass by probing the\nnoise-driven mechanical resonance of the nanotube. On the one hand, this\ndetection method is highly effective as it can resolve mass deposition with a\nresolution in the zeptogram range; on the other hand, this method is simple to\nuse and readily available to a wide range of potential users, since it can be\noperated in existing commercial FEBID systems without making any modification.\nThe presented method allows to engineer hybrid nanomechanical resonators with\nprecisely tailored functionality. It also appears as a new tool for studying\ngrowth dynamics of ultra-thin nanostructures, opening new opportunities for\ninvestigating so far out-of-reach physics of FEBID and related methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 16:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

Despite years of research, a lot is yet\nto be learnt about the joints' interface dynamics. The problem becomes even\nmore difficult when the interface Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) are inaccessible for\nFrequency Response Function (FRF) measurements. This is, for example, the case\nof bladed-disk systems with dove-tail or fir-tree type joints. Therefore, an\nFRF based expansion method called System Equivalent Model Mixing (SEMM) is used\nto obtain expanded interface dynamics. The method uses numerical and\nexperimental sub-models of each component and their assembly to produce the\nrespective expanded or hybrid sub-models. By applying substructure decoupling\nto these sub-models, the joint can be identified. However, the joint can be\nnoisy due to expansion and measurement errors which propagate to the hybrid\nsub-models. In this paper, a correlation based approach is proposed in the SEMM\nmethod wherein the quality of the expanded sub-models is improved. In this new\napproach, several expanded models are generated systematically using different\ncombinations of the experimental FRFs and computing a parameter, Frequency\nResponse Assurance Criteria (FRAC), to evaluate quality of the contribution of\nthe different measurements. The lowest correlated channels or FRFs can be\nfiltered out based on a certain threshold value of FRAC. Using the improved\nhybrid sub-models, the joint identification also shows a remarkable\nimprovement. The test object for the method is an assembly of disk and one\nblade with a dove-tail joint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 16:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

Due to those\napproximations, they violate the constraints or fail to find the optimal\nsolution within the trust region.

In this work, we propose differentiable\nneural network layers to enforce trust regions for deep Gaussian policies via\nclosed-form projections.

Since tasks in similar environments share\nmodel similarity, it is plausible to leverage pre-trained generative models\nfrom the cloud or other edge nodes. Appealing to optimal transport theory\ntailored towards Wasserstein-1 generative adversarial networks (WGAN), this\nstudy aims to develop a framework which systematically optimizes continual\nlearning of generative models using local data at the edge node while\nexploiting adaptive coalescence of pre-trained generative models. Specifically,\nby treating the knowledge transfer from other nodes as Wasserstein balls\ncentered around their pre-trained models, continual learning of generative\nmodels is cast as a constrained optimization problem, which is further reduced\nto a Wasserstein-1 barycenter problem. A two-stage approach is devised\naccordingly: 1) The barycenters among the pre-trained models are computed\noffline, where displacement interpolation is used as the theoretic foundation\nfor finding adaptive barycenters via a \"recursive\" WGAN configuration; 2) the\nbarycenter computed offline is used as meta-model initialization for continual\nlearning and then fast adaptation is carried out to find the generative model\nusing the local samples at the target edge node. Finally, a weight\nternarization method, based on joint optimization of weights and threshold for\nquantization, is developed to compress the generative model further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 17:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

Common causes of treatment and\noutcomes are often unmeasured, obscuring our ability to easily account for\nmedication use with commonly invoked assumptions such as ignorability. Further,\nabsent some variable satisfying the exclusion restriction, use of instrumental\nvariable approaches may be difficult to justify. Heckman's hybrid model with\nstructural shift (sometimes referred to less specifically as the treatment\neffects model) can be used to correct endogeneity bias via a homogeneity\nassumption (i.e., that average treatment effects do not vary across covariates)\nand parametric specification of a joint model for the outcome and treatment.

Recent developments demonstrated\nthat exceptional points can play an important role in photonics. However, to\ndate, exceptional points have been extensively examined in the systems\nsupporting only a few optical modes, thereby leaving the observation of\ncollective (multimode) effects outside of the scope of study.

Investigating this system, which is known to possess exceptional\npoints, we find two fundamentally different nonlinear regimes of operation\ncorresponding to effective parity-time symmetric and broken parity-time\nsymmetry states.

Here we investigate a manifestation of Noether's theorem in\nnon-Hermitian systems, where the inner product is defined differently from\nquantum mechanics. In this framework, a generalized symmetry which we term\npseudo-chirality emerges naturally as the counterpart of symmetries defined by\na commutation relation in quantum mechanics. Using this observation, we reveal\npreviously unidentified constants of motion in non-Hermitian systems with\nparity-time and chiral symmetries. We further elaborate the disparate\nimplications of pseudo-chirality induced constant of motion: It signals the\npair excitation of a generalized \"particle\" and the corresponding \"hole\" but\nvanishes universally when the pseudo-chiral operator is anti-symmetric. This\ndisparity, when manifested in a non-Hermitian topological lattice with the\nLandau gauge, depends on whether the lattice size is even or odd. We further\ndiscuss previously unidentified symmetries of this non-Hermitian topological\nsystem, and we reveal how its constant of motion due to pseudo-chirality can be\nused as an indicator of whether a pure chiral edge state is excited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 17:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

Resonant systems\nare especially important as the fragility of their orbital configuration\nensures that no significant scattering or collisional event has taken place\nsince the earliest formation phase when the parent protoplanetary disc was\nstill present. In this context, TOI-178 has been the subject of particular\nattention since the first TESS observations hinted at a 2:3:3 resonant chain.\nHere we report the results of observations from CHEOPS, ESPRESSO, NGTS, and\nSPECULOOS with the aim of deciphering the peculiar orbital architecture of the\nsystem. We show that TOI-178 harbours at least six planets in the super-Earth\nto mini-Neptune regimes, with radii ranging from 1.152(-0.070/+0.073) to\n2.87(-0.13/+0.14) Earth radii and periods of 1.91, 3.24, 6.56, 9.96, 15.23, and\n20.71 days. All planets but the innermost one form a 2:4:6:9:12 chain of\nLaplace resonances, and the planetary densities show important variations from\nplanet to planet, jumping from 1.02(+0.28/-0.23) to 0.177(+0.055/-0.061) times\nthe Earth's density between planets c and d. Using Bayesian interior structure\nretrieval models, we show that the amount of gas in the planets does not vary\nin a monotonous way, contrary to what one would expect from simple formation\nand evolution models and unlike other known systems in a chain of Laplace\nresonances. The brightness of TOI-178 allows for a precise characterisation of\nits orbital architecture as well as of the physical nature of the six presently\nknown transiting planets it harbours. The peculiar orbital configuration and\nthe diversity in average density among the planets in the system will enable\nthe study of interior planetary structures and atmospheric evolution, providing\nimportant clues on the formation of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 18:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

We specialize an existing Accelerated\nDual Gradient Projection (GPAD) algorithm to effectively solve the Quadratic\nProgramming (QP) relaxation that arise during Branch and Bound (B&B) and\npropose a generic framework to warm-start the binary variables which reduces\nthe number of QP relaxations.

Both heuristic approaches return an integer\nfeasible solution that may be suboptimal but involve a much reduced computation\neffort. Such a feasible solution can be either implemented directly or used to\nset an initial upper bound on the optimal cost in B&B.

In a recent paper, we\ndemonstrated that as a result of this interconnectedness, radial wind solutions\nof X-ray heated flows are prone to becoming clumpy. In this paper, we first\nshow that the Bernoulli function determines whether or not the entropy mode can\ngrow due to TI in dynamical flows. Based on this finding, we identify a\ncritical `unbound' radius beyond which TI should accompany thermal driving. Our\nnumerical disk wind simulations support this result and reveal that clumpiness\nis a consequence of buoyancy disrupting the stratified structure of steady\nstate solutions. Namely, instead of a smooth transition layer separating the\nhighly ionized disk wind from the cold phase atmosphere below, hot bubbles\nformed from TI rise up and fragment the atmosphere. These bubbles first appear\nwithin large scale vortices that form below the transition layer, and they\nresult in the episodic production of distinctive cold phase structures referred\nto as irradiated atmospheric fragments (IAFs). Upon interacting with the wind,\nIAFs advect outward and develop extended crests. The subsequent disintegration\nof the IAFs takes place within a turbulent wake that reaches high elevations\nabove the disk. We show that this dynamics has the following observational\nimplications: dips in the absorption measure distribution are no longer\nexpected within TI zones and there can be a less sudden desaturation of X-ray\nabsorption lines such as \\OVIII as well as multiple absorption troughs in\n\\FeXXVK.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 18:53:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 06:01:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 08:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

We test the null hypothesis that\nLOS frequency decorrelation is not detectable in $Planck$ 353 and 217~GHz\npolarization data at high Galactic latitudes. The data reject this hypothesis\nat high significance. The detection is robust against choice of CMB map and\nmap-making pipeline. The observed change in polarization angle due to LOS\nfrequency decorrelation is detectable above the $Planck$ noise level. The\nprobability that the detected effect is due to noise alone ranges from $5\\times\n10^{-2}$ to $4\\times 10^{-7}$, depending on the CMB subtraction algorithm and\ntreatment of residual systematics; correcting for residual systematics\nincreases the significance of the effect.

A popular model for causal\ninference is the Rubin Causal Model (RCM), which typically seeks to estimate\nthe average difference in study units' potential outcomes. An important\nassumption under RCM is no interference; that is, the potential outcomes of one\nunit are not affected by the exposure status of other units. The no\ninterference assumption is violated if we expect spillover or diffusion of\nexposure effects based on units' proximity to other units and several other\ncausal estimands arise. Air pollution epidemiology typically violates this\nassumption when we expect upwind events to affect downwind or nearby locations.\nThis paper adapts causal assumptions from social network research to address\ninterference and allow estimation of both direct and spillover causal effects.\nWe use propensity score-based methods to estimate these effects when\nconsidering the effects of the Environmental Protection Agency's 2005\nnonattainment designations for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter\nless than 2.5 micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) on lung cancer incidence using\ncounty-level data obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results\n(SEER) Program.

To address this issue, this research presents a novel genetic\nalgorithm with a hierarchical evaluation strategy (HESGA), which combines the\nfull evaluation of GNNs with a fast evaluation approach. By using full\nevaluation, a GNN is represented by a set of hyperparameter values and trained\non a specified dataset, and root mean square error (RMSE) will be used to\nmeasure the quality of the GNN represented by the set of hyperparameter values\n(for regression problems). While in the proposed fast evaluation process, the\ntraining will be interrupted at an early stage, the difference of RMSE values\nbetween the starting and interrupted epochs will be used as a fast score, which\nimplies the potential of the GNN being considered. To coordinate both types of\nevaluations, the proposed hierarchical strategy uses the fast evaluation in a\nlower level for recommending candidates to a higher level, where the full\nevaluation will act as a final assessor to maintain a group of elite\nindividuals.

This is fundamentally a\nmissing data problem, where the number of unobserved individuals represents the\nmissing data. As with any missing data problem, multiple-systems estimation\nrequires users to make an untestable identifying assumption in order to\nestimate the population size from the observed data. If an appropriate\nidentifying assumption cannot be found for a data set, no estimate of the\npopulation size should be produced based on that data set, as models with\ndifferent identifying assumptions can produce arbitrarily different population\nsize estimates -- even with identical observed data fits. Approaches to\nmultiple-systems estimation often do not explicitly specify identifying\nassumptions.

Second, due to the complexity of vascular trees and the\nsmall size of vessels, it is challenging to obtain the amount of annotated\ntraining data typically needed by deep learning methods. To address these\nproblems, we propose a novel annotation-efficient deep learning vessel\nsegmentation framework. The framework avoids pixel-wise annotations, only\nrequiring weak patch-level labels to discriminate between vessel and non-vessel\n2D patches in the training set, in a setup similar to the CAPTCHAs used to\ndifferentiate humans from bots in web applications.

The classifier\nnetwork allows to generate additional weak patch labels, further reducing the\nannotation burden, and it acts as a noise filter for poor quality images.

Although state-of-the-art CNNs\nprovide high accuracy in many applications, recent investigations show that\nsuch networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The black-box\nadversarial attack is one type of attack that the attacker does not have any\nknowledge about the model or the training dataset, but it has some input data\nset and their labels. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to generate a\nblack-box attack in sparse domain whereas the most important information of an\nimage can be observed. Our investigation shows that large sparse (LaS)\ncomponents play a critical role in the performance of image classifiers. Under\nthis presumption, to generate adversarial example, we transfer an image into a\nsparse domain and put a threshold to choose only k LaS components. In contrast\nto the very recent works that randomly perturb k low frequency (LoF)\ncomponents, we perturb k LaS components either randomly (query-based) or in the\ndirection of the most correlated sparse signal from a different class.

In this problem, each agent has a local cost\nfunction, and in the fault-free case, the goal is to design a distributed\nalgorithm that allows all the agents to find a minimum point of all the agents'\naggregate cost function. We consider a scenario where some agents might be\nByzantine faulty that renders the original goal of computing a minimum point of\nall the agents' aggregate cost vacuous. A more reasonable objective for an\nalgorithm in this scenario is to allow all the non-faulty agents to compute the\nminimum point of only the non-faulty agents' aggregate cost. Prior work shows\nthat if there are up to $f$ (out of $n$) Byzantine agents then a minimum point\nof the non-faulty agents' aggregate cost can be computed exactly if and only if\nthe non-faulty agents' costs satisfy a certain redundancy property called\n$2f$-redundancy. However, $2f$-redundancy is an ideal property that can be\nsatisfied only in systems free from noise or uncertainties, which can make the\ngoal of exact fault-tolerance unachievable in some applications. Thus, we\nintroduce the notion of $(f,\\epsilon)$-resilience, a generalization of exact\nfault-tolerance wherein the objective is to find an approximate minimum point\nof the non-faulty aggregate cost, with $\\epsilon$ accuracy. This approximate\nfault-tolerance can be achieved under a weaker condition that is easier to\nsatisfy in practice, compared to $2f$-redundancy. We obtain necessary and\nsufficient conditions for achieving $(f,\\epsilon)$-resilience characterizing\nthe correlation between relaxation in redundancy and approximation in\nresilience.

In line with\nthis progress, and in order to counteract potential dangers, several methods\nhave been pro-posed for detecting text written by these language models. In\nthis paper, we propose a transfer learning based model that will be able to\ndetect if an Arabic sentence is written by humans or automatically generated by\nbots.

MAVERICK automatically infers signatures for the control\nplane configurations (e.g., ACLs, route-maps, route-policies and so on) and\nstates that allows administrators to automatically detect bugs with minimal\nhuman intervention. MAVERICK achieves this by effectively leveraging any\nstructural deviation i.e., outliers in the network configurations that is\norganized as simple or complexly nested key-value pairs.

We\nuse the ADM formalism in order to write the gravitational Hamiltonian of the\nmodel and the Schutz's formalism in order to write the perfect fluid\nHamiltonian. The noncommutativity is introduced by four nontrivial Poisson\nbrackets between all geometrical as well as matter variables of the model.

We\nrecover the description in terms of commutative variables by introducing four\nvariables transformations that depend on the noncommutative parameters.

From the resulting\nHamiltonian, we obtain the scale factor dynamical equations for a generic\nperfect fluid. In order to solve these equations, we restrict our attention to\na model where the perfect fluid is radiation.

Confronting and addressing the issues concerning the scarce\nresource's conservation, competition, and stimulation by grappling its\ncharacteristics and adopting viable policy instruments calls the\ndecision-maker's attention with a paramount priority. In this paper, we develop\nthe first general decentralized cross-sector supply chain network model that\ncaptures the unique features of scarce resources under a unifying fiscal policy\nscheme. We formulate the problem as a network equilibrium model with\nfinite-dimensional variational inequality theories. We then characterize the\nnetwork equilibrium with a set of classic theoretical properties, as well as\nwith a set of properties that are novel to the network games application\nliterature, namely, the lowest eigenvalue of the game Jacobian. Lastly, we\nprovide a series of illustrative examples, including a medical glove supply\nnetwork, to showcase how our model can be used to investigate the efficacy of\nthe imposed policies in relieving supply chain distress and stimulating\nwelfare.

High-resolution\nmeasurements of the helium triplet, He(2$^{3}$S), absorption of highly\nirradiated planets have been recently reported, which provide a new mean to\nstudy their atmospheric escape. In this work, we study the escape of the upper\natmospheres of HD 189733 b and GJ 3470 b by analysing high-resolution\nHe(2$^{3}$S) absorption measurements and using a 1D hydrodynamic model coupled\nwith a non-LTE model for the He(2$^{3}$S) state. We also use the H density\nderived from Ly$\\alpha$ observations to further constrain their temperatures,\nT, mass-loss rates,$\\dot M$, and H/He ratios. We have significantly improved\nour knowledge of the upper atmospheres of these planets. While HD 189733 b has\na rather compressed atmosphere and small gas radial velocities, GJ 3470 b, with\na gravitational potential ten times smaller, exhibits a very extended\natmosphere and large radial outflow velocities. Hence, although GJ 3470 b is\nmuch less irradiated in the XUV, and its upper atmosphere is much cooler, it\nevaporates at a comparable rate.

The encoding is performed across the\nentire span of temporal time points for relatively extreme events with respect\nto a chosen quantile-based threshold. As such the return time series is\ntransformed into Bernoulli-variable processes. In the decoding phase, we\ncomputationally seek for locations of change points via estimations based on a\nnew searching algorithm in conjunction with the information criterion applied\non the observed collection of recurrence times upon the binary process.

Even though new single view reconstruction techniques can predict\nthe surface, they lead to incomplete models, specially, for non commons objects\nsuch as antique objects or art sculptures. Therefore, to achieve the task's\ngoals, it is essential to automatically determine the locations where the\nsensor will be placed so that the surface will be completely observed. This\nproblem is known as the next-best-view problem. In this paper, we propose a\ndata-driven approach to address the problem. The proposed approach trains a 3D\nconvolutional neural network (3D CNN) with previous reconstructions in order to\nregress the \\btxt{position of the} next-best-view. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is one of the first works that directly infers the\nnext-best-view in a continuous space using a data-driven approach for the 3D\nobject reconstruction task.

The depletions of different\nelements are tightly correlated, indicating a common origin. Hydrogen column\ndensity is the main driver for depletion variations. Correlations are weaker\nwith volume density, probed by CI fine structure lines, and distance to the LMC\ncenter. The latter correlation results from an East-West variation of the\ngas-phase metallicity. Gas in the East, compressed side of the LMC encompassing\n30 Doradus and the Southeast HI over-density is enriched by up to +0.3dex,\nwhile gas in the West side is metal-deficient by up to -0.5dex.

This problem is challenging since surfaces come\nwith arbitrary parameterizations and thus, they need to be spatially\nregistered. Also, different deforming objects, also called 4D surfaces, evolve\nat different speeds and thus they need to be temporally aligned. We solve this\nspatiotemporal registration problem using a Riemannian approach. We treat a 3D\nsurface as a point in a shape space equipped with an elastic Riemannian metric\nthat measures the amount of bending and stretching that the surfaces undergo. A\n4D surface can then be seen as a trajectory in this space. With this\nformulation, the statistical analysis of 4D surfaces can be cast as the problem\nof analyzing trajectories embedded in a nonlinear Riemannian manifold. However,\nperforming the spatiotemporal registration, and subsequently computing\nstatistics, on such nonlinear spaces is not straightforward as they rely on\ncomplex nonlinear optimizations. Our core contribution is the mapping of the\nsurfaces to the space of Square-Root Normal Fields where the L2 metric is\nequivalent to the partial elastic metric in the space of surfaces. Thus, by\nsolving the spatial registration in the SRNF space, the problem of analyzing 4D\nsurfaces becomes the problem of analyzing trajectories embedded in the SRNF\nspace, which has a Euclidean structure. In this paper, we develop the building\nblocks that enable such analysis. These include: (1) the spatiotemporal\nregistration of arbitrarily parameterized 4D surfaces in the presence of large\nelastic deformations and large variations in their execution rates; (2) the\ncomputation of geodesics between 4D surfaces; (3) the computation of\nstatistical summaries; and (4) the synthesis of random 4D surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2021 02:59:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 15:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

Only when the\nsoftening is relatively large do we find that prograde BBHs harden. We\ndetermine through detailed analysis of the binary torque, that this dichotomy\nis due to a loss of spiral structure in the circum-single disks orbiting each\nBH when the softening is a significant fraction of the binary separation.\nProperly resolving these spirals -- both with high resolution and small\nsoftening -- results in a significant source of binary angular momentum. Only\nfor retrograde BBHs do we find consistent hardening, regardless of softening,\nas these BBHs lack the important spiral structure in their circum-single disks.\nThis suggests that the gas-driven inspiral of retrograde binaries can produce a\npopulation of compact BBHs in the gravitational-wave-emitting regime in AGN\ndisks, which may contribute a large fraction to the observed BBH mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2021 03:05:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 20:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

The transport\nmechanisms, especially the global one as reflected by the Taylor dispersion\nmodel, are of great practical interest to various applications. For active\ndispersion process in confined flows, previous analytical studies focused on\nthe long-time asymptotic values of dispersion characteristics. Only several\nnumerical studies preliminarily investigated the temporal evolution. Extending\nrecent studies of Jiang & Chen (J.

The temporal evolution of the local\ndistribution in the confined-section--orientation space, drift, dispersivity\nand skewness, is explored based on moments of distributions. We introduce the\nbiorthogonal expansion method for solutions because the classic integral\ntransform method for passive transport problems is not applicable due to the\nself-propulsion effect. Two types of boundary condition, the reflective\ncondition and the Robin condition for wall accumulation, are imposed\nrespectively. A detailed study on spherical and ellipsoidal swimmers dispersing\nin a plane Poiseuille flow demonstrates the influences of the swimming, shear\nflow, wall accumulation and particle shape on the transient dispersion process\nafter a point-source release. The swimming-induced diffusion makes the local\ndistribution reach its equilibrium state faster than that of passive particles.\nThough the wall accumulation significantly affects the evolution of the local\ndistribution and the drift, the time scale to reach the Taylor regime is not\nobviously changed. The shear-induced alignment of ellipsoidal particles can\nenlarge the dispersivity but has less influence on the drift and the skewness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2021 04:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

It can be argued\nthat this scheme does not correspond well to the clinical imaging task because\nreal mammographic images contain a complex superposition of anatomical\nstructures, resulting in anatomical noise that may dominate over quantum noise.\nUsing a newly developed spectral mammography system, we measured the\ncorrelation and magnitude of the anatomical noise in a set of mammograms. The\nresults from these measurements were used as input to an observer-model\noptimization that included quantum noise as well as anatomical noise. We found\nthat, within this framework, the detectability of tumors and\nmicrocalcifications behaved very differently with respect to beam quality and\ndose. The results for small microcalcifications were similar to what\ntraditional optimization methods would yield, which is to be expected since\nquantum noise dominates over anatomical noise at high spatial frequencies. For\nlarger tumors, however, low-frequency anatomical noise was the limiting factor.\nBecause anatomical structure has similar energy dependence as tumor contrast,\noptimal x-ray energy was significantly higher and the useful energy region\nwider than traditional methods suggest. Measurements on a tissue phantom\nconfirmed these theoretical results. Furthermore, since quantum noise\nconstitutes only a small fraction of the noise, the dose could be reduced\nsubstantially without sacrificing tumor detectability. Exposure settings used\nclinically are therefore not necessarily optimal for this imaging task. The\nimpact of these findings on the mammographic imaging task as a whole is,\nhowever, at this stage unclear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2021 07:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

In this\npaper, we propose a new image transformation defense based on error diffusion\nhalftoning, and combine it with adversarial training to defend against\nadversarial examples.

Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method is able to improve adversarial\nrobustness even under advanced adaptive attacks, while most of the other image\ntransformation-based defenses do not.

However,\nstatic recommendation models are difficult to answer two important questions\nwell due to inherent shortcomings: (a) What exactly does a user like? (b) Why\ndoes a user like an item? The shortcomings are due to the way that static\nmodels learn user preference, i.e., without explicit instructions and active\nfeedback from users. The recent rise of conversational recommender systems\n(CRSs) changes this situation fundamentally. In a CRS, users and the system can\ndynamically communicate through natural language interactions, which provide\nunprecedented opportunities to explicitly obtain the exact preference of users.\n  Considerable efforts, spread across disparate settings and applications, have\nbeen put into developing CRSs. Existing models, technologies, and evaluation\nmethods for CRSs are far from mature. In this paper, we provide a systematic\nreview of the techniques used in current CRSs. We summarize the key challenges\nof developing CRSs in five directions: (1) Question-based user preference\nelicitation. (2) Multi-turn conversational recommendation strategies. (3)\nDialogue understanding and generation. (4) Exploitation-exploration trade-offs.\n(5) Evaluation and user simulation.

However, the particular\nway in which this penalization is carried out, affects the value of the penalty\nparameters, as well as the number of additional binary variables that are\nneeded to obtain the desired QUBO reformulation. In turn, these factors\nsubstantially affect the ability of quantum computers to efficiently solve\nthese constrained COPT problems. This efficiency is key towards the goal of\nusing quantum computers to solve constrained COPT problems more efficiently\nthan with classical computers. Along these lines, we consider an important\nconstrained COPT problem; namely, the maximum $k$-colorable subgraph (M$k$CS)\nproblem, in which the aim is to find an induced $k$-colorable subgraph with\nmaximum cardinality in a given graph. This problem arises in channel assignment\nin spectrum sharing networks, VLSI design, human genetic research, and\ncybersecurity.

In this paper, in\norder to circumvent the trade-off, we introduce a spatiotemporal filtering\noperation dubbed velocity filtering, which is capable of separating contrast\nagents into different groups based on their vector velocities thus reducing\ninterference in the localization step, while simultaneously offering blood\nvelocity mapping at super resolution, without tracking individual microbubbles.\nAs side benefit, the velocity filter provides noise suppression before\nmicrobubble localization that could enable substantially increased penetration\ndepth in tissue typically by 4cm or more. We provide a theoretical analysis of\nthe performance of velocity filter. Numerical experiments confirm that the\nproposed velocity filter is able to separate the microbubbles with respect to\nthe speed and direction of their motion. In combination with subsequent\nlocalization of microbubble centers, e.g. by matched filtering, the velocity\nfilter improves the quality of the reconstructed vasculature significantly and\nprovides blood flow information. Overall, the proposed imaging pipeline in this\npaper enables the use of higher concentrations of microbubbles while preserving\nspatial resolution, thus helping circumvent the trade-off between acquisition\ntime and spatial resolution.

An exceptional point\narises when both the eigenvectors and eigenvalues coalesce, which in a physical\nsystem can be achieved by engineering the gain and loss coefficients, leading\nto a wide variety of counter-intuitive phenomena. In this work we demonstrate\nthe existence of an exceptional point in an exciton polariton condensate in a\ndouble-well potential. Remarkably, near the exceptional point, the polariton\ncondensate localized in one potential well can be switched off by an additional\noptical excitation in the other well with very low (far below threshold) laser\npower which surprisingly induces additional loss into the system. Increasing\nthe power of the additional laser leads to a situation in which gain dominates\nin both wells again, such that the polaritons re-condense with almost the same\ndensity in the two potential wells.

Specifically, a truss can be associated to\nevery element of an extension ring that projects down to an idempotent in the\nextending ring; every weak equivalence of extensions yields an isomorphism of\ncorresponding trusses. Furthermore, equivalence classes of ideal extensions of\nrings by integers are in one-to-one correspondence with associated trusses up\nto isomorphism given by a translation. Conversely, to any truss $T$ and an\nelement of this truss one can associate a ring and its extension by integers in\nwhich $T$ is embedded as a truss. Consequently any truss can be understood as\narising from an ideal extension by integers. The key role is played by\ninterpretation of ideal extensions by integers as extensions defined by double\nhomothetisms of Redei [L.\\ Redei, Die Verallgemeinerung der Schreierschen\nErweiterungstheorie, {\\em Acta Sci.\\ Math.\\ Szeged}, {\\bf 14} (1952), 252--273]\nor by self-permutable bimultiplications of Mac Lane [S.\\ Mac Lane, Extensions\nand obstructions for rings, {\\em Illinois J.\\ Math.} {\\bf 2} (1958), 316--345],\nthat is, as {\\em integral homothetic extensions}.

We are particularly interested in the rare event regime when $N$ is large\nand/or $\\gamma$ is small. The exponential twisting is a popular technique for\nsimilar problems that, in most cases, compares favorably to other estimators.\nHowever, it has some limitations: i) it assumes the knowledge of the moment\ngenerating function of $X_i$ and ii) sampling under the new IS PDF is not\nstraightforward and might be expensive. The aim of this work is to propose an\nalternative IS PDF that approximately yields, for certain classes of\ndistributions and in the rare event regime, at least the same performance as\nthe exponential twisting technique and, at the same time, does not introduce\nserious limitations. The first class includes distributions whose probability\ndensity functions (PDFs) are asymptotically equivalent, as $x \\rightarrow 0$,\nto $bx^{p}$, for $p>-1$ and $b>0$.

Hence, even though high location\naccuracy is possible with these solutions, they are not practical due to cost\nand/or client adoption reasons. Majority of the public venues use commercial\ncontroller-managed WLAN solutions, %provided by Aruba, Cisco, etc., that\nneither allow client changes nor infrastructure changes. In fact, for such\nvenues we have observed highly heterogeneous devices with very low adoption\nrates for client-side apps.\n  In this paper, we present our experiences in deploying a scalable location\nsystem for such venues. We show that server-side localization is not trivial\nand present two unique challenges associated with this approach, namely\nCardinality Mismatch and High Client Scan Latency. The \"Mismatch\" challenge\nresults in a significant mismatch between the set of access points (APs)\nreporting a client in the offline and online phases, while the \"Latency\"\nchallenge results in a low number of APs reporting data for any particular\nclient. We collect three weeks of detailed ground truth data (~200 landmarks),\nfrom a WiFi setup that has been deployed for more than four years, to provide\nevidences for the extent and understanding the impact of these problems. Our\nanalysis of real-world client devices reveal that the current trend for the\nclients is to reduce scans, thereby adversely impacting their localization\naccuracy. We analyze how localization is impacted when scans are minimal. We\npropose heuristics to alleviate reduction in the accuracy despite lesser scans.\nBesides the number of scans, we summarize the other challenges and pitfalls of\nreal deployments which hamper the localization accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2021 14:48:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 04:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

In this paper, we propose a k-shell-based\nHookeRank (KSHR) algorithm to identify spreaders in weighted networks. First,\nwe propose weighted k-shell centrality of the node u by using the k-shell value\nof $u$, the k-shell value of its neighbors ($v$), and edge weight ($w_{uv}$)\nbetween them. We model edges present in the network as springs and edge weights\nas spring constants.
