We\nreconcile this disconnect between recent empirical findings and past research\nby using insights gathered from press releases, millions of tweets, and\nmobility data capturing local movement in retail, grocery, workplace, parks,\nand transit domains during COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders. We find that\nconservatives adhere to health directives when they express more fear of the\nvirus. In order to better understand this phenomenon, we analyze both official\nand citizen communications and find that press releases from local and federal\ngovernment, along with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, lead to an\nincrease in expressions of fear on Twitter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 17:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

In practice, the success of\ndeep learning based COD is mainly determined by two key factors, including (i)\nA significantly large receptive field, which provides rich context information,\nand (ii) An effective fusion strategy, which aggregates the rich multi-level\nfeatures for accurate COD. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we\npropose a novel deep learning based COD approach, which integrates the large\nreceptive field and effective feature fusion into a unified framework.\nSpecifically, we first extract multi-level features from a backbone network.\nThe resulting features are then fed to the proposed dual-branch mixture\nconvolution modules, each of which utilizes multiple asymmetric convolutional\nlayers and two dilated convolutional layers to extract rich context features\nfrom a large receptive field. Finally, we fuse the features using\nspecially-designed multi-level interactive fusion modules, each of which\nemploys an attention mechanism along with feature interaction for effective\nfeature fusion. Our method detects camouflaged objects with an effective fusion\nstrategy, which aggregates the rich context information from a large receptive\nfield. All of these designs meet the requirements of COD well, allowing the\naccurate detection of camouflaged objects.

The robots are classified in different types that\ncapture their different capabilities, and each task may require robots of\nmultiple types. The specific robots assigned to each task are immaterial, as\nlong as they are of the desired type. Given a discrete workspace, our goal is\nto design paths, i.e., sequences of discrete states, for the robots so that the\nLTL specification is satisfied. To obtain a scalable solution to this complex\ntemporal logic task allocation problem, we propose a hierarchical approach that\nfirst allocates specific robots to tasks using the information about the tasks\ncontained in the Nondeterministic Buchi Automaton (NBA) that captures the LTL\nspecification, and then designs low-level executable plans for the robots that\nrespect the high-level assignment. Specifically, we first prune and relax the\nNBA by removing all negative atomic propositions. This step is motivated by\n\"lazy collision checking\" methods in robotics and allows to simplify the\nplanning problem by checking constraint satisfaction only when needed. Then, we\nextract sequences of subtasks from the relaxed NBA along with their temporal\norders, and formulate a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to allocate these\nsubtasks to the robots. Finally, we define generalized multi-robot path\nplanning problems to obtain low-level executable robot plans that satisfy both\nthe high-level task allocation and the temporal constraints captured by the\nnegative atomic propositions in the original NBA.

Additionally, we\ncompare the structural complexity of Fornax galaxies to those in the Virgo\ncluster and in the field. Our sample consists of 582 galaxies from the Fornax\nmain cluster and Fornax A group. We quantified the light distributions of each\ngalaxy based on a combination of aperture photometry, S\\'ersic+PSF (point\nspread function) and multi-component decompositions, and non-parametric\nmeasures of morphology (Concentration $C$; Asymmetry $A$, Clumpiness $S$; Gini\n$G$; second order moment of light $M_{20}$), and structural complexity based on\nmulti-component decompositions. These quantities were then compared between the\nFornax main cluster and Fornax A group. The structural complexity of Fornax\ngalaxies were also compared to those in Virgo and in the field. Overall, we\nfind significant differences in the distributions of quantities derived from\nS\\'ersic profiles ($g'-r'$, $r'-i'$, $R_e$, and $\\bar{\\mu}_{e,r'}$), and\nnon-parametric indices ($A$ and $S$) between the Fornax main cluster and Fornax\nA group.

In recent works\n[RR-9334], we presented the mathematical theory needed to establish the\ndevelopment of compilers and tools for DAE-based physical modeling languages on\nsolid mathematical grounds.At the core of this analysis sits the so-called\n*structural analysis*, whose purpose, at compile time, is to either identify\nunder- and over-specified subsystems (if any), or to rewrite the model in a\nform amenable of existing DAE solvers, including the handling of mode change\nevents. The notion of \"structure\" collects, for each mode and mode change\nevent, the variables and equations involved, as well as the *latent equations*\n(additional equations redundant with the system), needed to prepare the code\nsubmitted to the solver. The notion of DAE *index* (the minimal number of times\nany equation has to be possibly differentiated) is part of this structural\nanalysis. This report complements [RR-9334] by collecting all the needed\nbackground on structural analysis.

In the case of $\\lambda$-calculus translated to\nproof-nets, these inessential details are captured by a notion of equivalence\non $\\lambda$-terms known as $\\simeq_\\sigma$-equivalence, in both the\nintuitionistic (due to Regnier) and classical (due to Laurent) cases. The\npurpose of this paper is to uncover a strong bisimulation behind\n$\\simeq_\\sigma$-equivalence, as formulated by Laurent for Parigot's\n$\\lambda\\mu$-calculus. This is achieved by introducing a relation $\\simeq$,\ndefined over a revised presentation of $\\lambda\\mu$-calculus we dub $\\Lambda\nM$.\n  More precisely, we first identify the reasons behind Laurent's\n$\\simeq_\\sigma$-equivalence on $\\lambda\\mu$-terms failing to be a strong\nbisimulation. Inspired by Laurent's \\emph{Polarized Proof-Nets}, this leads us\nto distinguish multiplicative and exponential reduction steps on terms.

We prove that if the surfaces $X_n$ have a uniform resonance-free region\nin the vicinity of $\\delta$, then the graphs $\\mathcal{G}_n$ form a family of\nexpanders.

We discuss two potential\ninterpretations for the GRB delay: dispersion of light in interstellar medium\nand violation of Lorentz invariance due to quantum gravitational fluctuations.\nAmong a few other media, we consider dispersion of light in an axion plasma,\nobtaining the axion plasma frequency and the dispersion relation from quantum\nfield theory for the first time. We find that the density of axions inferred\nfrom observations is far too low to produce the observed GRB delay. However, a\nmore precise estimation of the spatial distribution of axions is required for a\nconclusive result. Other known media are also unable to account for the GRB\ndelay, although there remains uncertainties in the observations of the delays.\nThe interpretation in terms of Lorentz invariance violation and modified\ndispersion relation suffers from its own problems: since the modification of\nthe dispersion relation should not be dependent on particle type, delays\nbetween photons and neutrinos are hard to explain. Thus neither interpretation\nis sufficient to explain the observations. We conclude that a crucial\ndifference between the two interpretations is the frequency dependence of the\npropagation speed of radiation: in dispersive plasma the group speed increases\nwith higher frequency, while Lorentz invariance violation implies lower speed\nat higher frequency.

Both have distinct observational signatures. We\nanalyse plasma and magnetic processes in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot\nJupiter HAT-P-7b to investigate the formation of a thermal ionosphere and the\npossibility of magnetically coupling the atmospheric gas as the base for an\nextended exosphere. We show which ions and atoms may be used as spectral\ntracers, and if and where conditions for lightning may occur within the clouds\nof HAT-P-7b, evaluate characteristic plasma and magnetic coupling parameters,\nand a LTE radiative transfer is solved for the ionised gas phase. The\nionisation throughout HAT-P-7b's atmosphere varies drastically between day- and\nnightside. The dayside has high levels of thermal ionisation and long-range\nelectromagnetic interactions dominate over kinetic electron-neutral\ninteractions, suggesting a day-night difference in magnetic coupling. K+, Na+,\nLi+, Ca+, and Al+ are more abundant than their atomic counterparts on the\ndayside. The minimum magnetic flux density for electrons for magnetic coupling\nis B<0.5G for all regions of HAT-P-7b's atmosphere. HAT-P-7b's dayside has an\nasymmetric ionosphere that extends deep into the atmosphere, the nightside has\nno thermally driven ionosphere. A corresponding asymmetry is imprinted in the\nion/neutral composition at the terminators. The ionosphere on HAT-P-7b may be\ndirectly traced by the Ca+ H&K lines if the local temperature is > 5000K. The\nwhole atmosphere may couple to a global, large-scale magnetic field, and\nlightning may occur on the nightside.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 18:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

Based on adversarial machine\nlearning, a novel over-the-air attack is introduced to manipulate the RL\nalgorithm and disrupt NextG network slicing. The adversary observes the\nspectrum and builds its own RL based surrogate model that selects which RBs to\njam subject to an energy budget with the objective of maximizing the number of\nfailed requests due to jammed RBs. By jamming the RBs, the adversary reduces\nthe RL algorithm's reward. As this reward is used as the input to update the RL\nalgorithm, the performance does not recover even after the adversary stops\njamming. This attack is evaluated in terms of both the recovery time and the\n(maximum and total) reward loss, and it is shown to be much more effective than\nbenchmark (random and myopic) jamming attacks.

Since 1995, the three universities of this\nregion have formed and maintained a coalition which led to the establishment of\nan interdisciplinary center in 2012, i.e., German Center for Integrative\nBiodiversity Research (iDiv). We investigate whether the impact of the former\ncoalition is evident in the region's structure of scientific collaborations and\nthe scientific output of the new center. Using publications data from\n1996-2018, we build co-authorship networks and identify the most cohesive\ncommunities in terms of collaboration, and compare them with communities\nidentified based on publications presented as the scientific outcome of the\ncoalition and new center on their website. Our results show that despite the\nhighly cohesive structure of collaborations presented on the coalition website,\nthere is still much potential to be realized. The newly established center has\nbridged the member institutions but not to a particularly strong level. We see\nthat geographical proximity, collaboration policies, funding, and\norganizational structure alone do not ensure prosperous scientific\ncollaboration structures. When new center's scientific output is compared with\nits regional context, observed trends become less conspicuous. Nevertheless,\nthe level of success the coalition achieved could inform policy makers\nregarding other regions' scientific development plans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 18:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

In\nparticular, the modeled microstructure evolution, in form of diffusion-based\nand non-diffusional transformations, is a pure consequence of energy and\nmobility competitions among the different species, without the need for\nheuristic transformation criteria as often applied in existing models. The\nmathematically consistent formulation of the evolution equations in rate form\nrenders the model suitable for the practically relevant scenario of\ntemperature- or time-dependent diffusion coefficients, arbitrary temperature\nprofiles, and multiple coexisting phases. Due to its physically motivated\nfoundation, the proposed model requires only a minimal number of free\nparameters, which are determined in an inverse identification process\nconsidering a broad experimental data basis in form of time-temperature\ntransformation diagrams. Subsequently, the predictive ability of the model is\ndemonstrated by means of continuous cooling transformation diagrams, showing\nthat experimentally observed characteristics such as critical cooling rates\nemerge naturally from the proposed microstructure model, instead of being\nenforced as heuristic transformation criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 18:44:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 12:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

The problem that these solutions have\nis a conical singularity along the symmetry axis at all distances from the\norigin. In 1969 Misner proposed a non-singular interpretation of Taub-NUT\nspacetimes. We extend and refine his method to include a broader family of\nsolutions and completely solve the outstanding issue of a non-singular\nextension of the Kerr-NUT- (anti) de Sitter solutions to Einstein's equations.\nOur approach relies on an observation that in 2 dimensional algebra of Killing\nvector fields there exist 2 distinguished vector fields that may be used to\ndefine $U(1)$-principal bundle structure over the non-singular spaces of\nnon-null orbits. For all admissible parameters we derive appropriate Killing\nvector fields and discuss limits to spacetimes with less parameters. The global\nstructure of spacetime, together with non-singular conformal geometry of the\ninfinities is presented and (possibly also projectively non-singular) Killing\nhorizons is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 18:59:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 11:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Methods for visualizing the local\natomic structure, such as atom probe tomography (APT), which routinely generate\ndatasets comprised of millions of atoms, are an important step in realizing\nthis goal. However, state-of-the-art APT instruments generate noisy and sparse\ndatasets that provide information about elemental type, but obscure atomic\nstructures, thus limiting their subsequent value for materials discovery. The\napplication of a materials fingerprinting process, a machine learning algorithm\ncoupled with topological data analysis, provides an avenue by which\nhere-to-fore unprecedented structural information can be extracted from an APT\ndataset. As a proof of concept, the material fingerprint is applied to\nhigh-entropy alloy APT datasets containing body-centered cubic (BCC) and\nface-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structures. A local atomic configuration\ncentered on an arbitrary atom is assigned a topological descriptor, with which\nit can be characterized as a BCC or FCC lattice with near perfect accuracy,\ndespite the inherent noise in the dataset.

Discs that are misaligned to the black hole spin can become\nwarped over time by Lense-Thirring precession. Recent work has shown that\nstrongly warped discs can become unstable, causing the disc to break into\ndiscrete rings producing a more dynamic and variable accretion flow. In a\ncompanion paper, we present numerical simulations of this instability and the\nresulting dynamics. In this paper, we discuss the implications of this dynamics\nfor accreting black hole systems, with particular focus on the variability of\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We discuss the timescales on which variability\nmight manifest, and the impact of the observer orientation with respect to the\nblack hole spin axis. When the disc warp is unstable near the inner edge of the\ndisc, we find quasi periodic behaviour of the inner disc which may explain the\nrecent quasi periodic eruptions observed in, for example, the Seyfert 2 galaxy\nGSN 069 and in the galactic nucleus of RX J1301.9+2747. These eruptions are\nthought to be similar to the `heartbeat' modes observed in some X-ray binaries\n(e.g. GRS 1915+105 and IGR J17091-3624). When the instability manifests at\nlarger radii in the disc, we find that the central accretion rate can vary on\ntimescales that may be commensurate with, e.g., changing-look AGN. We therefore\nsuggest that some of the variability properties of accreting black hole systems\nmay be explained by the disc being significantly warped, leading to disc\ntearing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 19:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

The\nsecond important feature is the calculation of cost and constraints functions\ngradients with the help of adjoint equations. The adjoint equations presented\nin the paper take into account sliding motion and exhibit jump conditions at\ntransition instants. The procedure uses the discretization of system equations\nby Radau IIA Runge--Kutta scheme and the evaluation of optimization functions\ngradients with the help of the adjoint equations stated for discretized system\nequations.

Many efficient bounding algorithms have\nbeen presented recently, but they are often too loose to verify more\nchallenging properties. This is due to the weakness of the employed relaxation,\nwhich is usually a linear program of size linear in the number of neurons.\nWhile a tighter linear relaxation for piecewise-linear activations exists, it\ncomes at the cost of exponentially many constraints and currently lacks an\nefficient customized solver. We alleviate this deficiency by presenting two\nnovel dual algorithms: one operates a subgradient method on a small active set\nof dual variables, the other exploits the sparsity of Frank-Wolfe type\noptimizers to incur only a linear memory cost.

In our work, we\ncontribute a comprehensive formal analysis of the shift equivariance properties\nof encoder-decoder-style CNNs, which yields a clear picture of what can and\ncannot be achieved with metric learning in the face of same-looking objects. In\nparticular, we prove that a standard encoder-decoder network that takes\n$d$-dimensional images as input, with $l$ pooling layers and pooling factor\n$f$, has the capacity to distinguish at most $f^{dl}$ same-looking objects, and\nwe show that this upper limit can be reached.

In this manuscript, we analyze the role\nthat plasticity rules play on the changes that lead to a better performance of\nRC. To this end, we implement synaptic and non-synaptic plasticity rules in a\nparadigmatic example of RC model: the Echo State Network. Testing on nonlinear\ntime series prediction tasks, we show evidence that improved performance in all\nplastic models are linked to a decrease of the pair-wise correlations in the\nreservoir, as well as a significant increase of individual neurons ability to\nseparate similar inputs in their activity space. Here we provide new insights\non this observed improvement through the study of different stages on the\nplastic learning. From the perspective of the reservoir dynamics, optimal\nperformance is found to occur close to the so-called edge of instability.

Such services thrive\non their ability to predict future contexts to pre-fetch content or make\ncontext-specific recommendations. An increasingly common method to predict\nfuture contexts, such as location, is via machine learning (ML) models. Recent\nwork in context prediction has focused on ML model personalization where a\npersonalized model is learned for each individual user in order to tailor\npredictions or recommendations to a user's mobile behavior. While the use of\npersonalized models increases efficacy of the mobile service, we argue that it\nincreases privacy risk since a personalized model encodes contextual behavior\nunique to each user.

Our large scale experiment on 51\nsoftware projects shows that using global data improves BugLocator on average\n6.6% and 4.8% in terms of MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) and MAP (Mean Average\nPrecision), with over 14% in a majority (64% and 54% in terms of MRR and MAP,\nrespectively) of the cases. This amount of improvement is significant compared\nto the improvement rates that five other state-of-the-art IRFL tools provide\nover BugLocator. In addition, training the models globally is a one-time\noffline task with no overhead on BugLocator's run-time fault localization. Our\nstudy, however, shows that a Word Embedding-based global solution did not\nfurther improve the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 20:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

In addition, it is often prohibited for service providers to\nverify the quality of data samples due to the increasing concern of user data\nprivacy. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing Auto-weighted\nRobust Federated Learning (arfl), a novel approach that jointly learns the\nglobal model and the weights of local updates to provide robustness against\ncorrupted data sources. We prove a learning bound on the expected risk with\nrespect to the predictor and the weights of clients, which guides the\ndefinition of the objective for robust federated learning. The weights are\nallocated by comparing the empirical loss of a client with the average loss of\nthe best p clients (p-average), thus we can downweight the clients with\nsignificantly high losses, thereby lower their contributions to the global\nmodel. We show that this approach achieves robustness when the data of\ncorrupted clients is distributed differently from benign ones.

We show\nthat the nature of the lasing mode is dictated by the gain-layer thickness.\nMoreover, by explicitly treating gain in our waveguide model, we find that,\ncontrary to conventional wisdom, a gap layer with high refractive index is\nadvantageous for plasmonic lasing. Additionally, our rate-equation model\nreveals a regime where plasmonic and photonic modes compete within the same\ndevice, raising the possibility of facile, active mode switching. These\nfindings provide guidance for future designs of metallic lasers and could lead\nto on-chip lasers with controlled photonic and plasmonic output, switchable at\nhigh speeds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 21:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

The reduced basis method (RBM) presents itself as such\nan option. RBM features a mathematically rigorous error estimator which drives\nthe construction of a low-dimensional subspace. A surrogate solution is then\nsought in this low-dimensional space approximating the parameter-induced high\nfidelity solution manifold. However when the system is nonlinear or its\nparameter dependence nonaffine, this efficiency gain degrades tremendously, an\ninherent drawback of the application of the empirical interpolation method\n(EIM).\n  In this paper, we augment and extend the EIM approach as a direct solver, as\nopposed to an assistant, for solving nonlinear partial differential equations\non the reduced level. The resulting method, called Reduced Over-Collocation\nmethod (ROC), is stable and capable of avoiding the efficiency degradation. Two\ncritical ingredients of the scheme are collocation at about twice as many\nlocations as the number of basis elements for the reduced approximation space,\nand an efficient error indicator for the strategic building of the reduced\nsolution space. The latter, the main contribution of this paper, results from\nan adaptive hyper reduction of the residuals for the reduced solution.\nTogether, these two ingredients render the proposed R2-ROC scheme both offline-\nand online-efficient. A distinctive feature is that the efficiency degradation\nappearing in traditional RBM approaches that utilize EIM for nonlinear and\nnonaffine problems is circumvented, both in the offline and online stages.\nNumerical tests on different families of time-dependent and steady-state\nnonlinear problems demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy of our R2-ROC\nand its superior stability performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 23:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

The computational\ncomplexity of describing the Kohn-Sham orbitals is replaced by introducing a\nset of random (stochastic) orbitals leading to linear and often sub-linear\nscaling of certain ground-state observable at the account of introducing a\nstatistical error. Schemes to reduce the noise are essential, for example, for\ndetermining the structure using the forces obtained from sDFT. Recently we have\nintroduced two embedding schemes to mitigate the statistical fluctuations in\nthe electron density and resultant forces on the nuclei. Both techniques were\nbased on fragmenting the system either in real-space or slicing the occupied\nspace into energy windows, allowing for a significant reduction of the\nstatistical fluctuations. For chemical accuracy further reduction of the noise\nis required, which could be achieved by increasing the number of stochastic\norbitals. However, the convergence is relatively slow as the statistical error\nscales as $1/\\sqrt{N_\\chi}$ according to the central limit theorem, where\n$N_\\chi$ is the number of random orbitals. In this paper we combined the\naforementioned embedding schemes and introduced a new approach that builds on\noverlapped fragments and energy windows.

Unlike the case in conventional radio-frequency wireless systems,\nthe VLC channel is not isotropic, meaning that the device orientation affects\nthe channel gain significantly. In addition, due to the use of optical\nfrequency bands, the presence of different obstacles (e.g., walls, human\nbodies, furniture) may easily block the VLC links. One solution to overcome\nthese issues is the integration of the intelligent reflective surface (IRS),\nwhich is a new and revolutionizing technology that has the potential to\nsignificantly improve the performance of wireless networks. IRS is capable of\nsmartly reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment with the use of\nmassive low-cost passive reflecting elements integrated on a planar surface.

To solve\nthis problem, recent advances unleash DNN services using the edge computing\nparadigm. The existing approaches split a DNN into two parts and deploy the two\npartitions to computation nodes at two edge computing tiers.

A key example is the\ncelebrated formula of Berg and Purcell for the rate that cell surface receptors\ncapture extracellular molecules. Indeed, this influential result is only valid\nif receptors transport molecules through the cell wall at a rate much faster\nthan molecules arrive at receptors. From a mathematical perspective, ignoring\nreceptor kinetics is convenient because it makes the diffusing molecules\nindependent.

Many companies that deploy AI publicly state that when training a model,\nwe not only need to improve its accuracy, but also need to guarantee that the\nmodel does not discriminate against users (fairness), is resilient to noisy or\npoisoned data (robustness), is explainable, and more.

We thus propose three key research\ndirections towards this vision - depth, breadth, and usability - to measure\nprogress and introduce our ongoing research. First, responsible AI must be\ndeeply supported where multiple objectives like fairness and robust must be\nhandled together.

Previous works in this area depend on\neither network node identities or rich edge attributes and typically fail to\nextract these laws.

In\nthis paper, we address the problem of enhancing corrupted speech signal from\nvideos by using audio-visual (AV) neural processing. Most of recent AV speech\nenhancement approaches separately process the acoustic and visual features and\nfuse them via a simple concatenation operation. Although this strategy is\nconvenient and easy to implement, it comes with two major drawbacks: 1)\nevidence in speech perception suggests that in humans the AV integration occurs\nat a very early stage, in contrast to previous models that process the two\nmodalities separately at early stage and combine them only at a later stage,\nthus making the system less robust, and 2) a simple concatenation does not\nallow to control how the information from the acoustic and the visual\nmodalities is treated. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a multi-layer\nfeature fusion convolution network (MFFCN), which separately process acoustic\nand visual modalities for preserving each modality features while fusing both\nmodalities' features layer by layer in encoding phase for enjoying the human AV\nspeech perception. In addition, considering the balance between the two\nmodalities, we design channel and spectral attention mechanisms to provide\nadditional flexibility in dealing with different types of information expanding\nthe representational ability of the convolution neural network.

Spectral variability on intraday timescales is estimated\nusing the hardness ratio.

The key to the Question Answering task is semantic feature\ninteraction between documents and questions, which is widely processed by\nBi-directional Attention Flow (Bi-DAF), but Bi-DAF generally captures only the\nsurface semantics of words in complex questions and fails to capture implied\nsemantic feature of intermediate answers. As a result, Bi-DAF partially ignores\npart of the contexts related to the question and cannot extract the most\nimportant parts of multiple documents. In this paper we propose a new model\narchitecture for multi-hop question answering, by applying two completion\nstrategies: (1) Coarse-Grain complex question Decomposition (CGDe) strategy are\nintroduced to decompose complex question into simple ones under the condition\nof without any additional annotations (2) Fine-Grained Interaction (FGIn)\nstrategy are introduced to better represent each word in the document and\nextract more comprehensive and accurate sentences related to the inference\npath. The above two strategies are combined and tested on the SQuAD and\nHotpotQA datasets, and the experimental results show that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 06:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

All the data used for the training/validation of the\nnetwork and to generate ground truth (GT) maps, using a state-of-the-art\ndeconvolution-algorithm, were previously pre-processed using a standard\npipeline.

These networks are trained to map random inputs in\ntheir latent space to new samples representative of the learned data. However,\nthe structure of the latent space is hard to intuit due to its high\ndimensionality and the non-linearity of the generator, which limits the\nusefulness of the models. Understanding the latent space requires a way to\nidentify input codes for existing real-world images (inversion), and a way to\nidentify directions with known image transformations (interpretability). Here,\nwe use a geometric framework to address both issues simultaneously. We develop\nan architecture-agnostic method to compute the Riemannian metric of the image\nmanifold created by GANs. The eigen-decomposition of the metric isolates axes\nthat account for different levels of image variability. An empirical analysis\nof several pretrained GANs shows that image variation around each position is\nconcentrated along surprisingly few major axes (the space is highly\nanisotropic) and the directions that create this large variation are similar at\ndifferent positions in the space (the space is homogeneous). We show that many\nof the top eigenvectors correspond to interpretable transforms in the image\nspace, with a substantial part of eigenspace corresponding to minor transforms\nwhich could be compressed out.

Subsequently, observations reveal progressive\nhomogenization of salinity and relaxation of sea-level anomalies and salinity\ngradients within a month. In particular, salty water spirals in, and freshwater\nis pulled out across the eddy boundary. Lagrangian experiments elucidate this\nprocess, whereby horizontal chaotic mixing provides a mechanism for the rapid\nincrease in surface salinity on the order of timescale of a month. This pathway\nis distinct from vertical mixing and likely to be important in the eddy-rich\nBay of Bengal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 10:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

In specific application\nareas, dedicated contract theories formalise the notion of contract and the\noperations on contracts in a manner that supports best the development of\nsystems in that area. At the other end, contract meta-theories attempt to\nprovide a systematic view on the various contract theories by axiomatising\ntheir desired properties. However, there exists a noticeable gap between the\nmost well-known contract meta-theory of Benveniste et al., which focuses on the\ndesign of embedded and cyber-physical systems, and the established way of using\ncontracts when developing general software, following Meyer's\ndesign-by-contract methodology. At the core of this gap appears to be the\nnotion of procedure: while it is a central unit of composition in software\ndevelopment, the meta-theory does not suggest an obvious way of treating\nprocedures as components.\n  In this paper, we provide a first step towards a contract theory that takes\nprocedures as the basic building block, and is at the same time an\ninstantiation of the meta-theory. To this end, we propose an abstract contract\ntheory for sequential programming languages with procedures, based on\ndenotational semantics. We show that, on the one hand, the specification of\ncontracts of procedures in Hoare logic, and their procedure-modular\nverification, can be cast naturally in the framework of our abstract contract\ntheory. On the other hand, we also show our contract theory to fulfil the\naxioms of the meta-theory. In this way, we give further evidence for the\nutility of the meta-theory, and prepare the ground for combining our\ninstantiation with other, already existing instantiations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 13:02:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 08:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

During the evolution of\nan outbreak, various non-pharmaceutical interventions are employed, the impact\nof which is frequently assessed by the reduction that they introduce to the\neffective reproduction number Rt; reduction below 1 is an indication of\neventual dying out of the disease spread. Motivated by the fact that R0\nessentially expresses the stability of the disease-free equilibrium, in this\nwork, Rt was examined in the view of timescale analysis. It was shown that\nduring the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, when various\ninterventions were in place, Rt had a clear relation with the explosive\ntimescale characterizing the dynamics of the outbreak. In particular, it is\nshown that the existence of an explosive timescale during the progression of\nthe epidemics implies Rt > 1, while its absence implies Rt < 1. In addition, as\nthis timescale converges/diverges with the immediately slowest one, Rt\napproaches to/withdraws from its threshold value 1. These results suggest that\ntimescale analysis can be utilized for the assessment of the impact of various\ninterventions, since it reflects the insight provided by the effective\nreproduction number, without being hindered by the selection of the population\nmodel, nor the parameter estimation process followed for model calibration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 13:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

A promising approach is the use of graph embeddings for ER in order to\ndetermine the similarity of entities based on the similarity of their graph\nneighborhood. The similarity computations for such embeddings translates to\ncalculating the distance between them in the embedding space which is\ncomparatively simple. However, previous work has shown that the use of graph\nembeddings alone is not sufficient to achieve high ER quality.

While viewpoint diversity\nis often considered synonymous with source diversity in communication science\ndomain, in this paper, we take a computational view. We operationalize the\nnotion of framing, adopted from communication science. We apply this notion to\na re-ranking of topic-relevant recommended lists, to form the basis of a novel\nviewpoint diversification method. Our offline evaluation indicates that the\nproposed method is capable of enhancing the viewpoint diversity of\nrecommendation lists according to a diversity metric from literature. In an\nonline study, on the Blendle platform, a Dutch news aggregator platform, with\nmore than 2000 users, we found that users are willing to consume viewpoint\ndiverse news recommendations. We also found that presentation characteristics\nsignificantly influence the reading behaviour of diverse recommendations.

Therefore,\nsecure communication and software state assurance (at run-time and boot-time)\nof the device has emerged as open security problems. Furthermore, these devices\nneed to have an appropriate recovery mechanism to bring them back to the\nknown-good operational state.

A key challenge in this learning paradigm is catastrophically\nforgetting previously learned tasks when the agent faces a new one. Current\nrehearsal-based methods show their success in mitigating the catastrophic\nforgetting problem by replaying samples from previous tasks during learning a\nnew one. However, these methods are infeasible when the data of previous tasks\nis not accessible. In this work, we propose a new pseudo-rehearsal-based\nmethod, named learning Invariant Representation for Continual Learning (IRCL),\nin which class-invariant representation is disentangled from a conditional\ngenerative model and jointly used with class-specific representation to learn\nthe sequential tasks. Disentangling the shared invariant representation helps\nto learn continually a sequence of tasks, while being more robust to forgetting\nand having better knowledge transfer. We focus on class incremental learning\nwhere there is no knowledge about task identity during inference. We\nempirically evaluate our proposed method on two well-known benchmarks for\ncontinual learning: split MNIST and split Fashion MNIST.

X-rays emitted from the central young stellar\nobject (YSO) that irradiate interstellar ices in the disk, followed by the\nejection of molecules in the gas phase, are a possible route to explain the\nabundances observed in the cold regions. This process, known as X-ray\nphotodesorption, needs to be quantified for methanol-containing ices. This\npaper I focuses on the case of X-ray photodesorption from pure methanol ices.\nWe aim at experimentally measuring X-ray photodesorption yields of methanol and\nits photo-products from pure CH$_3$OH ices, and to shed light on the mechanisms\nresponsible for the desorption process. We irradiated methanol ices at 15 K\nwith X-rays in the 525 - 570 eV range. The release of species in the gas phase\nwas monitored by quadrupole mass spectrometry, and photodesorption yields were\nderived. Under our experimental conditions, the CH$_3$OH X-ray photodesorption\nyield from pure methanol ice is 10$^{-2}$ molecule/photon at 564 eV.\nPhoto-products such as CH$_4$, H$_2$CO, H$_2$O, CO$_2$ , and CO also desorb at\nincreasing efficiency. X-ray photodesorption of larger COMs, which can be\nattributed to either ethanol, dimethyl ether, and/or formic acid, is also\ndetected. The physical mechanisms at play are discussed and must likely involve\nthe thermalization of Auger electrons in the ice, thus indicating that its\ncomposition plays an important role. Finally, we provide desorption yields\napplicable to protoplanetary disk environments for astrochemical models. The\nX-rays are shown to be a potential candidate to explain gas-phase abundances of\nmethanol in disks. However, more relevant desorption yields derived from\nexperiments on mixed ices are mandatory to properly support the role played by\nX-rays in nonthermal desorption of methanol (see paper II).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 15:40:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 08:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-22"}

This situation is especially worse\nin India with the second largest load of COVID-19 cases and a relatively\nresource-scarce medical infrastructure. Therefore, it becomes essential to\ntriage the patients based on the severity of their disease and devote resources\ntowards critically ill patients. Yan et al. 1 have published a very pertinent\nresearch that uses Machine learning (ML) methods to predict the outcome of\nCOVID-19 patients based on their clinical parameters at the day of admission.\nThey used the XGBoost algorithm, a type of ensemble model, to build the\nmortality prediction model. The final classifier is built through the\nsequential addition of multiple weak classifiers. The clinically operable\ndecision rule was obtained from a 'single-tree XGBoost' and used lactic\ndehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein\n(hs-CRP) values. This decision tree achieved a 100% survival prediction and 81%\nmortality prediction. However, these models have several technical challenges\nand do not provide an out of the box solution that can be deployed for other\npopulations as has been reported in the \"Matters Arising\" section of Yan et al.\nHere, we show the limitations of this model by deploying it on one of the\nlargest datasets of COVID-19 patients containing detailed clinical parameters\ncollected from India.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 07:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

X-rays emitted from the central young stellar\nobject (YSO) that irradiate interstellar ices in the disk, followed by the\nejection of molecules in the gas phase, are a possible route to explain the\nabundances observed in the cold regions. This process, known as X-ray\nphotodesorption, needs to be quantified for methanol-containing ices. We aim at\nexperimentally measuring X-ray photodesorption yields of methanol and its\nphoto-products from binary mixed ices: $^{13}$CO:CH$_3$OH ice and\nH$_2$O:CH$_3$OH ice. We irradiated these ices at 15 K with X-rays in the 525 -\n570 eV range. The release of species in the gas phase was monitored by\nquadrupole mass spectrometry, and photodesorption yields were derived. For\n$^{13}$CO:CH$_3$OH ice, CH$_3$OH X-ray photodesorption yield is estimated to be\n10$^{-2}$ molecule/photon at 564 eV. X-ray photodesorption of larger COMs,\nwhich can be attributed to either ethanol, dimethyl ether, and/or formic acid,\nis detected with a yield of 10$^{-3}$ molecule/photon. When methanol is mixed\nwith water, X-ray photodesorption of methanol and of the previous COMs is not\ndetected. X-ray induced chemistry, dominated by low-energy secondary electrons,\nis found to be the main mechanism that explains these results. We also provide\ndesorption yields that are applicable to protoplanetary disk environments for\nastrochemical models.

This allows us to establish the ranges of validity of\nthese approximations and to achieve a better understanding of their effects on\nthe studied system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 15:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

A giga\nfine-structure constant NI*alpha characterizes various properties of the\nsoliton, in which NI ~ 3 * 10^10 is the instanton number. A hierarchy of\nphotonic solitons is classified into six flavours, i.e., three generations in\neach of two homotopy classes. The underdoped metallic heterostructure contains\ntwo topologically distinct sectors. When the gama-dopant filling factor > 0.88,\nthe nontrivial sector becomes a chiral superfluid at T >> 300 K to provide a\ngama-clock Q-factor > 10^27 for some decades, while the trivial sector becomes\na superconductor below 9.3 K. Distinct soliton flavours carrying Kopnin masses\n> 14 PeV, Majorana mass < 36 aeV, and nuclear B > 35000 T imply a range of\npossible applications, e.g., topological quantum computation and the detection\nof invisible particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 10:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}
