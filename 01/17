At the point of\nmaximum wind, E-PI's key equation relates proportionally the centrifugal\nacceleration (squared maximum velocity divided by radius) to the radial\ngradient of saturated moist entropy. The proportionality coefficient depends on\nthe outflow temperature. Here it is shown that a different relationship between\nthe same quantities derives straightforwardly from the gradient-wind balance\nand the definition of entropy, with the proportionality coefficient depending\non the radial gradient of local air temperature. The robust alternative reveals\na previously unexplored constraint: for E-PI to be valid, the outflow\ntemperature should be a function of the radial temperature gradient at the\npoint of maximum wind. When the air is horizontally isothermal (which, as we\nargue, is not an uncommon condition), this constraint cannot be satisfied, and\nE-PI's key equation underestimates the squared maximum velocity by\napproximately twofold. This explains \"superintensity\" (maximum wind speeds\nexceeding E-PI). The new formulation predicts less superintensity at higher\ntemperatures, corroborating recent numerical simulations. Previous analyses are\nre-evaluated to reveal inconsistent support for the explanation of\nsuperintensity by supergradient winds alone. In Hurricane Isabel 2003, maximum\nsuperintensity is found to be associated with minimal gradient-wind imbalance.\nModified to diagnostically account for supergradient winds, the new formulation\nshows that air temperature increasing towards the storm center can mask the\neffect of gradient-wind imbalance, thus reducing \"superintensity\" and formally\nbringing E-PI closer to observations.

All\nnon-dominated network architectures obtained by the proposed method are then\nfully trained against randomly chosen adversarial attacks and tested on two\nwidely used datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of\noptimized neural architectures found by the proposed approach over\nstate-of-the-art networks that are widely used in the literature in terms of\nthe classification accuracy under different adversarial attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2021 19:38:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

Here,\nwe present a framework based on statistical physics to study dynamics of\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) that drives learning in neural networks. By\nusing the minibatch gradient ensemble, we construct order parameters to\ncharacterize dynamics of weight updates in SGD. Without mislabeled data, we\nfind that the SGD learning dynamics transitions from a fast learning phase to a\nslow exploration phase, which is associated with large changes in order\nparameters that characterize the alignment of SGD gradients and their mean\namplitude. In the case with randomly mislabeled samples, SGD learning dynamics\nfalls into four distinct phases. The system first finds solutions for the\ncorrectly labeled samples in phase I, it then wanders around these solutions in\nphase II until it finds a direction to learn the mislabeled samples during\nphase III, after which it finds solutions that satisfy all training samples\nduring phase IV. Correspondingly, the test error decreases during phase I and\nremains low during phase II; however, it increases during phase III and reaches\na high plateau during phase IV. The transitions between different phases can be\nunderstood by changes of order parameters that characterize the alignment of\nmean gradients for the correctly and incorrectly labeled samples and their\n(relative) strength during learning. We find that individual sample losses for\nthe two datasets are most separated during phase II, which leads to a cleaning\nprocess to eliminate mislabeled samples for improving generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2021 19:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

Slot\nfilling is one of the most important challenges in modern task-oriented dialog\nsystems. Supervised learning approaches have proven effective at tackling this\nchallenge, but they need a significant amount of labeled training data in a\ngiven domain. However, new domains (i.e., unseen in training) may emerge after\ndeployment. Thus, it is imperative that these models seamlessly adapt and fill\nslots from both seen and unseen domains -- unseen domains contain unseen slot\ntypes with no training data, and even seen slots in unseen domains are\ntypically presented in different contexts. This setting is commonly referred to\nas zero-shot slot filling. Little work has focused on this setting, with\nlimited experimental evaluation. Existing models that mainly rely on\ncontext-independent embedding-based similarity measures fail to detect slot\nvalues in unseen domains or do so only partially. We propose a new zero-shot\nslot filling neural model, LEONA, which works in three steps. Step one acquires\ndomain-oblivious, context-aware representations of the utterance word by\nexploiting (a) linguistic features; (b) named entity recognition cues; (c)\ncontextual embeddings from pre-trained language models. Step two fine-tunes\nthese rich representations and produces slot-independent tags for each word.\nStep three exploits generalizable context-aware utterance-slot similarity\nfeatures at the word level, uses slot-independent tags, and contextualizes them\nto produce slot-specific predictions for each word.

Also, many times due to human error or other\nunavoidable natural factors such as thunder strikes or landslides, the\nalgorithm may end up raising a false alarm. This work focuses on detecting\nearthquakes by converting seismograph recorded data into corresponding audio\nsignals for better perception and then uses popular Speech Recognition\ntechniques of Filter bank coefficients and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients\n(MFCC) to extract the features. These features were then used to train a\nConvolutional Neural Network(CNN) and a Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) network.\nThe proposed method can overcome the above-mentioned problems and help in\ndetecting earthquakes automatically from the waveforms without much human\nintervention. For the 1000Hz audio data set the CNN model showed a testing\naccuracy of 91.1% for 0.2-second sample window length while the LSTM model\nshowed 93.99% for the same.

This\nshows the effectiveness of the proposed method for Earthquake Early Warning\n(EEW) applications.

The dynamic\ncurrant-voltage (I-V-) loops of thin TGS plates of polar (010) cut with\ndissimilar electrodes on the opposite surfaces (vacuum deposited Ag and\nAg-paste diluted with a water-ethanol mixture) are investigated. After\nelectroforming in the low-voltage vicinity of coercive voltage, during further\ncycling, a reversible transformation of I-V-loop shape occurs from typical of\nnon-linear dielectrics to typical of memristive systems and than to typical of\nferroelectrics (and vice versa) with a sequential increase (decrease) of\ndrawing voltage amplitude.

While regular GB disconnections have been characterized for a variety of\ninterfaces, GB phase junctions formed by GBs with different structures and\ndifferent numbers of excess atoms have not been previously studied. We apply a\ngeneral Burgers circuit analysis to calculate the Burgers vectors b of\njunctions in two {\\Sigma}5 Cu boundaries previously simulated with molecular\ndynamics. The Burgers vectors of these junctions cannot be described by the\ndisplacement shift complete (DSC) lattice alone. We show that, in general, the\nnormal component of b is not equal to the difference in the GB excess volumes,\nbut contains another contribution from the numbers of GB atoms per unit area\n{\\Delta}N required to transform one GB phase into another. In the boundaries\nstudied, the latter component dominates and even changes the sign of b. We\nderive expressions for the normal and tangential components of b in terms of\nthe DSC lattice vectors and the non-DSC part due to {\\Delta}N and additional GB\nexcess properties, including excess volume and shears. These expressions\nprovide a connection between GB phase transformations driven by the GB free\nenergy difference and the motion of GB junctions under applied normal and shear\nstresses. The proposed analysis quantifies b and therefore makes it possible to\ncalculate the elastic part of the energy of these defects, evaluate their\ncontribution to the nucleation barrier during GB phase transformations, and\ntreat elastic interactions with other defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2021 02:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Recent studies of active galactic nuclei with moderate radio\nand low optical luminosities (Fanaroff & Riley class I, FR I) searching for\nbroad nuclear emission lines in polarized light, as predicted by some active\ngalactic nucleus unification models, have found heterogeneous results. These\nmodels typically consist of a central engine surrounded by a torus of discrete\ndusty clouds. These clouds would absorb and scatter optical emission, blocking\nbroad nuclear emission lines, and reradiate in mid-infrared. Some scattered\nbroad-line emission may be observable, depending on geometry, which would be\npolarized. We present a wide-band infrared spectroscopic analysis of 10 nearby\nFR I radio galaxies to determine whether there is significant emission from a\ndusty obscuring structure. We used Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms to\ndecompose Spitzer/IRS spectra of our sample. We constrained the wide-band\nbehavior of our models with photometry from the Two Micron All Sky Survey,\nSpitzer/IRAC, Spitzer/MIPS, and Herschel/SPIRE.

Over decades, TSE\napproaches bifurcate into two main categories, model-driven approaches and\ndata-driven approaches. However, each of them has limitations: the former\nhighly relies on existing physical traffic flow models, such as\nLighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) models, which may only capture limited\ndynamics of real-world traffic, resulting in low-quality estimation, while the\nlatter requires massive data in order to perform accurate and generalizable\nestimation. To mitigate the limitations, this paper introduces a\nphysics-informed deep learning (PIDL) framework to efficiently conduct\nhigh-quality TSE with small amounts of observed data.

Using a large\ndata sample of Atlantic tropical cyclones, we formally examine the composite\nsynoptic-scale patterns associated with tangential and \\curvature components of\ntheir acceleration. During periods of rapid tangential acceleration, the\ncomposite tropical cyclone moves poleward between an upstream trough and\ndownstream ridge of a developing extratropical wavepacket. The two systems\nsubsequently merge in a manner that is consistent with extratropical\ntransition. During rapid curvature acceleration, a prominent downstream ridge\npromotes recurvature of the tropical cyclone. In contrast, during rapid\ntangential or curvature deceleration, a ridge is located directly poleward of\nthe tropical cyclone.

On average,\nthe tangential acceleration peaks 18 hours prior to extratropical transition\nwhile the curvature acceleration peaks at recurvature.

Once the\nWeissenberg number exceeds a critical value, an unsteady motion downstream of\nthe sphere is observed in the case of two-species model.

To achieve a good trade-off between model size and\nperformance, popular pruning techniques usually rely on hand-crafted heuristics\nand require manually setting the compression ratio for each layer. This process\nis typically time-consuming and requires expert knowledge to achieve good\nresults. In this paper, we propose NAP, a unified and automatic pruning\nframework for both fine-grained and structured pruning. It can find out\nunimportant components of a network and automatically decide appropriate\ncompression ratios for different layers, based on a theoretically sound\ncriterion. Towards this goal, NAP uses an efficient approximation of the\nHessian for evaluating the importances of components, based on a\nKronecker-factored Approximate Curvature method. Despite its simpleness to use,\nNAP outperforms previous pruning methods by large margins. For fine-grained\npruning, NAP can compress AlexNet and VGG16 by 25x, and ResNet-50 by 6.7x\nwithout loss in accuracy on ImageNet.

This framework turns the traditional view of perception upside down,\nclaiming that the main flow of information processing is realized in a top-down\nhierarchical manner. Furthermore, it aims at unifying perception, cognition,\nand action as a single inferential process. However, in the related literature,\nthe predictive processing framework and its associated schemes such as\npredictive coding, active inference, perceptual inference, free-energy\nprinciple, tend to be used interchangeably.\n  In the field of cognitive robotics there is no clear-cut distinction on which\nschemes have been implemented and under which assumptions. In this paper,\nworking definitions are set with the main aim of analyzing the state of the art\nin cognitive robotics research working under the predictive processing\nframework as well as some related non-robotic models.\n  The analysis suggests that, first, both research in cognitive robotics\nimplementations and non-robotic models needs to be extended to the study of how\nmultiple exteroceptive modalities can be integrated into prediction error\nminimization schemes. Second, a relevant distinction found here is that\ncognitive robotics implementations tend to emphasize the learning of a\ngenerative model, while in non-robotics models it is almost absent. Third,\ndespite the relevance for active inference, few cognitive robotics\nimplementations examine the issues around control and whether it should result\nfrom the substitution of inverse models with proprioceptive predictions.\n  Finally, limited attention has been placed on precision weighting and the\ntracking of prediction error dynamics.

The bulk viscosity is reduced by both the two effects,\nespecially the superfluid effect at low temperatures which is also able to\nreduce the inferred core temperature of NSs.

However, existing publicly available datasets used in\nfacial landmark localization are usually much smaller than those for other\ncomputer vision tasks. A small dataset without diverse and balanced training\nsamples cannot support the training of a deep network effectively. To address\nthe above issues, this paper presents a novel Separable Batch Normalization\n(SepBN) module with a Cross-protocol Network Training (CNT) strategy for robust\nfacial landmark localization. Different from the standard BN layer that uses\nall the training data to calculate a single set of parameters, SepBN considers\nthat the samples of a training dataset may belong to different sub-domains.\nAccordingly, the proposed SepBN module uses multiple sets of parameters, each\ncorresponding to a specific sub-domain. However, the selection of an\nappropriate branch in the inference stage remains a challenging task because\nthe sub-domain of a test sample is unknown. To mitigate this difficulty, we\npropose a novel attention mechanism that assigns different weights to each\nbranch for automatic selection in an effective style. As a further innovation,\nthe proposed CNT strategy trains a network using multiple datasets having\ndifferent facial landmark annotation systems, boosting the performance and\nenhancing the generalization capacity of the trained network. The experimental\nresults obtained on several well-known datasets demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2021 13:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

Pruning for dense labeling applications is still a largely unexplored\nfield. The prevailing filter channel pruning method removes the entire filter\nchannel. Accordingly, the interaction between each kernel in one filter channel\nis ignored.\n  In this study, we proposed kernel cluster pruning (KCP) to prune dense\nlabeling networks. We developed a clustering technique to identify the least\nrepresentational kernels in each layer. By iteratively removing those kernels,\nthe parameter that can better represent the entire network is preserved; thus,\nwe achieve better accuracy with a decent model size and computation reduction.\nWhen evaluated on stereo matching and semantic segmentation neural networks,\nour method can reduce more than 70% of FLOPs with less than 1% of accuracy\ndrop.

Recently, machine learning approaches, especially deep\nlearning algorithms, have been used to perform computer-aided lesion\ncharacterization of glomeruli. However, one major challenge of developing such\nmethods is the naturally imbalanced distribution of different lesions. In this\npaper, we propose CircleMix, a novel data augmentation technique, to improve\nthe accuracy of classifying globally sclerotic glomeruli with a hierarchical\nlearning strategy. Different from the recently proposed CutMix method, the\nCircleMix augmentation is optimized for the ball-shaped biomedical objects,\nsuch as glomeruli. 6,861 glomeruli with five classes (normal, periglomerular\nfibrosis, obsolescent glomerulosclerosis, solidified glomerulosclerosis, and\ndisappearing glomerulosclerosis) were employed to develop and evaluate the\nproposed methods. From five-fold cross-validation, the proposed CircleMix\naugmentation achieved superior performance (Balanced Accuracy=73.0%) compared\nwith the EfficientNet-B0 baseline (Balanced Accuracy=69.4%)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2021 22:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

The game is\nvery interesting because there are exactly $n$ restaurants and each restaurant\ncan accommodate only one agent.

The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 (in particular the receptor binding\ndomain, RBD) to its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the\nantibodies is of great importance in understanding the infectivity of COVID-19\nand evaluating the candidate therapeutic for COVID-19. In this work, we propose\na new method based on molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area\n(MM/PBSA) to accurately calculate the free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to\nACE2 and antibodies. The calculated binding free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to\nACE2 is -13.3 kcal/mol, and that of SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2 is -11.4 kcal/mol,\nwhich agrees well with experimental result (-11.3 kcal/mol and -10.1 kcal/mol,\nrespectively). Moreover, we take two recently reported antibodies as the\nexample, and calculate the free energy of antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD,\nwhich is also consistent with the experimental findings. Further, within the\nframework of the modified MM/PBSA, we determine the key residues and the main\ndriving forces for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/CB6 interaction by the computational\nalanine scanning method. The present study offers a computationally efficient\nand numerically reliable method to evaluate the free energy of SARS-CoV-2\nbinding to other proteins, which may stimulate the development of the\ntherapeutics against the COVID-19 disease in real applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2021 13:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}
