A general 4-order tensor model\nthat enables computationally efficient DOA estimation is designed. Whereas\nother tensor decomposition-based methods treat all factor matrices as\narbitrary, the essence of the proposed DOA estimation method is to fully\nexploit the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrices to take advantage of\nthe shift-invariance between and within different subarrays. Specifically, the\nreceived signal of TB MIMO radar is expressed as a 4-order tensor. Depending on\nthe target Doppler shifts, the constructed tensor is reshaped into two distinct\n3-order tensors. A computationally efficient tensor decomposition method is\nproposed to decompose the Vandermonde factor matrices. The generators of the\nVandermonde factor matrices are computed to estimate the phase rotations\nbetween subarrays, which can be utilized as a look-up table for finding target\nDOA. It is further shown that our proposed method can be used in a more general\nscenario where the subarray structures can be arbitrary but identical.

Despite the great success of generic\nobject detection methods, a significant performance drop is observed when\napplied to images captured by UAVs. This is due to large variations in imaging\nconditions, such as varying altitudes, dynamically changing viewing angles, and\ndifferent capture times. These variations lead to domain imbalances and, thus,\ntrained models suffering from domain bias. We demonstrate that domain knowledge\nis a valuable source of information and thus propose domain-aware object\ndetectors by using freely accessible sensor data. By splitting the model into\ncross-domain and domain-specific parts, substantial performance improvements\nare achieved on multiple data sets across various models and metrics without\nchanging the architecture. In particular, we achieve a new state-of-the-art\nperformance on UAVDT for embedded real-time detectors.

Here we conduct a simulation study to compare\nthe discrimination ability between the energy score and three variogram scores.\nCompared with other studies, our simulation design is more realistic because it\nis supported by a historical data set containing commodity prices, currencies\nand interest rates, and our data generating processes include a diverse\nselection of models with different marginal distributions, dependence\nstructure, and calibration windows. This facilitates a comprehensive comparison\nof the performance of proper scoring rules in different settings. To compare\nthe scores we use three metrics: the mean relative score, error rate and a\ngeneralised discrimination heuristic. Overall, we find that the variogram score\nwith parameter p=0.5 outperforms the energy score and the other two variogram\nscores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 17:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-01"}

The most basic way for protection\nagainst the dangerous consequences of cyberbullying is to actively detect and\ncontrol the contents containing cyberbullying. When we look at today's internet\nand social media statistics, it is impossible to detect cyberbullying contents\nonly by human power. Effective cyberbullying detection methods are necessary in\norder to make social media a safe communication space. Current research efforts\nfocus on using machine learning for detecting and eliminating cyberbullying.\nAlthough most of the studies have been conducted on English texts for the\ndetection of cyberbullying, there are few studies in Turkish. Limited methods\nand algorithms were also used in studies conducted on the Turkish language. In\naddition, the scope and performance of the algorithms used to classify the\ntexts containing cyberbullying is different, and this reveals the importance of\nusing an appropriate algorithm.

An exciting next step\nis to combine these components into multifunctional nanorobots that could,\npotentially, perform complex tasks like swimming to a target location in the\nhuman body, detect an adverse reaction and then release a drug load to stop it.\nHowever, as we start to assemble more complex nanorobots, the yield of the\ndesired nanorobot begins to decrease as the number of possible component\ncombinations increases. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this work is to develop\na predictive model to maximize yield. However, training predictive models\ntypically requires a large dataset. For the nanorobots we are interested in\nassembling, this will be difficult to collect. This is because high-fidelity\ndata, which allows us to characterize the shape and size of individual\nstructures, is very time-consuming to collect, whereas low-fidelity data is\nreadily available but only captures bulk statistics for different processes.\nTherefore, this work combines low- and high-fidelity data to train a generative\nmodel using a two-step process. We first use a relatively small, high-fidelity\ndataset to train a generative model. At run time, the model takes low-fidelity\ndata and uses it to approximate the high-fidelity content. We do this by\nbiasing the model towards samples with specific properties as measured by\nlow-fidelity data. In this work we bias our distribution towards a desired node\ndegree of a graphical model that we take as a surrogate representation of the\nnanorobots that this work will ultimately focus on.

Therefore, we introduce in this work a framework\nto detect linear and non-linear dependencies between different features. As we\nwill show, features that are actually functions of other features do not\nrepresent further information. Consequently, a model reduction neglecting such\nfeatures conserves the relevant information, reduces noise and thus improves\nthe quality of the model.

In 1990, P.G. Bonneau proposed a relation to obtain the\nfull weight distribution of a coset of an MDS code with minimum distance $d$\nusing the known numbers of vectors of weights $\\le d-2$ in this coset. In this\npaper, the Bonneau formula is transformed into a more structured and convenient\nform. The new version of the formula allows to consider effectively cosets of\ndistinct weights $W$. (The weight $W$ of a coset is the smallest Hamming weight\nof any vector in the coset.) For each of the considered $W$ or regions of $W$,\nspecial relations more simple than the general ones are obtained. For the MDS\ncode cosets of weight $W=1$ and weight $W=d-1$ we obtain formulas of the weight\ndistributions depending only on the code parameters. This proves that all the\ncosets of weight $W=1$ (as well as $W=d-1$) have the same weight distribution.\nThe cosets of weight $W=2$ or $W=d-2$ may have different weight distributions;\nin this case, we proved that the distributions are symmetrical in some sense.\nThe weight distributions of the cosets of MDS codes corresponding to arcs in\nthe projective plane $\\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$ are also considered.

It is\nillustrated how the properties of the flat output can be employed for the\ngeneration of an initial guess to be used in the optimization algorithm in the\npresence of static and dynamic obstacles. As an example energy optimal point to\npoint trajectory planning for a nonlinear 3 degrees of freedom dynamic model of\nan underactuated surface vessel is undertaken.

Recently, Secure Software\nLeasing (SSL) has emerged as one of these areas of interest. Given a target\ncircuit $C$ from a circuit class, SSL produces an encoding of $C$ that enables\na recipient to evaluate $C$, and also enables the originator of the software to\nverify that the software has been returned -- meaning that the recipient has\nrelinquished the possibility of any further use of the software. Clearly, such\na functionality is unachievable using classical information alone, since it is\nimpossible to prevent a user from keeping a copy of the software. Recent\nresults have shown the achievability of SSL using quantum information for a\nclass of functions called compute-and-compare (these are a generalization of\nthe well-known point functions). These prior works, however all make use of\nsetup or computational assumptions. Here, we show that SSL is achievable for\ncompute-and-compare circuits without any assumptions.\n  Our technique involves the study of quantum copy-protection, which is a\nnotion related to SSL, but where the encoding procedure inherently prevents a\nwould-be quantum software pirate from splitting a single copy of an encoding\nfor $C$ into two parts, each of which enables a user to evaluate $C$. We show\nthat point functions can be copy-protected without any assumptions, for a novel\nsecurity definition involving one honest and one malicious evaluator; this is\nachieved by showing that from any quantum message authentication code, we can\nderive such an honest-malicious copy-protection scheme. We then show that a\ngeneric honest-malicious copy-protection scheme implies SSL; by prior work,\nthis yields SSL for compute-and-compare functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 18:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

This signature is precisely what has\nrecently been measured in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under external magnetic fields. The\nplateau-like behavior of the half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity as a\nfunction of external magnetic field, and the peculiar sign change depending on\nthe magnetic field orientation, has been proposed as strong evidence for the\nnon-Abelian Kitaev spin liquid.

We further discuss two types of\nenvironmental perturbations that can play a role in the inspiral phase: the\ngravitational interaction with a third massive body and the energy loss due to\ndynamical friction and torques from a surrounding gas medium ubiquitous in\ngalactic nuclei. With the aid of PN corrections to the time-scale in vacuum, we\nfind simple analytical expressions for the regions of phase space in which\nenvironmental perturbations are of comparable strength to the effects of any\nparticular PN order, being able to qualitatively reproduce the results of much\nmore sophisticated analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 19:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 18:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Methods: An article search was performed on 5\nbibliographic databases with the following search terms: robotic,\nrobot-assisted, JIGSAWS, surgery, surgical, gesture, fine-grained, surgeme,\naction, trajectory, segmentation, recognition, parsing. Selected articles were\nclassified based on the level of supervision required for training and divided\ninto different groups representing major frameworks for time series analysis\nand data modelling.

Our model is sufficiently flexible to capture known\ndetector effects, such as non-linearity, intra-pixel sensitivity variations,\nand focus change. In theory, the shape of the Kepler PRF should also be weakly\nwavelength dependent, due to optical chromatic aberration and wavelength\ndependent detector response functions.

We find weak, non-linear correlations between nulling fraction\nand pulse width, as well as nulling fraction and spin period which could be\nattributed to selection effects. We also further investigate a\nrecently-hypothesized gap at 40% nulling fraction. While a local minimum does\nexist in the distribution, we cannot confirm a consistent and unique break in\nthe distribution when we investigate with univariate and multivariate\nclustering methods, nor can we prove the existence of two statistically\ndistinct populations about this minimum. Using the same methods, we find that\nnulling pulsars are a statistically different population from normal, radio,\nnon-nulling pulsars, which has never been quantitatively verified. In addition,\nwe summarize the findings of the prior nulling pulsar statistics literature,\nwhich are notoriously contradictory. This study, in context, furthers the idea\nthat nulling fraction alone does not contain enough information to describe the\nbehaviour of a nulling pulsar and that other parameters such as null lengths\nand null randomness, in addition to a better understanding of selection\neffects, are required to fully understand this phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 20:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

Whereas convergence is often\na property of learning algorithms in games satisfying a particular reward\nstructure (e.g., zero-sum games), even basic learning models, such as the\nreplicator dynamics, are not guaranteed to converge for general payoffs. Worse\nyet, chaotic behavior is possible even in rather simple games, such as variants\nof the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Although chaotic behavior in learning dynamics\ncan be precluded by the celebrated Poincar\\'e-Bendixson theorem, it is only\napplicable to low-dimensional settings. Are there other characteristics of a\ngame that can force regularity in the limit sets of learning?

In this\nparadigm, a given problem is converted into an equivalent L-S equation and\nsolved as an optimization problem, where the optimization procedure is\ncalibrated to the problem at hand. As part of a learning-based loop unrolling,\nwe use a recurrent convolutional neural network to iteratively solve the\ngoverning equations for a field of interest. This architecture leverages the\ngeneralizability and computational efficiency of machine learning approaches,\nbut also permits a physics-based interpretation. We demonstrate our learning\napproach on the two-phase elastic localization problem, where it achieves\nexcellent accuracy on the predictions of the local (i.e., voxel-level) elastic\nstrains. Since numerous governing equations can be converted into an equivalent\nL-S form, the proposed architecture has potential applications across a range\nof multiscale materials phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 20:54:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 15:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

As with existing\nSFPCA methods, the mSFPCA algorithm characterizes each trajectory as a smooth\nmean plus a weighted combination of the smooth major modes of variation about\nthe mean, where the weights are given by the component scores for each subject.\nUnlike existing SFPCA methods, the mSFPCA algorithm allows estimation of\nmultiple trajectories simultaneously, such that the component scores, which are\nconstrained to be independent within a particular outcome for identifiability,\nmay be arbitrarily correlated with component scores for other outcomes. A\nCholesky decomposition is used to estimate the component score covariance\nmatrix efficiently and guarantee positive semi-definiteness given these\nconstraints. Mutual information is used to assess the strength of marginal and\nconditional temporal associations across outcome trajectories.

Although the CE phase is not driven by gravitational-wave\n(GW) emission, the in-spiraling binary emits GWs that passively trace the CE\ndynamics. Detecting this GW signal would provide direct insight into the\ngas-driven physics. Even a non-detection might offer invaluable constraints. We\ninvestigate the prospects of detection of a Galactic CE by LISA. While the\ndynamical phase of the CE is likely sufficiently loud for detection, it is\nshort and thus rare. We focus instead on the self-regulated phase that proceeds\non a thermal timescale. Based on population synthesis calculations and the\n(unknown) signal duration in the LISA band, we expect $\\sim 0.1-100$ sources in\nthe Galaxy during the mission duration. We map the GW observable parameter\nspace of frequency $f_\\mathrm{GW}$ and its derivative $\\dot f_\\mathrm{GW}$\nremaining agnostic on the specifics of the inspiral, and find that signals with\n$\\mathrm{SNR}>10$ are possible if the CE stalls at separations such that\n$f_\\mathrm{GW}\\gtrsim2\\times10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.

We report a\nsystematic numerical study of the sign problem in DMQMC based on simulations of\natomic and molecular systems. In DMQMC, the density matrix is written in an\nouter product basis of Slater determinants and has a size of space which is the\nsquare of the number of Slater determinants. In principle this means DMQMC\nneeds to sample a space which scales in the system size, $N$, as\n$\\mathcal{O}[(\\exp(N))^2]$. In practice, there is a system-dependent critical\nwalker population ($N_c$) which must be exceeded in order to remove the sign\nproblem, and this imposes limitations by way of storage and computer time. We\nestablish that $N_c$ for DMQMC is the square of $N_c$ for FCIQMC. By contrast,\nthe minimum $N_c$ in the interaction picture modification of DMQMC (IP-DMQMC)\nonly is directly proportionate to the $N_c$ for FCIQMC. We find that this comes\nfrom the asymmetric propagation of IP-DMQMC compared to the symmetric\npropagation of canonical DMQMC. An asymmetric mode of propagation is\nprohibitively expensive for DMQMC because it has a much greater stochastic\nerror. Finally, we find that the equivalence between IP-DMQMC and FCIQMC seems\nto extend to the initiator approximation, which is often required to study\nlarger basis sets and other systems. This suggests IP-DMQMC offers a way to\nameliorate the cost of moving between a Slater determinant space and an outer\nproduct basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 21:43:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 15:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

Our motivation is to identify the underlying reason\ncausing the deficiency of the eddy viscosity breaking model (EVBM) in\npredicting surface elevation for strongly nonlinear waves. Owing to the\nlimitation of experimental methods in the provision of high-resolution flow\ninformation, we propose a numerical methodology by developing an EVBM enclosed\nstandalone fully-nonlinear quasi-potential (FNP) flow model and a coupled FNP\nplus Navier-Stokes flow model. The numerical models were firstly verified with\na wave train subject to modulational instability, then used to simulate a\nseries of broad-banded focusing wave trains under non-, moderate- and\nstrong-breaking conditions. A systematic analysis was carried out to\ninvestigate the discrepancies of numerical solutions produced by the two models\nin surface elevation and other important physical properties. It is found that\nEVBM predicts accurately the energy dissipated by breaking and the amplitude\nspectrum of free waves in terms of magnitude, but fails to capture accurately\nbreaking induced phase shifting. The shift of phase grows with breaking\nintensity and is especially strong for high wavenumber components. This is\nidentified as a cause of the upshift of wave dispersion relation, which\nincreases the frequencies of large wavenumber components. Such a variation\ndrives large-wavenumber components to propagate at nearly the same speed, which\nis significantly higher than the linear dispersion levels. This suppresses the\ninstant dispersive spreading of harmonics after the focal point, prolonging the\nlifespan of focused waves and expanding their propagation space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 21:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

More precisely, freight booking control\nfocuses on the problem of deciding to accept or reject bookings: given a\nlimited capacity, accept a booking request or reject it to reserve capacity for\nfuture bookings with potentially higher revenue. This problem can be formulated\nas a finite-horizon stochastic dynamic program, where accepting a set of\nrequests results in a profit at the end of the booking period that depends on\nthe cost of fulfilling the accepted bookings. For many freight applications,\nthe cost of fulfilling requests is obtained by solving an operational\ndecision-making problem, which often requires the solutions to mixed-integer\nlinear programs. Routinely solving such operational problems when deploying\nreinforcement learning algorithms may be too time consuming. The majority of\nbooking control policies are obtained by solving problem-specific mathematical\nprogramming relaxations that are often non-trivial to generalize to new\nproblems and, in some cases, provide quite crude approximations.\n  In this work, we propose a two-phase approach: we first train a supervised\nlearning model to predict the objective of the operational problem, and then we\ndeploy the model within reinforcement learning algorithms to compute control\npolicies. This approach is general: it can be used every time the objective\nfunction of the end-of-horizon operational problem can be predicted, and it is\nparticularly suitable to those cases where such problems are computationally\nhard. Furthermore, it allows one to leverage the recent advances in\nreinforcement learning as routinely solving the operational problem is replaced\nwith a single prediction.

The TOA variations are measured between a number of slightly\ndisplaced pairs of points from the two regions. These variations are due to the\nnonrelativistic geometric effects (Roemer delays and finite distance effects)\nas well as the gravitational effects in the light propagation (gravitational\nray bending and Shapiro delays). We show that from a sufficiently broad sample\nof TOA measurements we can determine two scalars quantifying the impact of the\nspacetime curvature on the light propagation, directly related to the first two\nmoments of the mass density distribution along the line of sight. The values of\nthe scalars are independent of the angular positions or the states of motion of\nthe two clock ensembles we use for the measurement and free from any influence\nof masses off the line of sight. These properties can make the mass density\nmeasurements very robust. The downside of the method is the need for extremely\nprecise signal timing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:35:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 16:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Two major types of cyberattack are\nconsidered: deception attack and denial of service (DoS) attack, which\ncompromise the integrity and availability of resources, respectively. First, a\nresidual-based attack detection scheme is introduced to identify the type of\nattacks. Then, a switching control is designed to neutralize the effect of the\nidentified attacks, satisfying the performance guarantees required for state\nconsensus among robots. For the type of a deception attack, coordination-free\nconsensus protocols are designed to tune the weights of each robot in a way\nthat uncompromised robots gain more weight than compromised robots. For the\ntype of a DoS attack, leader-follower protocols that reconfigure the\ncommunication topology are utilized to transform the compromised robots into\nsub-robots following the leaders. The performance of the proposed approach is\nevaluated on the Robotarium multi-robot testbed.

In this study, we propose a model\nthat simulates the communication in an online social network, in which the\nposts are created from external information. We considered the nodes and edges\nof a network as users and their friendship, respectively. A real number is\nassociated with each user representing its opinion. The dynamics starts with a\nuser that has contact with a random opinion, and, according to a given\nprobability function, this individual can post this opinion. This step is\nhenceforth called post transmission. In the next step, called post\ndistribution, another probability function is employed to select the user's\nfriends that could see the post. Post transmission and distribution represent\nthe user and the social network algorithm, respectively. If an individual has\ncontact with a post, its opinion can be attracted or repulsed. Furthermore,\nindividuals that are repulsed can change their friendship through a rewiring.\nThese steps are executed various times until the dynamics converge. Several\nimpressive results were obtained, which include the formation of scenarios of\npolarization and consensus of opinions. In the case of echo chambers, the\npossibility of rewiring probability is found to be decisive. However, for\nparticular network topologies, with a well-defined community structure, this\neffect can also happen. All in all, the results indicate that the post\ndistribution strategy is crucial to mitigate or promote polarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 22:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

Namely, for\nprimes $\\ell$ we find that $$ \\tau(n)\\not \\in \\{ \\pm 2\\ell \\ : \\ 3\\leq \\ell<\n100\\} \\cup \\{\\pm 2\\ell^2 \\ : \\ 3\\leq \\ell <100\\} \\cup \\{\\pm 2\\ell^3 \\ : \\ 3\\leq\n\\ell<100\\ {\\text {\\rm with $\\ell\\neq 59$}}\\}.$$ Moreover, we obtain such\nresults for infinitely many powers of each prime $3\\leq \\ell<100$. As an\nexample, for $\\ell=97$ we prove that $$\\tau(n)\\not \\in \\{ 2\\cdot 97^j \\ : \\\n1\\leq j\\not \\equiv 0\\pmod{44}\\}\\cup \\{-2\\cdot 97^j \\ : \\ j\\geq 1\\}.$$ The\nmethod of proof applies mutatis mutandis to newforms with residually reducible\nmod 2 Galois representation and is easily adapted to generic newforms with\ninteger coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 23:55:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 May 2021 21:42:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 02:46:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 02:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

These sensors have huge potential for space applications as they\nprovide an extremely sparse representation of visual dynamics while removing\nredundant information, thereby conforming to low-resource requirements. An\nevent-based sensor was irradiated under wide-spectrum neutrons at Los Alamos\nNeutron Science Center and its effects were classified. We found that the\nsensor had very fast recovery during radiation, showing high correlation of\nnoise event bursts with respect to source macro-pulses. No significant\ndifferences were observed between the number of events induced at different\nangles of incidence but significant differences were found in the spatial\nstructure of noise events at different angles. The results show that\nevent-based cameras are capable of functioning in a space-like, radiative\nenvironment with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.355. They also show that\nradiation-induced noise does not affect event-level computation. We also\nintroduce the Event-based Radiation-Induced Noise Simulation Environment\n(Event-RINSE), a simulation environment based on the noise-modelling we\nconducted and capable of injecting the effects of radiation-induced noise from\nthe collected data to any stream of events in order to ensure that developed\ncode can operate in a radiative environment. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first time such analysis of neutron-induced noise analysis has been\nperformed on a neuromorphic vision sensor, and this study shows the advantage\nof using such sensors for space applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 23:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

We derive the relative astrometric positions and flux\nratios of the stellar companion in WW Cha from the interferometric model\nfitting of observations made with the VLTI instruments AMBER, PIONIER, and\nGRAVITY in the near-infrared from 2011 to 2020.

Experiments were conducted with the abovementioned droplets\ninformation measured using digital inline holography (DIH). Results show that\nthe volumetric droplet size distributions (VDSD) span widely from sub-200 um to\nover 2 mm in size. The application of an oil-in-water emulsion results largely\nin the suppression of smaller droplets, while the VDSD is relatively\ninsensitive to increasing the oil volume fraction beyond a critical level. DIH\nadditionally enables the determination of size-dependent droplet eccentricity\nand velocity measurements. Interestingly, the application of oil-in-water\nemulsion generally decreases the eccentricity, more significantly at the center\nthan at the edge of the spray fan. We attribute this decrease to the increase\nin lamella sheet thickness and thus decrease in characteristic shrinkage rates,\nconsistent with the observation using high-speed shadowgraphs. In all\ninstances, oil-in-water emulsion droplets have higher velocities than\nequivalent sized water droplets. We attribute this to the earlier action of the\nspray breakup process in the oil-in-water emulsion, reduced surface energy\ngeneration during a breakup (larger droplets), and reduce energy dissipation\nduring breakup with oil-in-water emulsions, leading to increased translational\nenergy after the breakup process. Therefore, it appears that oil-in-water\nemulsion application simultaneously suppresses small droplet formation and\nincreases droplet velocity, and hence spray penetration in agricultural\napplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2021 07:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

In mammography, dual-energy imaging (spectral imaging\nwith two energy levels) has been investigated for several applications, in\nparticular material decomposition, which allows for quantitative analysis of\nbreast composition and quantitative contrast-enhanced imaging. Material\ndecomposition with dual-energy imaging is based on the assumption that there\nare two dominant photon interaction effects that determine linear attenuation:\nthe photoelectric effect and Compton scattering. This assumption limits the\nnumber of basis materials, i.e. the number of materials that are possible to\ndifferentiate between, to two.

In particular,\nwe show that the JS-divergence between the GAN estimate and $\\mathsf{p}^*$\ndecays as fast as $(\\log{n}/n)^{2\\beta/(2\\beta+d)}$ where $n$ is the sample\nsize and $\\beta$ determines the smoothness of $\\mathsf{p}^*$.

To reduce the time cost of data acquisition and labeling and increase\nthe rate of successful grasps, we developed a self-supervised learning\nmechanism to control grasp tasks performed by manipulators. First, a\nmanipulator automatically collects the point cloud for the objects from\nmultiple perspectives to increase the efficiency of data acquisition. The\ncomplete point cloud for the objects is obtained by utilizing the hand-eye\nvision of the manipulator, and the TSDF algorithm. Then, the point cloud data\nfor the objects is used to generate a series of six-degrees-of-freedom grasp\nposes, and the force-closure decision algorithm is used to add the grasp\nquality label to each grasp pose to realize the automatic labeling of grasp\ndata.

The expansive feature of\nthis transformation affects the performance of such refractories, as (i) if\nthis hydrated phase is not accommodated in the formed microstructure, ceramic\nlinings with cracks and low green mechanical strength will be obtained; and\n(ii) if crack-free pieces are prepared, they should present low porosity and\nreduced permeability, which require special attention when heating these\nmaterials. This work investigated the ability of various additives in the\noptimization of the drying behavior of Al2O3-MgO castables. Vibratable\ncompositions were tested after incorporating polymeric fibers (PF), an organic\nsalt (OAS), SiO2-based additive (SM) or permeability enhancing active compound\n(MP) into the dry-mixtures. Various experimental measurements were performed to\ninfer the role of the drying agents to prevent the samples explosion and\nwhether they would also influence other properties of the castables. As\nobserved, OAS and MP helped to inhibit the MgO-bonded samples explosion even\nunder severe heating conditions (2-20C/min) and increased their green\nmechanical strength and slag infiltration resistance when compared to the\nadditive-free composition. On the other hand, the addition of polymeric fibers\n(PF) or silica-based compound (SM) to the formulations was not able to prevent\nthe castables explosion when using a high heating rate and other side effects\ncould also be observed when testing these materials. Thus, the selection of\nsuitable drying agents is a key issue, as they may allow the development of\nMgO-bonded castables with enhanced properties and lower spalling risk during\ntheir first thermal treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2021 12:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

However, current\nstrategies operate at the image level, and objects and the background are\ncoupled. Thus, the boundaries are not well augmented due to the fixed semantic\nscenario. In this paper, we propose ObjectAug to perform object-level\naugmentation for semantic image segmentation. ObjectAug first decouples the\nimage into individual objects and the background using the semantic labels.\nNext, each object is augmented individually with commonly used augmentation\nmethods (e.g., scaling, shifting, and rotation). Then, the black area brought\nby object augmentation is further restored using image inpainting. Finally, the\naugmented objects and background are assembled as an augmented image. In this\nway, the boundaries can be fully explored in the various semantic scenarios. In\naddition, ObjectAug can support category-aware augmentation that gives various\npossibilities to objects in each category, and can be easily combined with\nexisting image-level augmentation methods to further boost performance.\nComprehensive experiments are conducted on both natural image and medical image\ndatasets.

There are mainly two attention\nmechanisms widely used in computer vision studies, \\textit{spatial attention}\nand \\textit{channel attention}, which aim to capture the pixel-level pairwise\nrelationship and channel dependency, respectively. Although fusing them\ntogether may achieve better performance than their individual implementations,\nit will inevitably increase the computational overhead. In this paper, we\npropose an efficient Shuffle Attention (SA) module to address this issue, which\nadopts Shuffle Units to combine two types of attention mechanisms effectively.\nSpecifically, SA first groups channel dimensions into multiple sub-features\nbefore processing them in parallel. Then, for each sub-feature, SA utilizes a\nShuffle Unit to depict feature dependencies in both spatial and channel\ndimensions. After that, all sub-features are aggregated and a \"channel shuffle\"\noperator is adopted to enable information communication between different\nsub-features. The proposed SA module is efficient yet effective, e.g., the\nparameters and computations of SA against the backbone ResNet50 are 300 vs.\n25.56M and 2.76e-3 GFLOPs vs. 4.12 GFLOPs, respectively, and the performance\nboost is more than 1.34% in terms of Top-1 accuracy. Extensive experimental\nresults on common-used benchmarks, including ImageNet-1k for classification, MS\nCOCO for object detection, and instance segmentation, demonstrate that the\nproposed SA outperforms the current SOTA methods significantly by achieving\nhigher accuracy while having lower model complexity.

More\nprecisely, the cell growth and division is described through the space and time\nevolution of the membrane vertices. These vertices follow a Newtonian dynamics,\nmeaning that their evolution is controlled by different types of forces: a\nmembrane force (spring and bending), an adherence force (inter cellular\nspring), external and internal pressure forces. In addition to the cells\ndynamics, our formalism further relies on a lattice Boltzmann method, using the\nPalabos library, to simulate the diffusion of chemical signals. The latter aims\nat driving the growth and migration of a tissue by simply changing the state of\nthe cells.\n  All of this leads to an accurate description of the growth and division of\ncells, with realistic cell shapes and where membranes can have different\nproperties.

The objectives of this paper are: (1) to investigate the\nimpact of agents' decisions of link addition and deletion on their local and\nglobal resource availability, (2) to analyze spillover effects in terms of the\nimpact of link addition between a pair of agents on others' utility, (3) to\nstudy the role of agents' closeness in determining what type of spillover\neffects these agents experience in the network, and (4) to model the choices of\nagents that suggest with whom they want to add links in the social cloud. The\nfindings include the following. Firstly, agents' decision of link addition\n(deletion) increases (decreases) their local resource availability. However,\nthese observations do not hold in the case of global resource availability.\nSecondly, in a connected network, agents experience either positive or negative\nspillover effect and there is no case with no spillover effects. Agents observe\nno spillover effects if and only if the network is disconnected and consists of\nmore than two components (sub-networks).

Distinct detection methodologies\nneed to be developed for the IIoT network as threat detection is a significant\nexpectation of stakeholders. Machine learning approaches are considered to be\nevolving techniques that learn with experience, and such approaches have\nresulted in superior performance in various applications, such as pattern\nrecognition, outlier analysis, and speech recognition.

In\nthis paper, the objective is to develop a two-phase anomaly detection model to\nenhance the reliability of an IIoT network. In the first phase, SVM and Naive\nBayes are integrated using an ensemble blending technique. K-fold\ncross-validation is performed while training the data with different training\nand testing ratios to obtain optimized training and test sets. Ensemble\nblending uses a random forest technique to predict class labels. An Artificial\nNeural Network (ANN) classifier that uses the Adam optimizer to achieve better\naccuracy is also used for prediction.

This opens the\npath towards rapid and reliable assessment throughout the battery life cycle,\nfrom battery development and manufacturing quality assurance to operational\nsafety and optimised use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 18:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

One approach provides coarse and fine temporal\nresolutions of the input time-series to RNN in parallel. The other concatenates\nthe coarse and fine temporal resolutions of the input time-series data over\ntime before considering them as the input to RNN. In both approaches, first,\nfiner temporal resolution data are utilized to learn the fine temporal scale\nbehavior of the target data. Next, coarser temporal resolution data are\nexpected to capture long-duration dependencies between the input and target\nvariables. The proposed approaches were implemented for hourly rainfall-runoff\nmodeling at a snow-dominated watershed by employing a long and short-term\nmemory (LSTM) network, which is a newer type of RNN. Subsequently, the daily\nand hourly meteorological data were utilized as the input, and hourly flow\ndischarge was considered as the target data. The results confirm that both of\nthe proposed approaches can reduce the computational time for the training of\nRNN significantly (up to 32.4 times). Furthermore, one of the proposed\napproaches improves the estimation accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2021 07:51:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 18:45:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

Here, we study arbitrary\nnetworks geometrically by defining a dynamic edge curvature measuring the\nsimilarity between pairs of dynamical network processes seeded at nearby nodes.\nWe show that the evolution of the curvature distribution exhibits gaps at\ncharacteristic timescales indicating bottleneck-edges that limit information\nspreading. Importantly, curvature gaps are robust to large fluctuations in node\ndegrees, encoding communities until the phase transition of detectability,\nwhere spectral and node-clustering methods fail. Using this insight, we derive\ngeometric modularity to find multiscale communities based on deviations from\nconstant network curvature in generative and real-world networks, significantly\noutperforming most previous methods.
