The computation of vessel trajectory\nsimilarity has recently attracted increasing attention in the maritime data\nmining research community. However, traditional shape- and warping-based\nmethods often suffer from several drawbacks such as high computational cost and\nsensitivity to unwanted artifacts and non-uniform sampling rates, etc. To\neliminate these drawbacks, we propose an unsupervised learning method which\nautomatically extracts low-dimensional features through a convolutional\nauto-encoder (CAE). In particular, we first generate the informative trajectory\nimages by remapping the raw vessel trajectories into two-dimensional matrices\nwhile maintaining the spatio-temporal properties. Based on the massive vessel\ntrajectories collected, the CAE can learn the low-dimensional representations\nof informative trajectory images in an unsupervised manner. The trajectory\nsimilarity is finally equivalent to efficiently computing the similarities\nbetween the learned low-dimensional features, which strongly correlate with the\nraw vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on realistic data sets have\ndemonstrated that the proposed method largely outperforms traditional\ntrajectory similarity computation methods in terms of efficiency and\neffectiveness. The high-quality trajectory clustering performance could also be\nguaranteed according to the CAE-based trajectory similarity computation\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2021 04:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-11"}

We use simulations of a minimal 2D\nmodel of self-propelled rods moving through with a passive compliant medium\nconsisting of particles that offer elastic resistance before being plastically\ndisplaced from their equilibrium positions. It is observed that the\nmotility-induced clustering of active (self-propelled) particles is crucial for\nunderstanding the morphodynamics of colonisation. Clustering enables motile\ncolonies to spread faster than they would have as isolated particles. The\ncolonisation rate depends non-monotonically on substrate stiffness with a\ndistinct maximum at a non-zero value of substrate stiffness. This is observed\nto be due to a change in the morphology of clusters. Furrow networks created by\nthe active particles have a fractal-like structure whose dimension varies\nsystematically with substrate stiffness but is less sensitive to particle\nactivity. The power-law growth exponent of the furrowed area is smaller than\nunity, suggesting that, to sustain such extensive furrow networks, colonies\nmust regulate their overall growth rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 16:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

It is known that an $n$-dimensional variety of general type with nef\ncanonical divisor and canonical singularities, whose image $Y$ under the\ncanonical map is of maximal dimension, satisfies $K_X^n \\ge 2 (p_g-n)$. We\ninvestigate the very interesting extremal situation $K_X^n=2(p_g-n)$, which\nappears in a number of geometric situations. Since these extremal varieties are\nnatural higher dimensional analogues of Horikawa surfaces, we name them\nHorikawa varieties. These varieties have been previously dealt with inthe works\nof Fujita and Kobayashi. We carry out further studies of Horikawa varieties,\nproving new results on various geometric and topological issues concerning\nthem. In particular, we prove that the geometric genus of those Horikawa\nvarieties whose image under the canonical map is singular is bounded. We give\nan analogous result for polarized hyperelliptic subcanonical varieties, in\nparticular, for polarized Calabi-Yau and Fano varieties. The pleasing\nnumerology that emerges puts Horikawa's result on surfaces in a broader\nperspective. We obtain a structure theorem for Horikawa varieties and explore\ntheir pluriregularity. We use this to prove optimal results on projective\nnormality of pluricanonical linear systems. We study the fundamental groups of\nHorikawa varieties, showing that they are simply connected, even if $Y$ is\nsingular. We also prove results on deformations of Horikawa varieties, whose\nimplications on the moduli space make them the higher dimensional analogue of\ncurves of genus $2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 19:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

As these phenomena directly affect\nour lives and seemingly more and more as our societies and communication\nchannels evolve it becomes ever so important for us to understand the\nintricacies of opinion dynamics in the modern era. Here we extend an existing\necho chambers model with activity driven agents onto a bi-layer topology and\nstudy the dynamics of the polarised state as a function of interlayer\ncouplings. Different cases of such couplings are presented - unidirectional\ncoupling that can be reduced to a mono-layer facing an external bias, symmetric\nand non-symmetric couplings. We have assumed that initial conditions impose\nsystem polarisation and agent opinions are different for both layers. Such a\npre-conditioned polarised state can sustain without explicit homophilic\ninteractions provided the coupling strength between agents belonging to\ndifferent layers is weak enough. For a strong unidirectional or attractive\ncoupling between two layers a discontinuous transition to a radicalised state\ntakes place when mean opinions in both layers are the same. When coupling\nconstants between the layers are of different signs the system exhibits\nsustained or decaying oscillations. Transitions between these states are\nanalysed using a mean field approximation and classified in the framework of\nbifurcation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 21:41:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 09:07:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 10:42:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 09:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

The target was observed in\nSectors 4 and 5 during Cycle 1, with lightcurves extracted from TESS Full Frame\nImage data. It was also previously observed by the WASP survey and ASAS-SN. The\nsystem consists of three gravitationally-bound eclipsing binaries in a\nhierarchical structure of an inner quadruple system with an outer binary\nsubsystem. Follow-up observations from several different observatories were\nconducted as a means of determining additional parameters. The system was\nresolved by speckle interferometry with a 0.\"42 separation between the inner\nquadruple and outer binary, inferring an estimated outer period of ~2 kyr. It\nwas determined that the fainter of the two resolved components is an 8.217 day\neclipsing binary, which orbits the inner quadruple that contains two eclipsing\nbinaries with periods of 1.570 days and 1.306 days. MCMC analysis of the\nstellar parameters has shown that the three binaries of TIC 168789840 are\n\"triplets\", as each binary is quite similar to the others in terms of mass,\nradius, and Teff. As a consequence of its rare composition, structure, and\norientation, this object can provide important new insight into the formation,\ndynamics, and evolution of multiple star systems.

Computational approaches aim to sample from regions of the whole\nmolecular and solid-state compounds called chemical space which could be on the\norder of 1060 . Deep generative models can model the underlying probability\ndistribution of both the physical structures and property of drugs and relate\nthem nonlinearly. By exploiting patterns in massive datasets, these models can\ndistill salient features that characterize the molecules. Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) discover drug candidates by generating molecular\nstructures that obey chemical and physical properties and show affinity towards\nbinding with the receptor for a target disease. However, classical GANs cannot\nexplore certain regions of the chemical space and suffer from\ncurse-of-dimensionality. A full quantum GAN may require more than 90 qubits\neven to generate QM9-like small molecules. We propose a qubit-efficient quantum\nGAN with a hybrid generator (QGAN-HG) to learn richer representation of\nmolecules via searching exponentially large chemical space with few qubits more\nefficiently than classical GAN. The QGANHG model is composed of a hybrid\nquantum generator that supports various number of qubits and quantum circuit\nlayers, and, a classical discriminator. QGAN-HG with only 14.93% retained\nparameters can learn molecular distribution as efficiently as classical\ncounterpart. The QGAN-HG variation with patched circuits considerably\naccelerates our standard QGANHG training process and avoids potential gradient\nvanishing issue of deep neural networks.

These lower bounds require the manipulators to know precisely the\noutcome of all future matches.\n  We take a beyond worst-case view and instead consider tournaments which are\n\"close to uniform\": the outcome of all matches are independent, and no team is\nbelieved to win any match with probability exceeding $1/2+\\varepsilon$. We show\nthat Randomized Single Elimination Bracket [Schneider et al., 2017] and a new\ntournament rule we term Randomized Death Match have the property that no pair\nof teams can manipulate the outcome of their match to improve their probability\nof winning by more than $\\varepsilon/3 + 2\\varepsilon^2/3$, for all\n$\\varepsilon$, and this is the best possible among any Condorcet-consistent\ntournament rule.\n  Our main technical contribution is a recursive framework to analyze the\nmanipulability of certain forms of tournament rules.

However, iterative methods have become more sensitive to\nsystem operating conditions than ever before due to the deployment of\nintermittent renewable energy sources, low carbon technologies (e.g., electric\nvehicles), and demand response programs. Appropriate PSSE approaches are\nrequired to avoid pitfalls of the WLS-based PSSE computations for accurate\nprediction of operating conditions. This paper proposes a data-driven real-time\nPSSE using a deep ensemble learning algorithm. In the proposed approach, the\nensemble learning setup is formulated with dense residual neural networks as\nbase-learners and multivariate-linear regressor as meta-learner. Historical\nmeasurements and states are utilised to train and test the model. The trained\nmodel can be used in real-time to estimate power system states (voltage\nmagnitudes and phase angles) using real-time measurements. Most of current\ndata-driven PSSE methods assume the availability of a complete set of\nmeasurements, which may not be the case in real power system data-acquisition.\nThis paper adopts multivariate linear regression to forecast system states for\ninstants of missing measurements to assist the proposed PSSE technique.

The limited data\nthat exist in this domain are usually recorded with a handheld camera which can\nbe shaky or even moving, posing a challenge for traditional feature\nrepresentation approaches for activity detection which mistakenly capture the\ncamera's motion as a feature. To address these issues, we first document the\nadvantages and limitations of current feature representation techniques for\nactivity recognition when applied to head banging detection. We then propose a\nfeature representation consisting exclusively of head pose keypoints. We create\na computer vision classifier for detecting head banging in home videos using a\ntime-distributed convolutional neural network (CNN) in which a single CNN\nextracts features from each frame in the input sequence, and these extracted\nfeatures are fed as input to a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. On the\nbinary task of predicting head banging and no head banging within videos from\nthe Self Stimulatory Behaviour Dataset (SSBD), we reach a mean F1-score of\n90.77% using 3-fold cross validation (with individual fold F1-scores of 83.3%,\n89.0%, and 100.0%) when ensuring that no child who appeared in the train set\nwas in the test set for all folds. This work documents a successful technique\nfor training a computer vision classifier which can detect human motion with\nfew training examples and even when the camera recording the source clips is\nunstable.

For cerium hydride CeH$_9$ recently synthesized at\n80$-$100 GPa, our first-principles calculations reveal that the strongly\nhybridized electronic states of Ce 4$f$ and H 1$s$ orbitals produce the\ntopologically nontrivial Dirac nodal lines around the Fermi energy $E_F$, which\nare protected by crystalline symmetries. By hole doping, $E_F$ shifts down\ntoward the topology-driven van Hove singularity to significantly increase the\ndensity of states, which in turn raises a superconducting transition\ntemperature $T_c$ from 74 K up to 136 K at 100 GPa. The hole-doping\nconcentration can be controlled by the incorporation of Ce$^{3+}$ ions with\nvarying their percentages, which can be well electronically miscible with Ce\natoms in the CeH$_9$ matrix because both Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce behave similarly as\ncations. Therefore, the interplay of symmetry, band topology, and hole doping\ncontributes to enhance $T_c$ in compressed CeH$_9$.

The improvement scales down the\nphenomenon of intermediate expression swell as well as the complexity of\nBuchberger's algorithm to a significant degree. The idea is to compute a new\ntype of bases over principal ideal rings instead of over fields like Gr\\\"obner\nbases. The generalizations of Buchberger's algorithm from over fields to over\nrings are abundant in the literature. However they are limited to either\ncomputations of strong Gr\\\"obner bases or modular computations of the numeral\ncoefficients of ideal bases with no essential improvement on the algorithmic\ncomplexity. In this paper we make pseudo-divisions with multipliers to enhance\ncomputational efficiency. In particular, we develop a new methodology in\ndetermining the authenticity of the factors of the pseudo-eliminant, i.e., we\ncompare the factors with the multipliers of the pseudo-divisions instead of the\nleading coefficients of the basis elements. In order to find out the exact form\nof the eliminant, we contrive a modular algorithm of proper divisions over\nprincipal quotient rings with zero divisors. The pseudo-eliminant and proper\neliminants and their corresponding bases constitute a decomposition of the\noriginal ideal.

With the aim of learning\ncollision-free policies for unmanned vehicles, deep RL has been used for\ntraining with various types of data, such as colored images, depth images, and\nLiDAR point clouds, without the use of classic map--localize--plan approaches.\nHowever, existing methods are limited by their reliance on cameras and LiDAR\ndevices, which have degraded sensing under adverse environmental conditions\n(e.g., smoky environments). In response, we propose the use of single-chip\nmillimeter-wave (mmWave) radar, which is lightweight and inexpensive, for\nlearning-based autonomous navigation. However, because mmWave radar signals are\noften noisy and sparse, we propose a cross-modal contrastive learning for\nrepresentation (CM-CLR) method that maximizes the agreement between mmWave\nradar data and LiDAR data in the training stage. We evaluated our method in\nreal-world robot compared with 1) a method with two separate networks using\ncross-modal generative reconstruction and an RL policy and 2) a baseline RL\npolicy without cross-modal representation.

Although distant supervision methods can effectively\nalleviate the problem of lack of training data in supervised learning, they\nalso introduce noise into the data, and still cannot fundamentally solve the\nlong-tail distribution problem of the training instances. In order to enable\nthe neural network to learn new knowledge through few instances like humans,\nthis work focuses on few-shot relation classification (FSRC), where a\nclassifier should generalize to new classes that have not been seen in the\ntraining set, given only a number of samples for each class. To make full use\nof the existing information and get a better feature representation for each\ninstance, we propose to encode each class prototype in an adaptive way from two\naspects. First, based on the prototypical networks, we propose an adaptive\nmixture mechanism to add label words to the representation of the class\nprototype, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to\nintegrate the label information into features of the support samples of each\nclass so as to get more interactive class prototypes. Second, to more\nreasonably measure the distances between samples of each category, we introduce\na loss function for joint representation learning to encode each support\ninstance in an adaptive manner. Extensive experiments have been conducted on\nFewRel under different few-shot (FS) settings, and the results show that the\nproposed adaptive prototypical networks with label words and joint\nrepresentation learning has not only achieved significant improvements in\naccuracy, but also increased the generalization ability of few-shot RC models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2021 11:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

While CueNet V1 has a single input image, the approach\nwith CueNet V2 was to take three consecutive 240 x 180-pixel images as an input\nand transform them into a probability heatmap for the cueball's location. The\nnetwork was tested with a separate video that contained all sorts of\ndistractions to test its robustness. When confronted with our testing data,\nCueNet V1 predicted the correct cueball location in 99.6% of all frames, while\nCueNet V2 had 99.8% accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2021 13:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

We combine the same signal\nreceived by different receivers to improve signal to interference noise ratio\n(SINR). And SIC can effectively restore interference and eliminate its impact.\nThe simulation results show that channel capacity can be increased by more than\n5 times and up to 20 times under the condition of receiver and transmitter\nalignment.

The volatility of many economic and financial time series\ndisplays persistent changes and possible non-stationarity. However, the theory\nof the bootstrap for such models has focused on deterministic changes of the\nunconditional variance and little is known about the performance and the\nvalidity of the bootstrap when the volatility is driven by a non-stationary\nstochastic process. This includes near-integrated volatility processes as well\nas near-integrated GARCH processes. This paper develops conditions for\nbootstrap validity in time series regressions with non-stationary, stochastic\nvolatility. We show that in such cases the distribution of bootstrap statistics\n(conditional on the data) is random in the limit. Consequently, the\nconventional approaches to proving bootstrap validity, involving weak\nconvergence in probability of the bootstrap statistic, fail to deliver the\nrequired results. Instead, we use the concept of `weak convergence in\ndistribution' to develop and establish novel conditions for validity of the\nwild bootstrap, conditional on the volatility process. We apply our results to\nseveral testing problems in the presence of non-stationary stochastic\nvolatility, including testing in a location model, testing for structural\nchange and testing for an autoregressive unit root. Sufficient conditions for\nbootstrap validity include the absence of statistical leverage effects, i.e.,\ncorrelation between the error process and its future conditional variance. The\nresults are illustrated using Monte Carlo simulations, which indicate that the\nwild bootstrap leads to size control even in small samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2021 15:04:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

We show that the destructive effect of ion micromotion on\nits sympathetic cooling can however be suppressed in the vicinity of the\natom-ion CIR. The origin of this is the \"fermionization\" of the atom-ion wave\nfunction near CIR, where the atom-ion pair behaves as a pair of noninteracting\nidentical fermions. This prevents the complete approach of the atom with the\nion near resonance and does not enhance the ion micromotion, which interferes\nwith its sympathetic cooling.

The authors have investigated a\nphoton-counting spectral imaging system with two energy bins for\ncontrast-enhanced mammography. System optimization and the potential benefit\ncompared to conventional non-energy-resolved absorption imaging was studied.\n  Methods: A framework for system characterization was set up that included\nquantum and anatomical noise and a theoretical model of the system was\nbenchmarked to phantom measurements.\n  Results: Optimal combination of the energy-resolved images corresponded\napproximately to minimization of the anatomical noise, which is commonly\nreferred to as energy subtraction. In that case, an ideal-observer\ndetectability index could be improved close to 50% compared to absorption\nimaging in the phantom study. Optimization with respect to the\nsignal-to-quantum-noise ratio, commonly referred to as energy weighting,\nyielded only a minute improvement. In a simulation of a clinically more\nrealistic case, spectral imaging was predicted to perform approximately 30%\nbetter than absorption imaging for an average glandularity breast with an\naverage level of anatomical noise. For dense breast tissue and a high level of\nanatomical noise, however, a rise in detectability by a factor of 6 was\npredicted. Another ~70-90% improvement was found to be within reach for an\noptimized system.\n  Conclusions: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography is feasible and\nbeneficial with the current system, and there is room for additional\nimprovements.

The lsAGC algorithm combines\ndimension reduction with source time-series augmentation and uses predictive\ntime-series modeling for estimating directed causal relationships among\ntime-series. This method is a multivariate approach, since it is capable of\nidentifying the influence of each time-series on any other time-series in the\npresence of all other time-series of the underlying dynamic system. We\nquantitatively evaluate the performance of lsAGC on synthetic directional\ntime-series networks with known ground truth.

Using\nextensive simulations for a wide range of time-series lengths and two different\nsignal-to-noise ratios of 5 and 15 dB, lsAGC consistently outperforms\ncross-correlation at accurately detecting network connections, using Receiver\nOperator Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis, across all tested time-series\nlengths and noise levels.

Mining such literature can reveal trends that may not be\nimmediately apparent. The CORD-19 corpus represents a growing corpus of\nscientific literature associated with COVID-19. We examined the intersection of\na set of candidate therapeutics identified in a drug-repurposing study with\ntemporal instances of the CORD-19 corpus to determine if it was possible to\nfind and measure changes associated with them over time. We propose that the\ntechniques we used could form the basis of a tool to pre-screen new candidate\ntherapeutics early in the research process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 23:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

The\nparticipating devices in IoT networks can be problematic due to their\nresource-constrained nature, and integrating security on these devices is often\noverlooked. This has resulted in attackers having an increased incentive to\ntarget IoT devices. As the number of attacks possible on a network increases,\nit becomes more difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to\ncope with these attacks efficiently. In this paper, we highlight several\nmachine learning (ML) methods such as k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector\nmachine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF),\nartificial neural network (ANN), and logistic regression (LR) that can be used\nin IDS. In this work, ML algorithms are compared for both binary and\nmulti-class classification on Bot-IoT dataset. Based on several parameters such\nas accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss, we experimentally\ncompared the aforementioned ML algorithms. In the case of HTTP distributed\ndenial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the accuracy of RF is 99%. Furthermore, other\nsimulation results-based precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss metric\nreveal that RF outperforms on all types of attacks in binary classification.\nHowever, in multi-class classification, KNN outperforms other ML algorithms\nwith an accuracy of 99%, which is 4% higher than RF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2021 11:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-01"}
