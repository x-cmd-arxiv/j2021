Two samples with average\nparticle sizes of 5 nm and 20 nm, respectively, were studied. For both samples,\nthe magnetometry and $\\mu$SR results exhibit clear signatures of the\nsuperparmagnetic state at high temperature and the magnetically blocked state\nat low temperature. The $\\mu$SR data demonstrate that the transition from the\nsuperparamagnetic to the blocked state occurs gradually throughout the sample\nvolume over a broad temperature range due to the finite particle size\ndistribution of each sample. The transition occurs between approximately 3 K\nand 45 K for the 5 nm sample and 150 K and 300 K for the 20 nm sample. The\nmagnetometry and $\\mu$SR data are further analyzed to yield estimates of\nmicroscopic magnetic parameters including the nanoparticle spin-flip activation\nenergy $E_A$, magnetic anisotropy $K$, and intrinsic nanoparticle spin reversal\nattempt time $\\tau_0$.

We demonstrate that by taking into account constraints on the\npost-inflationary reheating parameters such as the duration of reheating\n$N_{_{\\rm re}}$, its temperature $T_{_{\\rm re}}$ and especially its equation of\nstate (EOS), $w_{_{\\rm re}}$, it is possible to break this degeneracy in\ncertain classes of inflationary models where identical values of $\\lbrace\nn_{_S}, r \\rbrace$ can correspond to different reheating $w_{_{\\rm re}}$. In\nparticular, we show how reheating constraints can break inflationary\ndegeneracies in the T-model and the E-model $\\alpha$-attractors. Non-canonical\ninflation is also studied. The relic gravitational wave (GW) spectrum provides\nus with another tool to break inflationary degeneracies. This is because the GW\nspectrum is sensitive to the post-inflationary EOS of the universe.

HI filaments are closely related to dusty magnetized structures that\nare observable in the far infrared (FIR). Recently it was proposed that the\ncoherence of oriented HI structures in velocity traces the line of sight\nmagnetic field tangling. Aims. We study the velocity-dependent coherence\nbetween FIR emission at 857 GHz and HI on angular scales of 18 arcmin. Methods.\nWe use HI4PI HI data and Planck FIR data and apply the Hessian operator to\nextract filaments. For coherence, we require that local orientation angles\n{\\theta} in the FIR at 857 GHz along the filaments be correlated with the HI.\nResults. We find some correlation for HI column densities at |v_LSR | < 50 km/,\nbut a tight agreement between FIR and HI orientation angles {\\theta} exists\nonly in narrow velocity intervals of 1 km/s. Accordingly, we assign velocities\nto FIR filaments. Along the line of sight these HI structures show a high\ndegree of the local alignment with {\\theta}, as well as in velocity space.\nInterpreting these aligned structures in analogy to the polarization of dust\nemission defines an HI polarization. We observe polarization fractions of up to\n80%, with averages of 30%.

This paper reports our initial effort towards the definition of an\nautomatic dashboard generation process that exploits metamodel layouts to\ncreate a full dashboard from a set of indicators selected by operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2021 17:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

The smaller length scales involved in\nthe experiments impel us to consider a perfectly periodic system of\ntwo-dimensionally confined InAs quantum dot layers separated by GaAs spacers.\nSubsequent system is subjected to a two-dimensional confining (harmonic)\npotential in the x-y plane and an applied magnetic field (B) in the symmetric\ngauge. This scheme defines virtually a system of quantum wire comprised of\nvertically stacked quantum dots (VSQD). We derive and discuss the Dyson\nequation, the generalized (nonlocal and dynamic) dielectric function, and the\ninverse dielectric function for investigating the single-particle and\ncollective (magnetoplasmon) excitations within the framework of (full)\nrandom-phase approximation (RPA). As an application, we study the influence of\nthe confinement potential and the magnetic field on the component\neigenfunctions, the density of states (DOS), the Fermi energy, the collective\nexcitations, and the inverse dielectric functions. These findings demonstrate,\nfor the very first time, the significance of investigating the system of VSQD\nsubjected to a quantizing magnetic field. Given the edge over the planar\nquantum dots and the foreseen applications in the single-electron devices and\nquantum computation, investigating the system of VSQD is deemed vital. The\nresults suggest exploiting magnetoplasmon qubits to be a potential option for\nimplementing the solemn idea of quantum state transfer in devising quantum\ngates for the quantum computation and quantum communication networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2021 17:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

The latter induce\nsubtle relativistic corrections due to the coupling of nucleon magnetic moments\nwith the nuclear spin-orbit density. We assess the precision of nuclear charge\ndensity calculations by studying the behavior of relativistic corrections.\n  Methods: The calculations are performed using Skyrme energy density\nfunctionals and density-dependent pairing force.

A pragmatic approach for dealing with such a diverse set of\nvulnerabilities would be to identify attack attempts at runtime on the device\nside, and thwart them with mitigating and corrective actions. Towards this\ngoal, in the paper we propose a general and extendable approach called Phoenix\nfor identifying n-day cellular network control-plane vulnerabilities as well as\ndangerous practices of network operators from the device vantage point. Phoenix\nmonitors the device-side cellular network traffic for performing\nsignature-based unexpected behavior detection through lightweight runtime\nverification techniques. Signatures in Phoenix can be manually-crafted by a\ncellular network security expert or can be automatically synthesized using an\noptional component of Phoenix, which reduces the signature synthesis problem to\nthe language learning from the informant problem. Based on the corrective\nactions that are available to Phoenix when an undesired behavior is detected,\ndifferent instantiations of Phoenix are possible: a full-fledged defense when\ndeployed inside a baseband processor; a user warning system when deployed as a\nmobile application; a probe for identifying attacks in the wild. One such\ninstantiation of Phoenix was able to identify all 15 representative n-day\nvulnerabilities and unsafe practices of 4G LTE networks considered in our\nevaluation with a high packet processing speed (~68000 packets/second) while\ninducing only a moderate amount of energy overhead (~4mW).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2021 22:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

The last two locations are\ncharacterized by strong mean-flow three-dimensionality and separation. The\nmessage conveyed by our error analysis is that WMLES performs as expected in\nregions where the flow resembles a zero-pressure-gradient flat plate boundary\nlayer. However, there is a clear decline of the current models in the presence\nof wing-body junctions and, more acutely, in separated zones. The slow\nconvergence to the solution in these regions renders the brute-force\ngrid-refinement approach to improve the accuracy of the solution unfeasible.\nThe results reported above pertain to the mean velocity profile predicted using\nthe typical grid resolution for external aerodynamics applications, i.e., 5--20\npoints per boundary-layer thickness. The prediction of the pressure coefficient\nis below 5\\% error for all grid sizes considered, even when boundary layers\nwere marginally resolved. The latter accuracy can be attributed to the\nouter-layer nature of the mean pressure, which becomes less sensitive to flow\ndetails within the turbulent boundary layer.

Our model represents both types and entity mentions as boxes.\nEach mention and its context are fed into a BERT-based model to embed that\nmention in our box space; essentially, this model leverages typological clues\npresent in the surface text to hypothesize a type representation for the\nmention. Box containment can then be used to derive both the posterior\nprobability of a mention exhibiting a given type and the conditional\nprobability relations between types themselves. We compare our approach with a\nvector-based typing model and observe state-of-the-art performance on several\nentity typing benchmarks. In addition to competitive typing performance, our\nbox-based model shows better performance in prediction consistency (predicting\na supertype and a subtype together) and confidence (i.e., calibration),\ndemonstrating that the box-based model captures the latent type hierarchies\nbetter than the vector-based model does.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2021 00:59:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 05:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

PDC is simultaneously a quantitative and visual approach to\nshowing separation of subpopulations. It uses subpopulation centers, the\nrespective variation about those centers and the relative subpopulation sizes.\nThis is accomplished by drawing motivation for the PDC from classical\npermutation based hypothesis testing, while taking that type of idea into\nnon-standard conceptual territory. In particular, the domain of very small P\nvalues is seen to seem to provide useful comparisons of data sets. Simulated\npermutation variation is carefully investigated, and we found that a balanced\npermutation approach is more informative in high signal (i.e large\nsubpopulation difference) contexts, than conventional approaches based on all\npermutations. This result is quite surprising in view of related work done in\nlow signal contexts, which came to the opposite conclusion. This issue is\nresolved by the proposal of an appropriate adjustment.

His\nstatistical theory of small-scale turbulence, which appears mathematically and\nphysically valid, successfully led to his contributions to (i) the closure\nproblem of turbulence; (ii) one-dimensional turbulence; (iii) two-dimensional\nturbulence; (iv) the turbulent passive scalar field; (v) the cascade model of\nturbulence; (vi) the universal equilibrium range of turbulence; (vii) a simple\nmodel of the bump phenomenon; (viii) universal constants of turbulence; (ix)\nthe intermittency of turbulence; and perhaps most importantly, (x) the effect\nof the Taylor microscale Reynolds number on both the width of the inertial\nrange of finite Re turbulence and the scaling exponents of velocity structure\nfunctions. In particular, Qian found that the inertial range cannot exist when\nRe is smaller than 2000. In contrast to the prevailing intermittency models, he\ndiscovered that normal scaling is valid in the real Kolmogorov inertial range\nwhen Re approaches infinity while the anomalous scaling observed in experiments\nreflects the finite Re effect. He then made a correction to the famous\nKolmogorov (1941c) equation and obtained the finite Re effect equation or the\nKolmogorov-Novikov-Qian equation. He also independently derived the decay law\nof the finite Re effect.

We adopt a\nrecently proposed concept, the age of information (AoI), to characterize the\ntimeliness of the status updates. In the considered system, delivering the\nstatus updates via the one-hop direct link will have a shorter transmission\ntime at the cost of incurring a higher error probability, while the delivery of\nstatus updates through the two-hop relay link could be more reliable at the\ncost of suffering longer transmission time. Thus, it is important to design the\nrelaying protocol of the considered system for optimizing the information\nfreshness.

By carefully analyzing\nthe evolution of the instantaneous AoI, we derive closed-form expressions of\nthe average AoI for both proposed AoR protocols. We further optimize the\ngeneration probability of the status updates at the source in both protocols.\nSimulation results validate our theoretical analysis, and demonstrate that the\ntwo proposed protocols outperform each other under various system parameters.\nMoreover, the protocol with better performance can achieve near-optimal\nperformance compared with the optimal scheduling policy attained by applying\nthe Markov decision process (MDP) tool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2021 06:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

This hypothesis is confirmed by a series of semantic probing\ntasks on which DelBERT (Derivation leveraging BERT), a model with derivational\ninput segmentation, substantially outperforms BERT with WordPiece segmentation.\nOur results suggest that the generalization capabilities of PLMs could be\nfurther improved if a morphologically-informed vocabulary of input tokens were\nused.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2021 08:36:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 16:05:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 14:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-03"}

It is suggested that retinal\nand conjunctival vascular tortuosity is a potential biomarker for such systemic\ndiseases. Most importantly, it is observed that the tortuosity depends on the\nthickness of these vessels. Therefore, selective calculation of tortuosity\nwithin specific vessel thicknesses is required depending on the disease being\nanalysed. In this paper, we propose a thickness sensitive vessel extraction\nframework that is primarily applicable for studies related to retinal and\nconjunctival vascular tortuosity. The framework uses a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork based on the IterNet architecture to obtain probability maps of the\nentire vasculature. They are then processed by a multi-scale vessel enhancement\ntechnique that exploits both fine and coarse structural vascular details of\nthese probability maps in order to extract vessels of specified thicknesses. We\nevaluated the proposed framework on four datasets including DRIVE and SBVPI,\nand obtained Matthew's Correlation Coefficient values greater than 0.71 for all\nthe datasets. In addition, the proposed framework was utilized to determine the\nassociation of diabetes with retinal and conjunctival vascular tortuosity.

While supervised deep learning\n(DL)-based approaches represent the state-of-the-art in automatic nuclei\ninstance segmentation, annotated datasets are required to train these models.\nThere are two main types of tissue processing protocols, namely formalin-fixed\nparaffin-embedded samples (FFPE) and frozen tissue samples (FS). Although\nFFPE-derived H&E stained tissue sections are the most widely used samples, H&E\nstaining on frozen sections derived from FS samples is a relevant method in\nintra-operative surgical sessions as it can be performed fast. Due to\ndifferences in the protocols of these two types of samples, the derived images\nand in particular the nuclei appearance may be different in the acquired whole\nslide images. Analysis of FS-derived H&E stained images can be more challenging\nas rapid preparation, staining, and scanning of FS sections may lead to\ndeterioration in image quality.\n  In this paper, we introduce CryoNuSeg, the first fully annotated FS-derived\ncryosectioned and H&E-stained nuclei instance segmentation dataset. The dataset\ncontains images from 10 human organs that were not exploited in other publicly\navailable datasets, and is provided with three manual mark-ups to allow\nmeasuring intra-observer and inter-observer variability. Moreover, we\ninvestigate the effects of tissue fixation/embedding protocol (i.e., FS or\nFFPE) on the automatic nuclei instance segmentation performance of one of the\nstate-of-the-art DL approaches.

The governing system here is of\nmixed elliptic-hyperbolic and changes type and the suitable formulation of\nboundary conditions at the boundaries is of great importance. First, we\nestablish the existence and uniqueness of smooth cylindrical transonic spiral\nsolutions with nonzero angular velocity and vorticity which are close to the\nbackground transonic flow with small perturbations of the Bernoulli's function\nand the entropy at the outer cylinder and the flow angles at both the inner and\nouter cylinders independent of the symmetric axis, and it is shown that in this\ncase, the sonic points of the flow are nonexceptional and noncharacteristically\ndegenerate, and form a cylindrical surface. Second, we also prove the existence\nand uniqueness of axi-symmetric smooth transonic rotational flows which are\nadjacent to the background transonic flow, whose sonic points form an\naxi-symmetric surface. The key elements in our analysis are to utilize the\ndeformation-curl decomposition for the steady Euler system introduced in\n\\cite{WengXin19} to deal with the hyperbolicity in subsonic regions and to find\nan appropriate multiplier for the linearized second order mixed type equations\nwhich are crucial to identify the suitable boundary conditions and to yield the\nimportant basic energy estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2021 13:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

X-ray magnetic linear\ndichroism (XMLD) signals, which sense magnetic ordering processes at surfaces,\nstart to increase monotonically below the N\\'eel temperature TN = 57 K. This\nincrease is due to a progressive bicollinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) alignment\nof Fe spins of the monoclinic Fe1+yTe parent phase. This AFM alignment was\nachieved by a [100]-oriented biasing field favoring a single-domain state\nduring cooling across TN. Our specific heat and magnetization measurements\nconfirm the bulk character of this AFM phase transition. On longer time scales,\nhowever, we observe that the field-biased AFM state is highly unstable even at\nthe lowest temperature of T = 3 K. After switching off the biasing field, the\nXMLD signal decays exponentially with a time constant {\\tau} = 1506 s. The\ninitial XMLD signal is restored only upon repeating a cycle consisting of\nheating and field-cooling through TN. We explain the time effect by a gradual\nformation of a multi-domain state with 90 deg rotated AFM domains, promoted by\nstructural disorder, facilitating the motion of twin-domains. Significant\ndisorder in our Fe1+yTe sample is evident from our X-ray diffraction and\nspecific heat data.

However,\nthis problem is notoriously difficult due to the high-dimensional, sparse,\nnoisy, and skewed nature of OD matrices. This paper proposes a High-order\nWeighted Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HW-DMD) model for short-term metro OD\nmatrices forecasting. DMD uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract\nlow-rank approximation from OD data, and a low-rank high-order vector\nautoregression model is established for forecasting. To address a practical\nissue that metro OD matrices cannot be observed in real-time, we use the\nboarding demand to replace the unavailable OD matrices. Particularly, we\nconsider the time-evolving feature of metro systems and improve the forecast by\nexponentially reducing the weights for old data. Moreover, we develop a\ntailored online update algorithm for HW-DMD to update the model coefficients\ndaily without storing historical data or retraining. Experiments on data from a\nlarge-scale metro system show the proposed HW-DMD is robust to the noisy and\nsparse data and significantly outperforms baseline models in forecasting both\nOD matrices and boarding flow. The online update algorithm also shows\nconsistent accuracy over a long time when maintaining an HW-DMD model at low\ncosts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2021 15:24:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 16:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

Using exploratory statistics, the analysis uses a novel tool\nto leverage the long-range dependency (LRD) intrinsic to PTA to resolve when\nsuch factor(s) may have caused significant disruptions in the evolution of the\nindices, and thus give insight into substantive economic growth dynamics.\nApproach: This paper explores the use of the Chronological Hurst Exponent (CHE)\nto explore the LRD using overlapping time windows to quantify long-memory\ndynamics in the monthly PTA time-series spanning 1977 to 2016.\nResults/Discussion: The CHE is found to increase in a clear S-curve pattern,\nachieving persistence (H~1) from non-persistence (H~0.5).

The post-1990s exogenic factors seem to be simply maintaining the high\ndegree and consistency of the persistency metric.

Glide-symmetric holey waveguides provide a higher\npropagation constant and a low dispersion over a wide frequency range regarding\nhollow waveguides. This property is particularly useful for the design of\nlow-loss and low-dispersive phase shifters. We also demonstrate that\nglide-symmetric holey waveguides are less dispersive than waveguides loaded\nwith glide-symmetric pins.

Specifically, we consider a multi-agent partially\nobservable Markov decision process (MA-POMDP), in which the agents, in addition\nto interacting with the environment can also communicate with each other over a\nnoisy communication channel. The noisy communication channel is considered\nexplicitly as part of the dynamics of the environment and the message each\nagent sends is part of the action that the agent can take. As a result, the\nagents learn not only to collaborate with each other but also to communicate\n\"effectively\" over a noisy channel. This framework generalizes both the\ntraditional communication problem, where the main goal is to convey a message\nreliably over a noisy channel, and the \"learning to communicate\" framework that\nhas received recent attention in the MARL literature, where the underlying\ncommunication channels are assumed to be error-free. We show via examples that\nthe joint policy learned using the proposed framework is superior to that where\nthe communication is considered separately from the underlying MA-POMDP.
