The\nchallenge lies in that visual encoding in brain is highly complex and not fully\nrevealed. Inspired by the theory that visual features are hierarchically\nrepresented in cortex, we propose to break the complex visual signals into\nmulti-level components and decode each component separately. Specifically, we\ndecode shape and semantic representations from the lower and higher visual\ncortex respectively, and merge the shape and semantic information to images by\na generative adversarial network (Shape-Semantic GAN). This 'divide and\nconquer' strategy captures visual information more accurately. Experiments\ndemonstrate that Shape-Semantic GAN improves the reconstruction similarity and\nimage quality, and achieves the state-of-the-art image reconstruction\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 16:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

Experimental results\nshow that the proposed approach is effective in detecting both powerful\nadversarial examples and out-of-distribution inputs, introducing limited\nextra-execution time and memory requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 16:38:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 20:31:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 23:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

DA enables networks to overcome the\ndistribution mismatch between the source and target that leads to poor\ngeneralization in the target domain. DA techniques align these distributions by\nminimizing a divergence measurement between source and target, making the\ntransfer of knowledge from source to target possible. While these algorithms\nhave advanced significantly in recent years, most do not explicitly leverage\nglobal data manifold structure in aligning the source and target. We propose to\nleverage global data structure by applying a topological data analysis (TDA)\ntechnique called persistent homology to TL.\n  In this paper, we examine the use of persistent homology in a domain\nadversarial (DAd) convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The\nexperiments show that aligning persistence alone is insufficient for transfer,\nbut must be considered along with the lifetimes of the topological\nsingularities. In addition, we found that longer lifetimes indicate robust\ndiscriminative features and more favorable structure in data. We found that\nexisting divergence minimization based approaches to DA improve the topological\nstructure, as indicated over a baseline without these regularization\ntechniques. We hope these experiments highlight how topological structure can\nbe leveraged to boost performance in TL tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 16:45:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

These dynamical processes are universal in\n'ordinary' GF fluids and collectively describe their 'fast dynamics', and we\nfind these relaxation processes also arise in a GF liquid exhibiting a\nfragile-strong transition. String-like particle motion, having both an\nirreversible and reversible nature ('stringlets') component, occurs in the\nfast-dynamics regime, corresponding to a ps timescale. String-like collective\nmotion associated with localized unstable modes facilitate irreversible and\nintermittent particle 'jumping' events at long times associated with the JG\n$\\beta$-relaxation process, while stringlets associated with localized stable\nmodes and corresponding perfectly reversible atomic motion give rise to the\nBoson peak. To further clarify the origin of the Boson peak, we calculate the\ndensity of states for both the stringlet particles and the 'normal' particles\nand find that the stringlet particles give rise to a Boson peak while the\nnormal atoms do not. The growth of stringlets upon heating ultimately also\nleads to the 'softening' of these excitations, and the Boson peak frequency and\nshear modulus drop in concert with this softening. The growth of string-like\ncollective motion upon heating in the fast-dynamics regime is further shown to\nbe responsible for the growth in the intensity of the fast relaxation process.\nRelaxation in cooled liquids clearly involves a hierarchy of relaxation\nprocesses acting on rather different time and spatial scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 16:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

We postulate a set of coherent states to\nexpress a transition amplitude in the spin chain as a path integral. We observe\nthat the temporal interval is discretised in terms of the step length of the\nspatial interval. This relationship implies that the Landau-Lifshitz limit of\nthe spin chain involves both intervals.

A recently proposed way to hide an\nindividual's genetic information is to mix in DNA samples of other individuals.\nWe assume these samples are known to the individual but unknown to the\nsequencing laboratory. Thus, these DNA samples act as \"noise\" to the sequencing\nlaboratory, but still allow the individual to recover their own DNA samples\nafterward. Motivated by this idea, we study the problem of hiding a binary\nrandom variable X (a genetic marker) with the additive noise provided by mixing\nDNA samples, using mutual information as a privacy metric. This is equivalent\nto the problem of finding a worst-case noise distribution for recovering X from\nthe noisy observation among a set of feasible discrete distributions. We\ncharacterize upper and lower bounds to the solution of this problem, which are\nempirically shown to be very close. The lower bound is obtained through a\nconvex relaxation of the original discrete optimization problem, and yields a\nclosed-form expression. The upper bound is computed via a greedy algorithm for\nselecting the mixing proportions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 17:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

Input pipelines for machine learning jobs are often challenging to\nimplement efficiently as they require reading large volumes of data, applying\ncomplex transformations, and transferring data to hardware accelerators while\noverlapping computation and communication to achieve optimal performance. We\npresent tf.data, a framework for building and executing efficient input\npipelines for machine learning jobs. The tf.data API provides operators which\ncan be parameterized with user-defined computation, composed, and reused across\ndifferent machine learning domains. These abstractions allow users to focus on\nthe application logic of data processing, while tf.data's runtime ensures that\npipelines run efficiently.\n  We demonstrate that input pipeline performance is critical to the end-to-end\ntraining time of state-of-the-art machine learning models. tf.data delivers the\nhigh performance required, while avoiding the need for manual tuning of\nperformance knobs.

Unlike in\nprevious observing runs in the advanced detector era, we include Virgo in the\nsearch for the GWB. The results are consistent with uncorrelated noise, and\ntherefore we place upper limits on the strength of the GWB. We find that the\ndimensionless energy density $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}\\leq 5.8\\times 10^{-9}$ at the 95%\ncredible level for a flat (frequency-independent) GWB, using a prior which is\nuniform in the log of the strength of the GWB, with 99% of the sensitivity\ncoming from the band 20-76.6 Hz; $\\leq 3.4 \\times 10^{-9}$ at 25 Hz for a\npower-law GWB with a spectral index of 2/3 (consistent with expectations for\ncompact binary coalescences), in the band 20-90.6 Hz; and $\\leq 3.9 \\times\n10^{-10}$ at 25 Hz for a spectral index of 3, in the band 20-291.6 Hz. These\nupper limits improve over our previous results by a factor of 6.0 for a flat\nGWB. We also search for a GWB arising from scalar and vector modes, which are\npredicted by alternative theories of gravity; we place upper limits on the\nstrength of GWBs with these polarizations. We demonstrate that there is no\nevidence of correlated noise of magnetic origin by performing a Bayesian\nanalysis that allows for the presence of both a GWB and an effective magnetic\nbackground arising from geophysical Schumann resonances. We compare our upper\nlimits to a fiducial model for the GWB from the merger of compact binaries.\nFinally, we combine our results with observations of individual mergers andshow\nthat, at design sensitivity, this joint approach may yield stronger constraints\non the merger rate of binary black holes at $z \\lesssim 2$ than can be achieved\nwith individually resolved mergers alone.

The particle impact point is typically determined by\ninterpolating the charge collected by several neighboring pads. However, to\neffectively extract the inherent positional information, the lateral spacing of\nthe straight pads must be significantly smaller than the extent of the charge\ncloud.

One of its main challenging,\ncatastrophic forgetting, is caused by the neural networks non-optimal ability\nto learn in non-stationary distributions. In most settings of the current\napproaches, the agent starts from randomly initialized parameters and is\noptimized to master the current task regardless of the usefulness of the\nlearned representation for future tasks. Moreover, each of the future tasks\nuses all the previously learned knowledge although parts of this knowledge\nmight not be helpful for its learning. These cause interference among tasks,\nespecially when the data of previous tasks is not accessible. In this paper, we\npropose a new method, named Self-Attention Meta-Learner (SAM), which learns a\nprior knowledge for continual learning that permits learning a sequence of\ntasks, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. SAM incorporates an attention\nmechanism that learns to select the particular relevant representation for each\nfuture task. Each task builds a specific representation branch on top of the\nselected knowledge, avoiding the interference between tasks. We evaluate the\nproposed method on the Split CIFAR-10/100 and Split MNIST benchmarks in the\ntask agnostic inference. We empirically show that we can achieve a better\nperformance than several state-of-the-art methods for continual learning by\nbuilding on the top of selected representation learned by SAM. We also show the\nrole of the meta-attention mechanism in boosting informative features\ncorresponding to the input data and identifying the correct target in the task\nagnostic inference. Finally, we demonstrate that popular existing continual\nlearning methods gain a performance boost when they adopt SAM as a starting\npoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 17:35:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

We combined multiple datasets from the Rosetta mission through a\nmulti-instrument analysis to complete the first forward modelling of FUV\nemissions in the southern hemisphere of comet 67P and compared modelled\nbrightnesses to observations with the Alice FUV imaging spectrograph. We\nmodelled the brightness of OI1356, OI1304, Lyman-$\\beta$, CI1657, and CII1335\nemissions, which are associated with the dissociation products of the four\nmajor neutral species in the coma: CO$_2$, H$_2$O, CO, and O$_2$.

The modelled and observed brightnesses of the FUV emission lines\nagree closely when viewing nadir and dissociative excitation by electron impact\nis shown to be the dominant source of emissions away from perihelion.

However, they exhibit\nvery different spreading behaviours: whereas chocolate exhibits slow long-term\nspreading, the Carbopol drop rapidly relaxes its stress by spreading to a new\nequilibrium shape with an enlarged footprint. This spreading is insensitive to\nthe history of the forcing. In addition, the Carbopol drop performs\nlarge-amplitude oscillations with the forcing frequency, both above and below\nthe threshold. We investigate these viscoelastic oscillations and provide\nevidence of complex nonlinear viscoelastic behaviour in the vicinity of the\nspreading threshold. In fact, for forcing accelerations greater than the\nspreading threshold, our drop automatically adjusts its shape to remain at the\nyield stress. We discuss how our vibrated-drop experiment offers a new and\npowerful approach to probing the yield transition in elastoviscoplastic fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 18:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

However moderately\nlarge learning rates can achieve higher test accuracies, and this\ngeneralization benefit is not explained by convergence bounds, since the\nlearning rate which maximizes test accuracy is often larger than the learning\nrate which minimizes training loss. To interpret this phenomenon we prove that\nfor SGD with random shuffling, the mean SGD iterate also stays close to the\npath of gradient flow if the learning rate is small and finite, but on a\nmodified loss. This modified loss is composed of the original loss function and\nan implicit regularizer, which penalizes the norms of the minibatch gradients.\nUnder mild assumptions, when the batch size is small the scale of the implicit\nregularization term is proportional to the ratio of the learning rate to the\nbatch size.

Due to the fiber core made of soft glass with high\nnonlinearity high switching contrast exceeding 20 dB is attained under\napplication of control pulses of only few nanojoule energy. The optimization of\nthe fiber length brought the best results at 14 mm, which is in good\ncorrespondence with the calculated coupling length at the signal wavelength.\nThe results express significant progress in comparison to similar studies based\non self-switching of solitonic pulses in dual-core fibers and represent high\napplication potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 18:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

The\nprime target of CMB lensing surveys is the lensing potential, which is\nreconstructed from observed CMB temperature $T$ and polarization $E$ and $B$\nfields. Until very recently, this reconstruction has been performed with\nquadratic estimators (QEs), which, although known to be suboptimal for\nhigh-sensitivity experiments, are numerically efficient, and useful to make\nforecasts and cross-check the results of more sophisticated likelihood-based\nmethods. It is expected that ongoing and near-future CMB experiments such as\nAdvACT, SPT-3G and the Simons Observatory (SO), will also rely on QEs. Here, we\nreview different QEs, and clarify their differences. In particular, we show\nthat the Hu-Okamoto (HO02) estimator is not the absolute optimal lensing\nestimator that can be constructed out of quadratic combinations of $T, E$ and\n$B$ fields. Instead, we derive the global-minimum-variance (GMV) lensing\nquadratic estimator. Although this estimator can be found elsewhere in the\nliterature, it was erroneously described as equivalent to the HO02 estimator,\nand has never been used in real data analyses. Here, we show explicitly that\nthe HO02 estimator is suboptimal to the GMV estimator, with a reconstruction\nnoise larger by up to $\\sim 9\\%$ for a SO-like experiment. We further show that\nthe QE used in the Planck, and recent SPT lensing analysis are suboptimal to\nboth the HO02 and GMV estimator, and would have a reconstruction noise up to\n$\\sim 11\\%$ larger than that of the GMV estimator for a SO-like experiment. In\naddition to clarifying differences between different QEs, this work should thus\nprovide motivation to implement the GMV estimator in future lensing analyses\nrelying on QEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 18:54:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 16:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Here, we consider\nminimally-coupled test scalar fields propagating on compact object solutions of\nthe Horndeski action, which possess an effective cosmological constant, leading\nto anti-de Sitter asymptotics, and show that echoes can form in the ringdown\nwaveform due to the entrapment of test fields between the photon sphere and the\neffective asymptotic boundary.

Young and embedded stellar populations are important probes of the\nstar formation process. Paradoxically, we have a better census of nearby\nembedded young populations than the slightly more evolved optically visible\nyoung populations. The high accuracy measurements and all-sky coverage of Gaia\ndata are about to change this situation. Aims. This work aims to construct the\nmost complete sample to date of YSOs in the $\\rho$ Oph region. Methods. We\ncompile a catalog of 1114 Ophiuchus YSOs from the literature and crossmatch it\nwith the Gaia EDR3, Gaia-ESO and APOGEE-2 surveys. We apply a multivariate\nclassification algorithm to this catalog to identify new, co-moving population\ncandidates. Results. We find 191 new high-fidelity YSO candidates in the Gaia\nEDR3 catalog belonging to the $\\rho$ Oph region. The new sources appear to be\nmainly Class III M-stars and substellar objects and are less extincted than the\nknown members. We find 28 previously unknown sources with disks. The analysis\nof the proper motion distribution of the entire sample reveals a well-defined\nbimodality, implying two distinct populations sharing a similar 3D volume. The\nfirst population comprises young stars' clusters around the $\\rho$ Ophiuchi\nstar and the main Ophiuchus clouds (L1688, L1689, L1709). In contrast, the\nsecond population is older ($\\sim$ 10 Myr), dispersed, has a distinct proper\nmotion, and is possibly from the Upper Sco group. The two populations are\nmoving away from each other at about 4.1 km/s, and will no longer overlap in\nabout 4 Myr. Finally, we flag 17 sources in the literature as impostors, which\nare sources that exhibit large deviations from the average distance and proper\nmotion properties of the $\\rho$ Oph population. Our results show the importance\nof accurate 3D space and motion information for improved stellar population\nanalysis.

Despite numerous studies concerning contact resistance in 2D\nsemiconductors, the exact nature of the buried interface under a\nthree-dimensional (3D) metal remains unclear.

We characterize the spatially varying electronic and\noptical properties of this buried interface with < 20 nm resolution. To be\nspecific, potential, conductance and photoluminescence at the buried\nmetal/MoS$_2$ interface are correlated as a function of a variety of metal\ndeposition conditions as well as the type of metal contacts. We observe that\ndirect evaporation of Au on MoS$_2$ induces a large strain of ~5% in the\nMoS$_2$ which, coupled with charge transfer, leads to degenerate doping of the\nMoS$_2$ underneath the contact. These factors lead to improvement of contact\nresistance to record values of 138 kohm-um, as measured using local conductance\nprobes. This approach was adopted to characterize MoS$_2$-In/Au alloy\ninterfaces, demonstrating contact resistance as low as 63 kohm-um.

This paper proposes a general framework of\nFMAB and then studies two specific federated bandit models. We first study the\napproximate model where the heterogeneous local models are random realizations\nof the global model from an unknown distribution. This model introduces a new\nuncertainty of client sampling, as the global model may not be reliably learned\neven if the finite local models are perfectly known. Furthermore, this\nuncertainty cannot be quantified a priori without knowledge of the\nsuboptimality gap. We solve the approximate model by proposing Federated Double\nUCB (Fed2-UCB), which constructs a novel \"double UCB\" principle accounting for\nuncertainties from both arm and client sampling. We show that gradually\nadmitting new clients is critical in achieving an O(log(T)) regret while\nexplicitly considering the communication cost. The exact model, where the\nglobal bandit model is the exact average of heterogeneous local models, is then\nstudied as a special case.

The difference in relative extents increases with\nredshift because the observed-frame 1.6 $\\mu$m emission stems from ever shorter\nwavelength stellar emission. These results suggest that the compact\ndust-continuum emission observed in $z>1$ galaxies is not (necessarily)\nevidence of the buildup of a dense central stellar component. We also find that\nthe dust-continuum half-light radius very closely follows the radius containing\nhalf the star formation in galaxies, indicating that single band dust-continuum\nemission is a good tracer of the location of (obscured) star formation. The\ndust-continuum emission is more compact than the H2 mass (for galaxies at\n$z\\geq 2$) and the underlying dust mass. The dust emission strongly correlates\nwith locations with the highest dust temperatures, which do not need to be the\nlocations where most H$_2$ and/or dust is located. The presented results are a\ncommon feature of main-sequence galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

With\nthe goal of enabling reproducible workflows for its users, GLEAM employs a\nsmall number of input files, including a central, user-friendly configuration\nin which fitting constraints can be defined for groups of spectra and overrides\ncan be specified for edge cases. For each spectrum, GLEAM produces a table\ncontaining measurements and error bars for the detected spectral lines and\ncontinuum, and upper limits for non-detections. For visual inspection and\npublishing, GLEAM can also produce plots of the data with fitted lines\noverlaid. In the present paper, we describe GLEAM's main features, the\nnecessary inputs, expected outputs, and some example applications, including\nthorough tests on a large sample of optical/infra-red multi-object\nspectroscopic observations and integral field spectroscopic data. gleam is\ndeveloped as an open-source project hosted at\nhttps://github.com/multiwavelength/gleam and welcomes community contributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 19:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

The objective is minimizing the number of object transfers under the\nassumption that the robot can manipulate one object at a time.

In the meantime, vehicular environment radio\npropagation is negatively influenced by a large set of objects that cause\ntransmission distortion such as high buildings. Therefore, this work is devoted\nto explore the area of RIS technology integration with vehicular communications\nwhile considering the dynamic nature of such communication environment.\nSpecifically, we provide a system model where RoadSide Unit (RSU) leverages RIS\nto provide indirect wireless transmissions to disconnected areas, known as dark\nzones. Dark zones are spots within RSU coverage where the communication links\nare blocked due to the existence of blockages. In details, a discrete RIS is\nutilized to provide communication links between the RSU and the vehicles\npassing through out-of-service zones.

However, such work is\noften susceptible to problems of infra-marginality -- that the data we observe\ncan only describe average outcomes, and not the outcomes associated with the\nmarginal decision.\n  In this work, we address this problem by creating a hierarchical Bayesian\nmodel of cash bail assignments. Specifically, our approach models cash bail\ndecisions as a probabilistic process whereby judges balance the relative costs\nof assigning cash bail with the cost of defendants potentially skipping court\ndates, and where these skip probabilities are estimated based upon features of\nthe individual case. We then use Monte Carlo inference to sample the\ndistribution over these costs for different magistrates and across different\nraces. We fit this model to a data set we have collected of over 50,000 court\ncases in the Allegheny and Philadelphia counties in Pennsylvania. Our analysis\nof 50 separate judges shows that they are uniformly more likely to assign cash\nbail to black defendants than to white defendants, even given identical\nlikelihood of skipping a court appearance. This analysis raises further\nquestions about the equity of the practice of cash bail, irrespective of its\nunderlying legal justification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 20:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-01"}

We therefore propose that the correct invariant is not\nthe persistence diagram of X, but rather the collection of persistence diagrams\nof many small subsets. This invariant, which we call \"distributed persistence,\"\nis perfectly parallelizable, more stable to outliers, and has a rich inverse\ntheory. The map from the space of point clouds (with the quasi-isometry metric)\nto the space of distributed persistence invariants (with the\nHausdorff-Bottleneck distance) is a global quasi-isometry. This is a much\nstronger property than simply being injective, as it implies that the inverse\nof a small neighborhood is a small neighborhood, and is to our knowledge the\nonly result of its kind in the TDA literature. Moreover, the quasi-isometry\nbounds depend on the size of the subsets taken, so that as the size of these\nsubsets goes from small to large, the invariant interpolates between a purely\ngeometric one and a topological one. Lastly, we note that our inverse results\ndo not actually require considering all subsets of a fixed size (an enormous\ncollection), but a relatively small collection satisfying certain covering\nproperties that arise with high probability when randomly sampling subsets.\nThese theoretical results are complemented by two synthetic experiments\ndemonstrating the use of distributed persistence in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 21:36:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 22:35:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 16:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

Even though the typical\nresonance frequency of a magnet ranges from gigahertz to terahertz, experiments\nalso report the resonance near zero frequency in a large class of magnets. Here\nwe revisit this phenomenon by analyzing the symmetry of the system and find\nthat the resonance frequency ($\\omega$) follows a universal power law $\\omega\n\\varpropto |H-H_c|^p$, where $H_c$ is the critical field at which the resonance\nfrequency is zero. When the magnet preserves the rotational symmetry around the\nexternal field ($H$), $p = 1$. Otherwise, $p=1/2$. The magnon excitations are\ngapped above $H_c$, gapless at $H_c$ and gapped again below $H_c$. The zero\nfrequency is often accompanied by a reorientation transition in the\nmagnetization. For the case that $p=1/2$, this transition is described by a\nLandau theory for second-order phase transitions. We further show that the spin\ncurrent driven by thermal gradient and spin-orbit effects can be significantly\nenhanced when the resonance frequency is close to zero, which can be measured\nelectrically by converting the spin current into electric signals. This may\nprovide an experimentally accessible way to characterize the critical field.\nOur findings provide a unified understanding of the magnetization dynamics near\nthe critical field, and may, furthermore, inspire the study of magnon transport\nnear magnetic transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 21:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

While such stresses and strains have been examined\ncomputationally in model systems with assumed constitutive models (e.g.,\nfinite-deformation Neo-Hookean model) and viscoelastic properties determined\nunder quasi-static conditions, recent studies proposed that the Quadratic Law\nKelvin-Voigt (QLKV) constitutive model, which additionally accounts for strain\nstiffening, more accurately represents the viscoelastic response of soft\nmaterials subjected to cavitation; this model has also been used to infer\nviscoelastic properties at high rates. In this work, we use the QLKV model and\nthese properties to calculate the time-dependent stress, strain, and strain\nrate fields produced during the growth and collapse of individual bubbles\nsubjected to a histotripsy-relevant pressure waveform in agarose gels of 0.3~\\%\nand 1.0~\\% concentration and corresponding to actual (past) experiments. We\nfind that, as the gel concentration is increased, strain stiffening manifests\nin larger elastic stresses and compressive stresses extending into the collapse\nphase, particularly for the 1.0~\\% concentration gel. As a result, the duration\nof the collapse phase also increases. In comparison with the conventional\nNeo-Hookean model, the compressive stress has a larger magnitude, extends\nfarther into the surrounding medium, and shows an increased departure from\ngrowth/collapse symmetry close to the bubble; all of these effects are\nmagnified in the stiffer gel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 22:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-01"}

In the fault-free\ncase, when all the agents are honest, the P2P distributed gradient-descent\nmethod allows all the agents to reach a consensus on a solution that minimizes\ntheir aggregate cost. However, we consider a scenario where a certain number of\nagents may be Byzantine faulty. Such faulty agents may not follow an algorithm\ncorrectly, and may share arbitrary incorrect information to prevent other\nnon-faulty agents from solving the optimization problem. In the presence of\nByzantine faulty agents, a more reasonable goal is to allow all the non-faulty\nagents to reach a consensus on a solution that minimizes the aggregate cost of\nall the non-faulty agents.

In the active systems a yielding\ntransition is observed as expected, when the self-propulsion is increased.\nHowever, the range of self-propulsions in which a pure liquid regime exist\nappears to vanish upon approaching the so-called \"jamming point\" at which\nsolidity of soft-sphere packings is lost. Such an \"active yielding\" transition\nshares similarities with the generic yielding transition for shear flows. A\nHerschel-Bulkley law is observed in both loading scenarios, with a clear\ndifference in the critical scaling exponents between the two, suggesting the\nexistent of different universality classes for the yielding transition under\ndifferent driving conditions.

Perfect auxetics are characterized by a Poisson's ratio $\\nu=-1$\nover a finite strain range and can be modeled as materials composed of rotating\nrigid units. Inspired by a natural connection between these rotating rigid\nunits with an antiferromagnetic spin system, here are unveiled the conditions\nfor the emergence of a non-trivial floppy mode responsible for the auxetic\nbehavior. Furthermore, this model paves a simple pathway for the design of new\nauxetic materials, based on three simple steps, which set the sufficient\nconnectivity and geometrical constraints for perfect auxetics. In particular, a\nnew exotic crystal, a Penrose quasi-crystal and the long desired isotropic\nauxetic material are designed and constructed for the first time. Using 3D\nprinted materials, finite element methods and this rigid unit model, the\nauxetic behavior of these designs is shown to be robust under small\ndisturbances in the structure, though the Poisson's ratio value relies on\nsystem's details, approaching $-1$ close to the ideal case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 01:44:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 18:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

Traditional DFM uses the so-called\nhybrid-dimensional approach to treat fractures explicitly as low-dimensional\nentries (e.g. line entries in 2D media and face entries in 3D media) on the\ninterfaces of matrix cells and then couple the matrix and fracture flow systems\ntogether based on the principle of superposition with the fracture thickness\nused as the dimensional homogeneity factor. Because of this methodology, DFM is\nconsidered to be limited on conforming meshes and thus may raise difficulties\nin generating high quality unstructured meshes due to the complexity of\nfracture's geometrical morphology. In this paper, we clarify that the DFM\nactually can be extended to non-conforming meshes without any essential\nchanges. To show it clearly, we provide another perspective for DFM based on\nhybrid-dimensional representation of permeability tensor to describe fractures\nas one-dimensional line Dirac delta functions contained in permeability tensor.\nA finite element DFM scheme for single-phase flow on non-conforming meshes is\nthen derived by applying Galerkin finite element method to it. Analytical\nanalysis and numerical experiments show that our DFM automatically degenerates\nto the classical finite element DFM when the mesh is conforming with fractures.\nMoreover, the accuracy and efficiency of the model on non-conforming meshes are\ndemonstrated by testing several benchmark problems. This model is also\napplicable to curved fracture with variable thickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 02:08:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-01"}

For such events, the sky locations of sources can\nbe pinpointed with techniques such as identifying the host galaxies. However,\nthe cosmological applications of these events still suffer from the problem of\ndegeneracy between luminosity distance and inclination angle. To address this\nissue, a technique was proposed in previous study, i.e., using the property of\nSGRBs. Based on the observations, we assume that the cosine of inclination\nfollows a Gaussian distribution, which may act as a prior in the Bayes analysis\nto break the degeneracy. This paper investigates the effects of different\nGaussian priors and detector configurations on distance measurement and\ncosmological research. We first derive a simplified Fisher information matrix\nfor demonstration, and then conduct quantitative analyses via simulation. By\nvarying the number of third-generation detectors and the scale of prior, we\ngenerate four catalogs of 1000 events. It is shown that, in the same detecting\nperiod, a network of detectors can recognize more and farther events than a\nsingle detector. Besides, adopting tighter prior and employing multiple\ndetectors both decrease the error of luminosity distance. Also considered is\nthe performance of a widely adopted formula in the error budget, which turns\nout to be a conservative choice in each case.

This study demonstrates wide-range epitaxial strain\ncontrol of electrical and magnetic properties in high-quality SrRuO3 films. The\nepitaxial strain was imposed by cubic or pseudocubic perovskite substrates\nhaving a lattice mismatch of -1.6 to 2.3% with reference to bulk SrRuO3.

In\nthis work, we show that standard deep learning approaches to 3D pose estimation\nare not robust when objects are partially occluded or viewed from a previously\nunseen pose. Inspired by the robustness of generative vision models to partial\nocclusion, we propose to integrate deep neural networks with 3D generative\nrepresentations of objects into a unified neural architecture that we term\nNeMo. In particular, NeMo learns a generative model of neural feature\nactivations at each vertex on a dense 3D mesh. Using differentiable rendering\nwe estimate the 3D object pose by minimizing the reconstruction error between\nNeMo and the feature representation of the target image. To avoid local optima\nin the reconstruction loss, we train the feature extractor to maximize the\ndistance between the individual feature representations on the mesh using\ncontrastive learning. Our extensive experiments on PASCAL3D+,\noccluded-PASCAL3D+ and ObjectNet3D show that NeMo is much more robust to\npartial occlusion and unseen pose compared to standard deep networks, while\nretaining competitive performance on regular data. Interestingly, our\nexperiments also show that NeMo performs reasonably well even when the mesh\nrepresentation only crudely approximates the true object geometry with a\ncuboid, hence revealing that the detailed 3D geometry is not needed for\naccurate 3D pose estimation.

The C-J detonation velocity is\ndefined as the stable operation boundary of scramjets, which is the maximum\nshock wave produced by combustion theoretically. The scramjets will work stable\nif the velocity in the isolator is faster than the corresponding C-J detonation\nvelocity. The combustion characteristics and propulsive performance of\nscramjets is theoretically analyzed by using C-J detonation theory. For high\nMach number scramjets, the velocity in the isolator is much faster than the C-J\ndetonation velocity. Therefore, extra fuel and oxygen can be injected into the\ncombustor to increase the thrust as long as the shock wave velocity driven by\nthe combustion products is slower than the air velocity in the isolator. The\ntheoretical results agree well with the existing experimental results, which\ncan be used as a baseline for the development of scramjets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 03:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-01"}

The investigation of such a team reported in this paper provides one\nexample of an alternative approach to research in a global context, through a\nlongitudinal interpretive field study seeking to understand how global virtual\nteams mediated the use of technology. Objective: Our focus in this paper is on\nthe conduct of research in the context of global software activities,\nparticularly as applied to the actions and interactions of global virtual\nteams. Method: We describe how we undertook a substantial field study of global\nvirtual teams, and highlight how the adopted structuration theory enabled us to\ndeliver effectively against our goals. Results: We believe that the approach\ntaken suited a research context in which situated practices were occurring over\ntime in a highly complex domain, ensuring that our results were both strongly\ngrounded and relevant to practice. It has resulted in the generation of\nsubstantive theory and techniques that have been adapted and applied on a pilot\nbasis in further field settings.

Traditional metrics for evaluation of these algorithms\n(e.g. ROUGE scores) rely on matching algorithmic summaries to human-generated\nones. However, it has been shown that when the textual contents are\nheterogeneous, e.g., when they come from different socially salient groups,\nmost existing summarization algorithms represent the social groups very\ndifferently compared to their distribution in the original data. To mitigate\nsuch adverse impacts, some fairness-preserving summarization algorithms have\nalso been proposed. All of these studies have considered normative notions of\nfairness from the perspective of writers of the contents, neglecting the\nreaders' perceptions of the underlying fairness notions. To bridge this gap, in\nthis work, we study the interplay between the fairness notions and how readers\nperceive them in textual summaries. Through our experiments, we show that\nreader's perception of fairness is often context-sensitive. Moreover, standard\nROUGE evaluation metrics are unable to quantify the perceived (un)fairness of\nthe summaries. To this end, we propose a human-in-the-loop metric and an\nautomated graph-based methodology to quantify the perceived bias in textual\nsummaries.

The [Fe/H]\nmetallicity from LAMOST DR5 for 146184 high-quality calibration stars, defined\nwith S/N > 10 in J-PLUS passbands and S/N > 3 in Gaia parallax, was used to\ncompute the metallicity-dependent stellar locus (ZSL). The initial\nhomogenization of J-PLUS photometry, performed with a unique stellar locus, was\nrefined by including the metallicity effect in colours via the ZSL. The\nvariation of the average metallicity along the Milky Way produces a systematic\noffset in J-PLUS calibration. This effect is well above 1% for the bluer\npassbands and amounts 0.07, 0.07, 0.05, 0.03, and 0.02 mag in u, J0378, J0395,\nJ0410, and J0430, respectively. We modelled this effect with the Milky Way\nlocation of the J-PLUS pointing, providing also an updated calibration for\nthose observations without LAMOST information. The estimated accuracy in the\ncalibration after including the metallicity effect is at 1% level for the bluer\nJ-PLUS passbands and below for the rest.

For problems with many\ndesign degrees of freedom, efficiency of design methods becomes a major\nconcern. In recent years, machine learning methods such as artificial neural\nnetworks have been used increasingly to speed up the design process. A main\nissue of many such approaches is the need for a large corpus of training data\nthat are generated using high-dimensional simulations. The high computational\ncost associated with training data generation largely diminishes the efficiency\ngained by using machine learning methods. In this work, an adaptive artificial\nneural network-based generative design approach is proposed and developed. This\nmethod uses a generative adversarial network to generate design candidates and\nthus the number of design variables is greatly reduced. To speed up the\nevaluation of the objective function, a convolutional neural network is\nconstructed as the surrogate model for function evaluation. The inverse design\nis carried out using the genetic algorithm in conjunction with two neural\nnetworks. A novel adaptive learning and optimization strategy is proposed,\nwhich allows the design space to be effectively explored for the search for\noptimal solutions. As such the number of training data needed is greatly\nreduced. The performance of the proposed design method is demonstrated on two\nheat source layout design problems. In both problems, optimal designs have been\nobtained. Compared with several existing approaches, the proposed approach has\nthe best performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 05:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-01"}

However, recently there were many concerns about data\nsharing as sharing sensitive information can jeopardize users' privacy. To\npreserve the privacy, organizations use anonymization techniques to conceal\nusers' sensitive data. However, these techniques are vulnerable to\nde-anonymization attacks which aim to identify individual records within a\ndataset. In this paper, a two-tier mathematical framework is proposed for\nanalyzing and mitigating the de-anonymization attacks, by studying the\ninteractions between sharing organizations, data collector, and a prospective\nattacker. In the first level, a game-theoretic model is proposed to enable\nsharing organizations to optimally select their anonymization levels for\nk-anonymization under two potential attacks: background-knowledge attack and\nhomogeneity attack. In the second level, a contract-theoretic model is proposed\nto enable the data collector to optimally reward the organizations for their\ndata. The formulated problems are studied under single-time sharing and\nrepeated sharing scenarios. Different Nash equilibria for the proposed game and\nthe optimal solution of the contract-based problem are analytically derived for\nboth scenarios.

That includes new\nglobal mineral distributions, quantitative mineral abundance distributions and\nmaps of Martian surface chemistry (wt % oxide) detailed in a companion paper\n(Riu et al., submitted). Here we present the method to derive the global\nhyperspectral cube from several hundred millions of spectra. Global maps of\nsome mafic minerals are then shown, and compared to previous works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 07:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-01"}

Recent observations found that solar eruptions\ncould be initiated by a sequence of \"flux feeding,\" during which chromospheric\nfibrils rise upward from below, and merge with a pre-existing prominence.\nFurther theoretical study has confirmed that the flux feeding mechanism is\nefficient in causing the eruption of flux ropes that are wrapped by bald patch\nseparatrix surfaces. But it is unclear how flux feeding influences coronal flux\nropes that are wrapped by hyperbolic flux tubes (HFT), and whether it is able\nto cause the flux-rope eruption. In this paper, we use a 2.5-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamic model to simulate the flux feeding processes in HFT\nconfigurations. It is found that flux feeding injects axial magnetic flux into\nthe flux rope, whereas the poloidal flux of the rope is reduced after flux\nfeeding. Flux feeding is able to cause the flux rope to erupt, provided that\nthe injected axial flux is large enough so that the critical axial flux of the\nrope is reached. Otherwise, the flux rope system evolves to a stable\nequilibrium state after flux feeding, which might be even farther away from the\nonset of the eruption, indicating that flux feeding could stabilize the rope\nsystem with the HFT configuration in this circumstance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 07:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

The synthetic data have been\nshown helpful to train better NMT, especially for low-resource language pairs\nand domains. Nonetheless, large monolingual data in the target domains or\nlanguages are not always available to generate large synthetic parallel data.\nIn this work, we propose a new method to generate large synthetic parallel data\nleveraging very small monolingual data in a specific domain. We fine-tune a\npre-trained GPT-2 model on such small in-domain monolingual data and use the\nresulting model to generate a large amount of synthetic in-domain monolingual\ndata.

The federated learning is an effective\nframework to train a shared model between decentralized edge devices or servers\nwithout exchanging raw data, which can help protect data privacy. In\nUAV-enabled IoT networks, latency and energy consumption are two important\nmetrics limiting the performance of FEEL. Although most of existing works have\nstudied how to reduce the latency and improve the energy efficiency, few works\nhave investigated the impact of limited batteries at the devices on the FEEL.\nMotivated by this, we study the battery-constrained FEEL, where the UAVs can\nadjust their operating CPU-frequency to prolong the battery life and avoid\nwithdrawing from federated learning training untimely. We optimize the system\nby jointly allocating the computational resource and wireless bandwidth in\ntime-varying environments. To solve this optimization problem, we employ a deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based strategy, where a linear combination\nof latency and energy consumption is used to evaluate the system cost.\nSimulation results are finally demonstrated to show that the proposed strategy\noutperforms the conventional ones.

Revisiting this limitation from a causal viewpoint we\ndevelop a more versatile conceptual framework, causal fairness criteria, and\nfirst algorithms to achieve them. We also provide tools to analyze how\nsensitive a believed-to-be causally fair algorithm is to misspecifications of\nthe causal graph.

In many\ncases, a supernova progenitor may have resulted in a black hole. However, there\nare several possible reasons why true pulsar-SNR associations may have been\nmissed in previous surveys: The pulsar's radio beam may not be oriented towards\nus; the pulsar may be too faint to be detectable; or there may be an offset in\nthe pulsar position caused by a kick. Our goal is to find new pulsars in SNRs\nand explore their possible association with the remnant. The search and\nselection of the remnants presented in this paper was inspired by the\nnon-detection of any X-ray bright compact objects in these remnants when\npreviously studied. Five SNRs were searched for radio pulsars with the Green\nBank Telescope at 820 MHz with multiple pointings to cover the full spatial\nextent of the remnants. A periodicity search plus an acceleration search up to\n500 m/s^2 and a single pulse search were performed for each pointing in order\nto detect potential isolated binary pulsars and single pulses, respectively. No\nnew pulsars were detected in the survey. However, we were able to re-detect a\nknown pulsar, PSR J2047+5029, near SNR G89.0+4.7. We were unable to detect the\nradio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar PSR J2021+4026, but we do find a flux density\nlimit of 0.08 mJy. Our flux density limits make our survey two to 16 times more\nsensitive than previous surveys, while also covering the whole spatial extent\nof the same remnants. We discuss potential explanations for the non-detection\nof a pulsar in the studied SNRs and conclude that sensitivity is still the most\nlikely factor responsible for the lack of pulsars in some remnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 09:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

Hence\nstatistical tools studying potential differences among milk samples coming from\nanimals on different feeding systems are required, thus providing increased\nsecurity around the authenticity of the products. Infrared spectroscopy\ntechniques are widely used to collect data on milk samples and to predict milk\nrelated traits. While these data are routinely used to predict the composition\nof the macro components of milk, each spectrum provides a reservoir of\nunharnessed information about the sample. The interpretation of these data\npresents a number of challenges due to their high-dimensionality and the\nrelationships amongst the spectral variables. In this work we propose a\nmodification of the standard factor analysis to induce a parsimonious summary\nof spectroscopic data. The procedure maps the observations into a\nlow-dimensional latent space while simultaneously clustering observed\nvariables. The method indicates possible redundancies in the data and it helps\ndisentangle the complex relationships among the wavelengths. A flexible\nBayesian estimation procedure is proposed for model fitting, providing\nreasonable values for the number of latent factors and clusters. The method is\napplied on milk mid-infrared spectroscopy data from dairy cows on different\npasture and non-pasture based diets, providing accurate modelling of the data\ncorrelation, the clustering of variables and information on differences between\nmilk samples from cows on different diets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 10:06:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-01"}

There are a few key aspects that drive our\nanalysis. First, C2H is detected in young and old systems, hinting at a\nlong-lived chemistry. Second, as a radical, C2H is rapidly destroyed, within\n<1000 yr. These two statements hint that the chemistry responsible for C2H\nemission must be predominantly in the gas-phase and must be in equilibrium.\nCombining new and published chemical models we find that elevating the total\nvolatile (gas and ice) C/O ratio is the only natural way to create a long\nlived, high C2H abundance. Most of the \\ce{C2H} resides in gas with a Fuv/n-gas\n~ 10^-7 G0 cm^3. To elevate the volatile C/O ratio, additional carbon has to be\nreleased into the gas to enable an equilibrium chemistry under oxygen-poor\nconditions. Photo-ablation of carbon-rich grains seems the most straightforward\nway to elevate the C/O ratio above 1.5, powering a long-lived equilibrium\ncycle. The regions at which the conditions are optimal for the presence of high\nC/O ratio and elevated C2H abundances in the gas disk set by the Fuv/n-gas ~\n10^-7 G0 cm^3 condition lie just outside the pebble disk as well as possibly in\ndisk gaps.

Recent interior models of Jupiter that fit\nJuno's measured gravitational field suggest an inhomogeneous interior and\npotentially the existence of a diluted core.

These\ncan later be used to reveal new insights on the planetary interior and be\ncompared to standard models. Here we present empirical structure models of\nJupiter where the density profile is constructed by piecewise-polytropic\nequations. With these models we investigate the relation between the normalized\nmoment of inertia (MoI) and the gravitational moments $J_2$ and $J_4$.

We find that bandpass and\ndivisively normalized frame-differences that are displaced along the motion\ndirection exhibit stronger statistical regularities than for other\ndisplacements. Conversely, the direction-dependent regularities of displaced\nframe differences can be used to estimate the image motion (optical flow) by\nfinding the space-time displacement paths that best preserve statistical\nregularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 10:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

Using the Maxwell fluid model, we show that the\nresonance enhances electrokinetic effects and results in a dramatic increase of\nelectrokinetic energy conversion efficiency. However, by applying the Oldroyd-B\nfluid model it reveals that the amplification of efficiency is suppressed even\nfor a very small Newtonian solvent contribution.

For\nsufficiently large electrical currents, spin-wave excitations have negative\nenergy with respect to the uniform magnetic ground state, while remaining\ndynamically stable due to dissipative spin-transfer torques. Hence, the uniform\nmagnetic ground state is energetically unstable, but is not able to dynamically\nreach the new ground state.

The present work explores a facile sulfur-based\npost-deposition treatment (S-PDT) to passivate the interface of CuInS2 thin\nfilms grown under Cu-rich conditions, which show excellent qFLs values, but\nmuch lower VOCs. The CuInS2 absorbers are treated in three different\nS-containing solutions at 80 oC.

However, existing computational\nmethods have some limitations, resulting in low-quality PPAs and DDAs that\nhamper the prediction performance. Therefore, we hope to develop a novel\nsupervised learning method to learn the PPAs and DDAs effectively and thereby\nimprove the prediction performance of the specific task of DPI.

It is\nchallenging to recommend Point-of-Interests (POIs) for out-of-town users since\nthe out-of-town check-in behavior is determined by not only the user's\nhome-town preference but also the user's travel intention. Besides, the user's\ntravel intentions are complex and dynamic, which leads to big difficulties in\nunderstanding such intentions precisely. In this paper, we propose a\nTRAvel-INtention-aware Out-of-town Recommendation framework, named TRAINOR. The\nproposed TRAINOR framework distinguishes itself from existing out-of-town\nrecommenders in three aspects. First, graph neural networks are explored to\nrepresent users' home-town check-in preference and geographical constraints in\nout-of-town check-in behaviors. Second, a user-specific travel intention is\nformulated as an aggregation combining home-town preference and generic travel\nintention together, where the generic travel intention is regarded as a mixture\nof inherent intentions that can be learned by Neural Topic Model (NTM). Third,\na non-linear mapping function, as well as a matrix factorization method, are\nemployed to transfer users' home-town preference and estimate out-of-town POI's\nrepresentation, respectively. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets\nvalidate the effectiveness of the TRAINOR framework. Moreover, the learned\ntravel intention can deliver meaningful explanations for understanding a user's\ntravel purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 13:14:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2021 05:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

In particular,\nwe compute the electronic structure, magnetic properties, and surface energies\nof the $(001)$ and $(110)$ surfaces of paramagnetic NiO using a fully charge\nself-consistent DFT+DMFT method. Our results reveal a complex interplay between\nelectronic correlations and surface effects in NiO, with the electronic\nstructure of the $(001)$ and $(110)$ NiO surfaces being significantly different\nfrom that in bulk NiO. We obtain a sizeable reduction of the band gap at the\nsurface of NiO, which is most significant for the $(110)$ NiO surface. This\nsuggests a higher catalytic activity of the $(110)$ NiO surface than that of\nthe $(001)$ NiO one. Our results reveal a charge-transfer character of the\n$(001)$ and $(110)$ surfaces of NiO. Most notably, for the $(110)$ NiO surface\nwe observe a remarkable electronic state characterized by an alternating\ncharge-transfer and Mott-Hubbard character of the band gap in the surface and\nsubsurface NiO layers, respectively. This novel form of electronic order\nstabilized by strong correlations is not driven by lattice reconstructions but\nof purely electronic origin. We notice the importance of\norbital-differentiation of the Ni $e_g$ states to characterize the Mott-Hubbard\ninsulating state of the $(001)$ and $(110)$ NiO surfaces. The unoccupied Ni\n$e_g$ surface states are seen to split from the lower edge of the conduction\nband to form strongly localized states in the fundamental gap of bulk NiO.

Longitudinal\nstudies have reported morphological changes in cortical thickness and volume in\nselected brain regions due to meditation practice, which is interpreted as\nevidence for effectiveness of it beyond the subjective self reporting. Evidence\nbased on real time monitoring of meditating brain by functional imaging\nmodalities such as MEG or EEG remains a challenge. In this article we consider\nMEG data collected during meditation sessions of experienced Buddhist monks\npracticing focused attention (Samatha) and open monitoring (Vipassana)\nmeditation, contrasted by resting state with eyes closed. The MEG data is first\nmapped to time series of brain activity averaged over brain regions\ncorresponding to a standard Destrieux brain atlas, and further by bootstrapping\nand spectral analysis to data matrices representing a random sample of power\nspectral densities over bandwidths corresponding to $\\alpha$, $\\beta$,\n$\\gamma$, and $\\theta$ bands in the spectral range. We demonstrate using linear\ndiscriminant analysis (LDA) that the samples corresponding to different\nmeditative or resting states contain enough fingerprints of the brain state to\nallow a separation between different states, and we identify the brain regions\nthat appear to contribute to the separation. Our findings suggest that\ncingulate cortex, insular cortex and some of the internal structures, most\nnotably accumbens, caudate and putamen nuclei, thalamus and amygdalae stand out\nas separating regions, which seems to correlate well with earlier findings\nbased on longitudinal studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 13:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

However, many phenomena are comprised of polyadic\ninteractions between more than two vertices. Such complex hypergraphs range\nfrom emails among groups of individuals, scholarly collaboration, or joint\ninteractions of proteins in living cells.\n  A key generative principle within social and other complex networks is\ntransitivity, where friends of friends are more likely friends. The previously\nproposed Iterated Local Transitivity (ILT) model incorporated transitivity as\nan evolutionary mechanism. The ILT model provably satisfies many observed\nproperties of social networks, such as densification, low average distances,\nand high clustering coefficients.\n  We propose a new, generative model for complex hypergraphs based on\ntransitivity, called the Iterated Local Transitivity Hypergraph (or ILTH)\nmodel. In ILTH, we iteratively apply the principle of transitivity to form new\nhypergraphs. The resulting model generates hypergraphs simulating properties\nobserved in real-world complex hypergraphs, such as densification and low\naverage distances. We consider properties unique to hypergraphs not captured by\ntheir 2-section. We show that certain motifs, which are specified\nsubhypergraphs of small order, have faster growth rates in ILTH hypergraphs\nthan in random hypergraphs with the same order and expected average degree.

The introduction of obstacles or the placement of\nadditional robots in the workspace, the modification of the joint range due to\nfaults or range-of-motion constraints are typical cases where the adaptation\ncapabilities play a key role for safely performing the robot's task.\nProbabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs) have been proposed for representing\nadaptable movement skills, which are modelled as Gaussian distributions over\ntrajectories. These are analytically tractable and can be learned from a small\nnumber of demonstrations. However, both the original ProMP formulation and the\nsubsequent approaches only provide solutions to specific movement adaptation\nproblems, e.g., obstacle avoidance, and a generic, unifying, probabilistic\napproach to adaptation is missing. In this paper we develop a generic\nprobabilistic framework for adapting ProMPs. We unify previous adaptation\ntechniques, for example, various types of obstacle avoidance, via-points,\nmutual avoidance, in one single framework and combine them to solve complex\nrobotic problems. Additionally, we derive novel adaptation techniques such as\ntemporally unbound via-points and mutual avoidance. We formulate adaptation as\na constrained optimisation problem where we minimise the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence between the adapted distribution and the distribution of the\noriginal primitive while we constrain the probability mass associated with\nundesired trajectories to be low. We demonstrate our approach on several\nadaptation problems on simulated planar robot arms and 7-DOF Franka-Emika\nrobots in a dual robot arm setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 13:26:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 15:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 15:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

However, for asymptotically flat spacetimes various definitions\nof mass have been proposed. In this paper I consider eight masses and show that\nsome of them correspond to the active gravitational mass while the others\ncorrespond to the inertial mass. For example, the ADM mass corresponds to the\ninertial mass while the M$\\o$ller mass corresponds to the active gravitational\nmass. In general the inertial and active gravitational masses are not equal. If\nthe spacetime is vacuum at large $r$ the Einstein equations force the inertial\nand active gravitational masses to be the same. The Einstein equations also\nforce the masses to be the same if any matter that extends out to large $r$\nsatisfies the weak, strong or dominant energy condition. I also examine the\ncontributions of the inertial and active gravitational masses to the\ngravitational redshift, the deflection of light, the Shapiro time delay, the\nprecession of perihelia and to the motion of test bodies in the spacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 17:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-01"}

To be valid, the process that goes\nfrom data to knowledge should be supported by detailed, rigorous guidelines,\nwhich help ferret out issues with the data or model, and lead to qualified\nresults that strike a reasonable balance between generality and practical\nrelevance. Such guidelines are being developed by statisticians to support the\nlatest techniques for Bayesian data analysis.

The\ndataset's original analysis (Ray et al., 2014) and a critical reanalysis\n(Berger at al., 2019) have attracted considerable attention -- in no small part\nbecause they target a topic (the impact of different programming languages) on\nwhich strong opinions abound.

The valley degree of freedom originates from the bulk\nbandstructure of silicon, which has six degenerate electronic minima. The\ndegeneracy can be lifted in silicon quantum wells due to strain and electronic\nconfinement, but the \"valley splitting\" of the two lowest lying valleys is\nknown to be sensitive to atomic-scale disorder. Large valley splittings are\ndesirable to have a well-defined spin qubit. In addition, an understanding of\nthe inter-valley tunnel coupling that couples different valleys in adjacent\nquantum dots is extremely important, as the resulting gaps in the energy level\ndiagram may affect the fidelity of charge and spin transfer protocols in\nsilicon quantum dot arrays. Here we use microwave spectroscopy to probe spatial\nvariations in the valley splitting, and the intra- and inter-valley tunnel\ncouplings ($t_{ij}$ and $t'_{ij}$) that couple dots $i$ and $j$ in a triple\nquantum dot (TQD).

By tuning the interdot tunnel barrier we also show that\n$t'_{ij}$ scales linearly with $t_{ij}$, as expected from theory.

Our technique produces\nnew all orders constructions which are significantly simpler compared to\nprevious approaches, and we illustrate its applicability in several examples of\ninterest in noncommutative field theory and gravity. We further show that our\nsymplectic embeddings naturally define a $P_\\infty$-structure on the exterior\nalgebra of differential forms on a generic almost Poisson manifold, which\ngeneralizes earlier constructions of differential graded Poisson algebras, and\nsuggests a new approach to defining noncommutative gauge theories beyond the\ngauge sector and the semi-classical limit based on $A_\\infty$-algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 14:58:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 08:27:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 18:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

It\nhas a high-level syntax but still generates efficient machine code that is\nusually as fast as comparable C/C++ applications. In addition to the language\nfeatures itself, Julia has a sophisticated package management system that makes\nproper modularization of functionality across different packages feasible.

The quasars have redshifts $1.5 < z <\n3.5$ and luminosities $44.6 < \\log(L_{\\text{bol}}/\\text{erg s}^{-1}) < 47.2$.\nWe employ ultraviolet spectral reconstructions based on an independent\ncomponent analysis to parametrize the CIV$\\lambda$1549-emission line that is\nused to infer the strength of accretion disc winds, and the HeII$\\lambda$1640\nline, an indicator of the soft X-ray flux. We find that radio-detected quasars\nare found in the same region of CIV blueshift versus equivalent-width space as\nradio-undetected quasars, but that the loudest, most luminous and largest radio\nsources exist preferentially at low CIV blueshifts. Additionally, the\nradio-detection fraction increases with blueshift whereas the radio-loud\nfraction decreases. In the radio-quiet population, we observe a range of HeII\nequivalent widths as well as a Baldwin effect with bolometric luminosity,\nwhilst the radio-loud population has mostly strong HeII, consistent with a\nstronger soft X-ray flux. The presence of strong HeII is a necessary but not\nsufficient condition to detect radio-loud emission suggesting some degree of\nstochasticity in jet formation. Using energetic arguments and Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we explore the plausibility of winds, compact jets and star\nformation as sources of the radio quiet emission, ruling out none. The\nexistence of quasars with similar ultraviolet properties but differing radio\nproperties suggests, perhaps, that the radio and ultraviolet emission is\ntracing activity occurring on different timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 15:17:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 16:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

We test this hypothesis quantitatively in order to\nplace constraints on the regolith properties. Based on previously estimated\nflow rates and thermophysical arguments, we suggest that there is insufficient\ndepth of porous regolith to support the full gas flow through the regolith. By\ncontrast, free gas flow through a regolith--ice gap is capable of supplying the\nlikely flow rates for gap sizes on the order of a centimetre. This size of gap\ncan be opened in the centre of a spider feature by gas pressure bending the\noverlying ice slab upwards, or by levitating it entirely as suggested in the\noriginal Kieffer et al (2007) model. Our calculations therefore support at\nleast some of the gas flowing through a gap opened between the regolith and\nice. Regolith properties most likely still play a role in the evolution of\nspider morphology, by regolith cohesion controlling the erosion of the central\npit and troughs, for example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 15:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-01"}

The proposed algorithms were\nvalidated through extensive simulations, conducted in the ns-3 network\nsimulator, and complemented by theoretical assessments. The obtained results\nreveal that the two proposed slicing approaches outperform today's Wi-Fi access\ntechnique, reaching lower error probability for bandwidth intensive slices and\nlower latency for time-critical slices.

The challenge is of improving bandwidth with limited spectrum and\npower consumption, which however has gradually become a bottleneck with\nevolution going on. The intrinsic problem is that communication is modeled as a\nmessage transportation from sender to receiver and pursues for an exact message\nreplication in Shannon's information theory, which certainly leads to large\nbandwidth and power requirements with data explosion. However, the goal for\ncommunication among intelligent agents, entities with intelligence including\nhumans, is to understand the meaning or semantics underlying data, not an\naccurate recovery of the transmitted messages. The separate first transmission\nand then understanding is a waste on bandwidth. In this article, we deploy\nsemantics to solve the spectrum and power bottleneck and propose a first\nunderstanding and then transmission framework with high semantic fidelity. We\nfirst give a brief introduction of semantics covering the definition and\nproperties to show the insights and scope of this paper. Then the proposed\ncommunication towards semantic fidelity framework is introduced, which takes\nthe above mentioned properties into account to further improve efficiency.\nSpecially, a semantic transformation is introduced to transform the input into\nsemantic symbols.

Besides, we also\ndiscuss semantic noise and performance measurement. To evaluate the\neffectiveness, a case study of audio transmission is carried out.

While most literatures consider\neither probabilistic QGT with random noise or combinatorial QGT with noiseless\nmeasurements, our focus is on the combinatorial QGT with noisy measurements\nthat might be adversarially perturbed by additive bounded noises.

A\nfurther suggestion came from the interpretation of the Hubbert curve in terms\nof a specific Lotka Volterra (LV) equation. The link with population dynamics\nwas obvious as logistic function and LV equation were proposed within the\ndemography science field. Mathematical population dynamics has a history of\nabout two centuries. The first principle and model of population dynamics can\nbe regarded the exponential law of Malthus. In the XIX century, the Malthusian\ndemographic model was first refined to include mortality rate by Gompertz. In\nthe early XIX century the model was further refined by Verhulst by introducing\nthe standard logistic function. The previous models only concern the population\nof a single species. In the early XX century, the American demographer Lotka\nand the Italian mathematician Volterra proposed a pair of state equations which\ndescribe the population dynamics of two competing species, the predator and the\nprey. This paper is concerned with the single and two-species fundamental\nequations: the logistic and LV equation. The paper starts with the generalized\nlogistic equation whose free response is derived together with equilibrium\npoints and stability properties. The parameter estimation of the logistic\nfunction is applied to the raw data of the US crude oil production. The paper\nproceeds with the Lotka Volterra equation of the competition between two\nspecies, with the goal of applying it to resource exploitation. At the end, a\nlimiting version of the LV equation is studied since it describes a competition\nmodel between the production rate of exploited resources and the relevant\ncapital stock employed in the exploitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 11:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Domain adaptation is a promising approach for\ncross-domain activity recognition. Existing methods mainly focus on adapting\ncross-domain representations via domain-level, class-level, or sample-level\ndistribution matching. However, they might fail to capture the fine-grained\nlocality information in activity data. The domain- and class-level matching are\ntoo coarse that may result in under-adaptation, while sample-level matching may\nbe affected by the noise seriously and eventually cause over-adaptation. In\nthis paper, we propose substructure-level matching for domain adaptation (SSDA)\nto better utilize the locality information of activity data for accurate and\nefficient knowledge transfer. Based on SSDA, we propose an optimal\ntransport-based implementation, Substructural Optimal Transport (SOT), for\ncross-domain HAR.

To solve this problem, a policy\ngradient-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that adopts a\nmeta-learning approach is proposed. The proposed meta policy gradient (MPG)\nalgorithm enables the trained policy to quickly adapt to new user movement\npatterns. In order to solve the problem of maximizing the average number of\nsuccessfully served users for VR scenarios with a large number of users, a dual\nmethod based MPG algorithm (D-MPG) with a low complexity is proposed.\nSimulation results demonstrate that, compared to the trust region policy\noptimization algorithm (TRPO), the proposed MPG and D-MPG algorithms yield up\nto 26.8% and 21.9% improvement in the reliability as well as 81.2% and 87.5%\ngains in the convergence speed, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 15:57:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 09:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Vergence can be driven by\ninformation in both the fovea and periphery, which play complementary roles.\nThe high resolution fovea can drive precise short range movements. The lower\nresolution periphery supports coarser long range movements. The fovea and\nperiphery may also contain conflicting information, e.g. due to objects at\ndifferent depths. While past AEC models did integrate peripheral and foveal\ninformation, they did not explicitly take into account these characteristics.\nWe propose here a two-level hierarchical approach that does.

While vaccine damage as a scientific fact is statistically highly\nuncommon, emerging social and technological forces have converted probable\nvaccine damage into an alternative fact. Methods: Using the Eurobarometer 91.2\nsurvey on a statistically representative EU27-UK sample interviewed in March\n2019, we documented perceptions of vaccine risks and identified three belief\nconfigurations regarding vaccine effectiveness, safety, and usefulness, through\nexploratory cluster analysis. Results: The public beliefs in vaccine risks are\nfrequent. Approximatively one-tenth of the EU27-UK population consider vaccines\nare not rigorously tested before authorization, one-third believe vaccines can\noverload or weaken the immune system and that they can cause the disease\nagainst which they protect, and almost one-half believe vaccines can cause\nserious side effects. We identified three belief configurations: the skeptical,\nthe confident, and the trade-off clusters. The skeptical type (approx. 11\npercent of EU27-UK respondents) is defined by the belief that vaccines are\nrather ineffective, affected by risks of probable vaccine damage, not\nwell-tested, and useless; the confident type (approx. 59 percent) is defined by\nbeliefs that vaccines are effective, safe, well-tested, and useful; and the\ntrade-off type (approx. 29 percent) combines beliefs that vaccines are\neffective, well-tested and useful, with beliefs of probable vaccine damage.\nConclusions: Probable vaccine damage presently exists as an alternative fact in\nthe public imagination, perceptively available for wide segments of the public,\nincluding those who trust medical science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 15:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

Recently, various fuels\nhave been investigated as a potential substitute or additive for diesel and\ngasoline. This work focuses on how oxymethylene ether-3 (OME3), the smallest\npromising OME compound, affects carbon particulate formation when blended with\nethylene in burner-stabilized premixed flames at different equivalence ratios.\nParticle size distribution (PSD) and Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and\nIncandescence (LII) along with numerical (Conditional Quadrature Method of\nMoments - CQMOM, based on D'Anna physico-chemical soot model) investigations\nwere conducted to study particle formation and growth in pure ethylene and\nethylene/OME3 flames. The soot volume fraction and PSD indicate a reduction in\nthe total number and the size of the soot particles at all equivalence ratios,\nwhile the number of small nanoparticles remains almost unchanged. The CQMOM\nmodel is able to predict similar trends for the soot volume fraction and, using\nthe entropy maximization concept, the general shape of the PSD for both pure\nethylene and OME3-blended flames, compared to the experimental measurements.\nFurther, carbon particulate matter was thermophoretically sampled in the\nhighest equivalence ratio conditions and spectroscopically analyzed. The soot\nstructure was investigated using UV-Visible and Raman spectroscopy, finding a\nslightly higher aromaticity for the pure ethylene soot. FTIR analysis showed\nthat carbon particulate matter produced from an OME3-doped flame contained\nlarger amounts of oxygen, mainly in the form of C=O.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 19:41:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 12:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}
