The paper proposes a\nbilevel optimization model to address this challenge, in which the leader\nproblem determines the ODMTS design, and the follower problems identify the\nmost cost efficient and convenient route for riders under the chosen design.\nThe leader model contains a choice model for every potential rider that\ndetermines whether the rider adopts the ODMTS given her proposed route.

We find that the inferred variation of methane abundance with\nlatitude in our previous analysis, which was based on central meridian\nobservations only, underestimated the retrieval errors when compared with a\nmore complete assessment of Neptune's limb darkening. In addition, our previous\nanalysis introduced spurious latitudinal variability of both the abundance and\nits uncertainty, which we reassess here. Our reanalysis of these data\nincorporates the effects of limb-darkening based upon the Minnaert\napproximation, which provides a much stronger constraint on the cloud structure\nand methane mole fraction, makes better use of the available data and is more\ncomputationally efficient. We find that away from discrete cloud features, the\nobserved reflectivity spectrum from 800-900 nm is very well approximated by a\nbackground cloud model that is latitudinally varying, but zonally symmetric,\nconsisting of a H$_2$S cloud layer, based at 3.6-4.7 bar with variable opacity\nand scale height, and a stratospheric haze.

It considers the Commute Trip\nSharing Problem with Autonomous Vehicles (CTSPAV), the optimization problem\nfaced by a reservation-based platform that receives daily commute-trip requests\nand serves them with a fleet of autonomous vehicles. The CTSPAV can be viewed\nas a special case of the Dial- A-Ride Problem (DARP). However, this paper\nrecognizes that commuting trips exhibit special spatial and temporal properties\nthat can be exploited in a branch and cut algorithm that leverages a redundant\nmodeling approach. In particular, the branch and cut algorithm relies on a MIP\nformulation that schedules mini routes representing inbound or outbound trips.\nThis formulation is effective in finding high-quality solutions quickly but its\nrelaxation is relatively weak. To remedy this limitation, the mini-route MIP is\ncomplemented by a DARP formulation which is not as effective in obtaining\nprimal solutions but has a stronger relaxation. The benefits of the proposed\napproach are demonstrated by comparing it with another, more traditional, exact\nbranch and cut procedure and a heuristic method based on mini routes.\n  The methodological contribution is complemented by a comprehensive analysis\nof a CTSPAV platform for reducing vehicle counts, travel distances, and\ncongestion. In particular, the case study for a medium-sized city reveals that\na CTSPAV platform can reduce daily vehicle counts by a staggering 92% and\ndecrease vehicles miles by 30%. The platform also significantly reduces\ncongestion, measured as the number of vehicles on the road per unit time, by\n60% during peak times. These benefits, however, come at the expense of\nintroducing empty miles. Hence the paper also highlights the tradeoffs between\nfuture ride-sharing and car-pooling platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 16:32:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

In a surveillance paradigm, these events\nrange from abuse to fighting and road accidents to snatching, etc. Due to the\nsparse occurrence of anomalous events, anomalous activity recognition from\nsurveillance videos is a challenging research task. The approaches reported can\nbe generally categorized as handcrafted and deep learning-based. Most of the\nreported studies address binary classification i.e. anomaly detection from\nsurveillance videos. But these reported approaches did not address other\nanomalous events e.g. abuse, fight, road accidents, shooting, stealing,\nvandalism, and robbery, etc. from surveillance videos. Therefore, this paper\naims to provide an effective framework for the recognition of different\nreal-world anomalies from videos. This study provides a simple, yet effective\napproach for learning spatiotemporal features using deep 3-dimensional\nconvolutional networks (3D ConvNets) trained on the University of Central\nFlorida (UCF) Crime video dataset. Firstly, the frame-level labels of the UCF\nCrime dataset are provided, and then to extract anomalous spatiotemporal\nfeatures more efficiently a fine-tuned 3D ConvNets is proposed. Findings of the\nproposed study are twofold 1)There exist specific, detectable, and quantifiable\nfeatures in UCF Crime video feed that associate with each other 2) Multiclass\nlearning can improve generalizing competencies of the 3D ConvNets by\neffectively learning frame-level information of dataset and can be leveraged in\nterms of better results by applying spatial augmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 16:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

This reversibility\nallows the system to reach limit-cycles in which plastic events repeat\nindefinitely under the oscillatory drive. Reaching reversible limit-cycles, can\ntake a large number of driving cycles and it was surmised that the plastic\nevents encountered during the transient period are not encountered again and\nare thus irreversible. Using a graph representation of the stable\nconfigurations of the system and the plastic events connecting them, we show\nthat the notion of reversibility is more subtle. We find that reversible\nplastic events are abundant, and that a large portion of the plastic events\nencountered during the transient period are actually reversible, in the sense\nthat they can be part of a reversible deformation path. We observe that the\ntransition graph can be decomposed into clusters of configurations that are\nconnected by reversible transitions. These clusters are the strongly connected\ncomponents of the graph and their sizes turn out to be power-law distributed.\nThe largest of these are grouped in regions of reversibility, which in turn are\nconfined by regions of irreversibility whose number proliferates at larger\nstrains. Our results provide an explanation for the irreversibility transition\n- the divergence of the transient period at a critical forcing amplitude. Long\ntransients result from transition between clusters of reversibility in a search\nfor a cluster large enough to contain a limit-cycle of a specific amplitude.\nFor large enough amplitudes, the search time becomes very large, since sizes of\nthe limit cycles become incompatible with the sizes of the regions of\nreversibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 16:42:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 08:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

The inferred magnetic field is\ntherefore some sort of average over a long line segment. A magnetic field\nmeasurement at a given spatial location is of much more physical significance.\nIn this paper, we point out that HII regions fortuitously offer such a\n``point'' measurement, albeit of one component of the magnetic field, and\naveraged over the sightline through the HII region. However, the line of sight\n(LOS) through an HII region is much smaller (e.g. 30 - 50 pc) than one through\nthe entire Galactic disk, and thus constitutes a ``pseudo-local'' measurement.\nWe use published HII region Faraday rotation measurements to provide a new\nconstraint on the magnitude of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the\nGalaxy, as well as to raise intriguing speculations about the modification of\nthe Galactic field during the star formation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 17:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

In the quantum\ndomain, time-dependent media can be used to convert vacuum fluctuations\n(virtual photons) into pairs of real photons. We refer to these processes\nbroadly as ``dynamical vacuum effects'' (DVEs). Despite interest for their\npotential applications as sources of quantum light, DVEs are generally very\nweak, providing many opportunities for enhancement through modern techniques in\nnanophotonics, such as using media which support excitations such as plasmon\nand phonon polaritons. Here, we present a theory of DVEs in arbitrary\nnanostructured, dispersive, and dissipative systems. A key element of our\nframework is the simultaneous incorporation of time-modulation and\n``dispersion'' through time-translation-breaking linear response theory. We\npropose a highly efficient scheme for generating entangled surface polaritons\nbased on time-modulation of the optical phonon frequency of a polar insulator.\nWe show that the high density of states, especially in hyperbolic polaritonic\nmedia, may enable high-efficiency generation of entangled phonon-polariton\npairs. More broadly, our theoretical framework enables the study of quantum\nlight-matter interactions in time-varying media, such as spontaneous emission,\nand energy level shifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 17:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

An effective approach to deal\nwith filtering boundary conditions is to extend the design domain beyond the\nborders using void densities. Although the approach is easy to implement, it\nintroduces extra computational cost required to store the additional Finite\nElements (FEs). This work proposes a numerical technique for the density filter\nthat emulates an extension of the design domain, thus, it avoids boundary\neffects without demanding additional computational cost, besides it is very\nsimple to implement on both regular and irregular meshes.

A highly desirable target space is that of a tree metric.\nUnfortunately, such embedding will result in a huge distortion. A celebrated\nbypass to this problem is stochastic embedding with logarithmic expected\ndistortion. Another bypass is Ramsey-type embedding, where the distortion\nguarantee applies only to a subset of the points. However, both these solutions\nfail to provide an embedding into a single tree with a worst-case distortion\nguarantee on all pairs.

Our primary motivation is the\ninvestigation of metapopulation dynamics arising from a collection of spatially\ndistributed, interacting biological populations. To make progress on this goal,\nwe embed it in a more general problem: inference for a collection of\ninteracting partially observed nonlinear non-Gaussian stochastic processes.\nEach process in the collection is called a unit; in the case of spatiotemporal\nmodels, the units correspond to distinct spatial locations. The dynamic state\nfor each unit may be discrete or continuous, scalar or vector valued. In\nmetapopulation applications, the state can represent a structured population or\nthe abundances of a collection of species at a single location. We consider\nmodels where the collection of states has a Markov property. A sequence of\nnoisy measurements is made on each unit, resulting in a collection of time\nseries. A model of this form is called a spatiotemporal partially observed\nMarkov process (SpatPOMP). The R package spatPomp provides an environment for\nimplementing SpatPOMP models, analyzing data using existing methods, and\ndeveloping new inference approaches. Our presentation of spatPomp reviews\nvarious methodologies in a unifying notational framework.

We present SmartDeal (SD),\nan algorithm framework to trade higher-cost memory storage/access for\nlower-cost computation, in order to aggressively boost the storage and energy\nefficiency, for both inference and training. The core of SD is a novel weight\ndecomposition with structural constraints, carefully crafted to unleash the\nhardware efficiency potential. Specifically, we decompose each weight tensor as\nthe product of a small basis matrix and a large structurally sparse coefficient\nmatrix whose non-zeros are quantized to power-of-2. The resulting sparse and\nquantized DNNs enjoy greatly reduced energy for data movement and weight\nstorage, incurring minimal overhead to recover the original weights thanks to\nthe sparse bit-operations and cost-favorable computations. Beyond inference, we\ntake another leap to embrace energy-efficient training, introducing innovative\ntechniques to address the unique roadblocks arising in training while\npreserving the SD structures.

In this case, a cavity is formed as\nmaterial inside the planetary orbit is removed by PE, leaving only the outer\ndisc to drive the migration of the giant planet. We investigate the impact of\nPE on giant planet migration and focus specifically on the case of transition\ndiscs with an evacuated cavity inside the planet location. This is important\nfor determining under what circumstances PE is efficient at halting the\nmigration of giant planets, thus affecting the final orbital distribution of a\npopulation of planets.

Neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM)\nattenuates Ly$\\alpha$~photons emitted by galaxies. As reionization progressed\nthe IGM opacity decreased, increasing Ly$\\alpha$~visibility. The galaxy\nLy$\\alpha$~luminosity function (LF) is thus a useful tool to constrain the\ntimeline of reionization. In this work, we model the Ly$\\alpha$~LF as a\nfunction of redshift, $z=5-10$, and average IGM neutral hydrogen fraction,\n$\\overline{x}_\\textsc{hi}$. We combine the Ly$\\alpha$~luminosity probability\ndistribution obtained from inhomogeneous reionization simulations with a model\nfor the UV LF to model the Ly$\\alpha$~LF.

Important trait features, such as\nthe roughness of the trait landscape or the modularity of a trait have a simple\nFourier interpretation. Ruggedness at a gene location corresponds to high\nsensitivity to mutation, while a modular organization of gene activity reduces\nsuch sensitivity.\n  Traits where rugged loci are rare will naturally compress gene data in the\nFourier domain, leading to a sparse representation of trait data, concentrated\nin identifiable, low-level coefficients. This Fourier representation of a trait\norganizes epistasis in a form which is isometric to the trait data. As Fourier\nmatrices are known to be maximally incoherent with the standard basis, this\npermits employing compressive sensing techniques to work from data sets that\nare relatively small -- sometimes even of polynomial size -- compared to the\nexponentially large sets of possible genomes.\n  This theory provides a theoretical underpinning for systematic use of Boolean\nfunction machinery to dissect the dependency of a trait on the genome and\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 20:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 18:21:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 17:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

The obscuring torus geometry determines the\naverage viewing angle, and if the torus geometry changes with the redshift,\nthis average viewing angle will also change. Thus the ratio between the\nisotropic luminosity and observed luminosity may change systematically with\nredshift. Therefore, if we use quasars to measure the luminosity distance by\nevaluating the isotropic absolute luminosity and measuring the observed flux,\nwe can have a redshift-dependent bias which can propagate to cosmological\nparameters. We propose a toy model for testing the effect of viewing angle\nuncertainty on measurement of the luminosity distance.

A common practice is to\nnormalize all the cutoffs to zero and estimate one effect. This procedure\nidentifies the average treatment effect (ATE) on the observed distribution of\nindividuals local to existing cutoffs. However, researchers often want to make\ninferences on more meaningful ATEs, computed over general counterfactual\ndistributions of individuals, rather than simply the observed distribution of\nindividuals local to existing cutoffs. This paper proposes a consistent and\nasymptotically normal estimator for such ATEs when heterogeneity follows a\nnon-parametric function of cutoff characteristics in the sharp case. The\nproposed estimator converges at the minimax optimal rate of root-n for a\nspecific choice of tuning parameters. Identification in the fuzzy case, with\nmultiple cutoffs, is impossible unless heterogeneity follows a\nfinite-dimensional function of cutoff characteristics. Under parametric\nheterogeneity, this paper proposes an ATE estimator for the fuzzy case that\noptimally combines observations to maximize its precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 21:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

However, the openness and distributed nature of MCS leads to various\nvulnerabilities and consequent challenges to address. A malicious user\nsubmitting fake sensing tasks to an MCS platform may be attempting to consume\nresources from any number of participants' devices; as well as attempting to\nclog the MCS server. In this paper, a novel approach that is based on\nhorizontal federated learning is proposed to identify fake tasks that contain a\nnumber of independent detection devices and an aggregation entity. Detection\ndevices are deployed to operate in parallel with each device equipped with a\nmachine learning (ML) module, and an associated training dataset. Furthermore,\nthe aggregation module collects the prediction results from individual devices\nand determines the final decision with the objective of minimizing the\nprediction loss. Loss measurement considers the lost task values with respect\nto misclassification, where the final decision utilizes a risk-aware approach\nwhere the risk is formulated as a function of the utility loss. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that using federated learning-driven illegitimate task\ndetection with a risk aware aggregation function improves the detection\nperformance of the traditional centralized framework. Furthermore, the higher\nperformance of detection and lower loss of utility can be achieved by the\nproposed framework. This scheme can even achieve 100%detection accuracy using\nsmall training datasets distributed across devices, while achieving slightly\nover an 8% increase in detection improvement over traditional approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 22:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

Integrating trait interaction theory with trait\nactivation theory, this paper examines how personality traits, i.e.\nconscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism impact passion at work across\ndifferent job situations. Passion has been conceptualized as a two-dimensional\nconstruct, consisting of harmonious work passion (HWP) and obsessive work\npassion (OWP). Our study is based on a sample of N = 824 participants from the\nmyPersonality project. We find a positive relationship between neuroticism and\nOWP in enterprising environments. Further, we find a three-way interaction\nbetween conscientiousness, agreeableness, and enterprising environment in\npredicting OWP. Our findings imply that the impact of personality\nconfigurations on different forms of passion is contingent on the job\nenvironment. Moreover, in line with self-regulation theory, the results reveal\nagreeableness as a \"cool influencer\" and neuroticism as a \"hot influencer\" of\nthe relationship between conscientiousness and work passion.

The FIBlock GUI allows the user to select a\nfault type and configure multiple parameters to tune error magnitude, fault\nactivation time, and fault exposure duration. Additional trigger inputs and\noutputs of the block enable the modeling of conditional faults. Furthermore,\ntwo or more FIBlocks connected with these trigger signals can model chained\nerrors.

One of the major challenges that\nmake them hard to be applied in practice is the issue with software updates.\nSpecifically, an operating system update causes the integrity violation because\nit changes the well-known initial state trusted by remote verifiers, such as\nintegrity monitoring systems. Consequently, the integrity monitoring of remote\ncomputers becomes unreliable due to the high amount of false positives. We\naddress this problem by adding an extra level of indirection between the\noperating system and software repositories. We propose a trusted software\nrepository (TSR), a secure proxy that overcomes the shortcomings of previous\napproaches by sanitizing software packages. Sanitization consists of modifying\nunsafe installation scripts and adding digital signatures in a way software\npackages can be installed in the operating system without violating its\nintegrity. TSR leverages shielded execution, i.e., Intel SGX, to achieve\nconfidentiality and integrity guarantees of the sanitization process. TSR is\ntransparent to package managers, and requires no changes in the software\npackages building and distributing processes. Our evaluation shows that running\nTSR inside SGX is practical; since it induces only ~1.18X performance overhead\nduring package sanitization compared to the native execution without SGX.

In particular, a neural\nnetwork (NN)-based approach is proposed to maximize the secrecy rate of the\nsecondary receiver under the constraints of total transmit power of secondary\ntransmitter, and the interference leakage to the primary receiver, within which\nthree different regularization schemes are developed. The key advantage of the\nproposed algorithm over conventional approaches is the capability to solve the\npower allocation problem with both perfect and imperfect channel state\ninformation. In a conventional setting, two completely different optimization\nframeworks have to be designed, namely the robust and non-robust designs.\nFurthermore, conventional algorithms are often based on iterative techniques,\nand hence, they require a considerable number of iterations, rendering them\nless suitable in future wireless networks where there are very stringent delay\nconstraints. To meet the unprecedented requirements of future ultra-reliable\nlow-latency networks, we propose an NN-based approach that can determine the\npower allocation in a CR network with significantly reduced computational time\nand complexity. As this trained NN only requires a small number of linear\noperations to yield the required power allocations, the approach can also be\nextended to different delay sensitive applications and services in future\nwireless networks. When evaluate the proposed method versus conventional\napproaches, using a suitable test set, the proposed approach can achieve more\nthan 94% of the secrecy rate performance with less than 1% computation time and\nmore than 93% satisfaction of interference leakage constraints.

However, the promise, a\npopular synchronization primitive for parallel tasks, does not enjoy\ndeadlock-freedom guarantees. Promises can exhibit deadlock-like bugs; however,\nthe concept of a deadlock is not currently well-defined for promises.\n  To address these challenges, we propose an ownership semantics in which each\npromise is associated to the task which currently intends to fulfill it.\nOwnership immediately enables the identification of bugs in which a task fails\nto fulfill a promise for which it is responsible. Ownership further enables the\ndiscussion of deadlock cycles among tasks and promises and allows us to\nintroduce a robust definition of deadlock-like bugs for promises.\n  Cycle detection in this context is non-trivial because it is concurrent with\nchanges in promise ownership.

Collaborative\nFiltering (CF) is the most popular recommendation model. Specifically, Graph\nNeural Network (GNN) has become a new state-of-the-art for CF. In the GNN-based\nrecommender system, message dropout is usually used to alleviate the selection\nbias in the user-item bipartite graph. However, message dropout might\ndeteriorate the recommender system's performance due to the randomness of\ndropping out the outgoing messages based on the user-item bipartite graph. To\nsolve this problem, we propose a graph contrastive learning module for a\ngeneral recommender system that learns the embeddings in a self-supervised\nmanner and reduces the randomness of message dropout. Besides, many recommender\nsystems optimize models with pairwise ranking objectives, such as the Bayesian\nPairwise Ranking (BPR) based on a negative sampling strategy. However, BPR has\nthe following problems: suboptimal sampling and sample bias. We introduce a new\ndebiased contrastive loss to solve these problems, which provides sufficient\nnegative samples and applies a bias correction probability to alleviate the\nsample bias.

There are two types of MI attacks in the literature, i.e.,\nthese with and without shadow models. The success of the former heavily depends\non the quality of the shadow model, i.e., the transferability between the\nshadow and the target; the latter, given only blackbox probing access to the\ntarget model, cannot make an effective inference of unknowns, compared with MI\nattacks using shadow models, due to the insufficient number of qualified\nsamples labeled with ground truth membership information.\n  In this paper, we propose an MI attack, called BlindMI, which probes the\ntarget model and extracts membership semantics via a novel approach, called\ndifferential comparison. The high-level idea is that BlindMI first generates a\ndataset with nonmembers via transforming existing samples into new samples, and\nthen differentially moves samples from a target dataset to the generated,\nnon-member set in an iterative manner.

Although some recent efforts mitigate this\nissue by imposing the 1-to-1 constraint on the alignment process, they still\ncannot adequately model the underlying interdependence and the results tend to\nbe sub-optimal. To fill in this gap, in this work, we delve into the dynamics\nof the decision-making process, and offer a reinforcement learning (RL) based\nmodel to align entities collectively.

It is known that the choice of a surrogate loss can highly\ninfluence the performance of the trained classifier and therefore it should be\ncarefully chosen. Recently, surrogate losses that satisfy a certain symmetric\ncondition (aka., symmetric losses) have demonstrated their usefulness in\nlearning from corrupted labels.

To address this problem, computational\nsimulations are a powerful tool, which have been employed by many previous\nworks. In this chapter, we describe simulation methods for studying the\nvibrational properties of glasses (and any solid-state materials). We first\npresent a method for studying vibrational eigenmodes. Since vibrational motions\nof particles are excited along eigenmodes, the eigenmodes are fundamental to\ndescriptions of vibrational properties. The eigenmodes in glasses are\nnon-phonon modes in general, and some of them are even localized in space. We\nnext present a method of analysing phonon transport, which is also crucial for\nunderstanding vibrational properties. Since phonons are not eigenmodes in\nglasses, they are decomposed into several different, non-phonon eigenmodes. As\na result, phonons in glasses are strongly scattered. In addition, we describe\nhow to analyse the elastic response. The elastic response of glasses is also\nanomalous with respect to that of crystals.

We first propose for the\nnetwork equipped with public-private networks. The private network is sparse\nand not even necessarily connected, over which communications are encrypted and\nsecure along with the intermediate node states; the public network is connected\nand may be dense, over which communications are allowed to be public. In this\nsetting, we propose a multi-gossip PPSC mechanism over the private network,\nwhere at each step, randomly selected node pairs update their states in such a\nway that they are shuffled with random noise while maintaining summation\nconsistency. We show that this mechanism can achieve any desired differential\nprivacy level with any prescribed probability. Next, we embed this mechanism in\ndistributed computing processes, and propose privacy-guarantee protocols for\nthree basic computation tasks, where an adaptive mechanism adjusts the amount\nof noise injected in PPSC steps for privacy protection, and the number of\nregular computation steps for accuracy guarantee. For average consensus, we\ndevelop a PPSC-Gossip averaging consensus algorithm by utilizing the\nmulti-gossip PPSC mechanism for privacy encryption before an averaging\nconsensus algorithm over the public network for local computations. For network\nlinear equations and distributed convex optimization, we develop two respective\ndistributed computing protocols by following the PPSC-Gossip averaging\nconsensus algorithm with an additional projection or gradient descent step\nwithin each step of computation.

In this\nwork we study population survival or extinction using a stochastic, discrete\nlattice-based random walk model where individuals undergo movement, birth and\ndeath events. The discrete model is defined on a two-dimensional hexagonal\nlattice with periodic boundary conditions. A key feature of the discrete model\nis that crowding effects are introduced by specifying two different crowding\nfunctions that govern how local agent density influences movement events and\nbirth/death events. The continuum limit description of the discrete model is a\nnonlinear reaction-diffusion equation, and we focus on crowding functions that\nlead to linear diffusion and a bistable source term that is often associated\nwith the strong Allee effect. Using both the discrete and continuum modelling\ntools we explore the complicated relationship between the long-term survival or\nextinction of the population and the initial spatial arrangement of the\npopulation. In particular, we study different spatial arrangements of initial\ndistributions: (i) a well-mixed initial distribution where the initial density\nis independent of position in the domain; (ii) a vertical strip initial\ndistribution where the initial density is independent of vertical position in\nthe domain; and, (iii) several forms of two-dimensional initial distributions\nwhere the initial population is distributed in regions with different shapes.\nOur results indicate that the shape of the initial spatial distribution of the\npopulation affects extinction of bistable populations.

It has been suggested that lack of\nthermal equilibration among the different edge modes of the A-Pf order can\naccount for this discrepancy. The identification of the topological order is\ncrucial for the interpretation of braiding (interference) operations, better\nunderstanding of the thermal equilibration process, and the reliability of the\nnumerical studies. We developed a new method that helps identifying the\ntopological order of the {\\nu}=5/2 state. By creating an interface between the\ntwo 2D half-planes, one hosting the {\\nu}=5/2 state and the other an integer\n{\\nu}=3 state, the interface supported a fractional {\\nu}=1/2 charge mode with\n1/2 quantum conductance and a neutral Majorana mode. The presence of the\nMajorana mode, probed by measuring noise, propagating in the opposite direction\nto the charge mode, asserted the presence of the PH-Pf order but not that of\nthe A-Pf order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 09:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Our results show that the chi-square statistic monotonously\nincreases as $\\alpha$ decreases from 2 to 1, where $\\alpha$ is the\ncharacteristic index of superdiffusion describing the degree of fractality of\nthe ISM and $\\alpha=2$ corresponds to the normal diffusion model. We find that\nmodel with $\\alpha<1.32$ (or $<1.4$, depending on the data used in fit) is\ndisfavored at 95\\% confidence level. Superdiffusion model with $\\alpha$ close\nto 2 can well explain the morphology of the Geminga halo, while it predicts\nmuch higher positron flux on the Earth than the normal diffusion model. This\nhas important implication for the interpretation of the CR positron excess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 10:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

However, not many practical ways to measure data quality\nare available today, especially when it comes to large-scale high-dimensional\ndata, such as images and videos.

Specifically, to reduce the huge sensitivity, we\ndevise a Katz index-based private graph feature extraction method, which can\ncapture global graph structure features while greatly reducing the global\nsensitivity via a sensitivity regulation strategy.

So far, a large number of deepfake videos\n(known as \"deepfakes\") have been crafted and uploaded to the internet, calling\nfor effective countermeasures. One promising countermeasure against deepfakes\nis deepfake detection. Several deepfake datasets have been released to support\nthe training and testing of deepfake detectors, such as DeepfakeDetection and\nFaceForensics++. While this has greatly advanced deepfake detection, most of\nthe real videos in these datasets are filmed with a few volunteer actors in\nlimited scenes, and the fake videos are crafted by researchers using a few\npopular deepfake softwares. Detectors developed on these datasets may become\nless effective against real-world deepfakes on the internet. To better support\ndetection against real-world deepfakes, in this paper, we introduce a new\ndataset WildDeepfake, which consists of 7,314 face sequences extracted from 707\ndeepfake videos collected completely from the internet. WildDeepfake is a small\ndataset that can be used, in addition to existing datasets, to develop and test\nthe effectiveness of deepfake detectors against real-world deepfakes. We\nconduct a systematic evaluation of a set of baseline detection networks on both\nexisting and our WildDeepfake datasets, and show that WildDeepfake is indeed a\nmore challenging dataset, where the detection performance can decrease\ndrastically. We also propose two (eg. 2D and 3D) Attention-based Deepfake\nDetection Networks (ADDNets) to leverage the attention masks on real/fake faces\nfor improved detection.

As many real-world complex systems\ncan be modeled as multilayer networks, the question of identifying important\nnodes in multilayer network has attracted much attention. Existing studies\nfocus on the multilayer network structure, while neglecting how the structural\nand dynamical coupling of multiple layers influence the dynamical importance of\nnodes in the network. Here we investigate on this question in an\ninformation-disease coupled spreading dynamics on multiplex networks. Firstly,\nwe explicitly reveal that three interlayer coupling factors, which are the\ntwo-layer relative spreading speed, the interlayer coupling strength and the\ntwo-layer degree correlation, significantly impact the spreading influence of a\nnode on the contact layer. The suppression effect from the information layer\nmakes the structural centrality on the contact layer fail to predict the\nspreading influence of nodes in the multiplex network. Then by mapping the\ncoevolving spreading dynamics into percolation process and using the\nmessage-passing approach, we propose a method to calculate the size of the\ndisease outbreaks from a single seed node, which can be used to estimate the\nnodes' spreading influence in the coevolving dynamics.

The\npatterns of material organization that characterize living organisms today are\ncontingent on events that occurred billions of years ago. This contingency is a\nnecessary component of Darwinian evolution: patterns in the present inherit\nsome of their features from those in the past. Despite its central role in\nbiology, heritable information is difficult to recognize in prebiotic systems\ndescribed in the language of chemistry or physics. Here, we consider one such\ndescription based on continuous-time Markov processes and investigate the\npersistence of heritable information within large sets of dynamical systems.\nWhile the microscopic state of each system fluctuates incessantly, there exist\nfew systems that relax slowly to their stationary distribution over much longer\ntimes. These systems, selected for their persistence, are further distinguished\nby their mesoscopic organization, which allows for accurate course grained\ndescriptions of their dynamics at long times. The slow relaxation of these\nstable patterns is made possible by dissipative currents fueled by\nthermodynamic gradients present in the surrounding reservoirs. We show how the\nrate of entropy production within a system sets an upper bound on the lifetime\nof its persistent patterns. We also consider the probability of finding\npersistence within large sets of dynamical systems. We show that physical\nconstraints based on continuity and locality can strongly influence the\nprobability of persistence and its dependence on system size. Finally, we\ndescribe how heritable information can be quantified in practice using\nuniversal compression algorithms.

Both solar and in situ mechanisms have been suggested to\nexplain the existence of HMF inversions in general. Previous work using Helios\n1, covering 0.3-1AU, observed inverted HMF to become more common with\nincreasing r, suggesting that some heliospheric driving process creates or\namplifies inversions. This study expands upon these findings, by analysing\ninversion-associated changes in plasma properties for the same large data set,\nfacilitated by observations of 'strahl' electrons to identify the unperturbed\nmagnetic polarity. We find that many inversions exhibit anti-correlated field\nand velocity perturbations, and are thus characteristically Alfv\\'enic, but\nmany also depart strongly from this relationship over an apparent continuum of\nproperties. Inversions depart further from the 'ideal' Alfv\\'enic case with\nincreasing r, as more energy is partitioned in the field, rather than the\nplasma, component of the perturbation. This departure is greatest for\ninversions with larger density and magnetic field strength changes, and\ncharacteristic slow solar wind properties. We find no evidence that inversions\nwhich stray further from 'ideal' Alfv\\'enicity have different generation\nprocesses from those which are more Alfv\\'enic.

Methods.For\nthe purpose of this study, we used (a) the spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) Data Release (DR) 14 catalogue, in order to select and classify\nAGNs using emission line diagnostics, up to a redshift of z=0.2, and (b) the\nGalaxy Zoo Project catalogue, which classifies SDSS galaxies in two broad\nHubble types: spirals and ellipticals. Results.We find that the fraction of\ntype 1 Seyfert nuclei (Sy1) hosted in elliptical galaxies is significantly\nlarger than the corresponding fraction of any other AGN type, while there is a\ngradient of increasing spiral-hosts from Sy1 to LINER, type 2 Seyferts (Sy2)\nand composite nuclei. These findings cannot be interpreted within the simple\nunified model, but possibly by a co-evolution scheme for supermassive black\nholes (SMBH) and galactic bulges. Furthermore, for the case of spiral host\ngalaxies we find the Sy1 population to be strongly skewed towards face-on\nconfigurations, while the corresponding Sy2 population range in all host galaxy\norientation configurations has a similar, but not identical, orientation\ndistribution to star-forming (SF) galaxies. These results also cannot be\ninterpreted by the standard unification paradigm, but point towards a\nsignificant contribution of the galactic disc to the obscuration of the nuclear\nregion. This is also consistent with the observed preference of Sy1 nuclei to\nbe hosted by ellipticals, that is, the dusty disc of spiral hosts contributes\nto the obscuration of the broad-line region (BLR), and thus relatively more\nellipticals are expected to appear hosting Sy1 nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 12:27:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 12:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

Here, we study the effect of viscosity, in presence of\ncooling, on the sub-Keplerian flows around neutron stars, using Smoothed\nParticle Hydrodynamics. Our time-dependent study shows that multiple shocks,\ntransition and boundary layers form in such type of accretion, when viscosity\nis significant, and one or more layers are absent when the viscosity is\nmoderate. These flows are particularly of interest for the wind dominated\nsystems such as Cir X-1. We also report the formation of a generalized flow\nconfiguration, Two-Component Advective Flow, for the first time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 12:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

Linear modeling methods such as logistic regression are often\nadopted, since they offer an acceptable balance between precision and\ninterpretability. Linear methods, however, are not well equipped to handle\ncategorical predictors with high-cardinality or to exploit non-linear relations\nin the data. As a solution, data preprocessing methods such as\nweight-of-evidence are typically used for transforming the predictors. The\nbinning procedure that underlies the weight-of-evidence approach, however, has\nbeen little researched and typically relies on ad-hoc or expert driven\nprocedures. The objective in this paper, therefore, is to propose a formalized,\ndata-driven and powerful method.\n  To this end, we explore the discretization of continuous variables through\nthe binning of spline functions, which allows for capturing non-linear effects\nin the predictor variables and yields highly interpretable predictors taking\nonly a small number of discrete values.

Together, this offers an improved ability to exploit both\nnon-linear and categorical predictors for achieving increased classification\nprecision, while maintaining interpretability of the resulting model and\ndecreasing the risk of overfitting.\n  We present the results of a series of experiments in a fraud detection\nsetting, which illustrate the effectiveness of the presented approach.

Due to the\ninaccuracy in cardinality estimation, errors in cost model, and the huge plan\nspace, the optimizer cannot find the optimal execution plan for a complex query\nin a reasonable time. In this paper, we first deeply study the causes behind\nthe limitations above. Next, we review the techniques used to improve the\nquality of the three key components in the cost-based optimizer, cardinality\nestimation, cost model, and plan enumeration. We also provide our insights on\nthe future directions for each of the above aspects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 13:47:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

SNOW\nsupports massive concurrent communication between a base station (BS) and\nnumerous low-power nodes through a distributed implementation of OFDM. In SNOW,\ninter-carrier interference (ICI) is more pronounced under mobility due to its\nOFDM based design. Geospatial variation of white spaces also raises challenges\nin both intra- and inter-network mobility as the low-power nodes are not\nequipped to determine white spaces.

The primordial Li abundance deduced from the observations\nof the cosmic background is larger than the maximum observed in these stars.\nRecent observations have given evidence of a large Li abundance dispersion in\nvery metal-poor stars.

It was found that the obtained VDFs\ncontain strip-like and loss-cone features with positive gradient, and both\nfeatures are capable of driving electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME), which\nis a viable radiation mechanism for some solar radio bursts, in particular,\nsolar radio spikes. The strip-like feature is important in driving the harmonic\nX mode, while the loss-cone feature can be important in driving the fundamental\nX mode. In the weak-scattering case, the rate of energy conversion from\nenergetic electrons to X2 can reach up to ~2.9 * 10^-3 Ek0, where Ek0 is the\ninitial kinetic energy of energetic electrons. The study demonstrates a novel\nway of exciting X2 mode in the corona during solar flares, and provides new\nsight into how escaping radiation can be generated within a coronal loop during\nsolar flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 14:20:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

At present, our\nknowledge of these cross sections in the energy range where cosmic-ray\ninteractions occur is limited, and this is a source of uncertainties in the\npredicted fluxes of secondary cosmic-ray nuclei.

We perform calculations without Hubbard-like U potential on\nNi 3d levels but with a meta-GGA better amending self-interaction errors. We\nfind that at low doping, polarons form with intermediate localized states in\nthe band gap resulting in a semiconducting behavior.

Yet, in spite of being discussed since the\n1950s, how robustness emerges from the complexity of genetic architectures and\nhow it evolves still remains unclear. In particular, whether or not robustness\nis independent to various sources of perturbations conditions the range of\nadaptive scenarios that can be considered. For instance, selection for\nrobustness to heritable mutations is likely to be modest and indirect, and its\nevolution might result from indirect selection on a pleiotropically-related\ncharacter (e.g., homeostasis). Here, I propose to treat various robustness\nmeasurements as quantitative characters, and study theoretically, by\nindividual-based simulations, their propensity to evolve independently. Based\non a simple evolutionary model of a gene regulatory network, I showed that five\nmeasurements of the robustness of gene expression to genetic or non-genetic\ndisturbances were substantially correlated. Yet, robustness was mutationally\nvariable in several dimensions, and robustness components could evolve\ndifferentially under direct selection pressure. Therefore, the fact that the\nsensitivity of gene expression to mutations and environmental factors rely on\nthe same gene networks does not preclude distinct evolutionary histories of\nrobustness components.

The unhelpful status of angles in the SI can be remedied\nwith minimal disruption by (1) changing the definition of the radian from a\nradian equals 1 m/m to e.g. a right angle equals $\\pi/2$ radians, and (2)\nacknowledging that the adoption of the Radian Convention is acceptable, when\nmade explicit. The standard definitions of frequency and the hertz should\nremain unchanged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 16:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

The three planets are\n1.2, 2.4, and 2.1 times the size of Earth and have orbital periods of 3.4, 5.7,\nand 11.4 days. We obtained 29 high-resolution optical spectra with the newly\ncommissioned Echelle Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic\nObservations (ESPRESSO) and 58 spectra using the High Accuracy Radial velocity\nPlanet Searcher (HARPS).

The combination of radius and mass measurements suggests that the\ninnermost planet has a rocky composition similar to that of Earth, while the\nouter two planets have lower densities. Thus, the inner planet and the outer\nplanets are on opposite sides of the `radius valley' -- a region in the\nradius-period diagram with relatively few members, which has been interpreted\nas a consequence of atmospheric photo-evaporation.

We found that\nthe circumstellar disks featuring accretion bursts can bear kinematic features\nthat are distinct for different burst mechanisms, which can be useful when\nidentifying the burst origin. The disks in the stellar encounter and\nclump-infall models are characterized by tens of percent deviations from the\nKeplerian rotation, whie the disks in the MRI models are characterized only a\nfew percent deviation, which is mostly caused by the gravitational instability\nthat fuels the MRI bursts.

The deviations of velocity channels in the\nburst-hosting disks from a symmetric pattern typical of Keplerian disks are\nstrongest for the clump-infall and collision models, and carry individual\nfeatures that may be useful for the identification of the corresponding burst\nmechanism.

This method\nis based on a truncation, $Q^{\\operatorname{tr}}(f,f)$, of the Boltzmann\ncollision operator, $Q(f,f)$, whose Fourier transform is given by a weighted\nconvolution. The truncated collision operator models the situation in which two\ncolliding particles ignore each other if their relative speed exceeds a\nthreshold, $g_{\\text{tr}}$. We demonstrate that the choice of truncation\nparameter plays a critical role in the accuracy of the numerical computation of\n$Q$.

We show that in this solution there is a\nsingularity at the origin, and give the parameters of that singularity in terms\nof the geometrical and physical parameters of the shell. This does not\ncorrespond to an infinite concentration of matter, but in fact to zero energy\ndensity at the center. It does, however, imply that the spacetime within the\nspherical cavity is not flat, so that there is a non-trivial gravitational\nfield there, in contrast with Newtonian gravitation. This gravitational field\nhas the effect of stabilizing the geometrical configuration of the matter,\nsince any particle of the matter that wanders out into the vacuum regions tends\nto be brought back to the bulk of the matter by the gravitational field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 23:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 02:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

Tensor network decomposition and distributed tensor computation\nhave been widely used in signal processing and machine learning for\ndimensionality reduction and large-scale optimization. However, the potential\nof distributed tensor networks for big data privacy preservation have not been\nconsidered before, this motivates the current study. Our primary intuition is\nthat tensor network representations are mathematically non-unique, unlinkable,\nand uninterpretable; tensor network representations naturally support a range\nof multilinear operations for compressed and distributed / dispersed\ncomputation. Therefore, we propose randomized algorithms to decompose big data\ninto randomized tensor network representations and analyze the privacy leakage\nfor 1D to 3D data tensors. The randomness mainly comes from the complex\nstructural information commonly found in big data; randomization is based on\ncontrolled perturbation applied to the tensor blocks prior to decomposition.\nThe distributed tensor representations are dispersed on multiple clouds / fogs\nor servers / devices with metadata privacy, this provides both distributed\ntrust and management to seamlessly secure big data storage, communication,\nsharing, and computation.

As such, in\nthis thesis we propose a reversible approach to Petri nets by introducing\nmachinery and associated operational semantics to tackle the challenges of the\nmain forms of reversibility. Our proposal concerns a variation of cyclic Petri\nnets, called Reversing Petri Nets (RPNs) where tokens are persistent and\ndistinguished from each other by an identity. An immediate extension of the\noriginal model includes allowing multiple tokens of the same base/type to occur\nin a model. Specifically, we explore the individual token interpretation where\none distinguishes different tokens residing in the same place by keeping track\nof where they come from. We also propose the collective token interpretation,\nas the opposite approach to token ambiguity, which considers all tokens of a\ncertain type to be identical, disregarding their history during execution. Both\nof the proposed models of RPNs (with single or multi tokens) implement the\nnotion of uncontrolled reversibility, meaning that it specifies how to reverse\nan execution and allows to do so freely, yet it places no restrictions as to\nwhen and whether to prefer backward execution over forward execution or vice\nversa. In this respect, a further aim is to control reversibility by extending\nour formal semantics where transitions are associated with conditions whose\nsatisfaction allows the execution of transitions in the forward/reversed\ndirection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 16:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}
