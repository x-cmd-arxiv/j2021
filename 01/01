Making use of holography its dynamics is studied far from\nand near a critical point with the following results. Near a critical point the\ninterface between cold and hot stable phases, given by its width and surface\ntension, is found to feature a wider phase separation and a smaller surface\ntension. Far away from a critical point the formation time of the spinodal\ninstability is reduced. Across softer and harder phase transitions, it is\ndemonstrated that mergers of equilibrated peaks and unstable plateaux lead to\nthe preferred final single phase separated solution. Finally, a new atypical\nsetup with dissipation of a peak into a plateau is discovered.

Our approach outperforms conventional mapping methods\non bilingual lexicon induction, and obtains competitive results in the\ndownstream XNLI task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 17:10:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 21:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

While\nthese features are easily observed, what permits their recuring initiation,\ngrowth, and recession is not immediately clear. Ants rafts are comprised of a\nfloating, structural network of interconnected ants on which a layer of freely\nactive ants walks. We show here that sustained shape evolution is permitted by\ntreadmilling defined by the competition between perpetual raft contraction due\nto displacement of bulk structural ants into the active layer, and outwards\nraft expansion due to deposition of free ants into the structural network at\nthe edges. Furthermore, we see that protrusions emerge due to asymmetries in\nthe edge deposition rate of surface ants, and we provide strong evidence that\nthese asymmetries occur stochastically due to wall accumulation effects and\nlocal alignment interactions. Together these effects permit the cooperative,\nyet spontaneous formation of protrusions that fire ants utilize for functional\nexploration and to escape flooded environments. Ant raft dynamics mirror the\ntreadmilling that facilitates morphogenesis and motility of cytoskeletons, thus\nproviding another example in which reshaping of condensed active matter is\nexplained by free constituent transport, yet whose continuance relies on\nperpetual phase transition between structural and free members.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 18:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

Saliency maps are one of\nthe most widely-used local explanation tools to alleviate this problem. One of\nthe primary approaches for generating saliency maps is by optimizing a mask\nover the input dimensions so that the output of the network is influenced the\nmost by the masking. However, prior work only studies such influence by\nremoving evidence from the input. In this paper, we present iGOS++, a framework\nto generate saliency maps that are optimized for altering the output of the\nblack-box system by either removing or preserving only a small fraction of the\ninput. Additionally, we propose to add a bilateral total variation term to the\noptimization that improves the continuity of the saliency map especially under\nhigh resolution and with thin object parts.

We find that, in the scattering response of such\ntime-modulated systems, the output frequencies are inherently prohibited from\nspectrally preceding the input frequencies, hence we refer to these systems as\n'spectrally causal'. We explore the consequences of this newly introduced\nconcept for several relevant applications, including broadband perfect\nabsorption, temporal cloaking of an 'event', and truly unidirectional\npropagation along a synthetic dimension. By emulating the concept of causality\nin the spectral domain and providing new tools to extend the field of\ntemporally modulated metamaterials (\"chrono-metamaterials\") into the complex\nrealm, our findings may open unexplored opportunities and enable relevant\ntechnological advances in various areas of photonics and, more broadly, of wave\nphysics and engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 18:18:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 19:29:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 16:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

The method\nrelies upon three observations: First, most simple radial galaxy profiles of\ncommon interest (deVaucouleurs, exponential, Sersic) can be approximated as\nmixtures of Gaussians. Second, the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is a\nGaussian, thus the Fourier transform of a mixture-of-Gausssian approximation of\na galaxy can be directly evaluated as a mixture of Gaussians in Fourier space.\nThird, if a mixture component would result in Fourier-space aliasing, that\ncomponent can be evaluated in real space. For mixture components to be\nevaluated in Fourier space, we use the FFT for the PSF model, direct evaluation\nof the Fourier transform for the galaxy, and the inverse-FFT to return the\nresult to pixel space. For mixture components to be evaluated in real\nspace---which only happens when the mixture components is much larger than the\nPSF---we use a simple Gaussian approximation of the PSF, perform the\nconvolution analytically, and evaluate in real pixel space. The method is fast\nand exact (to the extent that the mixture-of-Gaussians approximation of the\ngalaxy profile is exact) as long as the pixelized PSF model is well sampled.\nThis Fourier method can be seen as a way of applying a perfect low-pass filter\nto the (typically strongly undersampled) galaxy profile before convolution by\nthe PSF, at exactly the Nyquist frequency of the PSF pixel model grid. In this\nway, it avoids the computational expense of a traditional super-resolution\napproach. This method allows the efficient use of pixelized PSF models (ie, a\nPSF represented as a grid of pixel values) in galaxy forward model-fitting\napproaches such as the Tractor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 18:18:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

If, as in QED in\n(3+1)-$d$ these particles are massive, the particle production rate is\nexponentially suppressed below a threshold field strength. Above this\nthreshold, the energy for pair creation must come from the electric field\nitself which ought to eventually relax to the threshold strength. Calculating\nthis relaxation in a self-consistent manner, however, is difficult. Chu and\nVachaspati addressed this problem in the context of capacitor discharge in\nmassless QED$_2$ [1] by utilizing bosonization in two-dimensions. When the bare\nfermions are massless, the dual bosonized theory is free and capacitor\ndischarge can be analyzed exactly [1], however, special care is required in its\ninterpretation given that the theory exhibits confinement. In this paper we\nreinterpret the findings of [1], where the capacitors Schwinger-discharge via\nelectrically neutral dipolar meson-production, and generalize this to the case\nwhere the fermions have bare masses. Crucially, we note that when the initial\ncharge of the capacitor is large compared to the charge of the fermions, $Q \\gg\ne$, the classical equation of motion for the bosonized model accurately\ncharacterizes the dynamics of discharge. For massless QED$_2$, we find that the\ndischarge is suppressed below a critical plate separation that is commensurate\nwith the length scale associated with the meson dipole moment. For massive\nQED$_2$, we find in addition, a mass threshold familiar from (3+1)-$d$, and\nshow the electric field relaxes to a final steady state with a magnitude\nproportional to the initial charge.

Examples are given along with the discussion of each general\nresult, comparisons are made with the existing entropy difference bounds, and\nnew mutual information upper bounds are derived based on the new results. We\nthen apply the entropy difference bounds to the theory of statistical learning.\nIt is shown that the excess risks in the two popular learning paradigms, the\nfrequentist learning and the Bayesian learning, both can be studied with the\ncontinuity property of different forms of the generalized entropy.

We also introduce a new multi-modal video\ndataset, VicarPPG 2, specifically designed to evaluate rPPG algorithms on HR\nand HRV estimation. We validate and study our method under various conditions\non a comprehensive range of public and self-recorded datasets, showing\nstate-of-the-art results and providing useful insights into some unique\naspects. Lastly, we make available CleanerPPG, a collection of human-verified\nground truth peak/heart-beat annotations for existing rPPG datasets. These\nverified annotations should make future evaluations and benchmarking of rPPG\nalgorithms more accurate, standardized and fair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 18:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

However, the high degree\nof plasticity and cross-population variability in human brains makes it\ndifficult to relate structure to function, motivating a search for invariant\npatterns in the connectivity. At the same time, variability within a population\ncan provide information about generative mechanisms. In this paper we analyze\nthe connection topology and link-weight distribution of human structural\nconnectomes obtained from a database comprising 196 subjects. By demonstrating\na correspondence between the occurrence frequency of individual links and their\naverage weight across the population, we show that the process by which the\nbrain is wired is not independent of the process by which the link weights of\nthe connectome are determined. Furthermore, using the specific distribution of\nthe weights associated with each link over the entire population, we show that\na single parameter that is specific to a link can account for its frequency of\noccurrence, as well as, the variation in its weight across different subjects.\nThis parameter provides a basis for ``rescaling'' the link weights in each\nconnectome, allowing us to obtain a generic network representative of the human\nbrain, distinct from a simple average over the connectomes. We obtain\nfunctional connectomes by implementing a neural mass model on each of the\nvertices of the corresponding structural connectomes. By comparing with the\nempirical functional brain networks, we demonstrate that the rescaling\nprocedure yields a closer structure-function correspondence. Finally, we show\nthat the representative network can be decomposed into a basal component that\nis stable across the population and a highly variable superstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 18:58:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

Using the public archival data\nfrom the GIRAFFE spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), we locate new\nmembers and provide refined measurements of physical parameters for these dwarf\ngalaxies. We identify nine new Leo IV members and four new Leo V members, and\nperform a comparative analysis of previously discovered members. Additionally,\nwe identify one new binary star in both Leo IV and Leo V. After removing binary\nstars, we recalculate the velocity dispersions of Bo\\\"otes I and Leo IV to be\n5.1$^{+0.7}_{-0.8}$ and 3.4$^{+1.3}_{-0.9}$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively; We do\nnot resolve the Leo V velocity dispersion. We identify a weak velocity gradient\nin Leo V that is $\\sim$4$\\times$ smaller than the previously calculated\ngradient and that has a corresponding position angle which differs from the\nliterature value by $\\sim$120 deg. Combining the VLT data with previous\nliterature, we re-analyze the Bo\\\"otes I metallicity distribution function and\nfind that a model including infall of pristine gas while Bo\\\"otes I was forming\nstars best fits the data. Our analysis of Leo IV, Leo V and other UFDs will\nenhance our understanding of these enigmatic stellar populations and contribute\nto future dark matter studies.

Then based on a\nsystematic understanding of covariance functions within the Gaussian process\nregression, two related data-driven models are developed. Specifically, by\nmodifying the isotropic squared exponential kernel with an automatic relevance\ndetermination structure, 'Model A' could extract the highly relevant input\nfeatures for capacity predictions.

Training an ML-PES is typically performed in\ntwo stages: feature extraction and structure-property relationship modeling.\nThe feature extraction stage transforms atomic positions into a\nsymmetry-invariant mathematical representation. This representation can be\nfine-tuned by adjusting on a set of so-called \"hyper-parameters\" (HPs).\nSubsequently, an ML algorithm such as neural networks or Gaussian process\nregression (GPR) is used to model the structure-PES relationship based on\nanother set of HPs. Choosing optimal values for the two sets of HPs is critical\nto ensure the high quality of the resulting ML-PES model.\n  In this paper, we explore HP optimization strategies tailored for ML-PES\ngeneration using a custom-coded parallel particle swarm optimizer (available\nfreely at https://github.com/suresh0807/PPSO.git). We employ the smooth overlap\nof atomic positions (SOAP) descriptor in combination with GPR-based Gaussian\napproximation potentials (GAP) and optimize HPs for four distinct systems: a\ntoy C dimer, amorphous carbon, $\\alpha$-Fe, and small organic molecules (QM9\ndataset). We propose a two-step optimization strategy in which the HPs related\nto the feature extraction stage are optimized first, followed by the\noptimization of the HPs in the training stage. This strategy is computationally\nmore efficient than optimizing all HPs at the same time by means of\nsignificantly reducing the number of ML models needed to be trained to obtain\nthe optimal HPs. This approach can be trivially extended to other combinations\nof descriptor and ML algorithm and brings us another step closer to fully\nautomated ML-PES generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 19:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

This structure descends to a resolution of the\nquotient as a stratified space.

By performing these\nmeasurements simultaneously with elastoresistivity in a multimodal fashion, we\nare able to make a direct and unambiguous comparison of these closely related\nthermodynamic and transport properties, both of which are sensitive to nematic\nfluctuations. As a result, we have uncovered an unanticipated doping-dependence\nof the nemato-elastic coupling and of the magnitude of the scattering of low\nenergy quasi-particles by nematic fluctuations -- while the former weakens, the\nlatter increases dramatically with increasing doping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 21:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

(ii)\npractitioners attitudes towards code smells removal in web apps have changed\nthroughout time? (iii) how long code smells survive in web applications? (iv)\nare there sudden variations (anomalies) in the density of code smells through\nthe evolution of web apps?\n  Method: We analyze the evolution of 6 code smells in 8 web applications\nwritten in PHP at the server side, across several years, using the survival\nanalysis technique. We classify code smells according to scope in two\ncategories: scattered and localized. Scattered code smells are expected to be\nmore harmful since their influence is not circumscribed as in localized code\nsmells. We split the observations for each web app into two equal and\nconsecutive timeframes, to test the hypothesis that code smells awareness has\nincreased throughout time. As for the anomalies, we standardize their detection\ncriteria.\n  Results: We present some evidence that code smells survival depends on their\nscope: the average survival rate decreases in some of them, while the opposite\nis observed for the remainder. The survival of localized code smells is around\n4 years, while the scattered ones live around 5 years. Around 60% of the smells\nare removed, and some live through all the application life.

Separate expressions\nfor structure functions in terms of quark and hadronic degrees of freedom are\npresented, with a goal of relating the two expressions. A two-parton model is\ndefined and resonance transition form factors are computed using previously\nderived light front wave functions. A new form of global duality is derived\nfrom the valence quark-number sum rule. Using a complete set of hadronic states\nis necessary for this new global duality to be achieved. Previous original work\ndoes not provide such a set. This is remedied by amending the model to include\na longitudinal confining potential, and the resulting complete set is\nsufficient to carry out the study of Bloom-Gilman duality. Expressions for\ntransition form factors are obtained and all are shown to fall asymptotically\nas 1/Q2.

In this paper, we selectively review\nsome recently-developed statistical methods, including communication efficient\ndistributed statistical inference, and renewal estimation and incremental\ninference, which can be regarded as the latest development of calibration\ninformation methods in the era of big data. Even though those methods were\ndeveloped in different fields and in different statistical frameworks, in\nprinciple, they are asymptotically equivalent to those well known methods\ndeveloped in meta analysis. Almost no or little information is lost compared\nwith the case when full data are available. As a general tool to integrate\ninformation, we also review the generalized method of moments and estimating\nequations approach by using empirical likelihood method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 23:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

The dynamical\ncontraction of the pre-stellar core ultimately leads to the formation of a\nfirst hydrostatic core, after ambipolar diffusion decouples the magnetic field\nfrom the predominantly neutral gas. The hydrostatic core accumulates angular\nmomentum from the infalling material, evolving into a rotationally supported\ntorus; this `first hydrostatic torus' then forms an accreting protostar and a\nrotationally supported disc. The disc spreads out by gravitational instability,\nreaching $\\sim$30 au in diameter at $\\sim$3 kyr after protostar formation. The\ntotal mass and angular momentum of the protostar-disc system are determined\nmainly by accretion of gas from an infalling pseudo-disc, which has low\nspecific angular momentum because of magnetic braking; their removal from the\nprotostar-disc system by outflow and disc magnetic braking are negligible, in\npart because the magnetic field is poorly coupled there. The redistribution of\nangular momentum within the protostar-disc system is facilitated mainly by\ngravitational instability; this allows formation of relatively large discs even\nwhen the specific angular momentum of infalling material is low.

To address the limitations of previous\napproaches, in this paper, we propose an alternative commonsense knowledge\nacquisition framework DISCOS (from DIScourse to COmmonSense), which\nautomatically populates expensive complex commonsense knowledge to more\naffordable linguistic knowledge resources. Experiments demonstrate that we can\nsuccessfully convert discourse knowledge about eventualities from ASER, a\nlarge-scale discourse knowledge graph, into if-then commonsense knowledge\ndefined in ATOMIC without any additional annotation effort. Further study\nsuggests that DISCOS significantly outperforms previous supervised approaches\nin terms of novelty and diversity with comparable quality. In total, we can\nacquire 3.4M ATOMIC-like inferential commonsense knowledge by populating ATOMIC\non the core part of ASER.

Many analytical and numerical\ntechniques produce dispersion curves from physics-based models.

For such cases, this\npaper proposes a novel method to estimate group velocities from experimental\ndata-driven models. Experimental frequency response functions (FRFs) are used\nto develop data-driven models, {which are then used to estimate dispersion\ncurves}. The advantages of this approach over other traditionally used\ntransient techniques stem from the need to conduct only steady-state\nexperiments. In comparison, transient experiments often need a higher-sampling\nrate for wave-propagation applications and are more susceptible to noise.\n  The vector-fitting (VF) algorithm is adopted to develop data-driven models\nfrom experimental in-plane and out-of-plane FRFs of a one-dimensional\nstructure. The quality of the corresponding data-driven estimates is evaluated\nusing an analytical Timoshenko beam as a baseline. The data-driven model (using\nthe out-of-plane FRFs) estimates the anti-symmetric ($A_0$) group velocity with\na maximum error of $4\\%$ over a 40~kHz frequency band. In contrast, group\nvelocities estimated from transient experiments resulted in a maximum error of\n$6\\%$ over the same frequency band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2021 03:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

The collected data and learned\nknowledge can help the vehicular service provider (VSP) improve the global\nmodel accuracy, e.g., for road safety as well as better profits for both VSP\nand participating SVs. Nonetheless, there exist major challenges when\nimplementing the FL in IoV networks, such as dynamic activities and diverse\nquality-of-information (QoI) from a large number of SVs, VSP's limited payment\nbudget, and profit competition among SVs. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndynamic FL-based economic framework for an IoV network to address these\nchallenges. Specifically, the VSP first implements an SV selection method to\ndetermine a set of the best SVs for the FL process according to the\nsignificance of their current locations and information history at each\nlearning round. Then, each selected SV can collect on-road information and\noffer a payment contract to the VSP based on its collected QoI.

Residual networks have transformed many\nfields like image classification, face recognition and object detection with\ntheir robust structure.

Here, we resolve at the\nsingle-charge scale, the dynamics of proton charges at the interface between an\nhBN crystal and binary mixtures of water and organic amphiphilic solvents (e.g.\nalcohol), evidencing a dramatic influence of solvation on interfacial dynamics.\nOur observations rely on the application of spectral Single Molecule\nLocalization Microscopy (sSMLM) to two types of optically active defects at the\nhBN surface, which act as intrinsic optical markers for both surface\nprotonation and interaction with apolar alkyl groups of the organic solvent. We\nuse sSMLM to reveal interfacial proton charge transport as a succession of\njumps between the titratable surface defects, mediated by the transport of the\nsolvated proton charge along the solid/liquid interface. By changing the\nrelative concentration of water in binary mixtures, we evidence a non-trivial\neffect on interfacial proton charge dynamics, leading at intermediate water\nconcentration to an increased affinity of the proton charge to the solid\nsurface, accompanied by an increased surface diffusivity.

The nonconvex reformulation\nbased on the low-rank factorization, significantly improves the computational\nefficiency but brings some new challenge to the analysis. The stochastic\nvariance reduced gradient (SVRG) method has been regarded as one of the most\neffective methods. SVRG in general consists of two loops, where a reference\nfull gradient is first evaluated in the outer loop and then used to yield a\nvariance reduced estimate of the current gradient in the inner loop. Two\noptions have been suggested to yield the output of the inner loop, where Option\nI sets the output as its last iterate, and Option II yields the output via\nrandom sampling from all the iterates in the inner loop. However, there is a\nsignificant gap between the theory and practice of SVRG when adapted to the\nstochastic semidefinite programming (SDP). SVRG practically works better with\nOption I, while most of existing theoretical results focus on Option II. In\nthis paper, we fill this gap via exploiting a new semi-stochastic variant of\nthe original SVRG with Option I adapted to the semidefinite optimization.\nEquipped with this, we establish the global linear submanifold convergence\n(i.e., converging exponentially fast to a submanifold of a global minimum under\nthe orthogonal group action) of the proposed SVRG method, given a provable\ninitialization scheme and under certain smoothness and restricted strongly\nconvex assumptions.

Here,\npackets from different sensing sources have different values or degrees of\nimportance to the central controller for intelligent decision making. In such a\nsetup, it is critical to provide timely and valuable information for the\ncentral controller. In this paper, we develop a parameterized maximum-weight\ntype scheduling policy that combines both the AoI metrics and Upper Confidence\nBound (UCB) estimates in its weight measure with parameter $\\eta$. Here, UCB\nestimates balance the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation in learning\nand are critical for yielding a small cumulative regret.

We also prove that our proposed algorithm achieves the cumulative\nregret over time horizon $T$ at most by $O(NT/\\eta+\\sqrt{NT\\log T})$. This\nreveals a tradeoff between the cumulative regret and the running average total\nage: when increasing $\\eta$, the cumulative regret becomes smaller, but is at\nthe cost of increasing running average total age.

This account, which I will call typicality\nfrequentism, will evade the major criticisms raised against previous forms of\nfrequentism. In this theory, probabilities arise within a physical theory from\nstatistical behavior of almost all initial conditions. The main advantage of\ntypicality frequentism is that it shows which kinds of probabilities (that also\nhave empirical relevance) can be derived from physics. Although one cannot\nrecover all probability talk in this account, this is rather a virtue than a\nvice, because it shows which types of probabilities can in fact arise from\nphysics and which types need to be explained in different ways, thereby opening\nthe path for a pluralistic account of probabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 18:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

In a\nRiemannian-geometric context, the stability/instability of the dynamics depends\non the curvature properties of the ambient manifold and is investigated by\nmeans of the Jacobi--Levi-Civita (JLC) equation for geodesic spread. It is\nconfirmed that the dominant mechanism at the ground of chaotic dynamics is\nparametric instability due to curvature variations along the geodesics. A\ncomparison is reported of the outcomes of the JLC equation written also for the\nJacobi metric on configuration space and for another metric due to Eisenhart on\nan extended configuration space-time.
