Extensive\nstudies have elucidated the different ways in which this phenomenon may arise.\nNevertheless, how collective migration can persist when a population is\nconfronted with perturbations, which inevitably arise in complex settings, is\npoorly understood. Here, by combining experiments and simulations, we describe\na mechanism by which collectively migrating populations smooth out large-scale\nperturbations in their overall morphology, enabling their constituents to\ncontinue to migrate together. We focus on the canonical example of chemotactic\nmigration of Escherichia coli, in which fronts of cells move via directed\nmotion, or chemotaxis, in response to a self-generated nutrient gradient. We\nidentify two distinct modes in which chemotaxis influences the morphology of\nthe population: cells in different locations along a front migrate at different\nvelocities due to spatial variations in (i) the local nutrient gradient and in\n(ii) the ability of cells to sense and respond to the local nutrient gradient.\nWhile the first mode is destabilizing, the second mode is stabilizing and\ndominates, ultimately driving smoothing of the overall population and enabling\ncontinued collective migration. This process is autonomous, arising without any\nexternal intervention; instead, it is a population-scale consequence of the\nmanner in which individual cells transduce external signals. Our findings thus\nprovide insights to predict, and potentially control, the collective migration\nand morphology of cell populations and diverse other forms of active matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 16:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

Dual-unitary circuits have been recently introduced as solvable\nmodels of many-body nonintegrable quantum chaotic systems having a hierarchy of\nergodic properties. We extend this to include the apex of a putative quantum\nergodic hierarchy which is Bernoulli, in the sense that correlations of single\nand two-particle observables vanish at space-time separated points. We derive a\ncondition based on the entangling power $e_p(U)$ of the basic two-particle\nunitary building block, $U$, of the circuit, that guarantees mixing, and when\nmaximized, corresponds to Bernoulli circuits.

This is shown in the framework of stochastic thermodynamics for\nspecial geometrical frustrated systems (GFSs), which have maximum entropy at\nits ground state and constant negative temperature. For two GFSs in weak\nthermal contact and at same temperature, all energetic constellations are equal\nprobable. A hot and a cool GFS in contact is driven by entropic forces via heat\ntransfer to a most probable state in which the hot GFS is in its ground state.\nThe same holds for a GFS in contact with a gas. As this is not a local maximum\nof entropy both subsystems maintain different temperatures here.\nRe-parametrization can transform these non-local into local maxima with\ncorresponding equivalence of re-defined temperatures. However, these\ntemperatures cannot be assigned solely to a subsystem but describe combinations\nof both.The non-local maxima of entropy restrict the naive application of the\nzeroth law of thermodynamics. Reformulated this law is still valid with the\nconsequence that a GFS at constant negative temperature can measure positive\ntemperatures. A GFS combined with a polarized paramagnetic spin gas may have a\nlocal or non-local maxima of entropy, with equivalent or non-equivalent\ntemperatures, respectively. In case of a local maximum the spin gas can measure\nthe temperature of the GFS, however, it does not reveal information about its\nenergetic state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 16:24:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 May 2021 14:15:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 12:47:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 11:40:31 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 12:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

Historically, perturbative analysis of gravitational-wave sources has\nlargely focused on post-Newtonian theory. However, strong-field perturbation\ntheory is essential in many cases such as the quasinormal ringdown following\nthe merger of a binary system, tidally perturbed compact objects, and\nextreme-mass-ratio inspirals. In this review, motivated primarily by\nsmall-mass-ratio binaries but not limited to them, we provide an overview of\nessential methods in (i) black hole perturbation theory, (ii) orbital mechanics\nin Kerr spacetime, and (iii) gravitational self-force theory. Our treatment of\nblack hole perturbation theory covers most common methods, including the\nTeukolsky and Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations, methods of metric\nreconstruction, and Lorenz-gauge formulations, presenting them in a new\nconsistent and self-contained form. Our treatment of orbital mechanics covers\nquasi-Keplerian and action-angle descriptions of bound geodesics and\naccelerated orbits, osculating geodesics, near-identity averaging\ntransformations, multiscale expansions, and orbital resonances. Our summary of\nself-force theory's foundations is brief, covering the main ideas and results\nof matched asymptotic expansions, local expansion methods, puncture schemes,\nand point particle descriptions. We conclude by combining the above methods in\na multiscale expansion of the perturbative Einstein equations, leading to\nadiabatic and post-adiabatic evolution schemes. Our presentation is intended\nprimarily as a reference for practitioners but includes a variety of new\nresults. In particular, we present the first complete post-adiabatic\nwaveform-generation framework for generic (nonresonant) orbits in Kerr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 16:44:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 13:15:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 22:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

The recent discovery of much greater magnetic flux cancellation\ntaking place at the photosphere than previously realised has led us in our\nprevious works to suggest magnetic reconnection driven by flux cancellation as\nthe cause of a wide range of dynamic phenomena, including jets of various kinds\nand solar atmospheric heating.

We analytically study\nreconnection and treat the current sheet as a three-dimensional structure. We\napply the theory to the cancellation of two fragments of equal but opposite\nflux that approach each another and are located in an overlying horizontal\nmagnetic field. Results. The energy release occurs in two phases. During Phase\n1, a separator is formed and reconnection is driven at it as it rises to a\nmaximum height and then moves back down to the photosphere, heating the plasma\nand accelerating a plasma jet as it does so. During Phase 2 the fluxes cancel\nin the photosphere and accelerate a mixture of cool and hot plasma upwards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 16:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

The\nlimitation mainly stems from the fact that Coulomb's theory (and its\nderivatives) is a simplification that intentionally ignores deformation\ncharacteristics that manifest from the particulate nature of such materials. It\nis thus customary to apply a branch of plasticity called non-associated\nplasticity for soils and similar materials. In the non-associated plasticity\nframework, yield functions and plastic potential functions are different. The\nformer defines the mobilization of the stress state while the later defines the\ndirection of plastic flow. For soils, stress-dilatancy theories have become\ncentral in the formulation of non-associated flow rules. In this paper, cyclic\nstress-dilatancy relations are derived based on complementarity hypothesis of\nstress-dilatancy conjugates. Both loading and unloading are explicitly\nconsidered. Then, yield functions are derived based on the resulting\nstress-dilatancy relations. In so doing, the resulting yield functions are\nrendered with a quality to be used for the modelling of deformation behavior of\nsoils subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. The newly derived\nyield functions are called Associated Cyclic Stress Dilatancy yield functions\nfor which the abbreviation ACStD is used. The theoretical framework is\nestablished first for special cases of deformation modes-plane strain and\naxisymmetric.

A\nsubtle interplay has been proposed to exist between the excitation of\nwell-defined resonant surface plasmons and the focusing capability of a\nsuperlens. To gain insights into these resonant modes and their contributions\nto the amplification and recovery of evanescent waves, we performed simple but\nrobust full-wave FDTD simulations on causal negative index Lorentz models. We\nfound that well-defined pair of resonant surface plasmons is excited whenever a\ncoupling of a diverging transmitted beam and a converging refracted beam occurs\nat the second interface. The resonant coupling of these modes at the interface\nled to the excitation of a single interface resonance predicted by the theory.\nThe physical consequence of this resonance is that incident wave energy is\npumped into the negative-index material medium and beyond it. These phenomena\ncontribute substantially to the amplification and recovery of the near-fields\nin the image plane. It is noteworthy that, for evanescent wave refocusing to be\nachieved in a flat superlens, its thickness, and the source-to-superlens\ndistance should be optimized. This optimization is critical in that an optimal\nthickness alongside optimal source-to-superlens distance will allow evanescent\nwave refocusing to dominate material lost. The FDTD simulated result showed an\nimage of the point source inside the superlens and beyond it when its thickness\nwas optimized. The resolution of the image beyond the superlens was\n$\\sim.58\\lambda$ and this superlens behaves like a near-perfect lens. Overall,\nthese numerically simulated results could serve as useful approximations to the\ndegree of resonant amplification and refocusing of near-fields that can be\nachieved by flat superlens in near-fields experimental imaging setups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 17:26:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

The denoising solutions suffer from\nepistemic uncertainty that can limit further advancements. This uncertainty is\ntraditionally mitigated through different ensemble approaches. However, such\nensembles are prohibitively costly with deep networks, which are already large\nin size.\n  Our work focuses on pushing the performance limits of state-of-the-art\nmethods on Gaussian denoising.

This limitation calls for\nnew solvers that are capable of utilizing the power of linear and convex\nprogramming to reason about general multivariate polynomials. In this paper, we\npropose PolyAR, a highly parallelizable solver for polynomial inequality\nconstraints. PolyAR provides several key contributions. First, it uses convex\nrelaxations of the problem to accelerate the process of finding a solution to\nthe set of the non-convex multivariate polynomials. Second, it utilizes an\niterative convex abstraction refinement process which aims to prune the search\nspace and identify regions for which the convex relaxation fails to solve the\nproblem.

Various studies have shown that the\ndissipation of tides in either body is very sensitive to its structure and to\nits dynamics, like differential rotation which exists in the outer convective\nenveloppe of solar-like stars and giant gaseous planets. In particular, tidal\nwaves may strongly interact with zonal flows at the so-called corotation\nresonances, where the wave's Doppler-shifted frequency cancels out. We aim to\nprovide a deep physical understanding of the dynamics of tidal inertial waves\nat corotation resonances, in the presence of differential rotation profiles\ntypical of low-mass stars and giant planets. By developping an inclined\nshearing box, we investigate the propagation and the transmission of free\ninertial waves at corotation, and more generally at critical levels, which are\nsingularities in the governing wave differential equation. Through the\nconstruction of an invariant called the wave action flux, we identify different\nregimes of wave transmission at critical levels, which are confirmed with a\none-dimensional three-layer numerical model. We find that inertial waves can be\neither fully transmitted, strongly damped, or even amplified after crossing a\ncritical level. The occurrence of these regimes depends on the assumed profile\nof differential rotation, on the nature as well as the latitude of the critical\nlevel, and on wave parameters such as the inertial frequency and the\nlongitudinal and vertical wavenumbers. Waves can thus either deposit their\naction flux to the fluid when damped at critical levels, or they can extract\naction flux to the fluid when amplified at critical levels. Both situations\ncould lead to significant angular momentum exchange between the tidally\ninteracting bodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 18:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

Clusters' shape and the number of filaments they\nare connected to, i.e., their connectivity, should reflect their level of\nanisotropic matter distribution and must be, in principle, related to their\nphysical properties. We investigate the influence of the dynamical state and\nthe formation history on both the morphology and local connectivity of about\n2400 groups and clusters of galaxies from the large hydrodynamical simulation\nIllustrisTNG at z=0. We find that the mass of groups and clusters mainly\ninfluences the geometry of the matter distribution: massive halos are\nsignificantly more elliptical, and more connected to the cosmic web than\nlow-mass ones. Beyond the mass-driven effect, ellipticity and connectivity are\ncorrelated and are imprints of the growth rate of groups and clusters. Both\nanisotropy measures appear to trace different dynamical states, such that\nunrelaxed groups and clusters are more elliptical and more connected than\nrelaxed ones. This relation between matter anisotropies and dynamical state is\nthe sign of different accretion histories. Relaxed groups and clusters are\nmostly formed long time ago, and slowly accreting matter at the present time.\nThey are rather spherical and weakly connected to their environment, mostly\nbecause they had enough time to relax and, hence, lost the connection with\ntheir preferential directions of accretion and merging. In contrast,\nlate-formed unrelaxed objects are highly anisotropic with large connectivities\nand ellipticities. These groups and clusters are in formation phase and must be\nstrongly affected by the infalling of materials from filaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 12:35:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

This Galactic center excess (GCE), has been measured with respect to\ndifferent interstellar emission models (IEMs), source catalogs, data selections\nand techniques. Although several proposed interpretations have appeared in the\nliterature, there are not firm conclusions as to its origin. The main\ndifficulty in solving this puzzle lies in modeling a region of such complexity\nand thus precisely measuring the characteristics of the GCE. In this paper, we\nuse 11 years of Fermi-LAT data, state of the art IEMs, and the newest 4FGL\nsource catalog to provide precise measurements of the energy spectrum, spatial\nmorphology, position, and sphericity of the GCE. We find that the GCE has a\nspectrum which is peaked at a few GeV and is well fit with a log-parabola. The\nnormalization of the spectrum changes by roughly $60\\%$ when using different\nIEMs, data selections and analysis techniques. The spatial distribution of the\nGCE is compatible with a dark matter (DM) template produced with a generalized\nNFW density profile with slope $\\gamma = 1.2-1.3$. No energy evolution is\nmeasured for the GCE morphology between $0.6-30$ GeV at a level larger than\n$10\\%$ of the $\\gamma$ average value, which is 1.25. The analysis of the GCE\nmodeled with a DM template divided into quadrants shows that the spectrum and\nspatial morphology of the GCE is similar in different regions around the\nGalactic center. Finally, the GCE centroid is compatible with the Galactic\ncenter, with best-fit position between\n$l=[-0.3^{\\circ},0.0^{\\circ}],b=[-0.1^{\\circ},0.0^{\\circ}]$, and it is\ncompatible with a spherical symmetric morphology. In particular, fitting the DM\nspatial profile with an ellipsoid gives a major-to-minor axis ratio between\n0.8-1.2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 19:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 13:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

Although there is substantial uncertainty in the satellite parallax\nmeasured by Spitzer, the measurement of the annual parallax effect combined\nwith the finite source effect allows us to determine the mass of the host star\n(M_L = 0.3--0.6 M_Sun), the mass of its planet (m_p = 1.4--3.1 M_Earth), the\nprojected separation between the host and planet (a_perp = 1.2--2.3 au), and\nthe distance to the lens system (D_L = 0.6--1.2 kpc).

However, the\neffectiveness of a simplified model is often below the original one. In this\nletter, we present new methods based on objective and subjective relevance\ncriteria for kernel elimination in a layer-by-layer fashion. During the\nprocess, a CNN model is retrained only when the current layer is entirely\nsimplified, by adjusting the weights from the next layer to the first one and\npreserving weights of subsequent layers not involved in the process. We call\nthis strategy \\emph{progressive retraining}, differently from kernel pruning\nmethods that usually retrain the entire model after each simplification action\n-- e.g., the elimination of one or a few kernels.

To help perform these tasks,\nreverse engineers often use toolkits (such as IDA Pro or Ghidra) that allow\nthem to interactively explicate properties of binaries. We argue that deductive\ndatabases serve as a natural abstraction for interfacing between\nvisualization-based binary analysis tools and high-performance logical\ninference engines that compute facts about binaries. In this paper, we present\na vision for the future in which reverse engineers use a visualization-based\ntool to understand binaries while simultaneously querying a logical-inference\nengine to perform arbitrarily-complex deductive inference tasks. We call our\nvision declarative demand-driven reverse engineering (D^3RE for short), and\nsketch a formal semantics whose goal is to mediate interaction between a\nlogical-inference engine (such Souffle) and a reverse engineering tool. We\ndescribe aprototype tool, d3re, which are using to explore the D^3RE vision.\nWhile still a prototype, we have used d3re to reimplement several common\nquerying tasks on binaries.

We also show how our method can bootstrap a motor skill for the\nchallenging dynamic task of learning to hit a ball off a tee, where a kinematic\nplan based on treating the scene as static is insufficient to solve the task,\nbut sufficient to bootstrap a more dynamic policy. In all three cases, our\nmethod is competitive with human-demonstrated initialization, and significantly\noutperforms starting with a random policy.

A partially observable environment is an environment whose state\nis not completely visible to the program, but from which the program receives\npartial observations. Developers typically deal with partial observability by\nwriting a state estimator that, given observations, attempts to deduce the\nhidden state of the environment. In safety-critical domains, to formally verify\nsafety properties developers may write an environment model. The model captures\nthe relationship between observations and hidden states and is used to prove\nthe software correct.\n  In this paper, we present a new methodology for writing and verifying\nprograms in partially observable environments. We present belief programming, a\nprogramming methodology where developers write an environment model that the\nprogram runtime automatically uses to perform state estimation. A belief\nprogram dynamically updates and queries a belief state that captures the\npossible states the environment could be in. To enable verification, we present\nEpistemic Hoare Logic that reasons about the possible belief states of a belief\nprogram the same way that classical Hoare logic reasons about the possible\nstates of a program. We develop these concepts by defining a semantics and a\nprogram logic for a simple core language called BLIMP. In a case study, we show\nhow belief programming could be used to write and verify a controller for the\nMars Polar Lander in BLIMP. We present an implementation of BLIMP called CBLIMP\nand evaluate it to determine the feasibility of belief programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 20:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

The first algorithm aims at hybrid systems exhibiting sliding\nmodes. The first algorithm has several features which distinguishes it from the\nother algorithms for problems described by hybrid systems. First of all, it can\ncope with hybrid systems which exhibit sliding modes. Secondly, the systems\nmotion on the switching surface is described by index 2 differential--algebraic\nequations and that guarantees accurate tracking of the sliding motion surface.\nThirdly, the gradients of the problems functionals are evaluated with the help\nof adjoint equations. The adjoint equations presented in the paper take into\naccount sliding motion and exhibit jump conditions at transition times. We\nstate optimality conditions in the form of the weak maximum principle for\noptimal control problems with hybrid systems exhibiting sliding modes and with\npiecewise differentiable controls. The second algorithm is for optimal control\nproblems with hybrid systems which do not exhibit sliding motion. In the case\nof this algorithm we assume that control functions are measurable functions.\nFor each algorithm, we show that every accumulation point of the sequence\ngenerated by the algorithm satisfies the weak maximum principle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 21:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

Therefore, limiting central access is important,\nespecially in healthcare settings, where data regulations are strict. A\npotential approach to tackling this is Federated Learning (FL), which enables\nmultiple parties to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model by using\nparameters of locally trained models while keeping raw training data locally.\nIn the context of AI-assisted pain-monitoring, we wish to enable\nconfidentiality-preserving and unobtrusive pain estimation for long-term\npain-monitoring and reduce the burden on the nursing staff who perform frequent\nroutine check-ups. To this end, we propose a novel Personalized Federated Deep\nLearning (PFDL) approach for pain estimation from face images. PFDL performs\ncollaborative training of a deep model, implemented using a lightweight CNN\narchitecture, across different clients (i.e., subjects) without sharing their\nface images. Instead of sharing all parameters of the model, as in standard FL,\nPFDL retains the last layer locally (used to personalize the pain estimates).\nThis (i) adds another layer of data confidentiality, making it difficult for an\nadversary to infer pain levels of the target subject, while (ii) personalizing\nthe pain estimation to each subject through local parameter tuning. We show\nusing a publicly available dataset of face videos of pain (UNBC-McMaster\nShoulder Pain Database), that PFDL performs comparably or better than the\nstandard centralized and FL algorithms, while further enhancing data privacy.\nThis, has the potential to improve traditional pain monitoring by making it\nmore secure, computationally efficient, and scalable to a large number of\nindividuals (e.g., for in-home pain monitoring), providing timely and\nunobtrusive pain measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 23:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

Instead of contrasting NOMA with OMA, we\ncontrast NOMA with two other baselines. The first is conventional Multi-User\nLinear Precoding (MULP). The second is Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)\nbased on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) and SIC. We show that there is some\nconfusion about the benefits of NOMA, and we dispel the associated\nmisconceptions. First, we highlight why NOMA is inefficient in multi-antenna\nsettings based on basic multiplexing gain analysis. We stress that the issue\nlies in how the NOMA literature has been hastily applied to multi-antenna\nsetups, resulting in a misuse of spatial dimensions and therefore loss in\nmultiplexing gains and rate. Second, we show that NOMA incurs a severe\nmultiplexing gain loss despite an increased receiver complexity due to an\ninefficient use of SIC receivers. Third, we emphasize that much of the merits\nof NOMA are due to the constant comparison to OMA instead of comparing it to\nMULP and RS baselines. We then expose the pivotal design constraint that\nmulti-antenna NOMA requires one user to fully decode the messages of the other\nusers. This design constraint is responsible for the multiplexing gain erosion,\nrate loss, and inefficient use of SIC receivers in multi-antenna settings. Our\nresults confirm that NOMA should not be applied blindly to multi-antenna\nsettings, highlight the scenarios where MULP outperforms NOMA and vice versa,\nand demonstrate the inefficiency, performance loss and complexity disadvantages\nof NOMA compared to RS. The first takeaway message is that, while NOMA is not\nbeneficial in most multi-antenna deployments. The second takeaway message is\nthat other non-orthogonal transmission frameworks, such as RS, exist which\nfully exploit the multiplexing gain and the benefits of SIC to boost the rate\nin multi-antenna settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 23:24:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

The present paper extends the\ndensity-based empirical likelihood technique in order to nonparametrically\napproximate the most powerful test for the multivariate two-sample (MTS)\nproblem, yielding an exact finite-sample test statistic. We rigorously\nestablish and apply one-to-one-mapping between the equality of vectors\ndistributions and the equality of distributions of relevant univariate linear\nprojections. In this framework, we prove an algorithm that simplifies the use\nof projection pursuit, employing only a few of the infinitely many linear\ncombinations of observed vectors components. The displayed distribution-free\nstrategy is employed in retrospective and group sequential manners. The\nasymptotic consistency of the proposed technique is shown. Monte Carlo studies\ndemonstrate that the proposed procedures exhibit extremely high and stable\npower characteristics across a variety of settings.

Many studies have shown that attacks are also possible\neven in a black-box setting where an adversary cannot access the target model's\ninternal information. Most black-box attacks are based on queries, each of\nwhich obtains the target model's output for an input, and many recent studies\nfocus on reducing the number of required queries. In this paper, we pay\nattention to an implicit assumption of query-based black-box adversarial\nattacks that the target model's output exactly corresponds to the query input.\nIf some randomness is introduced into the model, it can break the assumption,\nand thus, query-based attacks may have tremendous difficulty in both gradient\nestimation and local search, which are the core of their attack process.

To verify\nthat Robustness Gym can aid novel research analyses, we perform the first study\nof state-of-the-art commercial and academic named entity linking (NEL) systems,\nas well as a fine-grained analysis of state-of-the-art summarization models.\nFor NEL, commercial systems struggle to link rare entities and lag their\nacademic counterparts by 10%+, while state-of-the-art summarization models\nstruggle on examples that require abstraction and distillation, degrading by\n9%+.

An optimal dose distribution based on a specific\nanatomy can be predicted by pre-trained deep learning (DL) models. However,\ndose distributions are often optimized based on not only patient-specific\nanatomy but also physician preferred trade-offs between planning target volume\n(PTV) coverage and organ at risk (OAR) sparing. Therefore, it is desirable to\nallow physicians to fine-tune the dose distribution predicted based on patient\nanatomy. In this work, we developed a DL model to predict the individualized 3D\ndose distributions by using not only the anatomy but also the desired PTV/OAR\ntrade-offs, as represented by a dose volume histogram (DVH), as inputs.\nMethods: The desired DVH, fine-tuned by physicians from the initially predicted\nDVH, is first projected onto the Pareto surface, then converted into a vector,\nand then concatenated with mask feature maps. The network output for training\nis the dose distribution corresponding to the Pareto optimal DVH. The\ntraining/validation datasets contain 77 prostate cancer patients, and the\ntesting dataset has 20 patients. Results: The trained model can predict a 3D\ndose distribution that is approximately Pareto optimal. We calculated the\ndifference between the predicted and the optimized dose distribution for the\nPTV and all OARs as a quantitative evaluation. The largest average error in\nmean dose was about 1.6% of the prescription dose, and the largest average\nerror in the maximum dose was about 1.8%. Conclusions: In this feasibility\nstudy, we have developed a 3D U-Net model with the anatomy and desired DVH as\ninputs to predict an individualized 3D dose distribution. The predicted dose\ndistributions can be used as references for dosimetrists and physicians to\nrapidly develop a clinically acceptable treatment plan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 03:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

In this Note, we\ndescribe the public data release of the resulting object catalogs for the\ncoadded images of five years of simulated observations along with associated\ntruth catalogs. We include a brief description of the major features of the\navailable data sets. To enable convenient access to the data products, we have\ndeveloped a web portal connected to Globus data services. We describe how to\naccess the data and provide example Jupyter Notebooks in Python to aid first\ninteractions with the data. We welcome feedback and questions about the data\nrelease via a GitHub repository.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 03:39:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 16:30:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 19:17:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 23:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

Further,\ntorsional dynamics can vary and depend on many parameters making steerable\nneedles difficult to accurately model, limiting the effectiveness of\ntraditional observer methods. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nmodel-free, learned-method that leverages LSTM neural networks to estimate the\nneedle tip's orientation online.

Now, CFD simulations produce intuitive\nand physically plausible colour-coded results that help scientists understand\nSARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission patterns. In addition to validation\nrequirements, for any CFD model to be of epistemic value to the scientific\ncommunity; it must be reproducible. In 2020, more than 45 published studies\ninvestigated SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission in different scenarios using CFD.\nHere, I systematically review the published CFD studies of COVID-19 and discuss\ntheir reproducibility criteria with respect to the CFD modeling process. Using\na Weighted Scoring Model (WSM), I propose a novel reproducibility index for CFD\nsimulations of SARS-CoV-2 AT. The proposed index $(0 \\leq R^{CFD}_j \\leq 1)$\nrelies on three reproducibility criteria comprising 10 elements that represent\nthe possibility of a CFD study (j) to be reproduced. Frustratingly, only 3 of\n23 studies (13%) achieved full reproducibility index $(R^{CFD}_j\\geq 0.9)$\nwhile the remaining 87% were found generally irreproducible $(R^{CFD}_j<0.9)$.\nWithout reproducible models, the scientific benefit of CFD simulations will\nremain hindered, fragmented and limited. In conclusion, I call the scientific\ncommunity to apply more rigorous measures on reporting and publishing CFD\nsimulations in COVID-19 research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 04:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

Distinct\nfrom existing physics-informed NN approaches, where the strong form or weak\nform of PDEs are used to construct the loss function, we write the loss\nfunction of NNs based on the discretized residual of PDEs through an efficient,\nconvolutional operator-based, and vectorized implementation. We explore an\nencoder-decoder NN structure for both deterministic and probabilistic models,\nwith Bayesian NNs (BNNs) for the latter, which allow us to quantify both\nepistemic uncertainty from model parameters and aleatoric uncertainty from\nnoise in the data. For BNNs, the discretized residual is used to construct the\nlikelihood function. In our approach, both deterministic and probabilistic\nconvolutional layers are used to learn the applied boundary conditions (BCs)\nand to detect the problem domain. As both Dirichlet and Neumann BCs are\nspecified as inputs to NNs, a single NN can solve for similar physics, but with\ndifferent BCs and on a number of problem domains. The trained surrogate PDE\nsolvers can also make interpolating and extrapolating (to a certain extent)\npredictions for BCs that they were not exposed to during training. Such\nsurrogate models are of particular importance for problems, where similar types\nof PDEs need to be repeatedly solved for many times with slight variations.

The VEC\nregulates the Fermi energy and systematically alters the bonding\ncharacteristics of materials. As a result, mechanical properties evolve as\nfunction of the VEC. At VEC 8.4, the strong {\\sigma} bonding states stem from\nfilled overlapping metal d and carbon p orbitals, which results in maximum\nresistance to shear deformation and highest hardness. Beyond or below the\noptimum VEC point of 8.4, mechanical response degrades due to filling or\nemptying of energy orbitals that facilitates shear deformation. Furthermore,\nthe optimum VEC point can shift based on the constituent metals that formulate\nthe high entropy carbide.

The ozone\ndosage during the atomic layer deposition of HZO films appears to be a crucial\nparameter in suppressing the mechanisms driving the wake-up effect. A tungsten\ncapping electrode with a relatively low thermal expansion coefficient enables\nthe induction of an in-plane tensile strain, which increases the formation of\nthe orthorhombic phase while decreasing the formation of the monoclinic phase\nduring the cooling step of the annealing process. Therefore, increasing the\nannealing temperature TA followed by rapid cooling to room temperature resulted\nin a substantial increase in the 2Pr value (64 uC/cm2).

However,\nrestoration efforts of wild oysters are often unsuccessful, in that they do not\nproduce a robust population of oysters that are able to successfully reproduce.\nFurthermore, the dynamics of wild oyster fertilization is not yet well\nunderstood. Through conducting an experiment predicated on quantifying the\ninfluence of elementary aspects of fertilization kinetics--sperm concentration,\ngamete age, and success rate--we found that, as stochastic as the mating\nprocess may seem, there are correlations which fundamentally serve as the\nframework for assessing long-term sustainability, reef structure, and\nhydrodynamic parameters in relation to fertilization. We then focused on\nmathematically defining a procedure which simulated a concentration\ndistribution of a single sperm and egg release where there existed conditions\nnecessary for breeding to take place. We found a very significant impact of\nboth gamete age and sperm concentration on fertilization rate ($p < 0.0001$).\nOur hydrodynamic model demonstrates that distance can also drastically\ninfluence broadcast spawning.

Machine learning techniques using clinical data such\nas chest X-rays have been used to predict which patients are most at risk of\ndeterioration. We consider the task of predicting two types of patient\ndeterioration based on chest X-rays: adverse event deterioration (i.e.,\ntransfer to the intensive care unit, intubation, or mortality) and increased\noxygen requirements beyond 6 L per day. Due to the relative scarcity of\nCOVID-19 patient data, existing solutions leverage supervised pretraining on\nrelated non-COVID images, but this is limited by the differences between the\npretraining data and the target COVID-19 patient data. In this paper, we use\nself-supervised learning based on the momentum contrast (MoCo) method in the\npretraining phase to learn more general image representations to use for\ndownstream tasks. We present three results. The first is deterioration\nprediction from a single image, where our model achieves an area under receiver\noperating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.742 for predicting an adverse event\nwithin 96 hours (compared to 0.703 with supervised pretraining) and an AUC of\n0.765 for predicting oxygen requirements greater than 6 L a day at 24 hours\n(compared to 0.749 with supervised pretraining). We then propose a new\ntransformer-based architecture that can process sequences of multiple images\nfor prediction and show that this model can achieve an improved AUC of 0.786\nfor predicting an adverse event at 96 hours and an AUC of 0.848 for predicting\nmortalities at 96 hours. A small pilot clinical study suggested that the\nprediction accuracy of our model is comparable to that of experienced\nradiologists analyzing the same information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 07:03:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 04:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

We assume\nradiative torque and gas-flow torque as driving sources of the spinning motion,\nassume that dust aggregates reach a steady-state rigid rotation, and compare\nthe obtained tensile stress due to the centrifugal force with their tensile\nstrength. We model the irregularly-shaped dust aggregates by introducing a\nparameter, $\\gamma_\\mathrm{ft}$, that mimics the conversion efficiency from\nforce to torque.

It is\nalso under debate as to whether the flare-induced photospheric changes are due\nto the momentum conservation with coronal mass ejections or due to magnetic\nreconnection. To shed light on the so-called \"back reaction\" of solar\neruptions, we investigated how running penumbral waves (RPWs) at one foot of an\nerupting magnetic flux rope (MFR) responds to the rope buildup and subsequent\nerosion. During the rope-buildup stage, the western foot of the rope, which is\ncompletely enclosed by a hooked ribbon, expands rapidly and consequently\noverlaps a sunspot penumbra. This converts the original penumbral field into\nthe rope field, which is associated with a transient increase in electric\ncurrents flowing through the ribbon-swept penumbral region. During the\nrope-erosion stage, the rope foot shrinks as the eastern section of the hooked\nribbon slowly sweeps the same penumbral region, where the rope field is\nconverted into flare loops. This conversion induces mixed effects on the\nphotospheric field inclination but heats up the low atmosphere at the\nfootpoints of these flare loops to transition-region temperatures, therefore\nresulting in the post-eruption RPWs with an enhanced contrast in the 1600A\npassband and an extended bandwidth to low frequencies at 3-5 mHz, compared with\nthe pre-eruption RPWs that peak at 6 mHz. This observation clearly demonstrates\nthat it is the magnetic reconnection in the corona that impacts the low\natmosphere and leads to the changing behaviors of RPWs, which, in turn, offer a\nnew window to diagnose flare reconnections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 07:35:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 11:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

In this\npaper, we study the egocentric action anticipation task, which predicts future\naction seconds before it is performed for egocentric videos. Previous\napproaches focus on summarizing the observed content and directly predicting\nfuture action based on past observations. We believe it would benefit the\naction anticipation if we could mine some cues to compensate for the missing\ninformation of the unobserved frames. We then propose to decompose the action\nanticipation into a series of future feature predictions. We imagine how the\nvisual feature changes in the near future and then predicts future action\nlabels based on these imagined representations. Differently, our ImagineRNN is\noptimized in a contrastive learning way instead of feature regression. We\nutilize a proxy task to train the ImagineRNN, i.e., selecting the correct\nfuture states from distractors. We further improve ImagineRNN by residual\nanticipation, i.e., changing its target to predicting the feature difference of\nadjacent frames instead of the frame content.

A special case arises when anomalies are occluded\nin a small set of attributes, typically referred to as a subspace, and not\nnecessarily over the entire data space. In this paper, we propose a new\nsubspace analysis approach named Agglomerative Attribute Grouping (AAG) that\naims to address this challenge by searching for subspaces that are comprised of\nhighly correlative attributes. Such correlations among attributes represent a\nsystematic interaction among the attributes that can better reflect the\nbehavior of normal observations and hence can be used to improve the\nidentification of two particularly interesting types of abnormal data samples:\nanomalies that are occluded in relatively small subsets of the attributes and\nanomalies that represent a new data class. AAG relies on a novel\nmulti-attribute measure, which is derived from information theory measures of\npartitions, for evaluating the \"information distance\" between groups of data\nattributes. To determine the set of subspaces to use, AAG applies a variation\nof the well-known agglomerative clustering algorithm with the proposed\nmulti-attribute measure as the underlying distance function. Finally, the set\nof subspaces is used in an ensemble for anomaly detection. Extensive evaluation\ndemonstrates that, in the vast majority of cases, the proposed AAG method (i)\noutperforms classical and state-of-the-art subspace analysis methods when used\nin anomaly detection ensembles, and (ii) generates fewer subspaces with a fewer\nnumber of attributes each (on average), thus resulting in a faster training\ntime for the anomaly detection ensemble. Furthermore, in contrast to existing\nmethods, the proposed AAG method does not require any tuning of parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 08:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

To obtain a highly compact model, most methods first perform\nnetwork pruning and then conduct network quantization based on the pruned\nmodel. However, this strategy may ignore that they would affect each other and\nthus performing them separately may lead to sub-optimal performance. To address\nthis, performing pruning and quantization jointly is essential. Nevertheless,\nhow to make a trade-off between pruning and quantization is non-trivial.\nMoreover, existing compression methods often rely on some pre-defined\ncompression configurations. Some attempts have been made to search for optimal\nconfigurations, which however may take unbearable optimization cost. To address\nthe above issues, we devise a simple yet effective method named Single-path Bit\nSharing (SBS). Specifically, we first consider network pruning as a special\ncase of quantization, which provides a unified view for pruning and\nquantization. We then introduce a single-path model to encode all candidate\ncompression configurations. In this way, the configuration search problem is\ntransformed into a subset selection problem, which significantly reduces the\nnumber of parameters, computational cost and optimization difficulty. Relying\non the single-path model, we further introduce learnable binary gates to encode\nthe choice of bitwidth. By jointly training the binary gates in conjunction\nwith network parameters, the compression configurations of each layer can be\nautomatically determined. Extensive experiments on both CIFAR-100 and ImageNet\nshow that SBS is able to significantly reduce computational cost while\nachieving promising performance.

The asymptotic rate of growth/decay of\nsolutions to linear systems of wave equations along causal curves going into\nthe singularity is determined by model systems of ODE's (depending on the\ncausal curve). Moreover, the model systems are essentially obtained by dropping\nspatial derivatives and localising the coefficients along the causal curve.\nThis is in accordance with the BKL proposal. Note, however, that we here prove\nthis statement, we do not assume it. If the coefficients of the unknown and its\nexpansion normalised normal derivatives converge sufficiently quickly along a\ncausal curve, we obtain leading order asymptotics (along the causal curve) and\nprove that the localised energy estimate (along the causal curve) is optimal.\nIn this setting, it is also possible to specify the leading order asymptotics\nof solutions along the causal curve.

Estimators of the mutation\nrate (e.g. based on the total number of segregating sites or average of the\npairwise differences) and tests for neutrality (e.g. Tajima's D) are perhaps\nthe most well-known examples. The distribution of linear functions of the SFS\nis important for constructing confidence intervals for the estimators, and to\ndetermine significance thresholds for neutrality tests. These distributions are\noften approximated using simulation procedures. In this paper we use\nmultivariate phase-type theory to specify, characterize and calculate the\ndistribution of linear functions of the site frequency spectrum. In particular,\nwe show that many of the classical estimators of the mutation rate are\ndistributed according to a discrete phase-type distribution. Neutrality tests,\nhowever, are generally not discrete phase-type distributed. For neutrality\ntests we derive the probability generating function using continuous\nmultivariate phase-type theory, and numerically invert the function to obtain\nthe distribution.

Since\nlearned models inevitably make mistakes, the goal should be to improve the\nestimates that make the biggest difference to an optimizer. We introduce a new\nloss function, Flow-Loss, that explicitly optimizes for better query plans by\napproximating the optimizer's cost model and dynamic programming search\nalgorithm with analytical functions. At the heart of Flow-Loss is a reduction\nof query optimization to a flow routing problem on a certain plan graph in\nwhich paths correspond to different query plans. To evaluate our approach, we\nintroduce the Cardinality Estimation Benchmark, which contains the ground truth\ncardinalities for sub-plans of over 16K queries from 21 templates with up to 15\njoins. We show that across different architectures and databases, a model\ntrained with Flow-Loss improves the cost of plans (using the PostgreSQL cost\nmodel) and query runtimes despite having worse estimation accuracy than a model\ntrained with Q-Error. When the test set queries closely match the training\nqueries, both models improve performance significantly over PostgreSQL and are\nclose to the optimal performance (using true cardinalities). However, the\nQ-Error trained model degrades significantly when evaluated on queries that are\nslightly different (e.g., similar but not identical query templates), while the\nFlow-Loss trained model generalizes better to such situations. For example, the\nFlow-Loss model achieves up to 1.5x better runtimes on unseen templates\ncompared to the Q-Error model, despite leveraging the same model architecture\nand training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 09:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

The former is designed using fractional calculus. The latter is an\nadaptive estimator, and it is constructed using the general dynamic of biped\nrobots. Stability analysis shows that the closed-loop system is finite-time\nstable in both contact-less and impact phases. Simulation studies on two types\nof biped robots (i.e., two-link walker and RABBIT biped robot) demonstrate the\nproposed controller's tracking performance and disturbance rejection\ncapability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 10:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

In developing countries, because of the difficulty in\nusing a central system when enlisting voters, it often happens that several\nregional voter databases are created and then merged to form a central\ndatabase. A process is used to remove duplicates and ensure uniqueness by\nvoter. Until now, companies specializing in biometrics use several costly\ncomputing servers with algorithms to perform large-scale deduplication based on\nfingerprints. These algorithms take a considerable time because of their\ncomplexity in O (n2), where n is the size of the database. This article\npresents an algorithm that can perform this operation in O (2n), with just a\ncomputer. It is based on the development of an index obtained using a 5 * 5\nmatrix performed on each fingerprint. This index makes it possible to build\nclusters of O (1) in size in order to compare fingerprints. This approach has\nbeen evaluated using close to 11 4000 fingerprints, and the results obtained\nshow that this approach allows a penetration rate of less than 1%, an almost O\n(1) identification, and an O (n) deduplication.

AGNs in mergers and\nnon-mergers are identified on the basis of their X-ray emission, optical lines,\nmid-infrared colors, and radio emission. Among galaxies with adequate\nmeasurements to find potential AGNs, we find a similar fraction of AGNs in\nmergers (16.4%) compared to the fraction found in non-merging galaxies (15.4%).\nIn mergers, this fraction is obtained by assuming that, in unresolved\nobservations, only one of the merging galaxies is the AGN source.

However, any reduced dimensionality vision of the\nheliosphere limits the possible interpretations of in-situ observations.\nAccounting for non-planar structures, e.g. current sheets, magnetic islands,\nflux ropes as well as plasma bubbles, is decisive to shed the light on a\nvariety of phenomena, such as particle acceleration and energy dissipation. In\npart I of this review, we have described in detail the ubiquitous and\nmulti-scale observations of these magnetic structures in the solar wind and\ntheir significance for the acceleration of charged particles. Here, in part II,\nwe elucidate existing theoretical paradigms of the structure of the solar wind\nand the interplanetary magnetic field, with particular attention to the fine\nstructure and stability of current sheets. Differences in 2D and 3D views of\nprocesses associated with current sheets, magnetic islands, and flux ropes are\ndiscussed. We finally review the results of numerical simulations and in-situ\nobservations, pointing out the complex nature of magnetic reconnection and\nparticle acceleration in a strongly turbulent environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 11:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

DNA sequencers, the\nmachines which perform DNA sequencing, have evolved from the size of a fridge\nto that of a mobile phone over the last two decades. The cost of sequencing a\nhuman genome also has reduced from billions of dollars to hundreds of dollars.\nDespite these improvements, DNA sequencers output hundreds or thousands of\ngigabytes of data that must be analysed on computers to discover meaningful\ninformation with biological implications. Unfortunately, the analysis\ntechniques have not kept the pace with rapidly improving sequencing\ntechnologies. Consequently, even today, the process of DNA analysis is\nperformed on high-performance computers, just as it was a couple of decades\nago. Such high-performance computers are not portable. Consequently, the full\nutility of an ultra-portable sequencer for sequencing in-the-field or at the\npoint-of-care is limited by the lack of portable lightweight analytic\ntechniques. This thesis proposes computer architecture-aware optimisation of\nDNA analysis software. DNA analysis software is inevitably convoluted due to\nthe complexity associated with biological data. Modern computer architectures\nare also complex. Performing architecture-aware optimisations requires the\nsynergistic use of knowledge from both domains, (i.e, DNA sequence analysis and\ncomputer architecture). This thesis aims to draw the two domains together. In\nthis thesis, gold-standard DNA sequence analysis workflows are systematically\nexamined for algorithmic components that cause performance bottlenecks.\nIdentified bottlenecks are resolved through architecture-aware optimisations at\ndifferent levels, i.e., memory, cache, register and processor. The optimised\nsoftware tools are used in complete end-to-end analysis workflows and their\nefficacy is demonstrated by running on prototypical embedded systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 11:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

We\nrelate the conservation, or lack thereof, of specific higher-form currents with\nproperties of the underlying deformation field -- non-affinity -- which\ndictates how molecules move under an applied stress or deformation. In\nparticular, the single-valuedness of the deformation field is associated with\nconservation of higher-form charges that count the number of topological\ndefects. Our formalism predicts, from first principles, the presence of\npropagating shear waves above a critical wave-vector in liquids, thus giving\nthe first formal derivation of the phenomenon in terms of fundamental\nsymmetries. The same picture provides also a theoretical explanation of the\ncorresponding \"positive sound dispersion\" phenomenon for longitudinal sound.\nImportantly, accordingly to our theory, the main collective relaxation\ntimescale of a liquid or a glass (known as the $\\alpha$ relaxation for the\nlatter) is given by the phase relaxation time, which is not necessarily related\nto the Maxwell time. Finally, we build a non-equilibrium effective action using\nthe in-in formalism defined on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour, that further\nsupports the emerging picture. In summary, our work suggests that the\nfundamental difference between solids, fluids and glasses has to be identified\nwith the associated generalized higher-from global symmetries and their\ntopological structure, and that the Burgers vector for the displacement fields\nserves as a suitable topological order parameter distinguishing the solid\n(ordered) phase and the amorphous ones (fluids, glasses).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 11:33:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 14:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

This hinders the use of lattice structures in large-scale applications\n(e.g., to design the interior structure of a solid with spatially graded\nmaterial properties). To solve this issue, we propose a memory-efficient method\nfor the modeling and slicing of adaptive lattice structures. A lattice\nstructure is represented by a weighted graph where the edge weights store the\nstruts' radii. When slicing the structure, its solid model is locally evaluated\nthrough convolution surfaces and in a streaming manner. As such, only limited\nmemory is needed to generate the toolpaths of fabrication. Also, the use of\nconvolution surfaces leads to natural blending at intersections of struts,\nwhich can avoid the stress concentration at these regions. We also present a\ncomputational framework for optimizing supporting structures and adapting\nlattice structures with prescribed density distributions.

Given an image (respectively a caption),\nthere are multiple captions (respectively images) that equally make sense. In\nthis paper, we argue that deterministic functions are not sufficiently powerful\nto capture such one-to-many correspondences. Instead, we propose to use\nProbabilistic Cross-Modal Embedding (PCME), where samples from the different\nmodalities are represented as probabilistic distributions in the common\nembedding space. Since common benchmarks such as COCO suffer from\nnon-exhaustive annotations for cross-modal matches, we propose to additionally\nevaluate retrieval on the CUB dataset, a smaller yet clean database where all\npossible image-caption pairs are annotated. We extensively ablate PCME and\ndemonstrate that it not only improves the retrieval performance over its\ndeterministic counterpart but also provides uncertainty estimates that render\nthe embeddings more interpretable.

The method combines the\nconcept of two mesh adaptation approaches: (1) The virtual ring shear-slip mesh\nupdatemethod (VR-SSMUM); and (2) the elastic mesh update method (EMUM).

We\npresent various oscillation probabilities for including wrong-helicity\nneutrinos, right-handed neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos. We summarize the\nrelations between these probabilities. As neutrinos have finite mass, there are\ntwo components for each chirality corresponding to positive and negative\nhelicities. We show that the probability is different for each component even\nif neutrinos have the same chirality. The probabilities derived by the\nrelativistic equation depend on not only the mass squared differences but also\nthe absolute masses of neutrinos. Besides, the new CP phases appear in the\nprobabilities of oscillations with chirality-flip. These new CP phases are\nequivalent to the Majorana CP phases in the case of Majorana neutrinos. We\ninvestigate the CP dependence of oscillation probabilities in vacuum.

To further minimize the risk of human mistakes,\nspace agencies, such as the European Space Agency (ESA), are looking for\nautomated solutions for the assessment of software testing activities, which\nplay a crucial role in this context.\n  Over the years, mutation analysis has shown to be a promising solution for\nthe automated assessment of test suites; it consists of measuring the quality\nof a test suite in terms of the percentage of injected faults leading to a test\nfailure. A number of optimization techniques, addressing scalability and\naccuracy problems, have been proposed to facilitate the industrial adoption of\nmutation analysis. However, to date, two major problems prevent space agencies\nfrom enforcing mutation analysis in space software development.\n  In this paper, we enhance mutation analysis optimization techniques to enable\ntheir applicability to embedded software and propose a pipeline that\nsuccessfully integrates them to address scalability and accuracy issues in this\ncontext, as described above.

Furthermore, in\nsuperconductors, we find that the ratio between the backflow spin current in\nthe parallel and anti-parallel magnetization configuration depends strongly on\ntemperature, in contrast to the constant ratio in normal metals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 15:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

Safer engineering designs require appropriate cost and constraint\nfunction definitions that capture the \\textit{risk} associated with unwanted\nsystem behavior in the presence of uncertainties. The paper proposes two\nnotions of certifiability. The first is based on accounting for the magnitude\nof failure to ensure data-informed conservativeness.

In the context of CRiBDO, risk measures based on\nsuperquantile (a.k.a.\\ conditional value-at-risk) and buffered probability of\nfailure are analyzed.

We discuss the properties of synthetic radio images of merger\njet afterglows by using semi-analytic models of laterally spreading or\nnon-spreading jets. The image centroid initially moves away from the explosion\npoint in the sky with apparent superlumianal velocity. After reaching a maximum\ndisplacement its motion is reversed. This behavior is in line with that found\nin full hydrodynamics simulations. We show that the evolution of the centroid\nshift and image size are significantly different when lateral spreading is\nconsidered. For Gaussian jet models with plausible model parameters, the\nmorphology of the laterally spreading jet images is much closer to circular.\nThe maximum displacement of the centroid shift and its occurrence time are\nsmaller/earlier by a factor of a few for spreading jets.

Yet it oftentimes struggles in high dimensions where the computation\ncould be prohibitively heavy. To alleviate this problem, we introduce\nCoordinate backoff Bayesian Optimization (CobBO) with two-stage kernels. During\neach round, the first stage uses a simple coarse kernel that sacrifices the\napproximation accuracy for computational efficiency. It captures the global\nlandscape by purposely smoothing away local fluctuations. Then, in the second\nstage of the same round, past observed points in the full space are projected\nto the selected subspace to form virtual points. These virtual points, along\nwith the means and variances of their unknown function values estimated using\nthe simple kernel of the first stage, are fitted to a more sophisticated kernel\nmodel in the second stage. Within the selected low dimensional subspace, the\ncomputational cost of conducting Bayesian optimization therein becomes\naffordable. To further enhance the performance, a sequence of consecutive\nobservations in the same subspace are collected, which can effectively refine\nthe approximation of the function. This refinement lasts until a stopping rule\nis met determining when to back off from a certain subspace and switch to\nanother. This decoupling significantly reduces the computational burden in high\ndimensions, which fully leverages the observations in the whole space rather\nthan only relying on observations in each coordinate subspace. Extensive\nevaluations show that CobBO finds solutions comparable to or better than other\nstate-of-the-art methods for dimensions ranging from tens to hundreds, while\nreducing both the trial complexity and computational costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 15:39:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 10:18:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 21:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-21"}

A\nshallow convolutional neural net classified 3 second data windows from 20\nparticipants in a person-dependent manner with an average accuracy above 70\\%\nif the testing data and training data came from different trials.\nPerson-independent classification was possible above chance level for 6 out of\n20 participants. Thus, the reliability of such a Brain-Computer Interface is\nhigh enough for it to be treated as a useful input mechanism for Augmented\nReality applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 19:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

Conventional sensor signal processing pipelines with hand\nengineered feature extraction often involve huge computational cost with high\ndimensional data. Deep recurrent neural networks have shown promise in\nautomated feature learning for improved time-series processing. However,\ngeneric deep recurrent models grow in scale and depth with increased complexity\nof the data. This is particularly challenging in presence of high dimensional\ndata with temporal and spatial characteristics. Consequently, this work\nproposes a novel deep cellular recurrent neural network (DCRNN) architecture to\nefficiently process complex multi-dimensional time series data with spatial\ninformation. The cellular recurrent architecture in the proposed model allows\nfor location-aware synchronous processing of time series data from spatially\ndistributed sensor signal sources.

Considering the occasional requirements and fragmentation usage pattern\nof mobile users, temporal recommendation techniques are proposed to improve the\nefficiency of information retrieval on mobile devices by means of accurately\nrecommending items via learning temporal interests with short-term user\ninteraction behaviors. However, the enforcement of privacy-preserving laws and\nregulations, such as GDPR, may overshadow the successful practice of temporal\nrecommendation. The reason is that state-of-the-art recommendation systems\nrequire to gather and process the user data in centralized servers but the\ninteraction behaviors data used for temporal recommendation are usually\nnon-transactional data that are not allowed to gather without the explicit\npermission of users according to GDPR. As a result, if users do not permit\nservices to gather their interaction behaviors data, the temporal\nrecommendation fails to work. To realize the temporal recommendation in the\npost-GDPR era, this paper proposes $C^3DRec$, a cloud-client cooperative deep\nlearning framework of mining interaction behaviors for recommendation while\npreserving user privacy. $C^3DRec$ constructs a global recommendation model on\ncentralized servers using data collected before GDPR and fine-tunes the model\ndirectly on individual local devices using data collected after GDPR. We design\ntwo modes to accomplish the recommendation, i.e. pull mode where candidate\nitems are pulled down onto the devices and fed into the local model to get\nrecommended items, and push mode where the output of the local model is pushed\nonto the server and combined with candidate items to get recommended ones.\nEvaluation results show that $C^3DRec$ achieves comparable recommendation\naccuracy to the centralized approaches, with minimal privacy concern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 12:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

This FP method is constrcuted by subtracting a reference\ncell-face flow state from each cell-center value in the local stencil of the\noriginal upwind conservative FD schemes, which effectively leads to a\nreformulated dissipation. It is convenient to implement this method, as it does\nnot require to modify the original forms of the upwind schemes. In addition,\nthe proposed method removes the constraint in the traditional FP conservative\nFD schemes that require a consistent discretization of the mesh metrics and the\nfluxes. With this, the proposed method is more flexible in simulating the\nengineering problems which usually require a low-order scheme for their\nlow-quality mesh, while the high-order schemes can be applied to approximate\nthe flow states to improve the resolution. After demonstrating the strict FP\nproperty and the order of accuracy by two simple test cases, we consider\nvarious validation cases, including the supersonic flow around the cylinder,\nthe subsonic flow past the three-element airfoil, and the transonic flow around\nthe ONERA M6 wing, etc., to show that the method is suitable for a wide range\nof fluid dynamic problems containing complex geometries. Moreover, these test\ncases also indicate that the discretization order of the metrics have no\nsignificant influences on the numerical results if the mesh resolution is not\nsufficiently large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 07:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

This technology has the potential to have a\nsignificant effect on intercity trips. This study analyzed a travel survey to\nanticipate the impact of this technology on long-distance trips. We have\ndivided trips into two different categories including trips for pleasure and\ntrips for business. Different hypotheses based on the authors' knowledge and\nassisted by existing literature have been defined for each type of trip. By\nusing the Pearson method these hypotheses have been tested and the positive or\nnegative responses from respondents have been evaluated. The findings show that\nusing AVs for pleasure trips can increase the number of travelers and stimulate\npeople to choose longer distances for their trips. In addition, people enjoy\nmore and will be interested to travel more frequently. For business trips, AV\ntechnology can reduce travel costs and job-related stress. Unlike pleasure\ntrips for which people are not interested in traveling at night, business\ntravelers prefer to travel at night.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 03:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

Reconfigurable\nintelligent surface (RIS) has been recently proposed as an innovative new\ntechnology to achieve energy efficiency and coverage enhancement by\nestablishing favorable signal propagation environments, thereby improving data\ntransmission in massive connectivity. Nevertheless, the BS needs to detect\nactive devices and estimate channels to support data transmission in\nRIS-assisted massive access systems, which yields unique challenges. This paper\nshall consider an RIS-assisted uplink IoT network and aims to solve the\nRIS-related activity detection and channel estimation problem, where the BS\ndetects the active devices and estimates the separated channels of the\nRIS-to-device link and the RIS-to-BS link. Due to limited scattering between\nthe RIS and the BS, we model the RIS-to-BS channel as a sparse channel. As a\nresult, by simultaneously exploiting both the sparsity of sporadic transmission\nin massive connectivity and the RIS-to-BS channels, we formulate the\nRIS-related activity detection and channel estimation problem as a sparse\nmatrix factorization problem. Furthermore, we develop an approximate message\npassing (AMP) based algorithm to solve the problem based on Bayesian inference\nframework and reduce the computational complexity by approximating the\nalgorithm with the central limit theorem and Taylor series arguments. Finally,\nextensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and\nimprovements of the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 15:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}
