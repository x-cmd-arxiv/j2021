Materials and Methods: We\ngenerated concept vectors by encoding concept preferred terms using ELMo, BERT,\nand Sentence BERT models. We used BioELMo and Clinical ELMo. We used Ontology\nKnowledge Free (OKF) models like PubMedBERT, BioBERT, BioClinicalBERT, and\nOntology Knowledge Injected (OKI) models like SapBERT, CoderBERT, KbBERT, and\nUmlsBERT. We trained all the BERT models using Siamese network on SNLI and STSb\ndatasets to allow the models to learn more semantic information at the phrase\nor sentence level so that they can represent multi-word concepts better.\nFinally, to inject ontology relationship knowledge into concept vectors, we\nused retrofitting algorithm and concepts from various UMLS relationships. We\nevaluated our hybrid approach on four publicly available datasets which also\nincludes the recently released EHR-RelB dataset. EHR-RelB is the largest\npublicly available relatedness dataset in which 89% of terms are multi-word\nwhich makes it more challenging. Results: Sentence BERT models mostly\noutperformed corresponding BERT models. The concept vectors generated using the\nSentence BERT model based on SapBERT and retrofitted using UMLS-related\nconcepts achieved the best results on all four datasets. Conclusions: Sentence\nBERT models are more effective compared to BERT models in computing relatedness\nscores in most of the cases.

Attacks\ntargeting cyber-physical energy systems (CPES), given their mission-critical\nnature, can have disastrous consequences. The security of CPES can be enhanced\nleveraging testbed capabilities to replicate power system operations, discover\nvulnerabilities, develop security countermeasures, and evaluate grid operation\nunder fault-induced or maliciously constructed scenarios. In this paper, we\nprovide a comprehensive overview of the CPS security landscape with emphasis on\nCPES. Specifically, we demonstrate a threat modeling methodology to accurately\nrepresent the CPS elements, their interdependencies, as well as the possible\nattack entry points and system vulnerabilities. Leveraging the threat model\nformulation, we present a CPS framework designed to delineate the hardware,\nsoftware, and modeling resources required to simulate the CPS and construct\nhigh-fidelity models which can be used to evaluate the system's performance\nunder adverse scenarios. The system performance is assessed using\nscenario-specific metrics, while risk assessment enables system vulnerability\nprioritization factoring the impact on the system operation.

Gaia EDR3 has produced parallaxes for 1.468x10^9 sources but there\nare calibration issues that require corrections to the published values and\nuncertainties. AIMS. We want to characterize the behavior of the uncertainties\nof the Gaia EDR3 parallaxes. We also aim to provide a procedure for the\ncalculation of distances to stars and stellar clusters. METHODS. We reanalyze\nsome of the data in the calibration papers for QSO and LMC parallaxes and\ncombine those results with measurements for six bright GCs. We calculate the\nangular covariance of EDR3 parallaxes at small separations based on the LMC\nresults and combine it with the results for larger angles using QSOs to obtain\nan analytical formula for the angular covariance over the whole sky. The\nresults for the six GCs are used to validate the parallax bias correction as a\nfunction of magnitude, color, and ecliptic latitude and to determine the\nconstant used to convert internal uncertainties to external ones. RESULTS. The\nangular covariance at zero separation is 106.2 muas^2, yielding a minimum\nuncertainty for EDR3 parallaxes of 10.3 muas for individual stars. That value\ncan be only slightly reduced for GCs after considering the behavior of the\nangular covariance of the parallaxes for small separations. The Lindegren et\nal. parallax bias correction works quite well, except for the brighter\nmagnitudes, suggesting improvements may be possible there. The value of k is\n1.1-1.7 and depends on G. Stars with moderately large values of RUWE can still\nprovide useful parallaxes albeit with larger values of k. We give accurate and\nprecise Gaia EDR3 distances to the six GCs and for the specific case of 47 Tuc\nwe are able to beat the angular covariance limit and derive a high-precision\ndistance of 4.53+-0.06 kpc. Finally, a recipe for the derivation of distances\nto stars and stellar clusters using Gaia EDR3 parallaxes is given.

The\ndynamics of the pulse is described by a nonlinear equation for the vector\npotential of the electromagnetic field (it takes the form of a 3D\ngeneralization of the sine-Gordon equation), derived from the Maxwell's\nequations and averaged over the period of the HF control field. By means of\nsystematic simulations, we demonstrate that, depending on the amplitude and\nfrequency of the HF control, the ultrashort pulse approaching the barrier layer\neither passes it or bounces back. The layer's transmissivity for the incident\npulse is significantly affected by the amplitude and frequency of the HF\ncontrol field, with the reflection coefficient nearly vanishing in intervals\nthat make up a discrete set of transparency windows, which resembles the effect\nof the electromagnetically-induced transparency. Having passed the barrier, the\nultrashort pulse continues to propagate, keeping its spatiotemporal integrity.\nThe results may be used for the design of soliton valves, with the\ntransmissivity of the soliton stream accurately controlled by the HF field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 16:22:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 16:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Current efforts on joint entity and\nrelation extraction focus on enhancing the interaction between entity\nrecognition and relation extraction through parameter sharing, joint decoding,\nor other ad-hoc tricks (e.g., modeled as a semi-Markov decision process, cast\nas a multi-round reading comprehension task). However, there are still two\nissues on the table. First, the interaction utilized by most methods is still\nweak and uni-directional, which is unable to model the mutual dependency\nbetween the two tasks. Second, relation triggers are ignored by most methods,\nwhich can help explain why humans would extract a relation in the sentence.\nThey're essential for relation extraction but overlooked. To this end, we\npresent a Trigger-Sense Memory Flow Framework (TriMF) for joint entity and\nrelation extraction. We build a memory module to remember category\nrepresentations learned in entity recognition and relation extraction tasks.\nAnd based on it, we design a multi-level memory flow attention mechanism to\nenhance the bi-directional interaction between entity recognition and relation\nextraction. Moreover, without any human annotations, our model can enhance\nrelation trigger information in a sentence through a trigger sensor module,\nwhich improves the model performance and makes model predictions with better\ninterpretation.

Here we show that, through thickness\nmodulations introduced in the host material, it is possible to constrain\nthree-dimensional skyrmions to desired regions. We investigate skyrmion\nstructures in rectangular FeGe platelets with micromagnetic finite element\nelement simulations.

However, most existing RGB-D SOD models conduct\nfeature fusion either in the single encoder or the decoder stage, which hardly\nguarantees sufficient cross-modal fusion ability. In this paper, we make the\nfirst attempt in addressing RGB-D SOD through 3D convolutional neural networks.\nThe proposed model, named RD3D, aims at pre-fusion in the encoder stage and\nin-depth fusion in the decoder stage to effectively promote the full\nintegration of RGB and depth streams. Specifically, RD3D first conducts\npre-fusion across RGB and depth modalities through an inflated 3D encoder, and\nlater provides in-depth feature fusion by designing a 3D decoder equipped with\nrich back-projection paths (RBPP) for leveraging the extensive aggregation\nability of 3D convolutions. With such a progressive fusion strategy involving\nboth the encoder and decoder, effective and thorough interaction between the\ntwo modalities can be exploited and boost the detection accuracy. Extensive\nexperiments on six widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that RD3D\nperforms favorably against 14 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD approaches in terms of\nfour key evaluation metrics.

We first\ndemonstrate to what extent the use of pretrained feature extraction networks\ninductively bias the visual semantics conveyed by emergent communication\nchannel and quantify the visual semantics that are induced.\n  We then go on to explore ways in which inductive biases can be introduced to\nencourage the emergence of semantically meaningful communication without the\nneed for any form of supervised pretraining of the visual feature extractor. We\nimpose various augmentations to the input images and additional tasks in the\ngame with the aim to induce visual representations which capture conceptual\nproperties of images. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that\ncommunication systems which capture visual semantics can be learned in a\ncompletely self-supervised manner by playing the right types of game. Our work\nbridges a gap between emergent communication research and self-supervised\nfeature learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 17:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

Early attempts\nat modelling it analytically focused on using perturbation theory. However,\nsmall-scale effects introduced by gravitational collapse cannot be described\nperturbatively and this failure of perturbation theory is reflected even on the\nlargest scales. The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS)\nhas emerged as a consistent method for describing LSS on large scales by\nintroducing counterterms that account for the effects of small-scale dynamics.\nSo far studies of the EFT have mostly focused on the two and three point\nfunctions with little attention devoted to the four point function or\ntrispectrum. The trispectrum probes cubic interactions arising from non-linear\nclustering, biasing, and primordial non-Gaussianities, and constitutes a key\nelement of the covariance matrix of the power spectrum. In this paper, we\npresent explicit calibrations of the EFT counterterms for the one-loop\ntrispectrum. Specifically, we find clear evidence for non-zero EFT corrections.\nWe define two one-parameter ans\\\"{a}tze for the counterterm of the one-loop\npropagator and show that they provide a good correction to the residual at\nscales below k~0.07 h/Mpc. We then take the amplitudes of the linear and\nquadratic counterkernels calculated in our previous paper on the bispectrum and\nuse them in the remaining counterterms, establishing consistency of the\ncounterterms in the two, three and four point function. We also show that the\ncommonly used EdS approximation for the growth of the density fields leads to\nerrors that are of the same magnitude as loop corrections to the trispectrum on\nlarge scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 18:16:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

I proceed to identify how\nadding security features on such integrated circuits may affect the costs of\ntheir development and production.

I also go on to examine\npotential ways of reducing the cost of production for secure chips, while\nidentifying the difficulties in adopting them.\n  This essay ends with the conclusion that adding security features to chips\nmeant to be used for secure applications is well worth it, because the costs of\ndeveloping attacks are of comparable amounts to the costs of developing and\nproducing a chip and the potential damages and losses caused by such attacks\ncan be way higher than these costs. Therefore, although the production and\ndevelopment of integrated circuits come at a certain cost and security\nintroduces further additional costs, security is inherently unavoidable in such\nchips. Finally, I additionally identify that security is an evolving concept\nand does not aim to make a chip totally impenetrable, as this may be\nimpossible, but to lower the potential risks, including that of being\ncompromised, to acceptable levels. Thus, a balance needs be found between the\nlevel of security and the levels of cost and risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 18:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

We show a connection between\nclassical symmetries of the objective function and the symmetries of the terms\nof the cost Hamiltonian with respect to the QAOA energy. We show how by\nconsidering only the terms that are not connected by symmetry, we can\nsignificantly reduce the cost of evaluating the QAOA energy.

An associated challenge lies in bridging across time scales to\novercome the time scale limitations of atomistics. To address the biggest\nchallenge, bridging across both length and time scales, only a few techniques\nexist, and most of those are limited to conditions of constant temperature.\nHere, we present a new strategy for the space-time coarsening of an atomistic\nensemble, which introduces thermomechanical coupling. We investigate the\nquasistatics and dynamics of a crystalline solid described as a lattice of\nlumped correlated Gaussian phase packets occupying atomic lattice sites. By\ndefinition, phase packets account for the dynamics of crystalline lattices at\nfinite temperature through the statistical variances of atomic momenta and\npositions. We show that momentum-space correlation allows for an exchange\nbetween potential and kinetic contributions to the crystal's Hamiltonian.\nConsequently, local adiabatic heating due to atomic site motion is captured.\nMoreover, within the quasistatic approximation the governing equations reduce\nto the minimization of thermodynamic potentials such as Helmholtz free energy\n(depending on the fixed variables), and they yield the local equation of state.\nWe further discuss opportunities for describing atomic-level thermal transport\nusing the correlated Gaussian phase packet formulation and the importance of\ninteratomic correlations. Such a formulation offers a promising avenue for a\nfinite-temperature non-equilibrium quasicontinuum method that may be combined\nwith thermal transport models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 18:30:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 19:42:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 13:46:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 21:42:36 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 15:44:55 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 12:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

The existing literature largely focuses on\ndenoising methods for channel estimation that depend on either (i)~channel\nanalysis in the time-domain with prior channel knowledge or (ii)~supervised\nlearning techniques which require large pre-labeled datasets for training. To\naddress these limitations, we present a frequency-domain denoising method based\non a reinforcement learning framework that does not need a priori channel\nknowledge and pre-labeled data. Our methodology includes a new successive\nchannel denoising process based on channel curvature computation, for which we\nobtain a channel curvature magnitude threshold to identify unreliable channel\nestimates. Based on this process, we formulate the denoising mechanism as a\nMarkov decision process, where we define the actions through a geometry-based\nchannel estimation update, and the reward function based on a policy that\nreduces mean squared error (MSE). We then resort to Q-learning to update the\nchannel estimates. Numerical results verify that our denoising algorithm can\nsuccessfully mitigate noise in channel estimates. In particular, our algorithm\nprovides a significant improvement over the practical least squares (LS)\nestimation method and provides performance that approaches that of the ideal\nlinear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation with perfect knowledge of\nchannel statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 18:33:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 00:47:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 04:11:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 03:06:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

The FBC then\ndepends linearly on the phase offset of the potential with a quantized slope\ndetermined by the period. Furthermore, different possible values for the FBC at\na fixed phase offset label different degenerate ground states of the system\nthat cannot be connected adiabatically.

For moderate-to-low\nturbulence strengths of $\\alpha_{\\rm t} \\lesssim 10^{-3}$ and substantial\ndifferences in $v_{\\rm frag}$ for icy and ice-free grains, we find a spatially\nnon-uniform dust-to-gas ratio and grain size distribution that deviate\nsignificantly from the ISM values, in agreement with previous studies. The\neffect of a non-uniform dust-to-gas ratio on the Rosseland mean opacity\ndominates over that of the size distribution. This spatially varying -- that is\nnon-monotonic -- dust-to-gas ratio creates a region in the protoplanetary disk\nthat is optimal for producing hydrogen-rich planets, potentially explaining the\napparent peak in gas giant planet occurrence rate at intermediate distances.\nThe enhanced dust-to-gas ratio within the ice line also suppresses gas\naccretion rates onto sub-Neptune cores, thus stifling their tendency to undergo\nrunaway gas accretion within disk lifetimes. Finally, our work corroborates the\nidea that low mass cores with large primordial gaseous envelopes\n(`super-puffs') originate beyond the ice line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 22:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

The central,\nmassive galaxy in our group underwent a 10:1 merger 2 Gyr ago, and ejected 6.6\n- 11.2 x 10$^{8}$ Msol of HI that we detect as clouds and streams in the IGM,\nsome forming coherent structures up to 220 kpc in length. We also detect giant\n(100 kpc) ionised hydrogen (H$\\alpha$) filaments in the IGM, likely from cool\ngas being removed (and ionised) from an infalling satellite. The H$\\alpha$\nfilaments are situated within the hot halo of NGC 1316 and some regions contain\nHI. We speculate that the H$\\alpha$ and multiphase gas is supported by magnetic\npressure (possibly assisted by the AGN), such that the hot gas can condense and\nform HI that survives in the hot halo for cosmological timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 19:00:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 19:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

For this reason, it is now believed that\nmagnetized winds could be the dominant mechanism driving accretion in these\nsystems. However, there is today no self-consistent way to describe discs\nsubject to a magnetized wind, in a way similar to the $\\alpha$ disc model. In\nthis article, I explore in a systematic way the parameter space of wind-driven\nprotoplanetary discs and present scaling laws which can be used in reduced\nmodels \\`a la alpha-disc. Methods: I compute a series of self-similar wind\nsolutions, assuming the disc is dominated by ambipolar and Ohmic diffusions.\nThese solution are obtained by looking for stationary solutions in the\nfinite-volume code PLUTO using a relaxation method and continuation. Results:\nSelf-similar solutions are obtained for values of plasma beta ranging from 10^2\nto 10^8, for several Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion strengths. Mass accretions\nrates of the order of 10^{-8} Msun/yr are obtained for poloidal field strength\nbeta=O(10^4) or equivalently 1 mG at 10 AU. The resulting magnetic lever arms\nare typically lower than 2, possibly reaching 1.5 in weakest field cases.\nFinally, I provide a complete set of scaling laws and semi-analytical wind\nsolutions, which can be used to fit and interpret observations. Conclusions:\nMagnetized winds are unavoidable in protoplanetary discs as soon as they are\nembedded in an ambient poloidal magnetic field. Very detailed disc microphysics\nare not always needed to describe them, and simplified models such as\nself-similar solutions manage to capture most of the physics seen in full 3D\nsimulations. The remaining difficulty to get a complete theory of wind-driven\naccretion lies in the transport of the large scale field, which remains poorly\nconstrained and not well understood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 19:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Because of these fluctuations, data\ndecoding schemes that treat the channel as deterministic perform inefficiently.\nA way to reduce the channel fluctuations is to design a precoding scheme that\nequalizes the effective channel gain seen by the users. Conjugate beamforming\n(CB) poorly contributes to harden the effective channel at the users. In this\nwork, we propose a variant of CB dubbed enhanced normalized CB (ECB), in that\nthe precoding vector consists of the conjugate of the channel estimate\nnormalized by its squared norm. For this scheme, we derive an exact closed-form\nexpression for an achievable downlink spectral efficiency (SE), accounting for\nchannel estimation errors, pilot reuse and user's lack of channel state\ninformation (CSI), assuming independent Rayleigh fading channels.

We aim to\nquantify the level of generality of this result and to measure the most likely\nsets of parameters. We also aim to determine the obliquity that Saturn will\nreach in the future.\n  Methods: We explore a broad range of parameters and propagate numerically the\norientation of Saturn's spin axis both backward and forward in time.\n  Results: In the adiabatic regime, the likelihood of reproducing Saturn's\ncurrent spin-axis orientation is maximised for primordial obliquities between\nabout 2{\\deg} and 7{\\deg}. For a slightly faster migration than expected from\nradio-science experiments, non-adiabatic effects even allow for exactly null\nprimordial obliquities. Starting from such small tilts, Saturn's spin axis can\nevolve up to its current state provided that: i) the semi-major axis of Titan\nchanged by more than 5% of its current value, and ii) its migration rate does\nnot exceed 10 times the nominal measured rate. In comparison, observational\ndata suggest that the increase of Titan's semi-major axis exceeded 50% over 4\nGyrs, and error bars imply that the current migration rate is unlikely to be\nlarger than 1.5 times its nominal value.\n  Conclusions: If Titan did migrate substantially before today, tilting Saturn\nfrom a small obliquity is not only possible, but it is the most likely\nscenario. Saturn's obliquity is expected to be still increasing today and could\nexceed 65{\\deg} in the future. Maximising the likelihood would also put strict\nconstraints on Saturn's polar moment of inertia. However, the possibility\nremains that Saturn's primordial obliquity was already large, for instance as a\nresult of a massive collision. The unambiguous distinction between these two\nscenarios would be given by a precise measure of Saturn's polar moment of\ninertia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 19:29:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 15:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

In this\narticle, we propose a class of identifiable multilayer (potentially deep)\ndiscrete latent structure models for discrete data, termed Bayesian pyramids.\nWe establish the identifiability of Bayesian pyramids by developing novel\ntransparent conditions on the pyramid-shaped deep latent directed graph. The\nproposed identifiability conditions can ensure Bayesian posterior consistency\nunder suitable priors. As an illustration, we consider the two-latent-layer\nmodel and propose a Bayesian shrinkage estimation approach.

Offline brute-force attacks against passwords are\nincreasingly commonplace and the danger is amplified by the well documented\nhuman tendency to select low-entropy password and/or reuse these passwords\nacross multiple accounts. Moderately hard password hashing functions are often\ndeployed to help protect passwords against offline attacks by increasing the\nattacker's guessing cost. However, there is a limit to how \"hard\" one can make\nthe password hash function as authentication servers are resource constrained\nand must avoid introducing substantial authentication delay. Observing that\nthere is a wide gap in the strength of passwords selected by different users we\nintroduce DAHash (Distribution Aware Password Hashing) a novel mechanism which\nreduces the number of passwords that an attacker will crack. Our key insight\nishat a resource-constrained authentication server can dynamically tune the\nhardness parameters of a password hash function based on the (estimated)\nstrength of the user's password. We introduce a Stackelberg game to model the\ninteraction between a defender (authentication server) and an offline attacker.\nOur model allows the defender to optimize the parameters of DAHash e.g.,\nspecify how much effort is spent to hash weak/moderate/high strength passwords.\nWe use several large scale password frequency datasets to empirically evaluate\nthe effectiveness of our differentiated cost password hashing mechanism.

For CH$_3$Cl and CH$_3$Br monolayers\nadsorbed on C$_6$H$_6$, two photodissociation pathways can be identified:\nneutral photodissociation similar to the gas-phase, and a dissociative electron\nattachment (DEA) pathway due to photoelectrons from the metal. The same methyl\nhalides adsorbed on a C$_6$F$_6$ thin film display only neutral\nphotodissociation, with the DEA pathway entirely absent due to intermolecular\nquenching via a LUMO-derived electronic band in the C$_6$F$_6$ thin film. For\nCH$_3$I adsorbed on a C$_6$F$_6$ thin film, illumination with 248nm light\nresults in CH$_3$ photofragments departing due to neutral photodissociation via\nthe A-band absorption. When CH$_3$I monolayers on C$_6$H$_6$ thin films are\nilluminated at the same wavelength, additional new photodissociation pathways\nare observed that are due to absorption in the molecular film with energy\ntransfer leading to dissociation of the CH$_3$I molecules adsorbed on top. The\nproposed mechanism for this photodissociation is via a charge-transfer complex\nfor the C$_6$H$_6$ layer and adsorbed CH$_3$I.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 20:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

However, it is common for models demonstrating\nstrong performance in offline analysis to yield poorer performance when\ndeployed online. This problem is a consequence of the difficulty of training on\nhistorical data in non-stationary environments. Moreover, the machine learning\nmetrics used for model selection may not sufficiently correlate with real-world\nbusiness metrics used to determine the success of the applications being\ntested. These problems are particularly prominent in the Real-Time Bidding\n(RTB) domain, in which ML models power bidding strategies, and a change in\nmodels will likely affect performance of the advertising campaigns. In this\nwork, we present Automatic Model Selector (AMS), a system for scalable online\nselection of RTB bidding strategies based on real-world performance metrics.\nAMS employs Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) to near-simultaneously run and evaluate\nmultiple models against live traffic, allocating the most traffic to the\nbest-performing models while decreasing traffic to those with poorer online\nperformance, thereby minimizing the impact of inferior models on overall\ncampaign performance. The reliance on offline data is avoided, instead making\nmodel selections on a case-by-case basis according to actionable business\ngoals. AMS allows new models to be safely introduced into live campaigns as\nsoon as they are developed, minimizing the risk to overall performance. In\nlive-traffic tests on multiple ad campaigns, the AMS system proved highly\neffective at improving ad campaign performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 20:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

In a harsh remote\ncollaboration setting, data compression techniques such as autoencoder can be\nutilized to obtain and transmit the data in terms of latent variables in a\ncompact form. In addition, to ensure real-time runtime performance even under\nunstable environments, an anytime estimation approach is desired that can\nreconstruct the full contents from incomplete information. In this context, we\npropose a method for imputation of latent variables whose elements are\npartially lost. To achieve the anytime property with only a few dimensions of\nvariables, exploiting prior information of the category-level is essential. A\nprior distribution used in variational autoencoders is simply assumed to be\nisotropic Gaussian regardless of the labels of each training datapoint. This\ntype of flattened prior makes it difficult to perform imputation from the\ncategory-level distributions. We overcome this limitation by exploiting a\ncategory-specific multi-modal prior distribution in the latent space. The\nmissing elements of the partially transferred data can be sampled, by finding a\nspecific modal according to the remaining elements. Since the method is\ndesigned to use partial elements for anytime estimation, it can also be applied\nfor data over-compression.

These methods introduce the concept of anchor BBox for elaborate 2D\nBBox estimation, and predictors are specialized and trained for specific 2D\nBBoxes. In order to estimate the distances to the 3D objects from a single 2D\nimage, we introduce the notion of \\textit{anchor distance} based on an object's\nlocation and propose a method that applies the anchor distance to the\nmulti-object detector structure. We let the predictors catch the distance prior\nusing anchor distance and train the network based on the distance. The\npredictors can be characterized to the objects located in a specific distance\nrange. By propagating the distance prior using a distance anchor to the\npredictors, it is feasible to perform the precise distance estimation and\nreal-time execution simultaneously. The proposed method achieves about 30 FPS\nspeed, and shows the lowest RMSE compared to the existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 20:33:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 17:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

LNF\nextends L2F to cases where there are more than two UAS on a collision path.\nThrough extensive simulations, we show that our method can run online\n(computation time in the order of milliseconds), and under certain assumptions\nhas failure rates of less than 1% in the worst-case, improving to near 0% in\nmore relaxed operations.

A brain injury criterion takes some descriptor of the\nhead's motion as input and yields a prediction for that motion's potential for\ncausing mTBI as the output. The inputs are descriptors of the head's motion\nthat are usually synthesized from accelerometer and gyroscope data. In the\ncontext of brain injury criterion the head is modeled as a rigid body.

As a result, the efficacy of most\nantiviral drugs is short-lived. To include this effect, we modify the Neumann\nand Dahari model. Considering the fact that the efficacy of the antiviral drug\nvaries in time, the differential equations introduced in the previous model\nsystems are rewritten to study the correlation between the viral load and\nantiviral drug. The effect of antiviral drug that either prevents infection or\nstops the production of a virus is explored. First, the efficacy of the drug is\nconsidered to decreases monotonously as time progresses. In this case, our\nresult depicts that when the efficacy of the drug is low, the viral load\ndecreases and increases back in time revealing the effect of the antiviral\ndrugs is short-lived. On the other hand, for the antiviral drug with high\nefficacy, the viral load, as well as the number of infected cells, monotonously\ndecreases while the number of uninfected cells increases. The dependence of the\ncritical drug efficacy on time is also explored. Moreover, the correlation\nbetween viral load, the antiviral drug, and CTL response is also explored.

With the wide application of deep learning, more and more\nresearchers use deep learning models to solve TSC problems. Since time series\nalways contains a lot of noise, which has a negative impact on network\ntraining, people usually filter the original data before training the network.\nThe existing schemes are to treat the filtering and training as two stages, and\nthe design of the filter requires expert experience, which increases the design\ndifficulty of the algorithm and is not universal. We note that the essence of\nfiltering is to filter out the insignificant frequency components and highlight\nthe important ones, which is similar to the attention mechanism. In this paper,\nwe propose an attention mechanism that acts on spectrum (SAM). The network can\nassign appropriate weights to each frequency component to achieve adaptive\nfiltering. We use L1 regularization to further enhance the frequency screening\ncapability of SAM. We also propose a segmented-SAM (SSAM) to avoid the loss of\ntime domain information caused by using the spectrum of the whole sequence. In\nwhich, a tumbling window is introduced to segment the original data. Then SAM\nis applied to each segment to generate new features.

In this paper, we employ a\nhigh-temporal-frequency filter to identify sites of acoustic emission in a\nradiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation. The properties of the filter were\ndetermined from a convolutional neural network trained to identify the\ntwo-dimensional acoustic Green's function response of the atmosphere, but once\ndefined, it can be directly applied to an image time series to extract the\nsignal of local wave excitation, bypassing the need for the original neural\nnetwork.

A complex distribution, fi(v), consisting, for example, of\nessentially disjoint pieces will be called a multi-beam distribution and\nmodeled as a sum of \"beams,\" fi(v) = f1(v) + ... +fN(v). Velocity moments of\nfi(v) are taken beam by beam and summed. Such multi-beam moments of fi(v) have\nadvantages over the customary standard velocity moments of fi(v), forwhich\nthere is only one mean flow velocity. For example, the standard thermal energy\nmomentof a pair of equal and opposite cold particle beams is non-zero even\nthough each beam has zero thermal energy. We therefore call this thermal energy\npseudo-thermal. By contrast, a multi-beam moment of two or more beams has no\npseudo-thermal energy.

We apply the model to construct\ncategorical and concrete semantic interpretations for the motivating example of\nthis extended calculus: the derivation of a phrase with a parasitic gap. The\neffectiveness of the concrete interpretations are evaluated via a\ndisambiguation task, on an extension of a sentence disambiguation dataset to\nparasitic gap phrases, using BERT, Word2Vec, and FastText vectors and\nRelational tensors\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 00:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

The control, movement and nonholonomic\ndynamics constraints of the mobile sensors are also considered in the adaptive\nsampling optimization problem. In order to tackle the nonlinearity and\nnonconvexity of the objective function in the optimization problem we first\nexploit the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (L-ADMM)\nmethod that can effectively simplify the objective function, though it is\ncomputationally expensive since a nonconvex problem needs to be solved exactly\nin each iteration.

Together with the charge local field factor from previous\nDiffusion Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we obtain the complete form of the\neffective electron-electron interaction in the uniform three-dimensional\nelectron gas. Very simple quadratic formulas are presented for the local field\nfactors that quantitatively produce all of the response functions of the\nelectron gas at metallic densities.\n  Exchange and correlation become increasingly important at low densities. At\nthe compressibility divergence at rs = 5.25, both the direct (screened Coulomb)\nterm and the charge-dependent exchange term in the electron-electron\ninteraction at q=0 are separately divergent. However, due to large\ncancellations, their difference is finite, well behaved, and much smaller than\neither term separately.

We investigate the ocean circulation and\nstratification of Enceladus' ocean using a combination of theoretical arguments\nand simulations using the MITgcm. We find that, if the salinity is high, the\nwhole ocean is unstratified, and convection dominates the entire ocean.\nHowever, if the salinity is low enough, there exists a stratified layer in the\nupper ocean, whose thickness depends on the magnitude of the turbulent vertical\ndiffusivity, which remains poorly constrained. Such a layer can suppress the\nvertical flux of heat and tracers, thereby affecting the heat flux to the ice\nshell and leading to a vertical tracer mixing time scale across the stratified\nlayer of at least hundreds of years. This time scale is inconsistent with a\nprevious estimate of vertical ocean mixing of several years, based on the size\nof detected silica nanoparticles in the plumes, leading us to conclude that\neither the salinity of Enceladus' ocean is higher than previously suggested or\nthe interpretation of silica nanoparticle observations has to be reconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 03:03:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 02:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

The $\\alpha$-lift\nis proposed as the $L_\\alpha$-norm of the lift: $\\ell_{\\alpha}(x) = \\|\n(\\cdot,x) \\|_{\\alpha} = (E[l(S,x)^\\alpha])^{1/\\alpha}$.

We show that when grown on an oxygen-deficient\n$SrTiO_{3}$ substrate, the $Bi_{2}WO_{6}$ film exhibits a mixture of (001) and\n(100)/(010)-oriented domains alongside (001)-oriented impurity $WO_{3}$ phases.\nThe (100)/(010)-oriented $Bi_{2}WO_{6}$ phases form a self-organized 3D\nnanopillar-structure, yielding a very rough film surface morphology. Oxygen\nannealing of the substrate or using a few monolayer-thick $SrRuO_{3}$ as the\nblocking layer for oxygen vacancy diffusion enables growing high-quality\nsingle-crystalline $Bi_{2}WO_{6}$ (001) thin film exhibiting an atomically\nsmooth film surface with step-terrace structure. We propose that the large\noxide-ion conductivity of $Bi_{2}WO_{6}$ facilitates diffusion of oxygen\nvacancies from the substrate during the film growth, accelerating the\nevaporation of volatile Bismuth (Bi), which hinders the epitaxial growth. Our\nwork provides a general guideline for high-quality thin film growth of\nAurivillius compounds and other oxide-ion conductors containing volatile\nelements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 05:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

Skyrmions are believed to be circular and stripy spin\ntextures appeared in the vicinity of skyrmion crystals are termed spiral,\nhelical, and cycloid spin orders, but not skyrmions. Here we present convincing\nevidences showing that those stripy spin textures are skyrmions, \"siblings\" of\ncircular skyrmions in skyrmion crystals and \"cousins\" of isolated circular\nskyrmions. Specifically, isolated skyrmions are excitations when skyrmion\nformation energy is positive. The skyrmion morphologies are various stripy\nstructures when the ground states of chiral magnetic films are skyrmions. The\ndensity of skyrmion number determines the morphology of condensed skyrmion\nstates. At the extreme of one skyrmion in the whole sample, the skyrmion is a\nramified stripe. As the skyrmion number density increases, individual skyrmion\nshapes gradually change from ramified stripes to rectangular stripes, and\neventually to disk-like objects. At a low skyrmion number density, the natural\nwidth of stripes is proportional to the ratio between the exchange stiffness\nconstant and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction coefficient. At a high skyrmion\nnumber density, skyrmion crystals are the preferred states.

In this context, low-power radar\ndevices have recently gained in popularity as recording sensors, given that the\nusage of these devices allows mitigating a number of privacy concerns, a key\nissue when making use of conventional video cameras. Another concern that is\noften cited when designing smart home applications is the resilience of these\napplications against cyberattacks. It is, for instance, well-known that the\ncombination of images and CNNs is vulnerable against adversarial examples,\nmischievous data points that force machine learning models to generate wrong\nclassifications during testing time. In this paper, we investigate the\nvulnerability of radar-based CNNs to adversarial attacks, and where these\nradar-based CNNs have been designed to recognize human gestures. Through\nexperiments with four unique threat models, we show that radar-based CNNs are\nsusceptible to both white- and black-box adversarial attacks. We also expose\nthe existence of an extreme adversarial attack case, where it is possible to\nchange the prediction made by the radar-based CNNs by only perturbing the\npadding of the inputs, without touching the frames where the action itself\noccurs. Moreover, we observe that gradient-based attacks exercise perturbation\nnot randomly, but on important features of the input data. We highlight these\nimportant features by making use of Grad-CAM, a popular neural network\ninterpretability method, hereby showing the connection between adversarial\nperturbation and prediction interpretability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 05:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

It generally occurs when a\ngeneralist predator targets some specific prey. However, apart from the lethal\neffects of predation, there are some non-lethal effects in the presence of\npredator. Due to the fear of predation, positive density dependence growth may\nbe observed at low population density, because of reduced foraging activities.\nMoreover, this non-lethal effect can be carried over generations. In the\npresent manuscript, we investigate the role of predation fear and its\ncarry-over effects in prey-predator model. First, we study the single species\nmodel in global perspective. We have shown that depending on the birth rate,\nour single species model describes three types of growth dynamics, namely,\nstrong Allee dynamics, weak Allee dynamics and logistic dynamics. Then we\nconsider the explicit dynamics of predator, with type I functional response.\nBasic dynamical properties, as well as global stability of each equilibria have\nbeen discussed. From our analysis, we can observe that both the fear and its\ncarry-over effects have significant role in the stability of the coexistence\nequilibrium, even if for the model with type I functional response. The\nphenomenon paradox of enrichment can be observed in our model, which cannot be\nobserved in the classical prey-predator model with type I functional response.\nHowever, we can see that such phenomenon can be ruled out by choosing suitable\nnon-lethal effect parameters. Therefore, our study shows how non-lethal effects\nchange the dynamics of a competition model, and has important biological\ninsights, specially for the understanding of the dynamics of small populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 06:21:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

However, in real scenarios, the trajectory often\nexhibits randomness, and has its own probability distribution. Inspired by this\nobserved fact, also considering other movement characteristics of pedestrians,\nwe propose one simple and intuitive movement description, probability\ntrajectory, which maps the coordinate points of pedestrian trajectory into\ntwo-dimensional Gaussian distribution in images. Based on this unique\ndescription, we develop one novel trajectory prediction method, called social\nprobability. The method combines the new probability trajectory and powerful\nconvolution recurrent neural networks together. Both the input and output of\nour method are probability trajectories, which provide the recurrent neural\nnetwork with sufficient spatial and random information of moving pedestrians.\nAnd the social probability extracts spatio-temporal features directly on the\nnew movement description to generate robust and accurate predicted results.

Approximate memory is a technique to reduce the DRAM access latency\nin return of losing data integrity. It is beneficial for applications that are\nrobust to noisy input and intermediate data such as artificial intelligence,\nmultimedia processing, and graph processing. To obtain reasonable outputs from\napplications on approximate memory, it is crucial to protect critical data\nwhile accelerating accesses to non-critical data. We refer the minimum size of\na continuous memory region that the same error rate is applied in approximate\nmemory to as the approximation granularity. A fundamental limitation of\napproximate memory is that the approximation granularity is as large as a few\nkilo bytes. However, applications may have critical and non-critical data\ninterleaved with smaller granularity. For example, a data structure for graph\nnodes can have pointers (critical) to neighboring nodes and its score\n(non-critical, depending on the use-case). This data structure cannot be\ndirectly mapped to approximate memory due to the gap between the approximation\ngranularity and the granularity of data criticality. We refer to this issue as\nthe granularity gap problem. In this paper, we first show that many\napplications potentially suffer from this problem. Then we propose a framework\nto quantitatively evaluate the performance overhead of a possible method to\navoid this problem using known techniques. The evaluation results show that the\nperformance overhead is non-negligible compared to expected benefit from\napproximate memory, suggesting that the granularity gap problem is a\nsignificant concern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 07:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

Learning a single universal parsing model by unifying label\nannotations from different domains or at various levels of granularity is a\ncrucial but rarely addressed topic. This poses many fundamental learning\nchallenges, e.g., discovering underlying semantic structures among different\nlabel granularity or mining label correlation across relevant tasks. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a graph reasoning and transfer learning framework,\nnamed \"Graphonomy\", which incorporates human knowledge and label taxonomy into\nthe intermediate graph representation learning beyond local convolutions. In\nparticular, Graphonomy learns the global and structured semantic coherency in\nmultiple domains via semantic-aware graph reasoning and transfer, enforcing the\nmutual benefits of the parsing across domains (e.g., different datasets or\nco-related tasks). The Graphonomy includes two iterated modules: Intra-Graph\nReasoning and Inter-Graph Transfer modules. The former extracts the semantic\ngraph in each domain to improve the feature representation learning by\npropagating information with the graph; the latter exploits the dependencies\namong the graphs from different domains for bidirectional knowledge transfer.\nWe apply Graphonomy to two relevant but different image understanding research\ntopics: human parsing and panoptic segmentation, and show Graphonomy can handle\nboth of them well via a standard pipeline against current state-of-the-art\napproaches.

Localization in\nreverberant environments remains an open challenge. Even with large data\nvolumes, the number of labels available for supervised learning in reverberant\nenvironments is usually small. We address this issue by performing\nsemi-supervised learning (SSL) with convolutional variational autoencoders\n(VAEs) on reverberant speech signals recorded with microphone arrays. The VAE\nis trained to generate the phase of relative transfer functions (RTFs) between\nmicrophones, in parallel with a direction of arrival (DOA) classifier based on\nRTF-phase. These models are trained using both labeled and unlabeled RTF-phase\nsequences. In learning to perform these tasks, the VAE-SSL explicitly learns to\nseparate the physical causes of the RTF-phase (i.e., source location) from\ndistracting signal characteristics such as noise and speech activity. Relative\nto existing semi-supervised localization methods in acoustics, VAE-SSL is\neffectively an end-to-end processing approach which relies on minimal\npreprocessing of RTF-phase features. As far as we are aware, our paper presents\nthe first approach to modeling the physics of acoustic propagation using deep\ngenerative modeling. The VAE-SSL approach is compared with two signal\nprocessing-based approaches, steered response power with phase transform\n(SRP-PHAT) and MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC), as well as fully\nsupervised CNNs. We find that VAE-SSL can outperform the conventional\napproaches and the CNN in label-limited scenarios. Further, the trained VAE-SSL\nsystem can generate new RTF-phase samples, which shows the VAE-SSL approach\nlearns the physics of the acoustic environment. The generative modeling in\nVAE-SSL thus provides a means of interpreting the learned representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 08:54:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 20:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

Results: Here we introduce a discuss essHi-C, a method to\nisolate the specific, or essential component of Hi-C matrices from the\naspecific portion of the spectrum that is compatible with random matrices.\nSystematic comparisons show that essHi-C improves the clarity of the\ninteraction patterns, enhances the robustness against sequencing depth, allows\nthe unsupervised clustering of experiments in different cell lines and recovers\nthe cell-cycle phasing of single-cells based on Hi-C data. Thus, essHi-C\nprovides means for isolating significant biological and physical features from\nHi-C matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 09:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

Using the derived formal set-up\nrecently found, the model can be formulated in a way that in many respects\nclosely parallels that of the familiar 3d CS one. In spite of these formal\nresemblance, the gauge invariance properties of the 4d CS model differ\nconsiderably. The 4d CS action is fully gauge invariant if the underlying base\n4fold has no boundary. When it does, the action is gauge variant, the gauge\nvariation being a boundary term. If certain boundary conditions are imposed on\nthe gauge fields and gauge transformations, level quantization can then occur.\nIn the canonical formulation of the theory, it is found that, depending again\non boundary conditions, the 4d CS model is characterized by surface charges\nobeying a non trivial Poisson bracket algebra. This is a higher counterpart of\nthe familiar WZNW current algebra arising in the 3d model. 4d CS theory thus\nexhibits rich holographic properties. The covariant Schroedinger quantization\nof the 4d CS model is performed. A preliminary analysis of 4d CS edge field\ntheory is also provided. The toric and Abelian projected models are described\nin some detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 09:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

It is hence not clear if the spectral radius is\naccessible to biological neural networks.\n  Using random matrix theory, we show that the spectral radius is related to\nlocal properties of the neuronal dynamics whenever the overall dynamical state\nis only weakly correlated. This result allows us to introduce two local\nhomeostatic synaptic scaling mechanisms, termed flow control and variance\ncontrol, that implicitly drive the spectral radius towards the desired value\nunder working conditions.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the two adaptation mechanisms under\ndifferent external input protocols and the network performance after adaptation\nby training the network to perform a time-delayed XOR operation on binary\nsequences. As our main result, we found that flow control reliably regulates\nthe spectral radius for different types of input statistics. Precise tuning is\nhowever negatively affected when interneural correlations are substantial.\nFurthermore, we found a consistent task performance over a wide range of input\nstrengths/variances. Variance control did however not yield the desired\nspectral radii with the same precision, being less consistent across different\ninput strengths.\n  Given the effectiveness and remarkably simple mathematical form of flow\ncontrol, we conclude that self-consistent local control of the spectral radius\nvia an implicit adaptation scheme is an interesting and biological plausible\nalternative to conventional methods using setpoint homeostatic feedback\ncontrols of neural firing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 09:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

In the single-field attractor models, inflaton's trajectories with\ndifferent initial conditions effectively converge into a single trajectory in\nthe phase space, and hence there is only one \\emph{clock} degree of freedom\n(DoF) in the scalar part. Its long-wavelength perturbations can be absorbed\ninto the local coordinate renormalization and lead to the so-called\n\\emph{consistency relation} between $n$- and $(n+1)$-point functions. On the\nother hand, if the inflaton dynamics deviates from the attractor behavior, its\nlong-wavelength perturbations cannot necessarily be absorbed and the\nconsistency relation is expected not to hold any longer. In this work, we\nderive a formula for the squeezed bispectrum including the explicit correction\nto the consistency relation, as a proof of its violation in the non-attractor\ncases. First one must recall that non-attractor inflation needs to be followed\nby attractor inflation in a realistic case. Then, even if a specific\nnon-attractor phase is effectively governed by a single DoF of phase space\n(represented by the exact ultra-slow-roll limit) and followed by a single-DoF\nattractor phase, its transition phase necessarily involves two DoF in dynamics\nand hence its long-wavelength perturbations cannot be absorbed into the local\ncoordinate renormalization. Thus, it can affect local physics, even taking\naccount of the so-called \\emph{local observer effect}, as shown by the fact\nthat the bispectrum in the squeezed limit can go beyond the consistency\nrelation. More concretely, the observed squeezed bispectrum does not vanish in\ngeneral for long-wavelength perturbations exiting the horizon during a\nnon-attractor phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 10:15:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 15:17:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 15:01:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 23 May 2021 15:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

The common practice is to first evenly\ndivide the image into a pre-defined number of grids and then learn to associate\neach pixel with its surrounding grids. However, simply applying a series of\nconvolution operations with limited receptive fields can only implicitly\nperceive the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids.\nConsequently, existing methods often fail to provide an effective context when\ninferring the association map. To remedy this issue, we propose a novel\n\\textbf{A}ssociation \\textbf{I}mplantation (AI) module to enable the network to\nexplicitly capture the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids.\nThe proposed AI module directly implants the features of grid cells to the\nsurrounding of its corresponding central pixel, and conducts convolution on the\npadded window to adaptively transfer knowledge between them. With such an\nimplantation operation, the network could explicitly harvest the pixel-grid\nlevel context, which is more in line with the target of superpixel segmentation\ncomparing to the pixel-wise relation. Furthermore, to pursue better boundary\nprecision, we design a boundary-perceiving loss to help the network\ndiscriminate the pixels around boundaries in hidden feature level, which could\nbenefit the subsequent inferring modules to accurately identify more boundary\npixels. Extensive experiments on BSDS500 and NYUv2 datasets show that our\nmethod could not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but maintain\nsatisfactory inference efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 10:40:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2021 03:57:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 08:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

In\nrecent years, fast approximate algorithms for discord search have been proposed\nin order to compensate for the increasing size of the time series.

The resulting algorithm, called HOT\nSAX Time (HST), has been validated with real and synthetic time series, and\nsuccessfully compared with HOT SAX, RRA, SCAMP, and DADD. The complexity of a\ndiscord search has been evaluated with a new indicator, the cost per sequence\n(cps), which allows one to compare searches on time series of different\nlengths. Numerical evidence suggests that two conditions are involved in\ndetermining the complexity of a discord search in a non-trivial way: the length\nof the discords, and the noise/signal ratio. In the case of complex searches,\nHST can be more than 100 times faster than HOT SAX, thus being at the forefront\nof the exact discord search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 10:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

However, in the past, there have been few measurement studies on\nmeasuring and comparing the actual level of decentralization between existing\nblockchains using multiple metrics and granularities. This paper presents a new\ncomparison study of the degree of decentralization in Bitcoin and Ethereum, the\ntwo most prominent blockchains, with various decentralization metrics and\ndifferent granularities within the time dimension. Specifically, we measure the\ndegree of decentralization in the two blockchains during 2019 by computing the\ndistribution of mining power with three metrics (Gini coefficient, Shannon\nentropy, and Nakamoto coefficient) as well as three granularities (days, weeks,\nand months). Our measurement results with different metrics and granularities\nreveal the same trend that, compared with each other, the degree of\ndecentralization in Bitcoin is higher, while the degree of decentralization in\nEthereum is more stable. To obtain the cross-interval information missed in the\nfixed window based measurements, we propose the sliding window based\nmeasurement approach. The corresponding results demonstrate that the use of\nsliding windows could reveal additional cross-interval information overlooked\nby the fixed window based measurements, thus enhancing the effectiveness of\nmeasuring decentralization in terms of continuous trends and abnormal\nsituations. We believe that the methodologies and findings in this paper can\nfacilitate future studies of decentralization in blockchains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 10:45:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 03:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Automatically extracting this embedded causal\nknowledge supports not only reasoning about requirements dependencies, but also\nvarious automated engineering tasks such as seamless derivation of test cases.\nHowever, causality extraction from natural language is still an open research\nchallenge as existing approaches fail to extract causality with reasonable\nperformance. We understand causality extraction from requirements as a two-step\nproblem: First, we need to detect if requirements have causal properties or\nnot. Second, we need to understand and extract their causal relations. At\npresent, though, we lack knowledge about the form and complexity of causality\nin requirements, which is necessary to develop a suitable approach addressing\nthese two problems. We conduct an exploratory case study with 14,983 sentences\nfrom 53 requirements documents originating from 18 different domains and shed\nlight on the form and complexity of causality in requirements.

The theory is based on a high-throughput/data-mining search\namong materials listed in the ICSD database. From ab-initio theory of the\ndefect free material it is predicted that the saturation magnetization is 1.71\nT, the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy is 1.44 MJ/m$^3$, and the Curie\ntemperature is 700 K. Co$_3$Mn$_2$Ge samples were then synthesized and\ncharacterised with respect to structure and magnetism. The crystal structure\nwas found to be the MgZn$_2$-type, with partial disorder of Co and Ge on the\ncrystallographic lattice sites. From magnetization measurements a saturation\npolarization of 0.86 T at 10 K was detected, together with a uniaxial\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy constant of 1.18 MJ/m$^3$, and the Curie\ntemperature of $T_{\\rm C}$ = 359 K. These magnetic properties make\nCo$_3$Mn$_2$Ge a very promising material as a rare-earth free permanent magnet,\nand since we can demonstrate that magnetism depends critically on the amount of\ndisorder of the Co and Ge atoms, a further improvement of the magnetism is\npossible.

The method consists of two phases: (1) an offline\nlearning phase where we collect noisy input-output data to determine a function\nto propagate the state-set ahead in time; and (2) an online estimation phase\nconsisting of a time update and a measurement update. It is assumed that known\nfinite sets bound measurement noise and disturbances, but we assume no\nknowledge of their statistical properties. These sets are described using\nzonotopes, allowing efficient propagation and intersection operations. We\npropose a new approach to compute a set of models consistent with the data and\nnoise-bound, given input-output data in the offline phase.

The latter uses large\npre-trained models as feature extractors and enables the design of complex,\nnon-linear models even on tiny datasets. Combining these two approaches is an\neffective, state-of-the-art method when dealing with small datasets.\n  In this paper, we share an intriguing observation: Namely, that the\ncombination of these techniques is particularly susceptible to a new kind of\ndata poisoning attack: By adding small adversarial noise on the input, it is\npossible to create a collision in the output space of the transfer learner. As\na result, Active Learning algorithms no longer select the optimal instances,\nbut almost exclusively the ones injected by the attacker. This allows an\nattacker to manipulate the active learner to select and include arbitrary\nimages into the data set, even against an overwhelming majority of unpoisoned\nsamples.

This paper aims to address this problem by revisiting the\nlocally supervised learning, where a network is split into gradient-isolated\nmodules and trained with local supervision. We experimentally show that simply\ntraining local modules with E2E loss tends to collapse task-relevant\ninformation at early layers, and hence hurts the performance of the full model.\nTo avoid this issue, we propose an information propagation (InfoPro) loss,\nwhich encourages local modules to preserve as much useful information as\npossible, while progressively discard task-irrelevant information. As InfoPro\nloss is difficult to compute in its original form, we derive a feasible upper\nbound as a surrogate optimization objective, yielding a simple but effective\nalgorithm.

Extensive empirical results on five datasets (i.e., CIFAR, SVHN, STL-10,\nImageNet and Cityscapes) validate that InfoPro is capable of achieving\ncompetitive performance with less than 40% memory footprint compared to E2E\ntraining, while allowing using training data with higher-resolution or larger\nbatch sizes under the same GPU memory constraint.

We also make a phenomenological estimate for how chiral\nfluctuations could effect the momentum spectrum of soft pions.\n  We first formulate the appropriate stochastic hydrodynamic equations close to\nthe $O(4)$ critical point.

In the\nmeantime, however, driven by the Gaia space mission, there is mounting evidence\nthat many of the most extreme high-velocity early-type stars at high Galactic\nlatitudes do originate in the Galactic disk and not in the GC. Moreover, the\nejection velocities of these extreme disk-runaway stars exceed the predicted\nlimits of the classical scenarios for the production of runaway stars. Based on\nproper motions from the Gaia early data release 3 and on recent and new\nspectrophotometric distances, we studied the kinematics of 30 such extreme\ndisk-runaway stars, allowing us to deduce their spatial origins in and their\nejection velocities from the Galactic disk with unprecedented precision.

We address the\nquestion of how to interpret this breakdown, restricting our attention to\nclassical considerations (though our work has ramifications for more general\nclassical metric theories of gravity, as well). In particular, we argue for a\nnew claim: spacetime singularities in general relativity signal indeterminism.\n  The usual manner in which indeterminism is formulated for physical theories\ncan be traced back to Laplace. This formulation is based on the non-uniqueness\nof future (or past) states of a physical system -- as understood in the context\nof a physical theory -- as a result of the specification of an antecedent state\n(or, respectively, of a subsequent state). We contend that for physical\ntheories generally, this formulation does not comprehensively capture the\nrelevant sense of a lack of determination. And, in particular, it does not\ncomprehensively capture the sense(s) in which a lack of determination (and so,\nindeterminism) arises due to spacetime singularities in general relativity.\n  We thus present a novel, broader formulation, in which indeterminism in the\ncontext of some physical theory arises whenever one of the three following\nconditions holds: future (and/or past) states are (i) not unique -- as for\nLaplacian notions of indeterminism; (ii) not specified; or (iii) `incoherent'\n-- that is, they fail to satisfy certain desiderata that are internal to the\ntheory and/or imposed from outside the theory. We apply this formulation to\nsalient features of singularities in general relativity and show that this\nbroader sense of indeterminism can comprehensively account for (our\ninterpretation of) the breakdown signaled by their occurrence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 15:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

As compressed forms of the documents we use\nstraight-line programs (SLPs) -- a lossless compression scheme for textual data\nwidely used in different areas of theoretical computer science and particularly\nwell-suited for algorithmics on compressed data. In terms of data complexity,\nour results are as follows. For a regular spanner M and an SLP S that\nrepresents a document D, we can solve the tasks of model checking and of\nchecking non-emptiness in time O(size(S)). Computing the set M(D) of all\nspan-tuples extracted from D can be done in time O(size(S) size(M(D))), and\nenumeration of M(D) can be done with linear preprocessing O(size(S)) and a\ndelay of O(depth(S)), where depth(S) is the depth of S's derivation tree. Note\nthat size(S) can be exponentially smaller than the document's size |D|; and,\ndue to known balancing results for SLPs, we can always assume that depth(S) =\nO(log(|D|)) independent of D's compressibility. Hence, our enumeration\nalgorithm has a delay logarithmic in the size of the non-compressed data and a\npreprocessing time that is at best (i.e., in the case of highly compressible\ndocuments) also logarithmic, but at worst still linear. Therefore, in a\nbig-data perspective, our enumeration algorithm for SLP-compressed documents\nmay nevertheless beat the known linear preprocessing and constant delay\nalgorithms for non-compressed documents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 18:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

We showed that random\nprocesses defined by this model can capture the essence of the stochastic,\noften erratic, behavior of the infection process. The most significant finding\nwas that it is negative binomial distributed with small r, hence it is\ngeometrically distributed with an exceedingly long tail. This leads to a much\nlarger disparity in the epidemic patterns than has been known to the modeling\ncommunity. In Part 2 we conduct simulation experiments by implementing an\nevent-driven simulator. Several independent runs are presented to verify the\nfindings reported in Part 1. The enormous variations among the sample paths\nobtained from several consecutive and independent runs with statistically\nidentical conditions confirm our analysis. Note that the epidemic pattern that\nwe observe is merely one sample path taken out of infinitely many paths. Thus,\none such path cannot represent the ensemble of the underlying random process.\nBy plotting the simulation runs in the semi-log scale, we can see that the\nprobabilistic chances in the early phase of the infection process determine the\nbehavior of the process. Once the process has reached a considerable number,\nthe weak law of large numbers sets in, and the process behaves less erratically\nthan in the early phase. One important implication of our findings is that it\nwould be a futile effort to attempt to identify all plausible causes of the\nepidemic patterns. Mere luck may play a more significant role than most people\nbelieve.

One challenge of 1H-MRS is the low Signal-Noise Ratio\n(SNR). To improve the SNR, a typical approach is to perform Signal Averaging\n(SA) with M repeated samples. The data acquisition time, however, is increased\nby M times accordingly, and a complete clinical MRS scan takes approximately 10\nminutes at a common setting M=128. Recently, deep learning has been introduced\nto improve the SNR but most of them use the simulated data as the training set.\nThis may hinder the MRS applications since some potential differences, such as\nacquisition system imperfections, and physiological and psychologic conditions\nmay exist between the simulated and in vivo data. Here, we proposed a new\nscheme that purely used the repeated samples of realistic data. A deep learning\nmodel, Refusion Long Short-Term Memory (ReLSTM), was designed to learn the\nmapping from the low SNR time-domain data (24 SA) to the high SNR one (128 SA).\nExperiments on the in vivo brain spectra of 7 healthy subjects, 2 brain tumor\npatients and 1 cerebral infarction patient showed that only using 20% repeated\nsamples, the denoised spectra by ReLSTM could provide comparable estimated\nconcentrations of metabolites to 128 SA.

Italian lexical gemination is contrastive, so that two words may\ndiffer by only one geminated consonant.

This study investigates the acoustic correlates of Italian lexical and\nsyntactic gemination, asking if the correlates for the two types are similar in\nthe case of stop consonants. Results confirmed previous studies showing that\nduration is a prominent gemination cue, with a lengthened consonant closure and\na shortened pre-consonant vowel for both types. Results also revealed the\npresence, in about 10-12% of instances, of a double stop-release burst,\nproviding strong support for the biphonematic nature of Italian geminated stop\nconsonants. Moreover, the timing of these bursts suggests a different planning\nprocess for lexical vs. syntactic geminates. The second burst, when present, is\naccommodated within the closure interval in syntactic geminates, while lexical\ngeminates are lengthened by the extra burst. This suggests that syntactic\ngemination occurs during a post-lexical phase of production planning, after\ntiming has already been established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 16:07:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 09:26:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

However, such a broadband\nhigh-purity tailored spectrum is difficult to be achieved by the present\ndevices, where the broadband amplitude manipulation has not been explored yet.\nIn this work, inspired by the envelope-modulation theory, an elegant and\nuniversal way to manipulate the OAM spectrum in wide bandwidth is proposed by\nusing a shape-tailored metasurface. Firstly, the rotating meta-atoms on a\ntriangular lattice are proved to have smaller coupling distortion than that on\na square lattice, and this behavior is critical for high-purity vortex spectrum\ngeneration by the Pancharatnam-Berry-based metasurfaces. Secondly, a universal\nmodulation relation is established between the spatial arrangement of\nmetasurfaces and the generated vortex beams.
