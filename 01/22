By using\nthe theoretical spectra from MARCS, we demonstrate that there is a prominent\ndifference around 1.6 $\\mu$m (\"H-bump\") between low-surface-gravity (LSG) and\nhigh-surface-gravity (HSG) targets. Taking advantage of this feature, we\nidentify efficient color-color diagrams (CCDs) of rzH and rzK to separate HSG\nand LSG targets from crossmatching of optical and NIR data. Moreover, synthetic\nphotometry from ATLAS9 also give similar results. Further separating RSG\ncandidates from the rest of the LSG candidates is done by using semi-empirical\ncriteria on NIR CMDs and resulted in 323 RSG candidates. Meanwhile, the\nsimulation of foreground stars from Besan\\c{c}on models also indicates that our\nselection criteria is largely free from the contamination of Galactic giants.\nIn addition to the \"H-bump\" method, we also use the traditional BVR method as a\ncomparison and/or supplement, by applying a slightly aggressive cut to select\nas much as possible RSG candidates (358 targets). Furthermore, the Gaia\nastrometric solution is used to constrain the sample, where 181 and 193 targets\nwere selected from the \"H-bump\" and BVR method, respectively. The percentages\nof selected targets in both methods are similar as $\\sim$60\\%, indicating the\ncomparable accuracy of the two methods. In total, there are 234 RSG candidates\nafter combining targets from both methods with 140 ($\\sim$60\\%) of them in\ncommon. The final RSG candidates are in the expected locations on the MIR CMDs,\nwhile the spatial distribution is also coincident with the FUV-selected star\nformation regions, suggesting the selection is reasonable and reliable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Here we attempt to investigate space and time from the\ninformation theoretic point of view to understand spatial and temporal\ncorrelations under the relative assumption. Correlations, as a measure of\nrelationship between two quantities, do not distinguish space and time in\nclassical probability theory; quantum correlations in space are well-studied\nbut temporal correlations are not well understood. The thesis investigates\nquantum correlations in space-time, by treating temporal correlations equally\nin form as spatial correlations and unifying quantum correlations in space and\ntime. In particular, we follow the pseudo-density matrix formalism in which\nquantum states in spacetime are properly defined by correlations from\nmeasurements. We first review classical correlations, quantum correlations in\nspace and time, to motivate the pseudo-density matrix formalism in finite\ndimensions. Next we generalise the pseudo-density matrix formulation to the\nGaussian case, general continuous variables via Wigner representations, and\ngeneral measurement processes like weak measurements. Then we compare the\npseudo-density matrix formalism with other spacetime formulations: indefinite\ncausal structures, consistent histories, generalised non-local games,\nout-of-time-order correlation functions, and path integrals. We argue that in\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics, different spacetime formulations are\nclosely related via quantum correlations, except path integrals. Finally, we\napply the pseudo-density matrix formulation to time crystals. By defining time\ncrystals as long-range order in time, we analyse continuous and discrete time\ntranslation symmetry as well as discuss the existence of time crystals from an\nalgebraic point of view. Finally, we summarise our work and provide the outlook\nfor future directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-22"}

Arising due to different mechanisms -- electron correlation for\ndispersion and the Pauli exclusion principle for exchange-repulsion -- these\ninteractions do not appear to have a straightforward connection. In this paper,\nwe use a coarse-grained approach for evaluating the exchange energy for two\ncoupled quantum Drude oscillators and investigate the mutual compensation of\nthe attractive and repulsive forces at the equilibrium distance within the\nmultipole expansion of the Coulomb potential. This compensation yields a\ncompact formula relating the vdW radius of an atom to its multipole\npolarizabilities, $R_{\\rm vdW} = A_l^{\\,}\\, \\alpha_l^{{2}/{7(l+1)}}$, where $l$\nis the multipole rank and $A_l$ is a conversion factor. Such a relation is\ncompelling because it connects an electronic property of an isolated atom\n(atomic polarizability) with an equilibrium distance in a dimer composed of two\nclosed-shell atoms. We assess the accuracy of the revealed formula for\nnoble-gas, alkaline-earth, and alkali atoms and show that the $A_l$ can be\nassumed to be universal constants. Besides a seamless definition of vdW radii,\nthe proposed relation can also be used for the efficient determination of\natomic multipole polarizabilities solely based on the corresponding dipole\npolarizability and the vdW radius.

This output tracking problem only allows to\nutilize the outputs of the reference system and the controlled system, rather\nthan their states, and differs from most existing tracking results that depend\non the state of the system. The optimal tracking problem is formulated into a\nlinear quadratic regulation problem by proposing a family of dynamic\ndiscrete-time controllers. Then, it is shown that solving the output tracking\nproblem is equivalent to solving output regulation equations, whose solution,\nhowever, requires the knowledge of the complete and accurate system dynamics.\nTo remove such a requirement, an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm is\nproposed using only the measured output data along the trajectories of the\nsystem and the reference output. By introducing re-expression error and\nanalyzing the rank condition of the parameterization matrix, we ensure the\nuniqueness of the proposed RL based optimal control via output feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-22"}

We show that the phase can be chosen in such a way\nthat the Wannier functions for the different sites in the basis both become\neigenstates of the position operator in a particular band. A key step in\nshowing this is the extension of the Brillouin zone. When the distance between\nsites within a unit cell is a rational number, $p/q$, the Brillouin extends by\na factor of $q$. For irrational numbers, the Brillouin zone extends to\ninfinity. In the case of rational distance, $p/q$, the Berry phase \"lives\" on a\ncyclic curve in the parameter space of the Hamiltonian, on the Brillouin zone\nextended by a factor of $q$. For irrational distances the most stable way to\ncalculate the polarization is to approximate the distance as a rational\nsequence, and use the formulas derived here for rational numbers. The use of\ndifferent bases are related to unitary transformations of the Hamiltonian, as\nsuch, the phase diagrams of topological systems are not altered, but each phase\ncan acquire different topological characteristics when the basis is changed.

The analysis is\nfulfilled by using the representation theory of groups with the application of\nthe magnetic group theory, which is a new approach in solving such problems.

Each communication request comes with\nquality of experience (QoE) requirements such as throughput and\nlatency/deadline, which can be met by assigning RBs, communication power, and\nprocessing power to the request. For a completed request, the achieved reward\nis measured by the weight (priority) of this request. Then, the reward is\nmaximized over time by allocating resources, e.g., with reinforcement learning\n(RL). In this paper, we introduce a novel flooding attack on 5G network\nslicing, where an adversary generates fake network slicing requests to consume\nthe 5G RAN resources that would be otherwise available to real requests. The\nadversary observes the spectrum and builds a surrogate model on the network\nslicing algorithm through RL that decides on how to craft fake requests to\nminimize the reward of real requests over time. We show that the portion of the\nreward achieved by real requests may be much less than the reward that would be\nachieved when there was no attack. We also show that this flooding attack is\nmore effective than other benchmark attacks such as random fake requests and\nfake requests with the minimum resource requirement (lowest QoE requirement).\nFake requests may be detected due to their fixed weight. As an attack\nenhancement, we present schemes to randomize weights of fake requests and show\nthat it is still possible to reduce the reward of real requests while\nmaintaining the balance on weight distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 17:05:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 14:39:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

The complexity and streaming nature of\nsocial messages make it appealing to address social event detection in an\nincremental learning setting, where acquiring, preserving, and extending\nknowledge are major concerns. Most existing methods, including those based on\nincremental clustering and community detection, learn limited amounts of\nknowledge as they ignore the rich semantics and structural information\ncontained in social data. Moreover, they cannot memorize previously acquired\nknowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge-Preserving Incremental\nHeterogeneous Graph Neural Network (KPGNN) for incremental social event\ndetection. To acquire more knowledge, KPGNN models complex social messages into\nunified social graphs to facilitate data utilization and explores the\nexpressive power of GNNs for knowledge extraction. To continuously adapt to the\nincoming data, KPGNN adopts contrastive loss terms that cope with a changing\nnumber of event classes. It also leverages the inductive learning ability of\nGNNs to efficiently detect events and extends its knowledge from previously\nunseen data. To deal with large social streams, KPGNN adopts a mini-batch\nsubgraph sampling strategy for scalable training, and periodically removes\nobsolete data to maintain a dynamic embedding space. KPGNN requires no feature\nengineering and has few hyperparameters to tune. Extensive experiment results\ndemonstrate the superiority of KPGNN over various baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 17:56:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 17:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

In a circular forced jet with Strouhal number 0.2,\ncontinuous formation of these vortices is observed which undergo pairing,\ntearing and disintegration. The forced jet is analyzed for varying frequency of\nforced perturbations, coflow temperature, turbulence intensity, momentum\nthickness, coflow intensity and Reynolds number at a constant forcing\namplitude. The observation reveals that any reduction in momentum thickness\nincreases the circulation as well as energy capacity of the leading and the\ntrailing vortices, thereby enhancing the vortex pairing time. However, the hot\ncoflow increases the strength of the leading vortex to such an extent that the\ngenerated trailing vortex is weak and dissipates even before it undergoes\nvortex pairing, while an incomplete disintegration of the leading vortex occurs\nin this case. Moreover, the strength of leading and trailing vortices is found\nto decrease with an increase in coflow power, thereby leading to a weaker\nvortex pairing. The decrease in Reynolds number also reduces the intensity of\ntrailing vortices; whereas, at a lower Reynolds Number (Re) the trailing\nvortices dissipate soon after they form.

This paper describes a simulation study exploring\ntwo techniques to lower the energy threshold of LZ to gain sensitivity to\nlow-mass dark matter and astrophysical neutrinos, which will be applicable to\nother liquid xenon detectors. The energy threshold is determined by the number\nof detected S1 photons; typically, these must be recorded in three or more\nphotomultiplier channels to avoid dark count coincidences that mimic real\nsignals. To lower this threshold: a) we take advantage of the double\nphotoelectron emission effect, whereby a single vacuum ultraviolet photon has a\n$\\sim20\\%$ probability of ejecting two photoelectrons from a photomultiplier\ntube photocathode; and b) we drop the requirement of an S1 signal altogether,\nand use only the ionization signal, which can be detected more efficiently. For\nboth techniques we develop signal and background models for the nominal\nexposure, and explore accompanying systematic effects, including the dependence\non the free electron lifetime in the liquid xenon. When incorporating double\nphotoelectron signals, we predict a factor of $\\sim 4$ sensitivity improvement\nto the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross-section at $2.5$ GeV/c$^2$, and a\nfactor of $\\sim1.6$ increase in the solar $^8$B neutrino detection rate.\nDropping the S1 requirement may allow sensitivity gains of two orders of\nmagnitude in both cases.

Although physiological MRI provides more specific information\nregarding tumor infiltration, the relatively low resolution hinders a precise\nfull annotation. This has motivated us to develop a weakly supervised deep\nlearning solution that exploits the partial labelled tumor regions.\n  EMReDL contains two components: a physiological prior prediction model and\nEM-regularized segmentation model. The physiological prior prediction model\nexploits the physiological MRI by training a classifier to generate a\nphysiological prior map. This map is passed to the segmentation model for\nregularization using the EM algorithm. We evaluated the model on a glioblastoma\ndataset with the pre-operative multiparametric and recurrence MRI available.\nEMReDL showed to effectively segment the infiltrated tumor from the partially\nlabelled region of potential infiltration. The segmented core tumor and\ninfiltrated tumor demonstrated high consistency with the tumor burden labelled\nby experts. The performance comparisons showed that EMReDL achieved higher\naccuracy than published state-of-the-art models.

The choice of turbulence\nmodel, real gas model, and chemical kinetics model are the critical parameters\nin numerical simulations of cryogenic combustion at high pressure.

Therefore, we have systematically carried out a comparative study\nto analyze the importance of real gas models, turbulence parameters, and\nchemical kinetics at such conditions. The comparison of real gas models with\nthe NIST database reveals better conformity of SRK (Soave Redlich Kwong\nEquation of State (EoS)) model predictions with the database. Further, the\ncomputed results indicate that the Standard k-e turbulence model with modified\nconstant captures the better flame shape and temperature peak position compared\nto other RANS based turbulence models while invoking the non-premixed steady\nb-PDF flamelet model for simulating the combustion process.

Finally, we have studied the\neffect of chamber pressure and LOx inlet temperature on the flame\ncharacteristics. The flame characteristics exhibit a strong sensitivity towards\nthe chamber pressure due to the weakening of the pseudo-boiling effect with an\nincrease in pressure.

Besides\nhosting several ordered phases, the model is debated to possess a spin-liquid\nground state when only nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions are\npresent. Here, we contest this hypothesis with an extensive numerical\ninvestigation using both exact diagonalization and complementary variational\ntechniques. Specifically, we employ a RVB-like many-variable Monte Carlo ansatz\nand convolutional neural network quantum states for (variational) calculations\nwith up to $4\\times 4^3$ and $4 \\times 3^3$ spins, respectively.

Modeling the radial velocities with a Gaussian process using a\nquasi-periodic kernel suggests that the characteristic spot evolution timescale\nis ~180 days, though we cannot exclude the possibility that it is much longer.\nSuch long timescales may indicate the presence of failed fossil magnetic fields\non Vega. TESS data reveal Vega's photometric rotational modulation for the\nfirst time, with a total amplitude of only 10 ppm, and a comparison of the\nspectroscopic and photometric amplitudes suggest the surface features may be\ndominated by bright plages rather than dark spots. For the shortest orbital\nperiods, transit and radial velocity injection recovery tests exclude the\npresence of transiting planets larger than 2 Earth radii and most\nnon-transiting giant planets. At long periods, we combine our radial velocities\nwith direct imaging from the literature to produce detection limits for Vegan\nplanets and brown dwarfs out to distances of 15 au. Finally, we detect a\ncandidate radial velocity signal with a period of 2.43 days and a\nsemi-amplitude of 6 m/s. If caused by an orbiting companion, its minimum mass\nwould be ~20 Earth masses; because of Vega's pole-on orientation, this would\ncorrespond to a Jovian planet if the orbit is aligned with the stellar spin. We\ndiscuss the prospects for confirmation of this candidate planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 19:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

Current ML software libraries, however, are quite limited in\nhandling the dynamic interactions among the components of AutoML. For example,\nefficientNAS algorithms, such as ENAS and DARTS, typically require an\nimplementation coupling between the search space and search algorithm, the two\nkey components in AutoML. Furthermore, implementing a complex search flow, such\nas searching architectures within a loop of searching hardware configurations,\nis difficult. To summarize, changing the search space, search algorithm, or\nsearch flow in current ML libraries usually requires a significant change in\nthe program logic. In this paper, we introduce a new way of programming AutoML\nbased on symbolic programming. Under this paradigm, ML programs are mutable,\nthus can be manipulated easily by another program. As a result, AutoML can be\nreformulated as an automated process of symbolic manipulation. With this\nformulation, we decouple the triangle of the search algorithm, the search space\nand the child program. This decoupling makes it easy to change the search space\nand search algorithm (without and with weight sharing), as well as to add\nsearch capabilities to existing code and implement complex search flows. We\nthen introduce PyGlove, a new Python library that implements this paradigm.\nThrough case studies on ImageNet and NAS-Bench-101, we show that with PyGlove\nusers can easily convert a static program into a search space, quickly iterate\non the search spaces and search algorithms, and craft complex search flows to\nachieve better results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 19:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

Using this platform,\nwe demonstrate MEMS-OMS components for polarization-independent beam steering\nand two-dimensional focusing with high modulation efficiencies (~ 50%),\nbroadband operation (~ 20% near the operating wavelength of 800 nm) and fast\nresponses (< 0.4 ms). The developed MEMS-OMS platform offers flexible solutions\nfor realizing complex dynamic 2D wavefront manipulations that could be used in\nreconfigurable and adaptive optical networks and systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

Hence, deformable\nimage registration (DIR) algorithms are increasingly used to map contours and\ndose distributions from one image set to another. However, the lack of\nvalidation tools slows their clinical adoption, despite their commercial\navailability. This work presents a novel water-equivalent deformable dosimeter\nthat simultaneously measures the dose distribution and tracks deformation\nvector fields (DVF). The dosimeter in made of an array of 19 scintillating\nfiber detectors embedded in a cylindrical elastomer matrix. It is imaged by two\npairs of stereoscopic cameras tracking the position and angulation of the\nscintillators, while measuring the dose. The resulting system provides a\nprecision of 0.3 mm on DVF measurements. The dosimeter was irradiated with\n5$\\times$3, 4$\\times$3 and 3$\\times$3 cm$^2$ 6 MV photon beams in both fixed\nand deformed conditions. The measured DVF was compared to the one computed with\na DIR algorithm (Plastimatch). The deviations between the computed and measured\nDVFs was below 1.5 mm. As for dose measurements, the dosimeter acquired the\ndose distribution in fixed and deformed conditions within 1\\% of the treatment\nplanning system calculation and complementary dose validation using the\nHyperscint dosimetry system. Using the demonstrated qualities of scintillating\ndetectors, we developed a real-time, water-equivalent deformable dosimeter.\nGiven it's sensor tracking position precision and dose measurements accuracy,\nthe developed detector is a promising tools for the validation of DIR\nalgorithms as well as dose distribution measurements under fixed and deformed\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

This is achieved by\nexchanging local model updates with the help of a parameter server (PS).\nHowever, due to the increasing size of the trained models, the communication\nload due to the iterative exchanges between the clients and the PS often\nbecomes a bottleneck in the performance. Sparse communication is often employed\nto reduce the communication load, where only a small subset of the model\nupdates are communicated from the clients to the PS. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel time-correlated sparsification (TCS) scheme, which builds\nupon the notion that sparse communication framework can be considered as\nidentifying the most significant elements of the underlying model. Hence, TCS\nseeks a certain correlation between the sparse representations used at\nconsecutive iterations in FL, so that the overhead due to encoding and\ntransmission of the sparse representation can be significantly reduced without\ncompromising the test accuracy. Through extensive simulations on the CIFAR-10\ndataset, we show that TCS can achieve centralized training accuracy with 100\ntimes sparsification, and up to 2000 times reduction in the communication load\nwhen employed together with quantization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

However, there has been less agreement about how jets form in\naccretion flows, their possible relationship to black hole spin, and how they\ninteract with the surrounding medium. There have also been theoretical concerns\nabout instabilities in standard accretion disk models and lingering\ndiscrepancies with observational constraints. Despite seemingly successful\napplications to X-ray binaries, the standard accretion disk model faces a\ngrowing list of observational constraints that challenge its application to\nAGNs. Theoretical exploration of these questions has become increasingly\nreliant on numerical simulations owing to the dynamic nature of these flows and\nthe complex interplay between hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, radiation\ntransfer, and curved spacetime. We conclude the following: The advent of\ngeneral relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations has greatly\nimproved our understanding of jet production and its dependence on black hole\nspin.

An approximation (also known as abstraction) is itself a\ncontinuous-space system, which can be used as a replacement of the original\n(also known as concrete) system in a controller design process. Having designed\na controller for the abstract system, it is refined to a more detailed one for\nthe concrete system. We use the notion of so-called simulation functions to\nquantify the mismatch between the original system and its approximation. In\nparticular, each subsystem in the concrete network and its corresponding one in\nthe abstract network are related through a notion of local simulation\nfunctions. We show that if the local simulation functions satisfy certain\nsmall-gain type conditions developed for a network containing infinitely many\nsubsystems, then the aggregation of the individual simulation functions\nprovides an overall simulation function quantifying the error between the\noverall abstraction network and the concrete one. In addition, we show that our\nmethodology results in a scale-free compositional approach for any\nfinite-but-arbitrarily large networks obtained from truncation of an infinite\nnetwork.

The proposed\nsurrogate model integrates and extends recent developments in Gaussian process\nlearning, high-fidelity simulations, projection-based model reduction,\nuncertainty quantification, and experimental design, rendering a systematic,\nmultidisciplinary framework. The novelty of the CKSPOD emulation lies in the\nconstruction of a common Gram matrix, which results from the Hadamard product\nof Gram matrices of all observed design settings. The Gram matrix is a\nspatially averaged temporal correlation matrix and contains the temporal\ndynamics of the corresponding sampling point. The common Gram matrix\nsynthesizes the temporal dynamics by transferring POD modes into spatial\nfunctions at each observed design setting, which remedies the phase-difference\nissue encountered in the kernel-smoothed POD (KSPOD) emulation, a recent fluid\nflow emulator proposed in Chang et al.

A total of 30 training design settings and 8\nvalidation design settings are included. Both qualitative and quantitative\nresults show that the CKSPOD emulation outperforms the KSPOD emulation for all\nvalidation cases, and is capable of capturing small-scale wave structures on\nthe liquid-film surface faithfully. The turbulent kinetic energy prediction\nusing CKSPOD reveals lower predictive uncertainty than KSPOD, thereby allowing\nfor more accurate and precise flow predictions.

Zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods have\nattracted considerable attention in recent years because of their ability to\nclassify unseen/novel class examples. Most of the existing approaches on ZSL\nworks when all the samples from seen classes are available to train the model,\nwhich does not suit real life. In this paper, we tackle this hindrance by\ndeveloping a generative replay-based continual ZSL (GRCZSL). The proposed\nmethod endows traditional ZSL to learn from streaming data and acquire new\nknowledge without forgetting the previous tasks' gained experience. We handle\ncatastrophic forgetting in GRCZSL by replaying the synthetic samples of seen\nclasses, which have appeared in the earlier tasks. These synthetic samples are\nsynthesized using the trained conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) over\nthe immediate past task. Moreover, we only require the current and immediate\nprevious VAE at any time for training and testing. The proposed GRZSL method is\ndeveloped for a single-head setting of continual learning, simulating a\nreal-world problem setting. In this setting, task identity is given during\ntraining but unavailable during testing. GRCZSL performance is evaluated on\nfive benchmark datasets for the generalized setup of ZSL with fixed and dynamic\n(incremental class) settings of continual learning. The existing class setting\npresented recently in the literature is not suitable for a class-incremental\nsetting. Therefore, this paper proposes a new setting to address this issue.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms\nthe baseline and the state-of-the-art method and makes it more suitable for\nreal-world applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:03:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 00:44:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

In applications where\nparticles are much heavier than the carrying fluid, e.g. aerosols, the\ninfluence of particle inertia dominates the particle dynamics. Assuming that\nthe particle only experiences a local linear velocity profile, its rotational\nand translational motion are independent. However, we show that quadratic terms\nof the local velocity profile combined with particle inertia cause a lateral\ndrift of prolate spheroidal particles. We find that this drift is maximal when\nparticle inertial forces are of the same order of magnitude as viscous forces,\nand that both extremely light and extremely heavy particles have negligible\ndrift. In the non-inertial case, the particle rotates according to the local\nlinear velocity profile, with each instantaneous orientation corresponding to a\nvelocity that gives zero force on the particle. This results in a translational\nmotion in the flow direction with periodic velocity fluctuations. With added\nparticle inertia, the particle is slow to react to the surrounding fluid motion\nand the particle will switch between slower and faster rotation compared to the\nzero-force solution. The final motion that gives zero integrated force over a\nrotational period, is a motion with a lateral drift. We show that this drift is\npurely an effect of the non-sphericity of the particle and its translational\ninertia, while rotational inertia is negligible. Finally, although this\ninertial drift will contribute to the lateral motion of heavy elongated\nparticles in channel flow, sedimentation due to gravity will dominate in any\npractical application on earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Moreover, it is of greater importance\nto propose defenses that can protect the systems against these attacks.\nAddressing these concerns, this paper at first investigates how\nstate-of-the-art x-vector based SR systems are affected by white-box\nadversarial attacks, i.e., when the adversary has full knowledge of the system.\nx-Vector based SR systems are evaluated against white-box adversarial attacks\ncommon in the literature like fast gradient sign method (FGSM), basic iterative\nmethod (BIM)--a.k.a. iterative-FGSM--, projected gradient descent (PGD), and\nCarlini-Wagner (CW) attack.

The four pre-processing\ndefenses--viz. randomized smoothing, DefenseGAN, variational autoencoder (VAE),\nand Parallel WaveGAN vocoder (PWG) are compared against the baseline defense of\nadversarial training.

Compared with full body action recognition, hand gesture involves joints\nthat are more spatially closely distributed with stronger collaboration. This\nnature requires a different approach from action recognition to capturing the\ncomplex spatial features. Many gesture categories, such as \"Grab\" and \"Pinch\",\nhave very similar motion or temporal patterns posing a challenge on temporal\nprocessing. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a two-stream\nneural network with one stream being a self-attention based graph convolutional\nnetwork (SAGCN) extracting the short-term temporal information and hierarchical\nspatial information, and the other being a residual-connection enhanced\nbidirectional Independently Recurrent Neural Network (RBi-IndRNN) for\nextracting long-term temporal information. The self-attention based graph\nconvolutional network has a dynamic self-attention mechanism to adaptively\nexploit the relationships of all hand joints in addition to the fixed topology\nand local feature extraction in the GCN. On the other hand, the\nresidual-connection enhanced Bi-IndRNN extends an IndRNN with the capability of\nbidirectional processing for temporal modelling. The two streams are fused\ntogether for recognition.

By machine learning\napproaches, we try to identify the physical characteristics in the\ntwo-dimensional percolation model. To achieve this, we adopt Monte Carlo\nsimulation to generate dataset at first, and then we employ several approaches\nto analyze the dataset. Four kinds of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), one\nvariational autoencoder (VAE), one convolutional VAE (cVAE), one principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA), and one $k$-means are used for identifying order\nparameter, the permeability, and the critical transition point. The former\nthree kinds of CNNs can simulate the two order parameters and the permeability\nwith high accuracy, and good extrapolating performance. The former two kinds of\nCNNs have high anti-noise ability. To validate the robustness of the former\nthree kinds of CNNs, we also use the VAE and the cVAE to generate new\npercolating configurations to add perturbations into the raw configurations. We\nfind that there is no difference by using the raw or the perturbed\nconfigurations to identify the physical characteristics, under the prerequisite\nof corresponding labels. In the case of lacking labels, we use unsupervised\nlearning to detect the physical characteristics.

However, the SHEL under an arbitrarily polarized\nor unpolarized incidence has remained largely unexplored.

The independence of the shift with respect to\nthe incident polarization is proved both analytically and numerically.\nMoreover, we prove that under an unpolarized incidence composed of a large\nnumber of completely random polarization states, the reflected beam is split in\nhalf into two circularly polarized components that undergo the same amount of\nsplitting but in opposite directions.

Britain's fifth Astronomer Royal, Nevil Maskelyne, had selected\nWilliam Dawes, a promising young Marine with a propensity for astronomical\nobservations, as his prot\\'eg\\'e. Maskelyne convinced the British Board of\nLongitude to supply Dawes with a suite of state-of-the-art instruments and\nallow the young Marine to establish an observatory in the new settlement. The\nAstronomer Royal may have had a dual motivation, one driven by strategic\nnational interests combined with a personal investment linked to the suggested\nre-appearance of a comet in the southern sky. With the unexpected assistance of\nthe French Lap\\'erouse expedition, between 1788 and 1791 Dawes established not\none but two observatories within a kilometre of Sydney's present-day city\ncentre. Motivated by persisting confusion in the literature, we explore the\nhistorical record to narrow down the precise location of Dawes' observatory. We\nconclude that the memorial plaque attached to Sydney Harbour Bridge indicates\nan incorrect location. Overwhelming contemporary evidence -- maps, charts and\npictorial representations -- implies that Dawes' observatory was located on the\nnortheastern tip of the promontory presently known as The Rocks (formerly\nDawes' Point), with any remains having vanished during the construction of the\nHarbour Bridge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 07:25:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

The methodology consists of atomistic, moderately\ncoarse-grained (mCG), and highly coarse-grained slip-spring (SLSP) simulations.\nAt the mCG level, a few chemically bonded atoms are lumped into one\ncoarse-grained bead. At this level, the chemical identity of the atomistic\nsystem, and the interchain topological constraints (entanglements) are\npreserved. The mCG potentials are derived by matching local structural\ndistributions of the mCG model to those of the atomistic model through\niterative Boltzmann inversion. For matching mCG and atomistic dynamics, the mCG\ntime is scaled by a time scaling factor, which compensates for the lower\nmonomeric friction coefficient of the mCG model than that of the atomistic one.\nAt the SLSP level, multiple Kuhn segments of a polymer chain are represented by\none coarse-grained bead. The very soft nonbonded interactions between beads do\nnot prevent chain crossing and, hence, can not capture entanglements. The\ntopological constraints are represented by slip-springs. A compensating pair\npotential is used in the SLSP model, to keep the static macromolecular\nproperties unaltered upon the introduction of slip-springs. The static and\nkinetic parameters of the SLSP model are determined based on the lower level\nsimulation models.

Although several works have approached this problem with\nweakly-supervised methods, the performance needs to be improved. One obstacle\nis that general weakly-supervised methods have failed to consider the\ncharacteristics of X-ray images, such as the highly-structural attribute. We\ntherefore propose the Cross-chest Graph (CCG), which improves the performance\nof automatic lesion detection by imitating doctor's training and\ndecision-making process. CCG models the intra-image relationship between\ndifferent anatomical areas by leveraging the structural information to simulate\nthe doctor's habit of observing different areas. Meanwhile, the relationship\nbetween any pair of images is modeled by a knowledge-reasoning module to\nsimulate the doctor's habit of comparing multiple images. We integrate\nintra-image and inter-image information into a unified end-to-end framework.\nExperimental results on the NIH Chest-14 database (112,120 frontal-view X-ray\nimages with 14 diseases) demonstrate that the proposed method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised localization of lesions by\nabsorbing professional knowledge in the medical field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:24:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 06:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

The dependence of this\n\"FLASH\" effect on target oxygenation has led to the assumption that oxygen\n\"depletion\" could be its major driving force. Materials and Methods: In a\nbottom-up approach starting from the chemical track evolution of 1 MeV\nelectrons in oxygenated water simulated with the TRAX-CHEM Monte Carlo code, we\ndetermine the oxygen consumption and radiolytic reactive oxygen species\nproduction following a short radiation pulse. Based on these values, the\neffective dose weighted by oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) or the in vitro cell\nsurvival under dynamic oxygen pressure is calculated and compared to that of\nconventional exposures, at constant OER. Results: We find an excellent\nagreement of our Monte Carlo predictions with the experimental value for\nradiolytic oxygen removal from oxygenated water. However, the application of\nthe present model to published radiobiological experiment conditions shows that\noxygen depletion can only have a negligible impact on radiosensitivity through\noxygen enhancement, especially at typical experimental oxygenations where a\nFLASH effect has been observed. Conclusion: We show that the magnitude and\ndependence of the \"oxygen depletion\" hypothesis are not consistent with the\nobserved biological effects of FLASH irradiation. While oxygenation plays an\nundoubted role in mediating the FLASH effect, we conclude that state-of-the-art\nradiation chemistry models do not support oxygen depletion and\nradiation-induced transient hypoxia as the main mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 09:12:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

In this ideal optical set-up the quantum\noscillator is subjected to the radiation pressure interaction of travelling\nlight waves, no cavity is involved. This configuration shows that squeezed\nlight can be generated by pure scattering on a quantum system, without\ninvolving a cavity. The squeezing can be detected at the output ports of the\ninterferometer either by direct detection or by measuring the spectrum of the\ndifference current. We use the Hudson-Parthasarathy equation to model the\nglobal evolution. It can describe the scattering of photons and the resulting\nradiation pressure interaction on the quantum oscillator. It allows to consider\nalso the interaction with a thermal bath. In this way we have a unitary\ndynamics giving the evolution of oscillator and fields. The Bose fields of\nquantum stochastic calculus and the related generalized Weyl operators allow to\ndescribe the whole optical circuit. By working in the Heisenberg picture, the\nquantum Langevin equations for position and momentum and the output fields\narise, which are used to describe the monitoring in continuous time of the\nlight at the output ports.

By this\nway, the cluster layer produces the general presentation for the same cluster,\nwhile produces relatively specific presentations for different clusters.

To these data, we associate natural conformally covariant\npolynomial one-parameter families of differential operators $C^\\infty(X) \\to\nC^\\infty(M)$. They arise through a residue construction which generalizes an\nearlier construction in the framework of Poincar\\'e-Einstein metrics. The main\ningredient of the definition of residue families are eigenfunctions of the\nLaplacian of the singular metric $\\sigma^{-2}g$. We prove that if $\\sigma$ is\nan approximate solution of a singular Yamabe problem, these families can be\nwritten as compositions of certain degenerate Laplacians. This result implies\nthat the notions of extrinsic conformal Laplacians and extrinsic $Q$-curvature\nintroduced in recent works by Gover and Waldron can naturally be rephrased in\nterms of residue families. The new spectral theoretical perspective enables us\nto relate the extrinsic conformal Laplacians and the critical extrinsic\n$Q$-curvature to the scattering operator of the asymptotically hyperbolic\nmetric $\\sigma^{-2}g$ extending the work of Graham and Zworski.

In this paper, we present results of high\nresolution simulations for embryo formation from a disc of up to 41,000\nfully-self gravitating planetesimals with the GPU-based N-body code GENGA. Our\nresults indicate that the growth of embryos are highly dependent on the initial\nconditions. More massive initial planetesimals, a shorter gas disc decay\ntimescale and initially eccentric Jupiter and Saturn (EJS) all lead to faster\ngrowth of embryos. Asteroid belt material can thereby be implanted into the\nterrestrial planet region via sweeping secular resonances. This could possibly\nexplain the rapid growth of Mars within 10 Myr inferred from its Hf-W\nchronology. The sweeping secular resonance almost completely clears the\nasteroid belt and deposits this material in the Mercury-Venus region, altering\nthe composition of embryos there. This could result in embryos in the\nMercury-Venus region accreting an unexpectedly high mass fraction from beyond 2\nAU. Changing the initial orbits of Jupiter and Saturn to more circular (CJS) or\nassuming embryos formed in a gas free environment removes the sweeping secular\nresonance effect and thus greatly decreases material accreted from beyond 2 AU\nfor Mercury-Venus region embryos.

Active learning\nstrategies come into ease the burden of human annotation, which queries only a\nsubset of training data for annotation.

The internal criterion leverages the disagreement of intermediate\nfeatures within the deep learning network for active sample selection, which\nsubsequently reduces the computational costs. We use the proposed criteria to\nselect samples for strong and weak labelers to produce oracle labels and pseudo\nlabels simultaneously at each active learning iteration in an ensemble learning\nmanner, which can be examined with IoMT Platform.

Therefore, orbital longitudinal magnetoresistance\nis unexpected. Here we report on the observation of a large and non saturating\nmagnetoresistance in lightly doped SrTiO$_{3-x}$ independent of the relative\norientation of current and magnetic field. We show that this quasi-isotropic\nmagnetoresistance can be explained if the carrier mobility along all\norientations smoothly decreases with magnetic field. This anomalous regime is\nrestricted to low concentrations when the dipolar correlation length is longer\nthan the distance between carriers. We identify cyclotron motion of electrons\nin a potential landscape tailored by polar domains as the cradle of\nquasi-isotropic orbital magnetoresistance.

With signal's temporal correlation in mind,\nwe provide a framework of iterative MMV algorithms based on thresholding,\nfunctional feedback and null space tuning. Convergence analysis for exact\nrecovery is established. Unlike most of iterative greedy algorithms that select\nindices in a measurement/solution space, we determine indices based on an\northogonal subspace spanned by the iterative sequence. In addition, a\nfunctional feedback that controls the amount of energy relocation from the\n\"tails\" is implemented and analyzed. It is seen that the principle of\nfunctional feedback is capable to lower the number of iteration and speed up\nthe convergence of the algorithm.

First, we discuss the\ndeterministic model, and derive the expected value of the infection process.\nThen as an application we consider that a government issues a decree to its\ncitizens to curtail their activities that may incur further infections and show\nhow the public's tardy response may further increase infections and prolong the\nepidemic much longer than one might think. We seek to solve a partial\ndifferential equation for the probability generating function. We find,\nhowever, that an exact solution is obtainable only for the BD process, i.e., no\narrivals of the infected from outside. The coefficient of variation for the\nnonhomogeneous BD process is found to be well over unity. This result implies\nthat the variations among different sample paths will be as large as in the\nnegative binomial distribution with r<1, which was found in Part I for the\nhomogeneous BDI model.

Although\nthe effect of data contamination on the estimated joint and individual\ncomponents has not been considered in the literature, gross errors and outliers\nin the data can cause instability in such methods, and lead to incorrect\nestimation of joint and individual variance components.

Its main advantage is that information about\nthe three-dimensional structure of the object is already contained in a single\nimage. This makes it useful for the reconstruction of fragile and\nnon-reproducible particles without the need for tomographic measurements.\nHowever, currently there is no efficient numerical inversion algorithm\navailable that is capable of determining the object's structure in real time.\nNeural networks, on the other hand, excel in image processing tasks suited for\nsuch purpose.

In this work, we calculate the rate of EMRIs of an alternative\nformation channel: EMRI formation assisted by the accretion flow around\naccreting massive black holes. In this scenario, sBHs and stars on inclined\norbits are captured by the accretion disk, and then subsequently migrate\ntowards the MBH, under the influence of density wave generation and head wind.\nBy solving the Fokker-Planck equation incorporating both sBH-sBH/sBH-star\nscatterings and sBH/star-disk interactions, we find that an accretion disk\nusually boosts the EMRI formation rate per individual MBH by $\\mathcal\nO(10^1-10^3)$ compared with the canonical \"loss cone\" formation channel.

On the other hands, it has been recently observed (F. Martelli et.\nal, \\textit{ACS Nano}, \\textbf{14}, 8616--8623, 2020) that the topology of the\nhydrogen bond network (HBN) is a very sensitive measure that should be\nconsidered when developing new interaction potentials. Here we report a\nthorough comparison of 11 popular non polarizable classical water models\nagainst their HBN, which is at the root of water properties. We probe the\ntopology of the HBN using the ring statistics and we evaluate the quality of\nthe network inspecting the percentage of broken and intact HBs. For each water\nmodel, we assess the tendency to develop hexagonal rings (that promote\ncrystallization at low temperatures) and pentagonal rings (known to frustrate\nagainst crystallization at low temperatures). We then introduce the\n\\emph{network complexity index}, a general descriptor to quantify how much the\ntopology of a given network deviates from that of the ground state, namely of\nhexagonal or cubic ice. Remarkably, we find that the network complexity index\nallows us to relate, for the first time, the dynamical properties of different\nwater models with their underlying topology of the HBN. Our study provides a\nbenchmark against which the performances of new models should be tested\nagainst, and introduces a general way to quantify the complexity of a network\nwhich can be transferred to other materials and that links the topology of the\nHBN with dynamical properties. Finally, our study introduces a new perspective\nthat can help in rationalizing the transformations among the different phases\nof water and of other materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 15:38:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

Machine learning has been increasingly used in fingerprint-based indoor\nlocalization to replace or emulate the radio map that is used to predict\nlocations given a location signature. The prediction quality of a machine\nlearning model primarily depends on how well the model was trained, which\nrelies on the amount and quality of data used to train it. Data augmentation\nhas been used to improve quality of the trained models by synthetically\nproducing more training data, and several approaches were used in the\nliterature that tackles the problem of lack of training data from different\nangles. In this paper, we propose DataLoc+, a data augmentation technique for\nroom-level indoor localization that combines different approaches in a simple\nalgorithm. We evaluate the technique by comparing it to the typical direct\nsnapshot approach using data collected from a field experiment conducted in a\nhospital.

The objective functions depend on the total\nreflection (TR) at the pass and stop band re-gions. Three types of the MDFs\nthat are low pass (LP), high pass (HP) and band pass (BP) MMDFs are optimally\ndesigned across the constituted dual-objective EM model with a frequency\ndependent material database through using the multi-objective ABC (MO-ABC)\nstrategy.

However, a low spatial resolution can\nlead to sub-optimal investment decisions for wind and solar generation.\nIgnoring power grid bottlenecks within regions tends to underestimate system\ncosts, while combining locations with different wind and solar capacity factors\nin the same resource class tends to overestimate costs. We investigate these\ntwo competing effects in a capacity expansion model for Europe's power system\nwith a high share of renewables, taking advantage of newly-available\nhigh-resolution datasets as well as computational advances. We vary the number\nof nodes, interpolating between a 37-node model based on country and\nsynchronous zone boundaries, and a 1024-node model based on the location of\nelectricity substations. If we focus on the effect of renewable resource\nresolution and ignore network restrictions, we find that a higher resolution\nallows the optimal solution to concentrate wind and solar capacity at sites\nwith better capacity factors and thus reduces system costs by up to 10%\ncompared to a low resolution model. This results in a big swing from offshore\nto onshore wind investment. However, if we introduce grid bottlenecks by\nraising the network resolution, costs increase by up to 23% as generation has\nto be sourced more locally at sites with worse capacity factors. These effects\nare most pronounced in scenarios where grid expansion is limited, for example,\nby low local acceptance.

Early Ad signs are usually mistaken for normal\nage-related cognitive dysfunctions, thus patients usually start their treatment\nin advanced AD stages, when its benefits are severely limited. AD has no known\ncure, as such, hope lies on early diagnosis which usually depends on\nneuroimaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET). PET data is\nthen analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software, which uses\nmass univariate statistical analysis, inevitably incurring in errors derived\nfrom this multiple testing approach.

Here we test this\napproach with a practical application for AD diagnosis, estimating mean\nfunctions and SCCs for the difference between AD and control group's PET\nactivity and locating regions where this difference galls outside estimated\nSCCs, indicating differences in brain activity attributable to AD-derived\nneural loss. Our results are consistent with previous literature on AD\npathology and suggest that this FDA approach is more resilient to reductions in\nsample size and less dependent on ad hoc selection of an {\\alpha} level than\nits counterpart, suggesting that this novel technique is a promising venue for\nresearch in the field of medical imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 13:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

However,\nthere has been little research into how to make the most of SBDH information\nfrom EHRs. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in six databases to find\nrelevant peer-reviewed publications that had recently been published. Relevance\nwas determined by screening and evaluating the articles. Based on selected\nrelevant studies, a methodological analysis of AI algorithms leveraging SBDH\ninformation in EHR data was provided. Results: Our synthesis was driven by an\nanalysis of SBDH categories, the relationship between SBDH and\nhealthcare-related statuses, and several NLP approaches for extracting SDOH\nfrom clinical literature. Discussion: The associations between SBDH and health\noutcomes are complicated and diverse; several pathways may be involved. Using\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) technology to support the extraction of SBDH\nand other clinical ideas simplifies the identification and extraction of\nessential concepts from clinical data, efficiently unlocks unstructured data,\nand aids in the resolution of unstructured data-related issues. Conclusion:\nDespite known associations between SBDH and disease, SBDH factors are rarely\ninvestigated as interventions to improve patient outcomes. Gaining knowledge\nabout SBDH and how SBDH data can be collected from EHRs using NLP approaches\nand predictive models improves the chances of influencing health policy change\nfor patient wellness, and ultimately promoting health and health equity.\n  Keywords: Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health, Artificial\nIntelligence, Electronic Health Records, Natural Language Processing,\nPredictive Model\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 09:03:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2021 17:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

More specifically, we need to answer how to represent an\ninstruction in a fixed-length vector. The idea of automatically learning\ninstruction representations is intriguing, however the existing schemes fail to\ncapture the unique characteristics of disassembly. These schemes ignore the\ncomplex intra-instruction structures and mainly rely on control flow in which\nthe contextual information is noisy and can be influenced by compiler\noptimizations.\n  In this paper, we propose to pre-train an assembly language model called\nPalmTree for generating general-purpose instruction embeddings by conducting\nself-supervised training on large-scale unlabeled binary corpora. PalmTree\nutilizes three pre-training tasks to capture various characteristics of\nassembly language. These training tasks overcome the problems in existing\nschemes, thus can help to generate high-quality representations. We conduct\nboth intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, and compare PalmTree with other\ninstruction embedding schemes. PalmTree has the best performance for intrinsic\nmetrics, and outperforms the other instruction embedding schemes for all\ndownstream tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 22:30:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 19:48:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 04:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}
