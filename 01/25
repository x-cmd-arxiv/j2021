This leads\nto several proposals of regularized variants of OT in the recent literature. In\nthis work, we consider an \\textit{entropy partial transport} (EPT) problem for\nnonnegative measures on a tree having different masses. The EPT is shown to be\nequivalent to a standard complete OT problem on a one-node extended tree. We\nderive its dual formulation, then leverage this to propose a novel\nregularization for EPT which admits fast computation and negative definiteness.\nTo our knowledge, the proposed regularized EPT is the first approach that\nyields a \\textit{closed-form} solution among available variants of unbalanced\nOT. For practical applications without priori knowledge about the tree\nstructure for measures, we propose tree-sliced variants of the regularized EPT,\ncomputed by averaging the regularized EPT between these measures using random\ntree metrics, built adaptively from support data points. Exploiting the\nnegative definiteness of our regularized EPT, we introduce a positive definite\nkernel, and evaluate it against other baselines on benchmark tasks such as\ndocument classification with word embedding and topological data analysis.

This research reduces\npopulation-driven, spatial modeling of individuals to the simplest\nconfigurations and parameters: an equal resource opportunity landscape with\nequally capable individuals; and asks the question, \"Will valid complex\npopulation and inequality dynamics emerge from this simple economic model?\" Two\nforaging economies are modeled: subsistence and surplus. The resulting,\nemergent population dynamics are characterized by their sensitivities to agent\nand landscape parameters. The various steady and oscillating regimes of\nsingle-species population dynamics are generated by appropriate selection of\nmodel growth parameters. These emergent dynamics are shown to be consistent\nwith the equation-based, continuum modeling of single-species populations in\nbiology and ecology. The intrinsic growth rates, carry capacities, and delay\nparameters of these models are implied for these simple economies. Aggregate\nmeasures of individual distributions are used to understand the sensitivities\nto model parameters. New local measures are defined to describe complex\nbehaviors driven by spatial effects, especially extinctions. This simple\neconomic model is shown to generate significantly complex population and\ninequality dynamics. Model parameters generating the intrinsic growth rate have\nstrong effects on these dynamics, including large variations in inequality.\nSignificant inequality effects are shown to be caused by birth costs above and\nbeyond their contribution to the intrinsic growth rate. The highest levels of\ninequality are found during the initial non-equilibrium period and are driven\nby factors different than those driving steady state inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2021 22:45:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 18:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

As internet traffic becomes increasingly encrypted,\nthe mainstream classic traffic recognition technique, payload inspection, is\nrendered ineffective. This paper uses machine learning techniques for encrypted\ntraffic classification, looking only at packet size and time of arrival.\nSpiking neural networks (SNN), largely inspired by how biological neurons\noperate, were used for two reasons. Firstly, they are able to recognize\ntime-related data packet features. Secondly, they can be implemented\nefficiently on neuromorphic hardware with a low energy footprint. Here we used\na very simple feedforward SNN, with only one fully-connected hidden layer, and\ntrained in a supervised manner using the newly introduced method known as\nSurrogate Gradient Learning. Surprisingly, such a simple SNN reached an\naccuracy of 95.9% on ISCX datasets, outperforming previous approaches. Besides\nbetter accuracy, there is also a very significant improvement on simplicity:\ninput size, number of neurons, trainable parameters are all reduced by one to\nfour orders of magnitude. Next, we analyzed the reasons for this good accuracy.\nIt turns out that, beyond spatial (i.e. packet size) features, the SNN also\nexploits temporal ones, mostly the nearly synchronous (within a 200ms range)\narrival times of packets with certain sizes. Taken together, these results show\nthat SNNs are an excellent fit for encrypted internet traffic classification:\nthey can be more accurate than conventional artificial neural networks (ANN),\nand they could be implemented efficiently on low power embedded systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2021 22:46:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 13:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

First, they need to be able to make\npredictions over a range of task distributions while utilizing only a small\namount of training data. Second, they also need to adapt to new novel unseen\ntasks at meta-test time again by using only a small amount of training data\nfrom that task. It is the second objective where meta-learning models fail for\nnon-mutually exclusive tasks due to task overfitting. Given that guaranteeing\nmutually exclusive tasks is often difficult, there is a significant need for\nregularization methods that can help reduce the impact of task-memorization in\nmeta-learning. For example, in the case of N-way, K-shot classification\nproblems, tasks becomes non-mutually exclusive when the labels associated with\neach task is fixed. Under this design, the model will simply memorize the class\nlabels of all the training tasks, and thus will fail to recognize a new task\n(class) at meta-test time. A direct observable consequence of this memorization\nis that the meta-learning model simply ignores the task-specific training data\nin favor of directly classifying based on the test-data input. In our work, we\npropose a regularization technique for meta-learning models that gives the\nmodel designer more control over the information flow during meta-training.

In contrast, evolutionary algorithms present almost no restriction\nto the features of these functions, although the most appropriate\nconstraint-handling technique is still an open question. The particle swarm\noptimization (PSO) method is sometimes viewed as another evolutionary algorithm\nbecause of their many similarities, despite not being inspired by the same\nmetaphor. Namely, they evolve a population of individuals taking into\nconsideration previous experiences and using stochastic operators to introduce\nnew responses. The advantages of evolutionary algorithms with respect to\ntraditional methods have been greatly discussed in the literature for decades.\nWhile all such advantages are valid when comparing the PSO paradigm to\ntraditional methods, its main advantages with respect to evolutionary\nalgorithms consist of its noticeably lower computational cost and easier\nimplementation.

Since both PH$_3$ and SO$_2$ are\nspectrally active near 266.94 GHz, the contribution to this line from SO$_2$\nmust be determined before it can be attributed, in whole or part, to PH$_3$. An\nundetected SO$_2$ reference line, interpreted as an unexpectedly low SO$_2$\nabundance, suggested that the 266.94 GHz feature could be attributed primarily\nto PH$_3$. However, the low SO$_2$ and the inference that PH$_3$ was in the\ncloud deck posed an apparent contradiction. Here we use a radiative transfer\nmodel to analyze the PH$_3$ discovery, and explore the detectability of\ndifferent vertical distributions of PH$_3$ and SO$_2$. We find that the 266.94\nGHz line does not originate in the clouds, but above 80 km in the Venus\nmesosphere. This level of line formation is inconsistent with chemical modeling\nthat assumes generation of PH$_3$ in the Venus clouds. Given the extremely\nshort chemical lifetime of PH$_3$ in the Venus mesosphere, an implausibly high\nsource flux would be needed to maintain the observed value of 20$\\pm$10 ppb. We\nfind that typical Venus SO$_2$ vertical distributions and abundances fit the\nJCMT 266.94 GHz feature, and the resulting SO$_2$ reference line at 267.54 GHz\nwould have remained undetectable in the ALMA data due to line dilution. We\nconclude that nominal mesospheric SO$_2$ is a more plausible explanation for\nthe JCMT and ALMA data than PH$_3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 00:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

Specifically, due to its controllable\nhigh-mobility and high-altitude, the UAV can move sufficiently close to the\nsensors to enable line-of-sight transmission and adaptively adjust all the\nlinks' distances, thereby enhancing the signal magnitude alignment and noise\nsuppression.

The outage performance of\nphase-quantized system is also investigated for the case of Rayleigh fading\nwhen the channel state information (CSI) is only known at the receiver. Our\nfindings suggest the existence of a threshold in the rate $R$, above which the\noutage exponent of the outage probability changes abruptly. In fact, this\nthreshold effect in the outage exponent causes $2^b$-PSK to have suboptimal\noutage performance at high SNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 05:01:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 09:33:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 09:45:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 00:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

First, these methods converge quite slowly since they\noptimize the loss functions in a high-dimensional and sparse Gaussian Sphere.\nSecond, the high dimensionality of features, despite the powerful descriptive\nability, brings difficulty to the optimization, which may lead to a sub-optimal\nlocal optimum. To address these problems, we propose a simple yet efficient\ntraining mechanism called MultiFace, where we approximate the original\nhigh-dimensional features by the ensemble of low-dimensional features. The\nproposed mechanism is also generic and can be easily applied to many advanced\nFR models. Moreover, it brings the benefits of good interpretability to FR\nmodels via the clustering effect. In detail, the ensemble of these\nlow-dimensional features can capture complementary yet discriminative\ninformation, which can increase the intra-class compactness and inter-class\nseparability. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can\naccelerate 2-3 times with the softmax loss and 1.2-1.5 times with Arcface or\nCosface, while achieving state-of-the-art performances in several benchmark\ndatasets.

In the classification part, EGFI\nencompasses the language model BioBERT which has been comprehensively\npre-trained on biomedical corpus. In particular, we propose the multi-head\nattention mechanism and pack BiGRU to fuse multiple semantic information for\nrigorous context modeling. In the generation part, EGFI utilizes another\npre-trained language model BioGPT-2 where the generation sentences are selected\nbased on filtering rules. We evaluated the classification part on \"DDIs 2013\"\ndataset and \"DTIs\" dataset, achieving the FI score of 0.842 and 0.720\nrespectively. Moreover, we applied the classification part to distinguish\nhigh-quality generated sentences and verified with the exiting growth truth to\nconfirm the filtered sentences.

However, collecting\ninstance-level annotations for various thoracic diseases is expensive.\nTherefore, weakly supervised localization methods have been proposed that use\nonly image-level annotation. While the previous methods presented the disease\nlocation as the most discriminative part for classification, this causes a deep\nnetwork to localize wrong areas for indistinguishable X-ray images. To solve\nthis issue, we propose a spatial attention method using disease masks that\ndescribe the areas where diseases mainly occur. We then apply the spatial\nattention to find the precise disease area by highlighting the highest\nprobability of disease occurrence. Meanwhile, the various sizes, rotations and\nnoise in chest X-ray images make generating the disease masks challenging. To\nreduce the variation among images, we employ an alignment module to transform\nan input X-ray image into a generalized image. Through extensive experiments on\nthe NIH-Chest X-ray dataset with eight kinds of diseases, we show that the\nproposed method results in superior localization performances compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 06:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

For systems with short-range\nattractions, however, $P(s)$ appears discontinuous. There is a power-law decay\nfor small cluster sizes, followed by a low probability gap and a peak near the\nsystem size.

In fact, it signifies the coexistence of two\ndistinct length scales, associated with the largest cluster and smaller ones,\nrespectively. The comparison between the largest and second largest clusters\nindicates that their growth rates with system size are rather different.\nHowever, both cluster sizes tend to diverge in the large system size limit,\nsuggesting that the jamming transition of systems with short-range attractions\nis still continuous.

We propose a probabilistic framework\nthat obtains (locally) optimal density distributions via gradient descent.\nStarting from random partitioning matrices abiding by the obtained\ndistribution, we perform low complexity optimization algorithms over the cycle\nproperties to construct high memory, high performance quasi-cyclic SC codes.\nSimulation results show that codes obtained through our proposed method notably\noutperform state-of-the-art SC codes with the same constraint length and codes\nwith uniform partitioning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 09:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

The problem is highly challenging due to the\nnon-convex SINR constraints as well as the non-convex unit-modulus constraints\nfor both the phase shifts at the RIS and the analog beamforming at the BS. A\npenalty-based algorithm in conjunction with the manifold optimization technique\nis proposed to handle the problem, followed by an individual optimization\nmethod with much lower complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed\nalgorithm outperforms the state-of-art algorithm.

However, the CNN models are\nusually computationally intensive and energy consuming, since they are often\ndesigned with numerous multiply-operations and considerable parameters for the\naccuracy reason. Thus, it is difficult to directly apply them in the\nresource-constrained environments such as 'Internet of Things' (IoT) devices\nand smart phones. To reduce the computational complexity and energy burden,\nhere we present a novel minimalist hardware architecture using adder\nconvolutional neural network (AdderNet), in which the original convolution is\nreplaced by adder kernel using only additions. To maximally excavate the\npotential energy consumption, we explore the low-bit quantization algorithm for\nAdderNet with shared-scaling-factor method, and we design both specific and\ngeneral-purpose hardware accelerators for AdderNet. Experimental results show\nthat the adder kernel with int8/int16 quantization also exhibits high\nperformance, meanwhile consuming much less resources (theoretically ~81% off).\nIn addition, we deploy the quantized AdderNet on FPGA (Field Programmable Gate\nArray) platform. The whole AdderNet can practically achieve 16% enhancement in\nspeed, 67.6%-71.4% decrease in logic resource utilization and 47.85%-77.9%\ndecrease in power consumption compared to CNN under the same circuit\narchitecture. With a comprehensive comparison on the performance, power\nconsumption, hardware resource consumption and network generalization\ncapability, we conclude the AdderNet is able to surpass all the other\ncompetitors including the classical CNN, novel memristor-network, XNOR-Net and\nthe shift-kernel based network, indicating its great potential in future high\nperformance and energy-efficient artificial intelligence applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 11:31:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 06:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

To better study\ngalaxy evolution, we propose a classification based on the maps of the ionised\nhydrogen distribution, traced by kpc-resolved, equivalent width of H$\\alpha$\nmaps, and the nuclear activity of the galaxies using information from the BPT\ndiagnostic diagrams. Using these tools, we group a sample of 238 galaxies from\nthe CALIFA survey in six quenching stages (QS): objects dominated by recent\nstar formation; systems that present a quiescent-nuclear-ring structure in\ntheir centre; galaxies that are centrally-quiescent; galaxies with no clear\npattern in their ionisation gas distribution - mixed; systems that posses only\na few star-forming regions - nearly-retired, or galaxies that are completely\nquiescent - fully-retired. Regarding their nuclear activity, we further divide\nthe galaxies into two groups - active systems that host a weak or strong AGN in\ntheir centre, and non-active objects. Galaxies grouped into quenching stage\nclasses occupy specific locations on the star-formation-rate versus stellar\nmass diagram. The \"Blue cloud\" is populated by the star-forming and the\nquiescent-nuclear-ring galaxies, the \"Green valley\" is populated by\ncentrally-quiescent and mixed systems, \"Red sequence\" by the nearly- and\nfully-retired objects. Generally, galaxies that host a weak or strong AGN show\nproperties, comparable to the non-active counterparts at the same quenching\nstages, except for the AGN-hosting star-forming systems. The degree of the\nstar-formation quenching increases along the present emission-line pattern\nsequence from star-forming to fully-retired. The proposed emission-line classes\nreinforce the \"inside-out\" quenching scenario, which foresees that the\nsuppression of the star-formation begins from the central regions of the\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 11:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

The\nbroad peak structure between the $\\pi\\Sigma$ and $\\bar{K} N$ thresholds\nregarded to be $\\Lambda(1405)$ is explained by a single pair with a resonant\nenergy of 1420 $\\pm$ 1 MeV, and a half width of 48 $\\pm$ 2 MeV, which is\nconsistent with the single-pole picture of $\\Lambda(1405)$. We conclude that\nthe Uniformized Mittag-Leffler expansion turns out to be a very powerful method\nto obtain resonance energy, width and residues from the near-threshold\nspectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 12:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

Similar to wedge holography, the cone\nholography can be obtained by taking the zero-volume limit of holographic\ndefect CFT. Remarkably, it can be regarded as a holographic dual of the edge\nmodes on the defects. For one class of solutions, we prove that the cone\nholography is equivalent to AdS/CFT, by showing that the classical\ngravitational action and thus the CFT partition function in large N limit are\nthe same for the two theories. In general, cone holography and AdS/CFT are\ndifferent due to the infinite towers of massive Kaluza-Klein modes on the\nbranes. We test cone holography by studying Weyl anomaly, Entanglement/R\\'enyi\nentropy and correlation functions, and find good agreements between the\nholographic and the CFT results. In particular, the c-theorem is obeyed by cone\nholography. These are strong supports for our proposal. We discuss two kinds of\nboundary conditions, the mixed boundary condition and Neumann boundary\ncondition, and find that they both define a consistent theory of cone\nholography. We also analyze the mass spectrum on the brane and find that the\nlarger the tension is, the more continuous the mass spectrum is. The cone\nholography can be regarded as a generalization of the wedge holography, and it\nis closely related to the defect CFT, entanglement/R\\'enyi entropy and\nAdS/BCFT(dCFT).

When\npore fluids are present and drainage is insufficient, dilation leads to pore\npressure drops, which in turn lead to strengthening of the material. We\nconducted laboratory rock fracture experiments with direct in-situ fluid\npressure measurements which demonstrate that dynamic rupture propagation and\nfault slip can be stabilised (i.e., become quasi-static) by such a dilatancy\nstrengthening effect. We also observe that, for the same effective pressures\nbut lower pore fluid pressures, the stabilisation process may be arrested when\nthe pore fluid pressure approaches zero and vaporises, resulting in dynamic\nshear failure. In case of a stable rupture, we witness continued prolonged slip\nafter the main failure event that is the result of pore pressure recharge of\nthe fault zone. All our observations are quantitatively explained by a\nspring-slider model combining slip-weakening behaviour, slip-induced dilation,\nand pore fluid diffusion. Using our data in an inverse problem, we estimate the\nkey parameters controlling rupture stabilisation, fault dilation rate and fault\nzone storage. These estimates are used to make predictions for the pore\npressure drop associated with faulting, and where in the crust we may expect\ndilatancy stabilisation or vaporisation during earthquakes. For intact rock and\nwell consolidated faults, we expect strong dilatancy strengthening between 4\nand 6 km depth regardless of ambient pore pressure, and at greater depths when\nthe ambient pore pressure approaches lithostatic pressure. In the uppermost\npart of the crust ($<4$ km), we predict vaporisation of pore fluids that limits\ndilatancy strengthening.

The convective Reynolds\nstress is calculated using mixing length theory, accounting for a sharp\nsuppression of dissipation when the turnover timescale is larger than the tidal\nperiod. This yields tidal dissipation rates several orders of magnitude too\nsmall to account for the circularization periods of late-type binaries or the\ntidal dissipation factor of giant planets. Here, we argue that the above\ndescription is inconsistent, because fluctuations and mean flow should be\nidentified based on the timescale, not on the spatial scale, on which they\nvary. Therefore, the standard picture should be reversed, with the fluctuations\nbeing the tidal oscillations and the mean shear flow provided by the largest\nconvective eddies. We assume that energy is locally transferred from the tides\nto the convective flow. Using this assumption, we obtain values for the tidal\n$Q$ factor of Jupiter and Saturn and for the circularization periods of PMS\nbinaries in good agreement with observations. The timescales obtained with the\nequilibrium tide approximation are however still 40 times too large to account\nfor the circularization periods of late-type binaries. For these systems, shear\nin the tachocline or at the base of the convective zone may be the main cause\nof tidal dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 12:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

This paper extends the random walk model (Arora\net al., 2016a) of word embeddings to Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to\nderive a scoring function that evaluates the strength of a relation R between\ntwo entities h (head) and t (tail). Moreover, we show that marginal loss\nminimisation, a popular objective used in much prior work in KGE, follows\nnaturally from the log-likelihood ratio maximisation under the probabilities\nestimated from the KGEs according to our theoretical relationship. We propose a\nlearning objective motivated by the theoretical analysis to learn KGEs from a\ngiven knowledge graph. Using the derived objective, accurate KGEs are learnt\nfrom FB15K237 and WN18RR benchmark datasets, providing empirical evidence in\nsupport of the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 13:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

Because of the ultrashort pulse\nduration, the XFEL-produced plasma will be out of equilibrium at the beginning\nand even the electronic subsystem may not reach thermal equilibrium while\ninteracting with a femtosecond time-scale pulse. In the dense plasma, the\nionization potential depression (IPD) induced by the plasma environment plays a\ncrucial role for understanding and modeling microscopic dynamical processes.\nHowever, all theoretical approaches for IPD have been based on local thermal\nequilibrium (LTE) and it has been controversial to use LTE IPD models for the\nnonthermal situation.

Specifically, the latent\nheat (Lv) of water vapor is varied, so that for small Lv, water substance is\nessentially a passive tracer from a dynamical point of view. Despite the lack\nof SST gradients, a general circulation with Hadley and Ferrel cells is\nobserved for relatively stronger moist coupling. Organized precipitation\npatterns via equatorial waves appear to play a significant role in tropical\nascent, and along with the equatorial deformation radius, the Hadley cell width\nincreases with coupling strength. An abrupt switch to a much shallower tropical\ncell is noted when the system becomes completely passive. In all cases, the\nHadley cell is thermally indirect and is influenced by eddy fluxes which are\nstrong in the upper and lower troposphere. Moist static energy is transported\nequatorward in the tropics and a larger amount is directed poleward in the\nmidlatitudes. Transient extratropical activity is seen in the form of intense\nwarm-core vortices for strong coupling, and these systems become weaker and\nsmaller as Lv decreases. The drift of these moist vortices results in the\nobserved poleward energy transport in the midlatitudes. In the tropics,\nintraseasonal variability is dominant and systematically shifts to longer time\nperiods with stronger coupling. In fact, large-scale, low-frequency Kelvin\nwaves and MJO-like modes disappear as water vapor becomes passive in nature.\nFinally, extreme rainfall events associated with cyclonic storms vanish as\nwater vapor becomes dynamically inactive. Tropospheric heating due to a\nsaturation of the outgoing longwave radiation results in an increase in the\nstability of the atmosphere for strong coupling, and provides a plausible\nphysical mechanism for interpreting the behavior of precipitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 15:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Nevertheless, some\nmethods to handle other kinds of problems are briefly reviewed. The particle\nswarm optimization paradigm was inspired by previous simulations of the\ncooperative behaviour observed in social beings. It is a bottom-up, randomly\nweighted, population-based method whose ability to optimize emerges from local,\nindividual-to-individual interactions. As opposed to traditional methods, it\ncan deal with different problems with few or no adaptation due to the fact that\nit does profit from problem-specific features of the problem at issue but\nperforms a parallel, cooperative exploration of the search-space by means of a\npopulation of individuals. The main goal of this thesis consists of developing\nan optimizer that can perform reasonably well on most problems. Hence, the\ninfluence of the settings of the algorithm's parameters on the behaviour of the\nsystem is studied, some general-purpose settings are sought, and some\nvariations to the canonical version are proposed aiming to turn it into a more\ngeneral-purpose optimizer. Since no termination condition is included in the\ncanonical version, this thesis is also concerned with the design of some\nstopping criteria which allow the iterative search to be terminated if further\nsignificant improvement is unlikely, or if a certain number of time-steps are\nreached. In addition, some constraint-handling techniques are incorporated into\nthe canonical algorithm to handle inequality constraints. Finally, the\ncapabilities of the proposed general-purpose optimizers are illustrated by\noptimizing a few benchmark problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 09:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

The fact that the testing\ndata is heterogeneous enhances our findings.
