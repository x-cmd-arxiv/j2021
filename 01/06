Under standard assumptions on the parameters of the model (opening of\nthe wedge, angles of the reflections, drift), we study the algebraic and\ndifferential nature of the Laplace transform of this stationary distribution.\nWe derive necessary and sufficient conditions for this Laplace transform to be\nrational, algebraic, differentially finite or more generally differentially\nalgebraic. These conditions are explicit linear dependencies between the angles\nof the model.\n  A complicated integral expression for this Laplace transform has recently\nbeen obtained by two authors of this paper. In the differentially algebraic\ncase, we provide a simple, explicit integral-free expression in terms of a\nhypergeometric function. It specializes to earlier expressions in several\nclassical cases: the skew-symmetric case, the orthogonal reflections case and\nthe sum-of-exponential densities case (corresponding to the so-called\nDieker-Moriarty conditions on the parameters). This paper thus closes, in a\nsense, the quest of all ``simple'' cases.\n  To prove these results, we start from a functional equation that the Laplace\ntransform satisfies, to which we apply tools from diverse horizons. To\nestablish differential algebraicity, a key ingredient is Tutte's invariant\napproach, which originates in enumerative combinatorics. It allows us to\nexpress the Laplace transform (or its square) as a rational function of a\ncertain canonical invariant, a hypergeometric function in our context. To\nestablish differential transcendence, we turn the functional equation into a\ndifference equation and apply Galoisian results on the nature of the solutions\nto such equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 17:59:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 11:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

The existing localization method using sequential pseudorange\nmeasurements and a linear clock drift model for the TDPBS, namely LSPM-D, does\nnot compensate the position displacement caused by the UD movement and will\nresult in position error. In this paper, depending on the knowledge of the UD\nvelocity, we develop a set of optimal localization methods for different cases.\nFirst, for known UD velocity, we develop the optimal localization method,\nnamely LSPM-KVD, to compensate the movement-caused position error. We show that\nthe LSPM-D is a special case of the LSPM-KVD when the UD is stationary with\nzero velocity. Second, for the case with unknown UD velocity, we develop a\nmaximum likelihood (ML) method to jointly estimate the UD position and\nvelocity, namely LSPM-UVD.

We derive the Cramer-Rao lower\nbound (CRLB) for all three estimators and analyze their localization error\nperformance. We show that the position error of the LSPM-KVD increases as the\nassumed known velocity deviates from the true value. As expected, the LSPM-KVD\nhas the smallest position error while the LSPM-PVD and the LSPM-UVD are more\nrobust when the prior knowledge of the UD velocity is limited.

Given the reciprocal relationship between habit and behavior,\nchanging lifestyle behaviors (e.g., toothbrushing) is largely a task of\nbreaking old habits and creating new and healthy ones. Thus, representing\nusers' habit strengths can be very useful for behavior change support systems\n(BCSS), for example, to predict behavior or to decide when an intervention\nreaches its intended effect. However, habit strength is not directly observable\nand existing self-report measures are taxing for users. In this paper, built on\nrecent computational models of habit formation, we propose a method to enable\nintelligent systems to compute habit strength based on observable behavior. The\nhypothesized advantage of using computed habit strength for behavior prediction\nwas tested using data from two intervention studies, where we trained\nparticipants to brush their teeth twice a day for three weeks and monitored\ntheir behaviors using accelerometers. Through hierarchical cross-validation, we\nfound that for the task of predicting future brushing behavior, computed habit\nstrength clearly outperformed self-reported habit strength (in both studies)\nand was also superior to models based on past behavior frequency (in the larger\nsecond study). Our findings provide initial support for our theory-based\napproach of modeling user habits and encourages the use of habit computation to\ndeliver personalized and adaptive interventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 16:42:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

We measured the occurrence of radio halos as a function of the\ncluster mass and we compared it with the expectations of turbulent acceleration\nmodels. We found that more than the 90% of radio halos are in merging clusters\nand that their radio power correlates with the mass of the host clusters. The\ncorrelation shows a large dispersion. Interestingly, we showed that cluster\ndynamics contributes significantly to this dispersion with more disturbed\nclusters being more radio luminous. Clusters without radio halos are generally\nrelaxed and the upper limits to their diffuse emission lie below the\ncorrelation. We showed that the radio emissivity of clusters exhibits an\napparent bimodality, with the emissivity of radio halos being at least 5 times\nlarger than the non-emission associated with more relaxed clusters.

Regenerative bone scaffolds should ideally mimic aspects of the\ntissue's ECM over multiple length scales and enable surgical handling and\nfixation during implantation in vivo. Leveraging the knowledge gained with\nbioactive self-assembling peptides (SAPs) and SAP-enriched electrospun fibres,\nwe presented a cell free approach for promoting mineralisation via apatite\ndeposition and crystal growth, in vitro, of SAP-enriched nonwoven scaffolds.\nThe nonwoven scaffold was made by electrospinning poly(epsilon-caprolactone)\n(PCL) in the presence of either peptide P11-4 (Ac-QQRFEWEFEQQ-Am) or P11-8\n(Ac-QQRFOWOFEQQ-Am), in light of the polymer's fibre forming capability and its\nhydrolytic degradability as well as the well-known apatite nucleating\ncapability of SAPs. The 11-residue family of peptides (P11-X) has the ability\nto self-assemble into beta-sheet ordered structures at the nano-scale and to\ngenerate hydrogels at the macroscopic scale, some of which are capable of\npromoting biomineralisation due to their apatite-nucleating capability. Both\nvariants of SAP-enriched nonwoven used in this study were proven to be\nbiocompatible with murine fibroblasts and supported nucleation and growth of\napatite minerals in simulated body fluid (SBF) in vitro. The fibrous nonwoven\nprovided a structurally robust scaffold, with the capability to control SAP\nrelease behaviour. Up to 75% of P11-4 and 45% of P11-8 were retained in the\nfibres after 7-day incubation in aqueous solution at pH 7.4. The encapsulation\nof SAP in a nonwoven system with apatite-forming as well as localised and\nlong-term SAP delivery capabilities is appealing as a potential means of\nachieving cost-effective bone repair therapy for critical size defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 17:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

In\nthis paper, we propose a new method for 6D pose estimation refinement from RGB\nimages. To achieve high accuracy of the final estimate, the observation and a\nrendered model need to be aligned. Our main insight is that after the initial\npose estimate, it is important to pay attention to distinct spatial features of\nthe object in order to improve the estimation accuracy during alignment.\nFurthermore, parts of the object that are occluded in the image should be given\nless weight during the alignment process.

Anomalous events are often indicative of illegal activities such as\nfraud, identity theft, network intrusion, account takeover, and money\nlaundering. Financial anomaly detection use cases face serious challenges due\nto the dynamic nature of the underlying patterns especially in adversarial\nenvironments such as constantly changing fraud tactics. While retraining the\nmodels with the new patterns is absolutely essential; keeping up with the rapid\nchanges introduces other challenges as it moves the model away from older\npatterns or continuously grows the size of the training data. The resulting\ndata growth is hard to manage and it reduces the agility of the models'\nresponse to the latest attacks. Due to the data size limitations and the need\nto track the latest patterns, older time periods are often dropped in practice,\nwhich in turn, causes vulnerabilities.

Also, several new characterizations of the arithmetical modules are\ngiven. In the case when $R$ is Noetherian and $M$ is finitely generated,\nseveral characterizations of strongly irreducible submodules are included.\nAmong other things, it is shown that when $N$ is a submodule of $M$ such that\n$N:_RM$ is not a prime ideal, then $N$ is strongly irreducible if and only if\nthere exist submodule $L$ of $M$ and prime ideal $\\frak p$ of $R$ such that $N$\nis $\\frak p$-primary, $N\\subsetneqq L\\subseteq \\frak pM$ and for all submodules\n$K$ of $M$ either $K\\subseteq N$ or $L_{\\frak p}\\subseteq K_{\\frak p}$.

CHIPS1911+4455 was discovered in the Clusters Hiding in\nPlain Sight (CHiPS) survey, which sought to discover galaxy clusters with\nextreme central galaxies that were misidentified as isolated X-ray point\nsources in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. With new Chandra X-ray observations, we\nfind the core (r=10 kpc) entropy to be 17+2-9 keV cm^2, suggesting a strong\ncool core, which are typically found at the centers of relaxed clusters.\nHowever, the large-scale morphology of CHIPS1911+4455 is highly asymmetric,\npointing to a more dynamically active and turbulent cluster. Furthermore, the\nHubble images reveal a massive, filamentary starburst near the brightest\ncluster galaxy (BCG). We measure the star formation rate for the BCG to be\n140--190 Msun/yr, which is one of the highest rates measured in a central\ncluster galaxy to date. One possible scenario for CHIPS1911+4455 is that the\ncool core was displaced during a major merger and rapidly cooled, with cool,\nstar-forming gas raining back toward the core. This unique system is an\nexcellent case study for high-redshift clusters, where such phenomena are\nproving to be more common. Further studies of such systems will drastically\nimprove our understanding of the relation between cluster mergers and cooling,\nand how these fit in the bigger picture of active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nfeedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 19:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

The model is used to simulate Vertical\nDisplacement Events (VDEs) occurring in the COMPASS tokamak. Recent COMPASS\nexperiments have shown that the parallel halo current density at the\nplasma-wall interface is limited by the ion saturation current during\nVDE-induced disruptions. We show that usual MHD boundary conditions can lead to\nthe violation of this physical limit and we implement this current density\nlimitation through a boundary condition for the electrostatic potential.

Although the locations of dropout areas random, the\npatterns of SpatialDropout and DropBlock are manually designed and fixed. Here\nwe propose to learn the dropout patterns.

Low-rank MF methods have\ntraditionally attempted to exploit low-rank representations of linear kernels,\nwhich are kernel functions of the form $K(u,v) = v^T u$ for vectors $u$ and\n$v$. However, such linear kernels may not be able to capture low-rank behavior,\nand they may admit LF and HF kernels that are not similar. Such a situation\nrenders a naive approach to low-rank MF procedures ineffective. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel approach for the selection of a near-optimal kernel function\nfor use in low-rank MF methods. The proposed framework is a two-step strategy\nwherein: (1) hyperparameters of a library of kernel functions are optimized,\nand (2) a particular combination of the optimized kernels is selected, through\neither a convex mixture (Additive Kernels) or through a data-driven\noptimization (Adaptive Kernels). The two resulting methods for this generalized\nframework both utilize only the available inexpensive low-fidelity data and\nthus no evaluation of high-fidelity simulation model is needed until a kernel\nis chosen.

The majority of computer graphics applications nowadays are used to\noperate only in one of the above realities. The lack of applications across the\nXR spectrum is a real shortcoming.

Symplectic quantization considers an explicit\ndependence of the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ on an additional time variable,\nnamed \"proper time\" at variance with the coordinate time of relativity. The\nphysical meaning of proper time is to label the sequence of $g_{\\mu\\nu}$\nquantum fluctuations at a given point of the four-dimensional space-time\ncontinuum. For this reason symplectic quantization necessarily incorporates a\nnew degree of freedom, the derivative $\\dot{g}_{\\mu\\nu}$ of the metric field\nwith respect to proper time, corresponding to the conjugated momentum\n$\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}$. Symplectic quantization describes the quantum fluctuations of\ngravity by means of the symplectic dynamics generated by a generalized action\nfunctional $\\mathcal{A}[g_{\\mu\\nu},\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}] =\n\\mathcal{K}[g_{\\mu\\nu},\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}] - S[g_{\\mu\\nu}]$, playing formally the\nrole of a Hamilton function, where $S[g_{\\mu\\nu}]$ is the Einstein-Hilbert\naction and $\\mathcal{K}[g_{\\mu\\nu},\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}]$ is a new term including the\nkinetic degrees of freedom of the field.

Burst-induced SED\nchanges provide valuable information on a very intense phase of high-mass star\nformation. In mid-January 2019, a maser flare of the MYSO G358.93-0.03 was\nreported. ALMA and SMA imaging resolved the core of the star forming region and\nproved the association of the masers with the brightest continuum source MM1.\nHowever, no significant flux rise of the (sub)mm dust continuum was found.\nThus, we performed NIR imaging with GROND and IFU spectroscopy with FIFI-LS\naboard SOFIA to detect possible counterparts to the (sub)mm sources, and\ncompare their photometry to archival measurements. The comparison of pre-burst\nand burst SEDs is of crucial importance to judge whether a luminosity increase\ndue to the burst is present and if it triggered the maser flare. The FIR fluxes\nof MM1 measured with FIFI-LS exceed those from Herschel significantly, which\nclearly confirms the presence of an accretion burst. The second epoch data,\ntaken about 16 months later, still show increased fluxes. Our RT modeling\nyielded major burst parameters and suggests that the MYSO features a\ncircumstellar disk which might be transient. From the multi-epoch SEDs,\nconclusions on heating and cooling time-scales could be drawn. Circumstances of\nthe burst-induced maser relocation have been explored. The verification of the\naccretion burst from G358 is another confirmation that Class II methanol maser\nflares represent an alert for such events.

We have two objectives: (1) to incentivize\nforecasters to report truthfully and (2) to award the prize to the most\naccurate forecaster. Proper scoring rules incentivize truthful reporting if all\nforecasters are paid according to their scores. However, incentives become\ndistorted if only the best-scoring forecaster wins a prize, since forecasters\ncan often increase their probability of having the highest score by reporting\nmore extreme beliefs. In this paper, we introduce two novel forecasting\ncompetition mechanisms. Our first mechanism is incentive compatible and\nguaranteed to select the most accurate forecaster with probability higher than\nany other forecaster. Moreover, we show that in the standard single-event,\ntwo-forecaster setting and under mild technical conditions, no other\nincentive-compatible mechanism selects the most accurate forecaster with higher\nprobability. Our second mechanism is incentive compatible when forecasters'\nbeliefs are such that information about one event does not lead to belief\nupdates on other events, and it selects the best forecaster with probability\napproaching 1 as the number of events grows. Our notion of incentive\ncompatibility is more general than previous definitions of dominant strategy\nincentive compatibility in that it allows for reports to be correlated with the\nevent outcomes. Moreover, our mechanisms are easy to implement and can be\ngeneralized to the related problems of outputting a ranking over forecasters\nand hiring a forecaster with high accuracy on future events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 22:31:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 21:17:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

It always holds whenever $G$ is amenable.\nRecently it was shown that for R.\\,Thompson's group $F$ the converse is also\ntrue. So the famous amenability problem for $F$ is equivalent to the question\non the Ore condition for the group ring of the same group.\n  It is easy to see that the problem on the Ore condition for $K[F]$ is\nequivalent to the same property for the monoid ring $K[M]$, where $M$ is the\nmonoid of positive elements of $F$.

The\nstationary-state roughness is obtained analytically in the small-$n_c$ regime\nwith weak non-linear coupling wherein the controlled growth process is found to\nresult in Edwards--Wilkinson dynamics.

However, recent ALMA observations suggest\nthat dust is highly settled, implying weak turbulence. Motivated by such\ntension, we carry out 3D stratified local simulations of self-gravitating\ndisks, focusing on settling of dust particles in actively accreting disks. We\nfind that gravitationally unstable disks can have moderately high accretion\nrates while maintaining a relatively thin dust disk for two reasons. First,\naccretion stress from the self-gravitating spirals (self-gravity stress) can be\nstronger than the stress from turbulence (Reynolds stress) by a factor of 5-20.\nSecond, the strong gravity from the gas to the dust decreases the dust scale\nheight by another factor of $\\sim 2$. Furthermore, the turbulence is slightly\nanisotropic, producing a larger Reynolds stress than the vertical dust\ndiffusion coefficient. Thus, gravitoturbulent disks have unusually high\nvertical Schmidt numbers ($Sc_z$) if we scale the total accretion stress with\nthe vertical diffusion coefficient (e.g. $Sc_z\\sim$ 10-100). The reduction of\nthe dust scale height by the gas gravity, should also operate in\ngravitationally stable disks ($Q>$1). Gravitational forces between particles\nbecome more relevant for the concentration of intermediate dust sizes, forming\ndense clouds of dust. After comparing with HL Tau observations, our results\nsuggest that self-gravity and gravity among different disk components could be\ncrucial for solving the conflict between the protoplanetary disk accretion and\ndust settling, at least at the early stages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 06:37:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 17:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

An open future means that the value observed when measuring a\nphysical quantity in the future is not determined. At first glance, quantum\nmechanics seems to support the open future thesis, because it cannot always\npredict measurement value with certainty. However, many interpretations regard\nquantum mechanics as deterministic. These interpretations only suggest that the\nquantum mechanical world can be deterministic. I argue that, although quantum\nmechanics cannot predict the future with certainty, the quantum mechanical\nworld must be deterministic, and the value observed by the observer is\ndetermined. I examine the following two cases: (1) the wave-function completely\ndescribes the physical state and (2) the wave-function does not describe the\nphysical state.

The overall\nbidirectional end-to-end transmission takes place in four phases, which include\nboth energy harvesting (EH) and information transfer. A non-linear energy\nharvester with a hybrid SWIPT scheme is adopted in which both power-splitting\nand time-switching EH techniques are used.

For both types of models, we find\nthat the single-particle band gaps are renormalized by the interaction in\naccordance with expectations employing general field theoretical arguments.\nWhile interaction induced effective edge states can be found in the local\nsingle-particle spectral function close to a boundary, the characteristics of\nthe boundary charge are not modified by the interaction.

In electron-doped\ncuprates, it is still in paradox about the interplay among different electronic\nstates in quantum perturbations, especially between superconducting and\nmagnetic states. Here, we report a systematic transport study on\ncation-optimized La2-xCexCuO4 (x = 0.10) thin films in high magnetic fields. We\nfind an AF quantum phase transition near 60 T, where the Hall number jumps from\nnH =-x to nH = 1-x, resembling the change of nH at the AF boundary (xAF = 0.14)\ntuned by Ce doping. In the AF region a spin dependent state manifesting\nanomalous positive magnetoresistance is observed, which is closely related to\nsuperconductivity. Once the AF state is suppressed by magnetic field, a\npolarized ferromagnetic state is predicted, reminiscent of the recently\nreported ferromagnetic state at the quantum endpoint of the superconducting\ndome by Ce doping. The magnetic field that drives phase transitions in a\nsimilar but distinct manner to doping thereby provides a unique perspective to\nunderstand the quantum criticality of electron-doped cuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 08:56:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 09:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

For\nthe wavenumber-frequency spectra of the total wall pressure fluctuations, a\nvalley-like behavior of contour lines in the sub-convective region is found,\nwhich may be linked to the Kraichnan-Phillips theorem. For the decomposition of\nthe wall pressure spectra, it is commonly assumed in previous studies that the\ncross spectral density (CSD) between the rapid and slow components of the wall\npressure fluctuations can be neglected.

HERMES securely outsources operations of vehicle\naccess token generation to a set of untrusted servers. It builds on an earlier\nproposal, namely SePCAR [1], and extends the system design for improved\nefficiency and scalability. To cater to system and user needs for secure and\nprivate computations, HERMES utilizes and combines several cryptographic\nprimitives with secure multiparty computation efficiently. It conceals secret\nkeys of vehicles and transaction details from the servers, including vehicle\nbooking details, access token information, and user and vehicle identities. It\nalso provides user accountability in case of disputes. Besides, we provide\nsemantic security analysis and prove that HERMES meets its security and privacy\nrequirements. Last but not least, we demonstrate that HERMES is efficient and,\nin contrast to SePCAR, scales to a large number of users and vehicles, making\nit practical for real-world deployments. We build our evaluations with two\ndifferent multiparty computation protocols: HtMAC-MiMC and CBC-MAC-AES. Our\nresults demonstrate that HERMES with HtMAC-MiMC requires only approx 1,83 ms\nfor generating an access token for a single-vehicle owner and approx 11,9 ms\nfor a large branch of rental companies with over a thousand vehicles.

A recently developed test based on summing squared CUSUM statistics\nover all times is shown to have realistic Type I errors and superior detection\npower.

In previous work, we have developed\nspatio-kinematic and radiative transfer models to reproduce the observed Balmer\nline variability and derive the spatio-kinematic structure of the jet and its\nmass-loss rate. Here, we apply our jet model to five post-AGB binaries with\ndistinct H{\\alpha} line variability and diverse orbital properties. Our models\nfit the H{\\alpha} line variations very well. We estimate jet mass-loss rates\nbetween 10-8 Mdot yr-1 and 10-4 Mdot yr-1 , from which we deduce accretion\nrates onto the companion between 10-7 Mdot yr-1 and 10-3 Mdot yr-1 . These\naccretion rates are somewhat higher than can be comfortably explained with\nreasonable sources of accretion, but we argue that the circumbinary disc in\nthese systems is most-likely the source feeding the accretion, although\naccretion from the post-AGB star cannot be ruled out. The diversity of the\nvariability in the five objects is due to their wide ejection cones combined\nwith a range of viewing angles, rather than inherent differences between the\nobjects. The nature of the observations does not let us easily distinguish\nwhich jet launching model (stellar jet, disc wind, or X-wind) should be\nfavoured.

However, functional\nconnectivity are considered to be multi-layered, while traditional machine\nlearning based on individual models not only are limited in performance, but\nalso fail to extract multi-dimensional and multi-layered information from brain\nnetwork. Methods: In this study, inspired by multi-layer brain network\nstructure, we propose a new method namely Weighted Ensemble-model and Network\nAnalysis, which combines the machine learning and graph theory for improved\nfluid intelligence prediction. Firstly, functional connectivity analysis and\ngraphical theory were jointly employed. The functional connectivity and\ngraphical indices computed using the preprocessed fMRI data were then all fed\ninto auto-encoder parallelly for feature extraction to predict the fluid\nintelligence. In order to improve the performance, tree regression and ridge\nregression model were automatically stacked and fused with weighted values.\nFinally, layers of auto-encoder were visualized to better illustrate the\nconnectome patterns, followed by the evaluation of the performance to justify\nthe mechanism of brain functions.

Moreover, it\ntakes multiple repeated tests to determine the size of the dual window, which\nneeds to be reset once the dataset changes and cannot be identified in advance\nwith prior knowledge. To alleviate this problem, we proposed a novel ensemble\nand random collaborative representation-based detector (ERCRD) for HAD, which\ncomprises two closely related stages.

Secondly,\nensemble learning is employed to refine the multiple results of RCRD, which act\nas various \"experts\" providing abundant complementary information to better\ntarget different anomalies.

In this paper, we propose an\nonline multi-object tracking framework based on a hierarchical single-branch\nnetwork to solve this problem. Specifically, the proposed single-branch network\nutilizes an improved Hierarchical Online In-stance Matching (iHOIM) loss to\nexplicitly model the inter-relationship between object detection and Re-ID.

Dynamic variants allow points to be added or\nremoved, one at a time. To support more powerful updates, we introduce the Grid\nRange class of data structure problems over integer arrays in one or more\ndimensions. These problems allow range updates (such as filling all cells in a\nrange with a constant) and queries (such as finding the sum or maximum of\nvalues in a range). In this work, we consider these operations along with\nupdates that replace each cell in a range with the minimum, maximum, or sum of\nits existing value, and a constant. In one dimension, it is known that segment\ntrees can be leveraged to facilitate any $n$ of these operations in\n$\\tilde{O}(n)$ time overall. Other than a few specific cases, until now, higher\ndimensional variants have been largely unexplored.\n  We show that no truly subquadratic time algorithm can support certain pairs\nof these updates simultaneously without falsifying several popular conjectures.\nOn the positive side, we show that truly subquadratic algorithms can be\nobtained for variants induced by other subsets. We provide two approaches to\ndesigning such algorithms that can be generalised to online and higher\ndimensional settings. First, we give almost-tight $\\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ time\nalgorithms for single-update variants where the update operation distributes\nover the query operation. Second, for other variants, we provide a general\nframework for reducing to instances with a special geometry. Using this, we\nshow that $O(m^{3/2-\\epsilon})$ time algorithms for counting paths and walks of\nlength 2 and 3 between vertex pairs in sparse graphs imply truly subquadratic\ndata structures for certain variants; to this end, we give an\n$\\tilde{O}(m^{(4\\omega-1)/(2\\omega+1)}) = O(m^{1.478})$ time algorithm for\ncounting simple 3-paths between vertex pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 13:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-07"}

While recently multiple deep\nlearning approaches for fast assessment of earthquakes have been proposed, they\nusually rely on either seismic records from a single station or from a fixed\nset of seismic stations. Here we introduce a new model for real-time magnitude\nand location estimation using the attention based transformer networks. Our\napproach incorporates waveforms from a dynamically varying set of stations and\noutperforms deep learning baselines in both magnitude and location estimation\nperformance. Furthermore, it outperforms a classical magnitude estimation\nalgorithm considerably and shows promising performance in comparison to a\nclassical localization algorithm. In this work, we furthermore conduct a\ncomprehensive study of the requirements on training data, the training\nprocedures and the typical failure modes using three diverse and large scale\ndata sets. Our analysis gives several key insights. First, we can precisely\npinpoint the effect of large training data; for example, a four times larger\ntraining set reduces the required time for real time assessment by a factor of\nfour. Second, the basic model systematically underestimates large magnitude\nevents. This issue can be mitigated by incorporating events from other regions\ninto the training through transfer learning. Third, location estimation is\nhighly precise in areas with sufficient training data, but is strongly degraded\nfor events outside the training distribution. Our analysis suggests that these\ncharacteristics are not only present for our model, but for most deep learning\nmodels for fast assessment published so far.

We then discovered a weak magnetic field at its surface using\nspectropolarimetry. Aims and Methods: We followed up our investigations on\nPollux first using ESPaDOnS at CFHT and then Narval at TBL to obtain Stokes I\nand Stokes V spectra to study their variations for a duration of 4.25 years,\nthat is, for more than two periods of about 590 d of the RV variations. We used\nthe least-squares deconvolution (LSD) profiles to measure the longitudinal\nmagnetic field and to perform a Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) investigation.\nResults: The longitudinal magnetic field of Pollux is found to vary with a\nsinusoidal behavior and a period similar to that of the RV variations. From the\nZDI investigation a rotation period of Pollux is determined to be equal to\n660+/-15 days and possibly different than the period of variations of the RV.\nAs to the magnetic topology, the poloidal component is dominant and almost\npurely dipolar with an inclination of 10.5{\\deg} of the dipole with respect to\nthe rotation axis. The mean strength of the surface magnetic field is 0.44 G.\nConclusions: As to the origin of the magnetic field of Pollux, we favor the\nhypothesis that it is maintained through contemporaneous dynamo action. Pollux\nappears as the representative of a class of slowly rotating and weakly magnetic\nG-K red giants. To explain the sinusoidal RV variations of Pollux, two\nscenarios are proposed. If the RV period is different from the rotation period,\nthe observed periodic RV variations are due to the hosted planet and the\ncontribution of Pollux magnetic activity is not significantly detected. In the\npeculiar case in which the two periods are equal, we cannot discard the\npossibility that the activity of Pollux could explain the total RV variations\nand that the planet hypothesis would appear unnecessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 13:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Particular emphasis\nis placed on the age of each system, which is a central parameter in\ninterpreting direct imaging observations. We implement a novel scheme for age\ndating based on kinematic sub-structures within Sco-Cen, which complements and\nexpands upon previous age determinations in the literature. We also present\ninitial results from the first epoch observations, including the detections of\nten stellar companions, of which six were previously unknown. All planetary\ncandidates in the survey will need follow up in second epoch observations,\nwhich are part of the allocated observational programme and will be executed in\nthe near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 13:57:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

The proposed algorithm uses a single convolutional\nneural network to predict the probabilities of finger class and positions of\nfingertips in one forward propagation. Instead of directly regressing the\npositions of fingertips from the fully connected layer, the ensemble of the\nposition of fingertips is regressed from the fully convolutional network.\nSubsequently, the ensemble average is taken to regress the final position of\nfingertips. Since the whole pipeline uses a single network, it is significantly\nfast in computation. Experimental results show that the proposed method\noutperforms the existing fingertip detection approaches including the Direct\nRegression and the Heatmap-based framework.

Trions and excitons in doped two-dimensional (2D) materials\nare not independent excitations but are strongly coupled as a result of Coulomb\ninteractions. When excitons in doped 2D materials are also strongly coupled\nwith light inside an optical waveguide, the resulting polariton states are\ncoherent superpositions of exciton, trion, and photon states. We realize these\nexciton-trion-polaritons by coupling an electron-doped monolayer of\ntwo-dimensional material MoSe2 to the optical mode in a photonic crystal\nwaveguide.

To promote the understanding to contrastive learning, this paper\nfirst theoretically shows a connection to maximization of mutual information\n(MI). Our result indicates that density ratio estimation is necessary and\nsufficient for maximization of MI under some conditions. Thus, contrastive\nlearning related to density ratio estimation as done in popular objective\nfunctions can be interpreted as maximizing MI. Next, with the density ratio, we\nestablish new recovery conditions for the latent source components in nonlinear\nindependent component analysis (ICA).

Goals, however, involve a high\nelement of chance and thus past results often do not reflect the performances\nof the teams. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that accounting\nfor other match events such as shots at goal can provide a better indication of\nthe relative strengths of two teams than the number of goals scored. Forecast\nmodels based on this information have been shown to be successful in\noutperforming those based purely on match results. A notable weakness, however,\nis that this approach does not take into account differences in the probability\nof shot success among teams. A team that is more likely to score from a shot\nwill need fewer shots to win a match, on average. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple parametric model to predict the probability of a team scoring, given it\nhas taken a shot at goal. We show that the resulting forecasts are able to\noutperform a model assuming an equal probability of shot success among all\nteams. We then show that the model can be combined with predictions of the\nnumber of shots achieved by each team, and can increase the skill of forecasts\nof both the match outcome and of whether the total number of goals in a match\nwill exceed 2.5. We assess the performance of the forecasts alongside two\nbetting strategies and find mixed evidence for improved performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 15:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-07"}

The spatial dissemination of droplets varies\naccording to their initial velocity. After a short literature review, our goal\nwas to determine the velocity of the exhaled air during vocal exercises.\nMethods A propylene glycol cloud produced by 2 e-cigarettes' users allowed\nvisualization of the exhaled air emitted during vocal exercises. Airflow\nvelocities were measured during the first 200 ms of a long exhalation, a\nsustained vowel /a/ and varied vocal exercises. For the long exhalation and the\nsustained vowel /a/, the decrease of airflow velocity was measured until 3 s.\nResults were compared with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study using\nboundary conditions consistent with our experimental study. Results Regarding\nthe production of vowels, higher velocities were found in loud and whispered\nvoices than in normal voice. Voiced consonants like /3/ or /v/ generated higher\nvelocities than vowels. Some voiceless consonants, e.g., /t/ generated high\nvelocities, but long exhalation had the highest velocities. Semi-occluded vocal\ntract exercises generated faster airflow velocities than loud speech, with a\ndecreased velocity during voicing. The initial velocity quickly decreased as\nwas shown during a long exhalation or a sustained vowel /a/. Velocities were\nconsistent with the CFD data. Conclusion Initial velocity of the exhaled air is\na key factor influencing droplets trajectory. Our study revealed that vocal\nexercises produce a slower airflow than long exhalation.

Interaction of matters is\nphenomenologically described by gauge theory of strong, electromagnetic, weak\nand gravitational interactions. In electro-weak theory, left handed leptons\n${l}_L$ and neutrino ${\\mathcal \\nu}_L$, right handed leptons ${l}_R$ and left\nhanded quarks $u_L, d_L$ and right handed quarks $u_R, d_R$ follow $SU(2)\\times\nU(1)$ symmetry. Charge of leptons and quarks define hypercharge $Y$, and via\nHiggs mechanism $SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$ symmetry forms $U(1)_{em}$ symmetry. In\norder to describe Hadron dynamics properly, embedding of 4-dimensional space to\n5-dimensional space was tried in lattice simulations, and in light front\nholographic QCD (LFHQCD) approach in which conformally symmetric light-front\ndynamics without ghost are embedded in $AdS_5$, and a parameter that fixes a\nmass scale was chosen from the Principle of Maximum Conformality. Coulomb or\nLandau gauge fixed Faddeev-Popov Yang-Mills field equation is known to have the\nGribov ambiguity, and tunneling between vacua between different topological\nstructures was proposed by van Baal and collaborators. The symmetry of three\ncolors can be assigned three vectors of quaternion ${\\bf H}$, whose\nmultiplication on $2\\times 2$ matrices of Dirac spinors on ${\\bf S}^3$ induces\ntransformations. Instantons or sphalerons whose presence is expected from\nconformal equivalence of ${\\bf S}^3\\times {\\bf R}$ to ${\\bf R}^4$ are reviewed.\nAn extension of the dynamics embedded in complex projective space is also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 04:26:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-03"}

Quaternions were used in the solution of\n4-dimensional Dirac equation in QED, and also in solutions of Yang-Mills\nequation in QCD as elements of noncommutative geometry. We present how\nquaternions are formulated in Clifford Algebra, how it is used in explaining\nrotation group in symplectic vector space and parallel transformation in\nholonomic dynamics.
