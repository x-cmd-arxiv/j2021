To mitigate the impact of such failures, we introduce a\nresilient VI (RVI) that can recover individual VI components from failure,\ncaused by hardware or software faults, transparently to the hosted virtual\nmachines (VMs). Much of the focus is on the ReHype mechanism for recovery from\nhypervisor failures, that can lead to state corruption and to inconsistencies\namong the states of system components. ReHype's implementation for the Xen\nhypervisor was done incrementally, using fault injection results to identify\nsources of critical corruption and inconsistencies. This implementation\ninvolved 900 LOC, with memory space overhead of 2.1MB. Fault injection\ncampaigns, with a variety of fault types, show that ReHype can successfully\nrecover, in less than 750ms, from over 88% of detected hypervisor failures. In\naddition to ReHype, recovery mechanisms for the other VI components are\ndescribed. The overall effectiveness of our RVI is evaluated hosting a Web\nservice application, on a cluster of VMs. With faults in any VI component, for\nover 87% of detected failures, our recovery mechanisms allow services provided\nby the application to be continuously maintained despite the resulting failures\nof VI components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2021 22:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

Existing studies have investigated\nthe behaviour and geometry of immiscible fluid flow in this setting, where the\ninjected fluid displaces the resident fluid, forming a sharp interface between\nthe two. The present study extends analytical solutions to include mechanical\ndispersion of the interface. The solutions are inverted to solve for time as a\nfunction of position (r,z), giving each position in the aquifer an intersection\ntime corresponding to the moment the travelling interface intersects a point of\ninterest. The set of (r0,z0) positions which share an intersection time are\ntreated as dummy variables that represent an 'effective surface' and are\nintegrated over to solve for the velocity field within the aquifer. Using this\nvelocity field, the concentration profile resulting from mechanical dispersion\ncan be found analytically.It is shown that the concentration of the injected\nfluid smoothly decays around the position of the interface from immiscible\nsolutions, allowing for the injected fluid to be present in detectable\nquantities beyond the extent of these interfaces.

These surveys\ncan trade off subsurface information for efficiency/cost - creating a problem\nof \"missing seismic data\" that can greatly hinder subsequent processing and\ninterpretation. Reconstruction of regularly sampled dense data from highly\nsparse, irregular data can therefore aid in processing and interpretation of\nthese far sparser, more efficient seismic surveys. Here, two methods are\ncompared to solve the reconstruction problem in both space-time and\nwavenumber-frequency domain. This requires an operator that maps sparse to\ndense data: the operator is generally unknown, being the inverse of a known\ndata sampling operator. As such, here the deterministic inversion is\nefficiently solved by least squares optimisation using a numerically efficient\nPython-based linear operator representation. An alternative approach is\nprobabilistic and uses deep learning. Here, two deep learning architectures are\nbenchmarked against each other and the deterministic approach; a Recurrent\nInference Machine (RIM), which is designed specifically to solve inverse\nproblems given known forward operators, and the well-known U-Net. The trained\ndeep learning networks are capable of successfully mapping sparse to dense\nseismic data for a range of different datasets and decimation percentages,\nthereby significantly reducing spatial aliasing in the wavenumber-frequency\ndomain. The deterministic inversion on the contrary, could not reconstruct the\nmissing data and thus did not reduce the undesired spatial aliasing.

Using the full-$GW$ method, the effect of EEI and temperature on the\nvalence and conduction band extrema and band gap are studied. The lifetime of\ncarriers with temperature are estimated at these band extrema. At 300 K,\nestimated value of lifetime at VBM (CBM) is $\\sim$1.91 x10$^{-14}s$ ($\\sim$2.05\nx10$^{-14}s$). The estimated ground state band gap considering EEI is $\\sim$378\nmeV. Next, the effect of EPI on the lifetime of electrons and phonons with\ntemperature are discussed. The comparison of two electron lifetimes suggests\nthat EEI should be considered in transport calculations along with EPI. The\naverage acoustic, optical and overall phonon lifetimes due to EPI are studied\nwith temperature. Further, the effect of PPI is studied by computing average\nphonon lifetime for acoustic and optical phonon branches. The lifetime of the\nacoustic phonons are higher compared to optical phonons which indicates\nacoustic phonons contribute more to lattice thermal conductivity\n($\\kappa_{ph}$). The comparison of phonon lifetime due to EPI and PPI suggests\nthat, above 500 K EPI is the dominant phonon scattering mechanism and cannot be\nignored in $\\kappa_{ph}$ calculations.

Such networks help\nanswer questions such as \"How many packages have dependencies to packages with\nknown security issues?\" or \"What are the most used packages?\". However, an\noverlooked aspect in existing studies is that manifest-inferred relationships\ndo not necessarily examine the actual usage of these dependencies in source\ncode. To better model dependencies between packages, we developed Pr\\\"azi, an\napproach combining manifests and call graphs of packages. Pr\\\"azi constructs a\ndependency network at the more fine-grained function-level, instead of at the\nmanifest level. This paper discusses a prototypical Pr\\\"azi implementation for\nthe popular system programming language Rust. We use Pr\\\"azi to characterize\nRust's package repository, Cratesio, at the function level and perform a\ncomparative study with metadata-based networks. Our results show that\nmetadata-based networks generalize how packages use their dependencies. Using\nPr\\\"azi, we find packages call only 40% of their resolved dependencies, and\nthat manual analysis of 34 cases reveals that not all packages use a dependency\nthe same way. We argue that researchers and practitioners interested in\nunderstanding how developers or programs use dependencies should account for\nits context -- not the sum of all resolved dependencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2021 19:10:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 13:31:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 09:07:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 08:58:41 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 11:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

Additionally,\nrecent research has shown that existing anti-forensic attacks against forensic\nCNNs have poor transferability, i.e. they are unable to fool other forensic\nCNNs that were not explicitly used during training. In this paper, we propose a\nnew anti-forensic attack framework designed to remove forensic traces left by a\nvariety of manipulation operations.

This work identifies a\ndecentralized coded caching scheme -- under the assumption of uncoded placement\n-- for shared cache network, where each cache serves multiple users. Each user\nhas access to only a single cache and the number of caches is less than or\nequal to the number of users. For this setting, we derive the optimal\nworst-case delivery time for any user-to-cache association profile where each\nsuch profile describes the number of users served by each cache. The optimality\nis shown using an index-coding based converse. Further, we improve the delivery\nscheme to accommodate redundant demands. Also, an optimal linear error\ncorrecting delivery scheme is proposed for the worst-case demand scenario.\nNext, we consider the Least Recently Sent (LRS) online coded caching scheme\nwhere the caches need to be updated based on the sequence of demands made by\nthe users. Cache update happens if any of the demanded file was not partially\ncached at the users. The update is done by replacing the least recently sent\nfile with the new file. But, the least recently sent file need not be unique.\nIn that case, there needs to be some ordering of the files which are getting\npartially cached, or else centralized coordination would have to be assumed\nwhich does not exist. If each user removes any of the least recently used files\nat random, then the next delivery phase will not serve the purpose.

HyCoR derives from two insights regarding replication mechanisms: 1)\ndeterministic replay can overcome a key disadvantage of checkpointing alone --\nunacceptably long delays of outputs to clients, and 2) checkpointing can\novercome a key disadvantage of active replication with deterministic replay\nalone -- vulnerability to even rare replay failures due to an untracked\nnondeterministic events. With HyCoR, the primary sends periodic checkpoints to\nthe backup and logs the outcomes of sources of nondeterminism. Outputs to\nclients are delayed only by the short time it takes to send the corresponding\nlog to the backup. Upon primary failure, the backup replays only the short\ninterval since the last checkpoint, thus minimizing the window of\nvulnerability. HyCoR includes a \"best effort\" mechanism that results in a high\nrecovery rate even in the presence of data races, as long as their rate is low.\nThe evaluation includes measurement of the recovery rate and recovery latency\nbased on fault injection. On average, HyCoR delays responses to clients by less\nthan 1ms and recovers in less than 1s.

Deep learning-based supervised algorithms\nachieve very good perforamnce in BGS, however, most of these algorithms are\noptimized for either a specific video or a group of videos, and their\nperformance decreases dramatically when applied to unseen videos. Recently,\nseveral papers addressed this problem and proposed video-agnostic supervised\nBGS algorithms.

One important and interesting problem is to\ncombine image classification and restoration tasks to improve the performance\nof CNN-based classification networks on degraded images.

The affine network regresses the 3D affine matrix based on a\ncorrelation loss function that enforces global similarity.

GST\nselectively utilizes block-circulant compression to maintain a high weight\ncompression ratio during all iterations of DRL training and dynamically adapt\ntarget sparsity through reward-aware pruning for stable training. Thanks to the\nfeatures, GST achieves a 25 \\%p $\\sim$ 41.5 \\%p higher average compression\nratio than the iterative pruning method without reward drop in Mujoco\nHalfcheetah-v2 and Mujoco humanoid-v2 environment with TD3 training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2021 05:52:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

The\nchannel-spatial attention mechanisms, which focus on the discriminative\nchannels and regions simultaneously, have significantly improved the\nclassification performance.

However, complex\nnetwork architectures challenge efficient real-time deployment and require\nsignificant computation resources and energy costs. These challenges can be\novercome through optimizations such as network compression. Network compression\ncan often be realized with little loss of accuracy. In some cases accuracy may\neven improve. This paper provides a survey on two types of network compression:\npruning and quantization. Pruning can be categorized as static if it is\nperformed offline or dynamic if it is performed at run-time. We compare pruning\ntechniques and describe criteria used to remove redundant computations. We\ndiscuss trade-offs in element-wise, channel-wise, shape-wise, filter-wise,\nlayer-wise and even network-wise pruning. Quantization reduces computations by\nreducing the precision of the datatype. Weights, biases, and activations may be\nquantized typically to 8-bit integers although lower bit width implementations\nare also discussed including binary neural networks. Both pruning and\nquantization can be used independently or combined. We compare current\ntechniques, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, present compressed network\naccuracy results on a number of frameworks, and provide practical guidance for\ncompressing networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2021 08:21:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 03:39:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

The difficulty is\nthat the coupling among multiple users' channels makes the channel estimation\ndeviate from widely-used tensor decompositions. It gives a non-standard tensor\ndecomposition format that has not been well tackled. To overcome this\nchallenge, besides directly fitting the new tensor model for channel estimation\nto the wireless data via block coordinate descent (BCD) method, which is prone\nto the overfitting of noises or requires regularization parameter tuning, we\nfurther propose a novel tuning-free channel estimation algorithm that can\nautomatically control the channel model complexity and thus effectively avoid\nthe overfitting.

The Markov randomization/sanitization scheme\n$P_{Y|X}(x|x') = P_{Y|S,X}(x|s,x')$ is obtained by solving linear equations.\nThe optimal non-Markov sanitization, the transition probability\n$P_{Y|S,X}(x|s,x')$ that depends on $S$, can be determined by maximizing the\ndata utility subject to linear equality constraints. We compute the solution\nfor two linear utility function: the expected distance and total variance\ndistance. It is shown that the non-Markov randomization significantly improves\ndata utility and the marginal probability $P_X(x)$ remains the same after the\nlinear sanitization method: $P_Y(x) = P_X(x), \\forall x \\in \\mathcal{X}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2021 11:18:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 10:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

In this regard,\nwe aim to replicate such kind of adaptability in legged robots through a\nSpiking Central Pattern Generator. This Spiking Central Pattern Generator\ngenerates different locomotion (rhythmic) patterns which are driven by an\nexternal stimulus, that is, the output of a Force Sensitive Resistor connected\nto the robot to provide feedback. The Spiking Central Pattern Generator\nconsists of a network of five populations of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons\ndesigned with a specific topology in such a way that the rhythmic patterns can\nbe generated and driven by the aforementioned external stimulus. Therefore, the\nlocomotion of the end robotic platform (any-legged robot) can be adapted to the\nterrain by using any sensor as input. The Spiking Central Pattern Generator\nwith adaptive learning has been numerically validated at software and hardware\nlevel, using the Brian 2 simulator and the SpiNNaker neuromorphic platform for\nthe latest. In particular, our experiments clearly show an adaptation in the\noscillation frequencies between the spikes produced in the populations of the\nSpiking Central Pattern Generator while the input stimulus varies. To validate\nthe robustness and adaptability of the Spiking Central Pattern Generator, we\nhave performed several tests by variating the output of the sensor.

In grant-free URLLC,\nprecise allocation of different pilot resources to different users that share\nthe same time-frequency resource is essential for the next generation NodeB\n(gNB) to exactly identify those users under access collision and to maintain\nprecise channel estimation required for reliable data transmission. However,\nthis process easily suffers from attacks on pilots. We in this paper propose a\nquantum learning based nonrandom superimposed coding method to encode and\ndecode pilots on multidimensional resources, such that the uncertainty of\nattacks can be learned quickly and eliminated precisely. Particularly,\nmultiuser pilots for uplink access are encoded as distinguishable subcarrier\nactivation patterns (SAPs) and gNB decodes pilots of interest from observed\nSAPs, a superposition of SAPs from access users, by joint design of attack mode\ndetection and user activity detection though a quantum learning network (QLN).\nWe found that the uncertainty lies in the identification process of codeword\ndigits from the attacker, which can be always modelled as a black-box model,\nresolved by a quantum learning algorithm and quantum circuit. Novel analytical\nclosed-form expressions of failure probability are derived to characterize the\nreliability of this URLLC system with short packet transmission.

The chief goal is to characterize the energy levels of\nthis system by analytical methods and the significance of this study arises\nfrom the commonly known fact that in the presence of interactions the energy\nlevels of a trapped BEC are hard to calculate analytically. The latter\ncharacterization is achieved by a matching of the PR energies to energy levels\nof the confining trap using perturbative methods. Further, this work reveals\nthe role of the interplay between dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) and trapping\ngeometry in defining the energies and amplitudes of the PRs. The PRs are\ninduced by a negative Gaussian potential whose depth oscillates with time.\nMoreover, the DDI play a role in this induction. The dynamics of this system is\nmodeled by the time-dependent Gross- Pitaevskii equation (TDGPE) that is\nnumerically solved by the Crank-Nicolson method. The PRs are discussed basing\non analytical methods: first, it is shown that it is possible to reproduce PRs\nby the Lagrangian variational method that are similar to the ones obtained from\nTDGPE. Second, the energies at which the PRs arise are closely matched with the\nenergy levels of the corresponding trap calculated by time-independent\nperturbation theory. Third, the most probable transitions between the trap\nenergy levels yielding PRs are determined by time-dependent perturbation\ntheory. The most significant result of this work is that we have been able to\ncharacterize the above mentioned energy levels of a DBEC in a complex trapping\npotential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2021 15:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Moreover,\nfibrin naturally assembles into gels in vivo during wound healing and thrombus\nformation. Macroscale biopolymer gel mechanics are dictated by the microscale\nfiber network. Hence, accurate description of biopolymer gels can be achieved\nusing representative volume elements (RVE) that explicitly model the discrete\nfiber networks of the microscale. These RVE models, however, cannot be\nefficiently used to model the macroscale due to the challenges and\ncomputational demands of multiscale coupling. Here, we propose the use of an\nartificial, fully connected neural network (FCNN) to efficiently capture the\nbehavior of the RVE models. The FCNN was trained on 1100 fiber networks\nsubjected to 121 biaxial deformations. The stress data from the RVE, together\nwith the total energy and the condition of incompressibility of the surrounding\nmatrix, were used to determine the derivatives of an unknown strain energy\nfunction with respect to the deformation invariants. During training, the loss\nfunction was modified to ensure convexity of the strain energy function and\nsymmetry of its Hessian. A general FCNN model was coded into a user material\nsubroutine (UMAT) in the software Abaqus. In this work, the FCNN trained on the\ndiscrete fiber network data was used in finite element simulations of fibrin\ngels using our UMAT. We anticipate that this work will enable further\nintegration of machine learning tools with computational mechanics. It will\nalso improve computational modeling of biological materials characterized by a\nmultiscale structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2021 23:52:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 15:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Similarly,\nswimmers immersed in \"perfect fluids\" are able to use cyclic shape changes to\nboth translate and rotate even if the swimmer-fluid system has no net linear or\nangular momentum. Finally, systems fully constrained by direct nonholonomic\nconstraints (e.g., passive wheels) can push against these constraints to move\nthrough the world. Previous work has demonstrated that the net displacement\ninduced by these shape changes corresponds to the amount of *constraint\ncurvature* that the gaits enclose.\n  To properly assess or optimize the utility of a gait, however, we must also\nconsider the time or resources required to execute it: A gait that produces a\nsmall displacement per cycle, but that can be executed in a short time, may\nproduce a faster average velocity than a gait that produces a large\ndisplacement per cycle, but takes much longer to complete a cycle at the same\naverage instantaneous effort.\n  In this paper, we consider two effort-based cost functions for assessing the\ncosts associated with executing these cycles. For each of these cost functions,\nwe demonstrate that fixing the average instantaneous cost to a unit value\nallows us to transform the effort costs into time-to-execute costs for any\ngiven gait cycle. We then illustrate how the interaction between the constraint\ncurvature and these costs leads to characteristic geometries for optimal\ncycles, in which the gait trajectories resemble elastic hoops distended from\nwithin by internal pressures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2021 20:12:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 17:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-30"}

We\npropose a novel, data-driven approach based on low-rank plus sparse (L+S)\ndecomposition to isolate stimulus-driven dynamic changes in brain functional\nconnectivity (FC) from the background noise, by exploiting shared network\nstructure among subjects receiving the same naturalistic stimuli. The\ntime-resolved multi-subject FC matrices are modeled as a sum of a low-rank\ncomponent of correlated FC patterns across subjects, and a sparse component of\nsubject-specific, idiosyncratic background activities. To recover the shared\nlow-rank subspace, we introduce a fused version of principal component pursuit\n(PCP) by adding a fusion-type penalty on the differences between the rows of\nthe low-rank matrix. The method improves the detection of stimulus-induced\ngroup-level homogeneity in the FC profile while capturing inter-subject\nvariability. We develop an efficient algorithm via a linearized alternating\ndirection method of multipliers to solve the fused-PCP. Simulations show\naccurate recovery by the fused-PCP even when a large fraction of FC edges are\nseverely corrupted. When applied to natural fMRI data, our method reveals FC\nchanges that were time-locked to auditory processing during movie watching,\nwith dynamic engagement of sensorimotor systems for speech-in-noise. It also\nprovides a better mapping to auditory content in the movie than ISC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2021 11:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}
