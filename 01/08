In some instances, the steps tend to form close groups (or\nbunches), a phenomenon termed step bunching, which corresponds to an\ninstability of the equal-spacing step propagation. Over the last fifty years,\nvarious mechanisms have been proposed to explain step bunching, the most\nprominent of which are the inverse Ehrlich-Schwoebel effect (i.e., the\nasymmetry which favors the attachment of adatoms from the upper terrace),\nelastically mediated interactions between steps (in heteroepitaxy), step\npermeability (in electromigration-controlled growth), and the chemical effect\n(which couples the diffusion fields on all terraces). Beyond the discussion of\nthe influence of each of these mechanisms taken independently on the propensity\nto bunching, we propose a unified treatment of the effect of these mechanisms\non the onset of the bunching instability, which also accounts for their\ninterplay. This is done in the setting of the so-called quasistatic\napproximation, which by permitting mostly analytical treatment, offers a clear\nview of the influence on stability of the combined mechanisms. In particular,\nwe find that the Ehrlich-Schwoebel effect, elastic step-interactions and the\nchemical effect combine in a quasi-additive fashion, whereas step permeability\nis neither stabilizing nor destabilizing per se but changes the relative\ninfluence of the three aforementioned mechanisms. In a companion paper, we\ndemonstrate and discuss the importance of another mechanism, which we call the\ndynamics effect, that emerges when relaxing the simplifying but questionable\nquasistatic approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 16:23:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 13:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

This paper concerns\nconvergence of first-order discrete methods to a local minimum of nonconvex\noptimization problems that comprise strict-saddle points within the geometrical\nlandscape.

We prove the existence of optimal controls and derive the\nfirst-order optimality conditions in general settings without any extra\nassumption. Computationally, the well-known conjugate gradient (CG) method can\nbe applied conceptually. However, due to the additional divergence-free\nconstraint on the control variable and the nonlinear relation between the state\nand control variables, it is challenging to compute the gradient and the\noptimal stepsize at each CG iteration, and thus nontrivial to implement the CG\nmethod. To address these issues, we advocate a fast inner preconditioned CG\nmethod to ensure the divergence-free constraint and an efficient inexactness\nstrategy to determine an appropriate stepsize. An easily implementable nested\nCG method is thus proposed for solving such a complicated problem. For the\nnumerical discretization, we combine finite difference methods for the time\ndiscretization and finite element methods for the space discretization.\nEfficiency of the proposed nested CG method is promisingly validated by the\nresults of some preliminary numerical experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 17:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

Human mobility is a sequential decision-making process\ndependent on the users' dynamic interests. With accurate user profiles, the\npredictive model can perfectly reproduce users' mobility trajectories. In the\nreverse direction, once the predictive model can imitate users' mobility\npatterns, the learned user profiles are also optimal. Such intuition motivates\nus to propose an imitation-based mobile user profiling framework by exploiting\nreinforcement learning, in which the agent is trained to precisely imitate\nusers' mobility patterns for optimal user profiles. Specifically, the proposed\nframework includes two modules: (1) representation module, which produces state\ncombining user profiles and spatio-temporal context in real-time; (2) imitation\nmodule, where Deep Q-network (DQN) imitates the user behavior (action) based on\nthe state that is produced by the representation module. However, there are two\nchallenges in running the framework effectively. First, epsilon-greedy strategy\nin DQN makes use of the exploration-exploitation trade-off by randomly pick\nactions with the epsilon probability. Such randomness feeds back to the\nrepresentation module, causing the learned user profiles unstable. To solve the\nproblem, we propose an adversarial training strategy to guarantee the\nrobustness of the representation module. Second, the representation module\nupdates users' profiles in an incremental manner, requiring integrating the\ntemporal effects of user profiles. Inspired by Long-short Term Memory (LSTM),\nwe introduce a gated mechanism to incorporate new and old user characteristics\ninto the user profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 17:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

The ParB partitioning complex on the newly replicated\nchromosome translocates up this ParA gradient, thereby contributing to\nchromosome segregation. A DNA-relay mechanism - deriving from the elasticity of\nthe fluctuating chromosome - has been proposed as the driving force for this\ncargo translocation, but a mechanistic theoretical description remains elusive.\nHere, we propose a minimal model to describe force generation by the DNA-relay\nmechanism over a broad range of operational conditions. Conceptually, we\nidentify four distinct force-generation regimes characterized by their\ndependence on chromosome fluctuations. These relay force regimes arise from an\ninterplay of the imposed ParA gradient, chromosome fluctuations, and an\nemergent friction force due chromosome-cargo interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 17:20:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 17:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

Given their upper level energies of 225 K, they were thought\nto arise in dense, hot molecular cores near newly formed stars. However, this\nhas not been confirmed by further observations of these lines and their origin\nhas remained unclear. Generally, there is a scarcity of observational data for\nCH2 and, while it is an important compound in the astrochemical context, its\nactual occurrence in astronomical sources is poorly constrained. The present\nstudy, along with other recent observations of the Orion region we report, rule\nout the possibility of an association with gas that is both hot and dense. We\nfind that the distribution of the CH2 emission closely follows that of the\n[CII] 158 um emission, while CH2 is undetected toward the hot core itself. The\nobservations suggest, rather, that its extended emission arises from hot but\ndilute layers of PDRs and not from the denser parts of such regions as in the\ncase of the Orion Bar. This hypothesis was corroborated by comparisons of the\nobserved CH2 line profiles with those of CRRLs, well-known PDR tracers. In\naddition, we report the detection of the 70 GHz fine- and hfs lines of o-CH2\ntoward the W51E, W51M, W51N, W49N, W43, W75N, DR21, and S140 SFRs, and three of\nthe fine- and hfs lines between 68-71 GHz toward W3 IRS5. Furthermore, using a\nnon-LTE radiative transfer analysis, we can constrain the gas temperatures and\nH2 density to 163 K and 3.4e3 cm^-3, respectively.

We\ndemonstrate the potential of this approach for the test case of anomalous\ndiffusion, where data are given analytically, and then apply our method to\nvelocity autocorrelation data of molecular dynamics simulations of a colloid in\na Lennard-Jones fluid. In both cases, the VACF and the memory kernel can be\nreproduced very accurately. Moreover, we show that the algorithm can also\nhandle input data with large statistical noise. We anticipate that it will be a\nvery useful tool in future studies that involve dynamic coarse-graining of\ncomplex soft matter systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 17:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Prior studies investigating the link between\ncrowdfunding and innovation do not compare traditional and crowdfunded products\nand so while claims that crowdfunding supports innovation are theoretically\nsound, they lack empirical backing.

Since identical baselines\nshould see an identical sky signal, this provides a way of finding a relative\ngain/bandpass calibration without needing an explicit sky model. In reality,\nthere are many reasons why baselines will not be exactly identical, giving rise\nto a host of effects that spoil the redundancy of the array and induce spurious\nstructure in the calibration solutions if not accounted for. In this paper, we\nseek to build an understanding of how differences in the primary beam response\nbetween antennas affect redundantly-calibrated interferometric visibilities and\ntheir resulting frequency (delay-space) power spectra. We use simulations to\nstudy several generic types of primary beam variation, including differences in\nthe width of the main lobe, the angular and frequency structure of the\nsidelobes, and the beam ellipticity and orientation. For all of these types, we\nfind that additional temporal structure is induced in the gain solutions,\nparticularly when bright point sources pass through the beam. In comparison,\nonly a low level of additional spectral structure is induced. The temporal\nstructure modulates the cosmological 21cm power spectrum, but only at the level\nof a few percent in our simulations. We also investigate the possibility of\nsignal loss due to decoherence effects when non-redundant visibilities are\naveraged together, finding that the decoherence is worst when bright point\nsources pass through the beam, and that its magnitude varies significantly\nbetween baseline groups and types of primary beam variation.

However, these fluctuations\nare not exclusively caused by gas inflow/outflow, but also by impulsive heating\nfrom minor mergers.

Double-blind peer review, in which the authors' identities are\nmasked from the reviewers, has been proposed as a way to reduce reviewer bias.\nAlthough intuitive, evidence for the effectiveness of double-blind peer review\nin reducing bias is limited and mixed. Here, we examine the effects of\ndouble-blind peer review on prestige bias by analyzing the peer review files of\n5027 papers submitted to the International Conference on Learning\nRepresentations (ICLR), a top computer science conference that changed its\nreviewing policy from single-blind peer review to double-blind peer review in\n2018.

The intensity behavior of the high-dipole moment species\narises from a combination of excitation effects and molecular freeze out, with\nsome modulation from optical depth.

Here, we show that introducing temporal variation in the network\nstructure can lead to efficient synchronization even when stable synchrony is\nimpossible in any static network under the given budget, thereby demonstrating\na fundamental advantage of temporal networks. The temporal networks generated\nby our open-loop design are versatile in the sense of promoting synchronization\nfor systems with vastly different dynamics, including periodic and chaotic\ndynamics in both discrete-time and continuous-time models. Furthermore, we link\nthe dynamic stabilization effect of the changing topology to the curvature of\nthe master stability function, which provides analytical insights into\nsynchronization on temporal networks in general.

Specifically, the association\nof a data block with a search pattern (or cues) as well as the granularity of a\nstored data do not evolve. Such a static nature of computer memory, we observe,\nnot only limits the amount of data we can store in a given physical storage,\nbut it also misses the opportunity for dramatic performance improvement in\nvarious applications.

In this approach,\nhealth workers periodically select a subset of population for screening.\nHowever, given the limited number of health workers, only a small subset of the\npopulation can be visited in any given time period. Given the recurrent nature\nof the disease and rapid spreading, the goal is to minimize the number of\ninfections over a long time horizon. Active screening can be formalized as a\nsequential combinatorial optimization over the network of people and their\nconnections. The main computational challenges in this formalization arise from\ni) the combinatorial nature of the problem, ii) the need of sequential planning\nand iii) the uncertainties in the infectiousness states of the population.\n  Previous works on active screening fail to scale to large time horizon while\nfully considering the future effect of current interventions.

This is accomplished by simultaneously\nmeasuring X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and grazing incidence X-ray\nscattering (GIXS) in gas pressures as high as the multi-Torr regime, while also\nrecording mass spectrometry. Scattering patterns reflect near-surface sample\nstructures from the nano- to the meso-scale. The grazing incidence geometry\nprovides tunable depth sensitivity while scattered X-rays are detected across a\nbroad range of angles using a newly designed pivoting-UHV-manipulator for\ndetector positioning. At the same time, XPS and mass spectrometry can be\nmeasured, all from the same sample spot and in ambient conditions. To\ndemonstrate the capabilities of this system, we measured the chemical state,\ncomposition, and structure of Ag-behenate on a Si(001) wafer in vacuum and in\nO$_2$ atmosphere at various temperatures. These simultaneous structural,\nchemical, and gas phase product probes enable detailed insights into the\ninterplay between structure and chemical state for samples in gas phase\nenvironments. The compact size of our pivoting-UHV-manipulator makes it\npossible to retrofit this technique into existing spectroscopic instruments\ninstalled at synchrotron beamlines.

Effective computation offloading strategies need to\ncomprehensively cope with several major issues, including the allocation of\ndynamic communication and computational resources, the deadline constraints of\nheterogeneous tasks, and the requirements for computationally inexpensive and\ndistributed algorithms. However, most of the existing works mainly focus on\npart of these issues, which would not suffice to achieve expected performance\nin complex and practical scenarios. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we\nsystematically study a distributed computation offloading problem with hard\ndelay constraints, where heterogeneous computational tasks require continually\noffloading to a set of edge servers via a limiting number of stochastic\ncommunication channels. The task offloading problem is then cast as a\ndelay-constrained long-term stochastic optimization problem under unknown\npriori statistical knowledge. To resolve this problem, we first provide a\ntechnical path to transform and decompose it into several slot-level\nsubproblems, then we develop a distributed online algorithm, namely TODG, to\nefficiently allocate the resources and schedule the offloading tasks with delay\nguarantees. Further, we present a comprehensive analysis for TODG, in terms of\nthe optimality gap, the delay guarantees, and the impact of system parameters.\nExtensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of\nTODG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 21:43:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 20:13:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 08:26:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-24"}

We present a pulsational stability\nanalysis applied to low-mass helium-core stars on their early white-dwarf\ncooling branches going through CNO flashes in order to study the possibility\nthat the $\\varepsilon$ mechanism is able to excite gravity-mode pulsations. We\ncarried out a nonadiabatic pulsation analysis for low-mass helium-core\nwhite-dwarf models going through CNO flashes during their early cooling phases.\nWe found that the $\\varepsilon$ mechanism due to stable hydrogen burning can\nexcite low-order ($\\ell= 1, 2$) gravity modes with periods between $\\sim 80$\nand $500\\ $s, for stars with $0.2025 \\lesssim M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot} \\lesssim\n0.3630$ located in an extended region of the $\\log g - T_{\\rm eff}$ diagram\nwith effective temperature and surface gravity in the ranges $15\\,000 \\lesssim\nT_{\\rm eff} \\lesssim 38\\,000\\ $K and $5.8 \\lesssim \\log g \\lesssim 7.1$,\nrespectively.

In addition, confirming a rapid\nrate of period change in these pulsations would support that these stars\nactually experience CNO flashes, as predicted by evolutionary calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 21:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

(J Comput Phys, 2019) presented a flux-based volume\npenalization (VP) approach for imposing inhomogeneous Neumann boundary\nconditions on embedded interfaces. The flux-based VP method modifies the\ndiffusion coefficient of the original elliptic (Poisson) equation and uses a\nflux-forcing function as a source term in the equation to impose the Neumann\nboundary conditions. As such, the flux-based VP method can be easily\nincorporated into existing fictitious domain codes.

Because of the analytical approach taken in the\nprior work, only (spatially) constant flux values on simple interfaces were\nconsidered. In this paper, we present a numerical technique for constructing\nflux-forcing functions for arbitrarily complex boundaries. The imposed flux\nvalues are also allowed to vary spatially in our approach. Furthermore, the\nflux-based VP method is extended to include (spatially varying) Robin boundary\nconditions, which makes the flux-based VP method even more general. We consider\nseveral two- and three-dimensional test examples to access the spatial accuracy\nof the numerical solutions. The method is also used to simulate flux-driven\nthermal convection in a concentric annular domain. We formally derive the\nflux-based volume penalized Poisson equation satisfying Neumann/Robin boundary\ncondition in strong form; such a derivation was not presented in Sakurai et\nal., where the equation first appeared for the Neumann problem.

In this paper, we propose two metallic phases, M1 and M2, of Si2Te3\nusing the evolution algorithm and first-principles density functional theory\n(DFT) calculations. Unlike the presence of Si-Si dimers in the semiconducting\n(SC) phase, both M1 and M2 phases have individual Si atoms, which play\nimportant roles in the metallicity. Analysis of structural properties,\nelectronic properties, dynamical as well as thermal stability is performed. The\nenergies of these new structures are compared with the SC phase under the\nsubsequent hydrostatic pressure up to 12 GPa. The results show that M1 and M2\nphases have lower energies under high pressure, thus elucidating the appearance\nof the metallic phase of Si2Te3. In addition, the external pressure causes the\nSC phase to have an indirect-direct-indirect bandgap transition. Analysis of\nRaman spectra of the SC phase at a different pressure shows the shifting of the\nmajor Raman peaks, and finally disappearing confirms the phase transition. The\nresults are in good agreement with the experimental observations.

However, the requirement of large amounts of\nnoisy-clean image pairs for supervision limits the wide use of these models.\nAlthough there have been a few attempts in training an image denoising model\nwith only single noisy images, existing self-supervised denoising approaches\nsuffer from inefficient network training, loss of useful information, or\ndependence on noise modeling. In this paper, we present a very simple yet\neffective method named Neighbor2Neighbor to train an effective image denoising\nmodel with only noisy images. Firstly, a random neighbor sub-sampler is\nproposed for the generation of training image pairs. In detail, input and\ntarget used to train a network are images sub-sampled from the same noisy\nimage, satisfying the requirement that paired pixels of paired images are\nneighbors and have very similar appearance with each other. Secondly, a\ndenoising network is trained on sub-sampled training pairs generated in the\nfirst stage, with a proposed regularizer as additional loss for better\nperformance. The proposed Neighbor2Neighbor framework is able to enjoy the\nprogress of state-of-the-art supervised denoising networks in network\narchitecture design. Moreover, it avoids heavy dependence on the assumption of\nthe noise distribution. We explain our approach from a theoretical perspective\nand further validate it through extensive experiments, including synthetic\nexperiments with different noise distributions in sRGB space and real-world\nexperiments on a denoising benchmark dataset in raw-RGB space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 02:03:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 02:43:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 03:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

To evaluate AVs'\nsafety performance unbiasedly, the probability distributions of environment\nstatistics in the simulated naturalistic driving environment (NDE) need to be\nconsistent with those from the real-world driving environment. However,\nalthough human driving behaviors have been extensively investigated in the\ntransportation engineering field, most existing models were developed for\ntraffic flow analysis without considering the distributional consistency of\ndriving behaviors, which could cause significant evaluation biasedness for AV\ntesting. To fill this research gap, a distributional consistent NDE modeling\nframework is proposed in this paper. Using large-scale naturalistic driving\ndata, empirical distributions are obtained to construct the stochastic human\ndriving behavior models under different conditions. To address the error\naccumulation problem during the simulation, an optimization-based method is\nfurther designed to refine the empirical behavior models. Specifically, the\nvehicle state evolution is modeled as a Markov chain and its stationary\ndistribution is twisted to match the distribution from the real-world driving\nenvironment. The framework is evaluated in the case study of a multi-lane\nhighway driving simulation, where the distributional accuracy of the generated\nNDE is validated and the safety performance of an AV model is effectively\nevaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 02:48:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2022 02:24:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Here we propose Dynamic Graph Collaborative Filtering\n(DGCF), a novel framework leveraging dynamic graphs to capture collaborative\nand sequential relations of both items and users at the same time. We propose\nthree update mechanisms: zero-order 'inheritance', first-order 'propagation',\nand second-order 'aggregation', to represent the impact on a user or item when\na new interaction occurs. Based on them, we update related user and item\nembeddings simultaneously when interactions occur in turn, and then use the\nlatest embeddings to make recommendations. Extensive experiments conducted on\nthree public datasets show that DGCF significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art dynamic recommendation methods up to 30.

Purpose: $J/\\psi$\nproduction in the SeaQuest kinematics is calculated with a combination of\nperturbative QCD and intrinsic charm to see whether the SeaQuest data can put\nlimits on an intrinsic charm contribution. Methods: $J/\\psi$ production in\nperturbative QCD is calculated to next-to-leading order in the cross section.\nCold nuclear matter effects include nuclear modification of the parton\ndensities, absorption by nucleons, and $p_T$ broadening by multiple scattering.\nThe $J/\\psi$ contribution from intrinsic charm is calculated assuming\nproduction from a $|uud c \\overline c \\rangle$ Fock state.

However, their high energy\nconsumption poses a bottleneck to their deployment in energy-constrained\ndevices. To address this problem, approximate computing can be employed at the\ncost of some tolerable accuracy loss. However, such small accuracy variations\nmay increase the sensitivity of DNNs towards undesired subtle disturbances,\nsuch as permanent faults. The impact of permanent faults in accurate DNNs has\nbeen thoroughly investigated in the literature. Conversely, the impact of\npermanent faults in approximate DNN accelerators (AxDNNs) is yet\nunder-explored. The impact of such faults may vary with the fault bit\npositions, activation functions and approximation errors in AxDNN layers. Such\ndynamacity poses a considerable challenge to exploring the trade-off between\ntheir energy efficiency and fault resilience in AxDNNs. Towards this, we\npresent an extensive layer-wise and bit-wise fault resilience and energy\nanalysis of different AxDNNs, using the state-of-the-art Evoapprox8b signed\nmultipliers. In particular, we vary the stuck-at-0, stuck-at-1 fault-bit\npositions, and activation functions to study their impact using the most widely\nused MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our quantitative analysis shows that the\npermanent faults exacerbate the accuracy loss in AxDNNs when compared to the\naccurate DNN accelerators. For instance, a permanent fault in AxDNNs can lead\nup to 66\\% accuracy loss, whereas the same faulty bit can lead to only 9\\%\naccuracy loss in an accurate DNN accelerator. Our results demonstrate that the\nfault resilience in AxDNNs is orthogonal to the energy efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 05:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-11"}

Therefore, this work exploits the potential of leaky-wave\nantennas in the dense THz networks, to establish low-complexity THz links.

The results show that the leaky-wave antenna is efficient for\nachieving the high-speed transmission rate.

Polysomnography (PSG),\nthe gold standard of detecting OSA, requires multiple specialized sensors for\nsignal collection, hence patients have to physically visit hospitals and bear\nthe costly treatment for a single detection. Recently, many single-sensor\nalternatives have been proposed to improve the cost efficiency and convenience.\nAmong these methods, solutions based on RR-interval (i.e., the interval between\ntwo consecutive pulses) signals reach a satisfactory balance among comfort,\nportability and detection accuracy. In this paper, we advance RR-interval based\nOSA detection by considering its real-world practicality from energy\nperspectives. As photoplethysmogram (PPG) pulse sensors are commonly equipped\non smart wrist-worn wearable devices (e.g., smart watches and wristbands), the\nenergy efficiency of the detection model is crucial to fully support an\novernight observation on patients. This creates challenges as the PPG sensors\nare unable to keep collecting continuous signals due to the limited battery\ncapacity on smart wrist-worn devices. Therefore, we propose a novel Frequency\nExtraction Network (FENet), which can extract features from different frequency\nbands of the input RR-interval signals and generate continuous detection\nresults with downsampled, discontinuous RR-interval signals. With the help of\nthe one-to-multiple structure, FENet requires only one-third of the operation\ntime of the PPG sensor, thus sharply cutting down the energy consumption and\nenabling overnight diagnosis.

While text comprehension is intuitive for\nhumans, machines face tremendous challenges in processing and interpreting a\nhuman's natural language. This paper presents a novel knowledge-based word\nsense disambiguation algorithm, namely Sequential Contextual Similarity Matrix\nMultiplication (SCSMM). The SCSMM algorithm combines semantic similarity,\nheuristic knowledge, and document context to respectively exploit the merits of\nlocal context between consecutive terms, human knowledge about terms, and a\ndocument's main topic in disambiguating terms. Unlike other algorithms, the\nSCSMM algorithm guarantees the capture of the maximum sentence context while\nmaintaining the terms' order within the sentence. The proposed algorithm\noutperformed all other algorithms when disambiguating nouns on the combined\ngold standard datasets, while demonstrating comparable results to current\nstate-of-the-art word sense disambiguation systems when dealing with each\ndataset separately. Furthermore, the paper discusses the impact of granularity\nlevel, ambiguity rate, sentence size, and part of speech distribution on the\nperformance of the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 06:47:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-11"}

In past few years, various automatic\ntools and techniques have been proposed for diagnosis of AD. Several methods\nfocus on fast, accurate and early detection of the disease to minimize the loss\nto patients mental health. Although machine learning and deep learning\ntechniques have significantly improved medical imaging systems for AD by\nproviding diagnostic performance close to human level.

People have different ideas about how to form the\ninterpretation about its operation. We look at this problem from a new\nperspective where the interpretation of task solving is synthesized by\nquantifying how much and what previously unused information is exploited in\naddition to the information used to solve previous tasks. First, after learning\nseveral tasks, the network acquires several information partitions related to\neach task. We propose that the network, then, learns the minimal information\npartition that supplements previously learned information partitions to more\naccurately represent the input. This extra partition is associated with\nun-conceptualized information that has not been used in previous tasks. We\nmanage to identify what un-conceptualized information is used and quantify the\namount. To interpret how the network solves a new task, we quantify as\nmeta-information how much information from each partition is extracted. We\nimplement this framework with the variational information bottleneck technique.\nWe test the framework with the MNIST and the CLEVR dataset. The framework is\nshown to be able to compose information partitions and synthesize\nexperience-dependent interpretation in the form of meta-information. This\nsystem progressively improves the resolution of interpretation upon new\nexperience by converting a part of the un-conceptualized information partition\nto a task-related partition.

The average number of segments between two\nneighboring slip-links or slip-springs, $N_{0}$, is an input parameter in these\nmodels. To analyze experimental data, the characteristic number of segments in\nentangled polymers $N_{e}$ estimated from the plateau modulus is used instead.\nBoth $N_{0}$ and $N_{e}$ characterize the topological constraints in entangled\npolymers, and naively $N_{0}$ is considered to be the same as $N_{e}$. However,\nearlier studies showed that $N_{0}$ and $N_{e}$ (or the plateau modulus) should\nbe considered as independent parameters. In this work, we show that due to the\nfluctuations at the short time scale, $N_{e}$ deviates from $N_{0}$. This means\nthat the relation between $N_{0}$ and the plateau modulus is not simple as\nnaively expected. The plateau modulus (or $N_{e}$) depends on the\nsubchain-scale details of the employed model, as well as the average number of\nsegments $N_{0}$. This is due to the fact that the subchain-scale fluctuation\nmechanisms depend on the model rather strongly. We theoretically calculate the\nplateau moduli for several single-chain slip-link and slip-spring models. Our\nresults explicitly show that the relation between $N_{0}$ and $N_{e}$ is\nmodel-dependent. We compare theoretical results with various simulation data in\nthe literature, and show that our theoretical expressions reasonably explain\nthe simulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 08:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

Recent research has proposed\nmethods to develop this algorithm further by accelerating the original PPA\n(OPPA)'s path-finding process. However, when does the PPA ascertain that the\nshortest path has been found? Is there a point after which the PPA could\ndistinguish the shortest path from other paths? By innovatively proposing the\nconcept of the dominant path (D-Path), the exact moment, named the transition\npoint (T-Point), when the PPA finds the shortest path can be identified. Based\non the D-Path and T-Point, a newly accelerated PPA named OPPA-D using the\nproposed termination criterion is developed which is superior to all other\nbaseline algorithms according to the experiments conducted in this paper. The\nvalidity and the superiority of the proposed termination criterion is also\ndemonstrated. Furthermore, an evaluation method is proposed to provide new\ninsights for the comparison of different accelerated OPPAs. The breakthrough of\nthis paper lies in using D-path and T-point to terminate the OPPA. The novel\ntermination criterion reveals the actual performance of this OPPA. This OPPA is\nthe fastest algorithm, outperforming some so-called accelerated OPPAs.\nFurthermore, we explain why some existing works inappropriately claim to be\naccelerated algorithms is in fact a product of inappropriate termination\ncriterion, thus giving rise to the illusion that the method is accelerated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 08:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-11"}

Uniqueness conditions and fitting methods\nhave thus been thoroughly studied. Nevertheless, the challenging problem of\nestimating the BTD model structure, namely the number of block terms, $R$, and\ntheir individual ranks, $L_r$, has only recently started to attract significant\nattention, mainly through regularization-based approaches which entail the need\nto tune the regularization parameter(s). In this work, we build on ideas of\nsparse Bayesian learning (SBL) and put forward a fully automated Bayesian\napproach. Through a suitably crafted multi-level \\emph{hierarchical}\nprobabilistic model, which gives rise to heavy-tailed prior distributions for\nthe BTD factors, structured sparsity is \\emph{jointly} imposed. Ranks are then\nestimated from the numbers of blocks ($R$) and columns ($L_r$) of\nnon-negligible energy. Approximate posterior inference is implemented, within\nthe variational inference framework. The resulting iterative algorithm\ncompletely avoids hyperparameter tuning, which is a significant defect of\nregularization-based methods. Alternative probabilistic models are also\nexplored and the connections with their regularization-based counterparts are\nbrought to light with the aid of the associated maximum a-posteriori (MAP)\nestimators.

The common approach of estimating the\nPLR is a two-step procedure that first estimates the Mira periods and then runs\na linear regression of magnitude on log period. When the light curves are\nsparse and noisy, the accuracy of period estimation decreases and can suffer\nfrom aliasing effects. Some methods improve accuracy by incorporating complex\nmodel structures at the expense of significant computational costs. Another\ndrawback of existing methods is that they only provide point estimation without\nproper estimation of uncertainty. To overcome these challenges, we develop a\nhierarchical Bayesian model that simultaneously models the quasi-periodic\nvariations for a collection of Mira light curves while estimating their common\nPLR. By borrowing strengths through the PLR, our method automatically reduces\nthe aliasing effect, improves the accuracy of period estimation, and is capable\nof characterizing the estimation uncertainty. We develop a scalable stochastic\nvariational inference algorithm for computation that can effectively deal with\nthe multimodal posterior of period. The effectiveness of the proposed method is\ndemonstrated through simulations, and an application to observations of Miras\nin the Local Group galaxy M33. Without using ad-hoc period correction tricks,\nour method achieves a distance estimate of M33 that is consistent with\npublished work.

The\nquantum state of the entire composite system is modeled using the multi-$\\rm\nD_2$ Ansatz in combination with the time-dependent Dirac-Frenkel variational\nprinciple. Applying a sinusoidal driving field to one of the qubits, this\ndevice is an ideal platform to study the photon-assisted LZ transitions by\ncomparing the dynamics of the two qubits. A series of interfering\nphoton-assisted LZ transitions take place if the photon frequency is much\nsmaller than the driving amplitude. Once the two energy scales are comparable,\nindependent LZ transitions arise and a transition pathway is revealed using an\nenergy diagram. It is found that both adiabatic and nonadiabatic transitions\nare involved in the dynamics. Used to model environmental effects on the LZ\ntransitions, the common phonon mode coupled to the qubits allows for more\navailable states to facilitate the LZ transitions. An analytical formula is\nobtained to estimate the short-time phonon population and produces results in\nreasonable agreement with numerical calculations. Equipped with the knowledge\nof the photon-assisted LZ transitions in the system, we can precisely\nmanipulate the qubit state and successfully generate the qubit dynamics with a\nsquare-wave pattern by applying driving fields to both qubits, opening up new\nvenues to manipulate the states of qubits and photons in quantum information\ndevices and quantum computers\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 10:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

The\nself-coherent camera (SCC) is an integrated coronagraph and focal-plane\nwavefront sensor that generates wavefront information-encoding Fizeau fringes\nin the focal plane by adding a reference hole (RH) in the Lyot stop. Here, we\naim to show that by featuring a polarizer in the RH and adding a polarizing\nbeamsplitter downstream of the Lyot stop, the RH can be placed right next to\nthe pupil. We refer to this new variant of the SCC as the polarization-encoded\nself-coherent camera (PESCC). We study the performance of the PESCC\nanalytically and numerically, and compare it, where relevant, to the SCC. We\nshow analytically that the PESCC relaxes the requirements on the focal-plane\nsampling and spectral resolution with respect to the SCC by a factor of 2 and\n3.5, respectively. Furthermore, we find via our numerical simulations that the\nPESCC has effectively access to $\\sim$16 times more photons, which improves the\nsensitivity of the wavefront sensing by a factor of $\\sim4$.

However, spatial objects often cover different\nlevels of spatial granularity and thereby are heterogeneous. For example, one\nuser may prefer to be recommended a region (say Manhattan), while another user\nmight prefer a venue (say a restaurant). Even for the same user, preferences\ncan change at different stages of data exploration. In this paper, we study how\nto support top-k spatial object recommendations at varying levels of spatial\ngranularity, enabling spatial objects at varying granularity, such as a city,\nsuburb, or building, as a Point of Interest (POI). To solve this problem, we\npropose the use of a POI tree, which captures spatial containment relationships\nbetween POIs. We design a novel multi-task learning model called MPR (short for\nMulti-level POI Recommendation), where each task aims to return the top-k POIs\nat a certain spatial granularity level. Each task consists of two subtasks: (i)\nattribute-based representation learning; (ii) interaction-based representation\nlearning. The first subtask learns the feature representations for both users\nand POIs, capturing attributes directly from their profiles. The second subtask\nincorporates user-POI interactions into the model. Additionally, MPR can\nprovide insights into why certain recommendations are being made to a user\nbased on three types of hints: user-aspect, POI-aspect, and interaction-aspect.\nWe empirically validate our approach using two real-life datasets, and show\npromising performance improvements over several state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 11:39:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-11"}

We present an environmental study of a sample of 116 SMGs in 96 ALMA\nobservation fields, which were initially discovered with the AzTEC camera on\nASTE and identified with high-resolution ALMA imaging within the COSMOS survey\nfield, having either spectroscopic or unambiguous photometric redshift.

We searched for dense galaxy environments computing the so-called\noverdensity parameter as a function of distance within a radius of 5 arcmin\nfrom the SMG. We validated this approach spectroscopically for those SMGs for\nwhich spectroscopic redshift is available. As an additional test, we searched\nfor extended X-ray emission as a proxy for the hot intracluster medium,\nperforming an X-ray stacking analysis in the 0.5-2 keV band with a 32 arcsec\naperture and our SMG position using all available XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray\nobservations of the COSMOS field. We find that 27% (31 out of 116) of the SMGs\nin our sample are located in a galactic dense environment; a fraction that is\nsimilar to previous studies. The spectroscopic redshift is known for 15 of\nthese 31 sources, thus this photometric approach is tested using spectroscopy.\nWe are able to confirm that 7 out of 15 SMGs lie in high-density peaks.\nHowever, the search for associated extended X-ray emission via an X-ray\nstacking analysis leads to a detection that is not statistically significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 12:09:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

However,\nGRBs can be seen from off-axis angles, and the recent detection of a short GRB\nassociated to a gravitational wave event has conclusively shown such a\nscenario. The observer viewing angle plays an important role in the observable\nspectral shape and the energetic of such events. We present a numerical model\nwhich is based on the single-pulse approximation with emission from a top-hat\njet and has been developed to investigate the effects of the observer viewing\nangle. We assume a conical jet parametrized by a radius $R_{\\rm jet}$,\nhalf-opening angle $\\theta_{\\rm jet}$, a comoving-frame emissivity law and an\nobserver viewing angle $\\theta_{\\rm obs}$, and then study the effects for the\nconditions $\\theta_{\\rm obs} < \\theta_{\\rm jet}$ and $\\theta_{\\rm obs}\n>\\theta_{\\rm jet}$.

In this work, we use sparse regression to\nbuild an accurate and explainable model of the stellar mass of central galaxies\ngiven properties of their host dark matter (DM) halo. Our data set comprises\n9,521 central galaxies from the EAGLE hydrodynamic simulation. By matching the\nhost halos to a DM-only simulation, we collect the halo mass and specific\nangular momentum at present time and for their main progenitors in 10 redshift\nbins from $z=0$ to $z=4$. The principal component of our governing equation is\na third-order polynomial of the host halo mass, which models the stellar-mass\nhalo-mass relation. The scatter about this relation is driven by the halo mass\nevolution and is captured by second and third-order correlations of the halo\nmass evolution with the present halo mass. An advantage of sparse regression\napproaches is that unnecessary terms are removed. Although we include\ninformation on halo specific angular momentum, these parameters are discarded\nby our methodology.

A Robinson\nincomplete symmetric matrix is an incomplete symmetric matrix whose non-missing\nentries do not decrease along rows and columns when moving toward the diagonal.\nA Strong-Robinson incomplete symmetric matrix is an incomplete symmetric matrix\n$A$ such that $a_{k,l} \\geq a_{i,j}$ if $a_{i,j}$ and $a_{k,l}$ are two\nnon-missing entries of $A$ and $i\\leq k \\leq l \\leq j$.

Most existing methods merely consider the local\nalignment between images and texts within a single scale (e.g. only global\nscale or only partial scale) then simply construct alignment at each scale\nseparately.

Therefore, to understand the\nthermodynamic stability of polar phases and its relation to electromechanical\nswitching during morphotropic phase transition in BZCT, we develop a Landau\npotential based on the theory of polar anisotropy. Since intrinsic\nelectrostrictive anisotropy changes as a function of electromechanical\nprocessing, we establish a correlation between the parameters of our potential\nand the coefficients of electrostriction.

The rules learned by these\nmodels outperform the previous strategies specially in high frequency trading\nenvironments. However, it is shown that the quality of the extracted features\nfrom a long-term sequence of raw prices of the instruments greatly affects the\nperformance of the trading rules learned by these models. Employing a neural\nencoder-decoder structure to extract informative features from complex input\ntime-series has proved very effective in other popular tasks like neural\nmachine translation and video captioning in which the models face a similar\nproblem. The encoder-decoder framework extracts highly informative features\nfrom a long sequence of prices along with learning how to generate outputs\nbased on the extracted features. In this paper, a novel end-to-end model based\non the neural encoder-decoder framework combined with DRL is proposed to learn\nsingle instrument trading strategies from a long sequence of raw prices of the\ninstrument. The proposed model consists of an encoder which is a neural\nstructure responsible for learning informative features from the input\nsequence, and a decoder which is a DRL model responsible for learning\nprofitable strategies based on the features extracted by the encoder. The\nparameters of the encoder and the decoder structures are learned jointly, which\nenables the encoder to extract features fitted to the task of the decoder DRL.\nIn addition, the effects of different structures for the encoder and various\nforms of the input sequences on the performance of the learned strategies are\ninvestigated. Experimental results showed that the proposed model outperforms\nother state-of-the-art models in highly dynamic environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 13:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

To address this issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a wide beam based training approach to calibrate the\nnarrow beam direction according to the channel power leakage. To handle the\ncomplex nonlinear properties of the channel power leakage, deep learning is\nutilized to predict the optimal narrow beam directly. Specifically, three deep\nlearning assisted calibrated beam training schemes are proposed. The first\nscheme adopts convolution neural network to implement the prediction based on\nthe instantaneous received signals of wide beam training. We also perform the\nadditional narrow beam training based on the predicted probabilities for\nfurther beam direction calibrations. However, the first scheme only depends on\none wide beam training, which lacks the robustness to noise. To tackle this\nproblem, the second scheme adopts long-short term memory (LSTM) network for\ntracking the movement of users and calibrating the beam direction according to\nthe received signals of prior beam training, in order to enhance the robustness\nto noise. To further reduce the overhead of wide beam training, our third\nscheme, an adaptive beam training strategy, selects partial wide beams to be\ntrained based on the prior received signals. Two criteria, namely, optimal\nneighboring criterion and maximum probability criterion, are designed for the\nselection. Furthermore, to handle mobile scenarios, auxiliary LSTM is\nintroduced to calibrate the directions of the selected wide beams more\nprecisely. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed schemes achieve\nsignificantly higher beamforming gain with smaller beam training overhead\ncompared with the conventional and existing deep-learning based counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 04:02:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:53:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 03:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

CNNs are preferable for region-wise traffic prediction\nby taking advantage of localized spatial correlations, whilst GNNs achieves\nbetter performance for graph-structured traffic data. When applied to\nregion-wise traffic prediction, CNNs typically partition an underlying\nterritory into grid-like spatial units, and employ standard convolutions to\nlearn spatial dependence among the units. However, standard convolutions with\nfixed geometric structures cannot fully model the nonstationary characteristics\nof local traffic flows. To overcome the deficiency, we introduce deformable\nconvolution that augments the spatial sampling locations with additional\noffsets, to enhance the modeling capability of spatial nonstationarity. On this\nbasis, we design a deep deformable convolutional residual network, namely\nDeFlow-Net, that can effectively model global spatial dependence, local spatial\nnonstationarity, and temporal periodicity of traffic flows. Furthermore, to\nbetter fit with convolutions, we suggest to first aggregate traffic flows\naccording to pre-conceived regions or self-organized regions based on traffic\nflows, then dispose to sequentially organized raster images for network input.\nExtensive experiments on real-world traffic flows demonstrate that DeFlow-Net\noutperforms GNNs and existing CNNs using standard convolutions, and spatial\npartition by pre-conceived regions or self-organized regions further enhances\nthe performance. We also demonstrate the advantage of DeFlow-Net in maintaining\nspatial autocorrelation, and reveal the impacts of partition shapes and scales\non deep traffic flow prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 10:16:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 02:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

If there is a gradient or a potential\ndifference of a quantity a diffusion process happens and this ends if an\nequilibrium is reached only. The concentration of a species maybe such\nquantity, or the voltage. An electric currant will be driven by a voltage\ndifference for example. In this COVID-19 pandemic one observes both regions\nwith low incidence and other ones with high incidence. The local different\npeople density could be a reason for that. In populous areas like big cities or\ncongested urban areas higher COVID-19 incidences could be observed than in\nrural regions.

In this paper, the idea of trapping\nthe electromagnetic waves in a feedback loop is proposed to achieve higher\ngroup delay swing. The proposed structure includes two transmission lines and\ntwo junctions that act as power divider/combiner. The transmission lines can be\neither dispersive or non-dispersive. The group delay in the proposed\nconfiguration is proportional to the injected power into the feedback loop. So,\nan increase in the group delay swing can be done by improving the junctions or\nby adding more feedback loops to the structure. Based on this configuration, a\nnovel DDS, using the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) transmission line, is\nintroduced. According to the experimental results, the proposed device with a\nrelatively compact size creates high group delay swings (9 ns), and its\ninsertion loss is about 7 dB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 16:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}
