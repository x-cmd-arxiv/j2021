The goal\nis to design algorithms for joint user activity detection, delay detection, and\nchannel estimation. By exploiting the sparsity on both user activity and\ndelays, we formulate a hierarchical sparse signal recovery problem in both the\nsingle-antenna and the multiple-antenna scenarios. While traditional compressed\nsensing algorithms can be applied to these problems, they suffer high\ncomputational complexity and often require the perfect statistical information\nof channel and devices. This paper solves these problems by designing the\nLearned Approximate Message Passing (LAMP) network, which belongs to\nmodel-driven deep learning approaches and ensures efficient performance without\ntremendous training data. Particularly, in the multiple-antenna scenario, we\ndesign three different LAMP structures, namely, distributed, centralized and\nhybrid ones, to balance the performance and complexity.

However, face\nrecognition approaches that are based purely on RGB images rely solely on\nintensity information, and therefore are more sensitive to facial variations,\nnotably pose, occlusions, and environmental changes such as illumination and\nbackground. A novel depth-guided attention mechanism is proposed for deep\nmulti-modal face recognition using low-cost RGB-D sensors. Our novel attention\nmechanism directs the deep network \"where to look\" for visual features in the\nRGB image by focusing the attention of the network using depth features\nextracted by a Convolution Neural Network (CNN). The depth features help the\nnetwork focus on regions of the face in the RGB image that contains more\nprominent person-specific information.

The presence of the dominant low frequencies observed using the\nDirect Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method has been explained as a consequence\nof the well-known bimodal probability density function (PDF) of the energy of\nparticles inside a shock. Here, PDFs of particle energies are derived in the\nupstream and downstream equilibrium regions, as well as inside shocks, and it\nis shown for the first time that they have the form of the non-central\nchi-squared (NCCS) distributions.

We develop a state estimation paradigm for the scenario\nwhere multiple parties with data and model privacy concerns are involved.\nMultiple parties monitor a physical dynamic process by deploying their own\nsensor networks and update the state estimate according to the average state\nestimate of all the parties calculated by a cloud server and security module.\nThe paradigm taps additively homomorphic encryption which enables the cloud\nserver and security module to jointly fuse parties' data while preserving the\ndata privacy.

For the\nproposed filtering paradigm, we analyze the stabilization and the optimality.\nFirst, to stabilize the multi-party state estimator while preserving\nobservation model privacy, two stabilization design methods are proposed. For\nspecial scenarios, the parties directly design their estimator gains by the\nmatrix norm relaxation. For general scenarios, after transforming the original\ndesign problem into a convex semi-definite programming problem, the parties\ncollaboratively derive suitable estimator gains based on the ADMM.

This paper\nproposes and analyzes alternative market models for a TMC system -- focusing on\nmarket design aspects such as allocation/expiration of tokens, rules governing\ntrading, transaction fees, and regulator intervention -- and develops a\nmethodology to explicitly model the dis-aggregate behavior of individuals\nwithin the market. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted within a\ncombined mode and departure time context for the morning commute problem to\ncompare the performance of the alternative designs relative to congestion\npricing and a no-control scenario. The simulation experiments employ a\nday-to-day assignment framework wherein transportation demand is modeled using\na logit-mixture model with income effects and supply is modeled using a\nstandard bottleneck model. The results indicate that small fixed transaction\nfees can effectively mitigate undesirable behavior in the market without a\nsignificant loss in efficiency (total welfare) whereas proportional transaction\nfees are less effective both in terms of efficiency and in avoiding undesirable\nmarket behavior. Further, an allocation of tokens in continuous time can be\nbeneficial in dealing with non-recurrent events and avoiding concentrated\ntrading activity. In the presence of income effects, despite small fixed\ntransaction fees, the TMC system yields a marginally higher social welfare than\ncongestion pricing while attaining revenue neutrality. Further, it is more\nrobust in the presence of forecasting errors and non-recurrent events due to\nthe adaptiveness of the market. Finally, as expected, the TMC scheme is more\nequitable (when revenues from congestion pricing are not redistributed)\nalthough it is not guaranteed to be Pareto-improving when tokens are\ndistributed equally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 17:14:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 16:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

To solve these problems, a mobility-aware seamless\nhandover method based on multipath transmission control protocol (MPTCP) is\nproposed. The proposed handover method is executed in the controller of the\nsoftware-defined HetNets (SDHetNets) and consists of three steps: location\nprediction, network selection, and handover execution. In particular, the\nmethod first predicts the user's location in the next moment with an echo state\nnetwork (ESN).

The mixed formulation\ncaptures the distinct nonlinearities associated with the constitutive flux\nequations and the reaction terms. The IMEX method conveniently treats these two\nsources of nonlinearity implicitly and explicitly, respectively, within a\nsingle time-stepping framework. The combination of the p-adaptive mixed\nformulation and the IMEX method delivers a robust and efficient algorithm. The\nproposed methods eliminate the coupled effect of mesh size and time step on the\nalgorithmic stability. A residual based a posteriori error estimate that\nprovides an upper bound of the natural error norm is derived. The availability\nof such estimate which can be obtained with minimal computational effort and\nthe hierarchical construction of the finite element spaces allow for the\nformulation of an efficient p-adaptive algorithm. A series of numerical\nexamples demonstrate the performance of the approach. It is shown that the\nmethod with the p-adaptive strategy accurately solves problems involving\ntravelling waves, and those with discontinuities and singularities. The\nflexibility of the formulation is also illustrated via selected applications in\npattern formation and electrophysiology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 18:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

Hence, our goal here is to enhance the embedding capacity while\npreserving the visual quality of the stego-image.

First, we use compressed sensing to sparsify cover image block-wise,\nobtain its linear measurements, and then uniquely select permissible\nmeasurements. Further, before embedding the secret data, we encrypt it using\nthe Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, and finally, we embed two bits of\nencrypted data into each permissible measurement.

To\nmitigate the effects of occlusion, our method 1) Uses a combination of locally\nlinear embedding and constrained optimization to regularize the output of CPD,\nthus enforcing topological consistency when occlusions create disconnected\npieces of the object; 2) Reasons about the free-space visible by an RGBD sensor\nto better estimate the prior on point location and to detect tracking failures\nduring occlusion; and 3) Uses shape descriptors to find the most relevant\nprevious state of the object to use for tracking after a severe occlusion. Our\nmethod does not rely on physics simulation or a physical model of the object,\nwhich can be difficult to obtain in unstructured environments. Despite having\nno physical model, our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves\nimproved accuracy in the presence of occlusion as compared to a physics-based\nCPD method while maintaining adequate run-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 00:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

As a fundamental problem, the\ntimely prediction of passenger demands in different regions is vital for\neffective traffic flow control and route planning. As both spatial and temporal\npatterns are indispensable passenger demand prediction, relevant research has\nevolved from pure time series to graph-structured data for modeling historical\npassenger demand data, where a snapshot graph is constructed for each time slot\nby connecting region nodes via different relational edges (e.g.,\norigin-destination relationship, geographical distance, etc.). Consequently,\nthe spatiotemporal passenger demand records naturally carry dynamic patterns in\nthe constructed graphs, where the edges also encode important information about\nthe directions and volume (i.e., weights) of passenger demands between two\nconnected regions. However, existing graph-based solutions fail to\nsimultaneously consider those three crucial aspects of dynamic, directed, and\nweighted (DDW) graphs, leading to limited expressiveness when learning graph\nrepresentations for passenger demand prediction. Therefore, we propose a novel\nspatiotemporal graph attention network, namely Gallat (Graph prediction with\nall attention) as a solution. In Gallat, by comprehensively incorporating those\nthree intrinsic properties of DDW graphs, we build three attention layers to\nfully capture the spatiotemporal dependencies among different regions across\nall historical time slots. Moreover, the model employs a subtask to conduct\npretraining so that it can obtain accurate results more quickly. We evaluate\nthe proposed model on real-world datasets, and our experimental results\ndemonstrate that Gallat outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 03:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

The integration of MEC with\nresource-constrained unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could enable flexible\nresource provisioning for supporting dynamic and computation-intensive UAV\napplications. Existing resource trading could facilitate this paradigm with\nproper incentives, which, however, may often incur unexpected negotiation\nlatency and energy consumption, trading failures and unfair pricing, due to the\nunpredictable nature of the resource trading process. Motivated by these\nchallenges, an efficient futures-based resource trading mechanism for edge\ncomputing-assisted UAV network is proposed, where a mutually beneficial and\nrisk-tolerable forward contract is devised to promote resource trading between\nan MEC server (seller) and a UAV (buyer). Two key problems i.e. futures\ncontract design before trading and power optimization during trading are\nstudied. By analyzing historical statistics associated with future resource\nsupply, demand, and air-to-ground communication quality, the contract design is\nformulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to maximize both\nthe seller's and the buyer's expected utilities, while estimating their\nacceptable risk tolerance. Accordingly, we propose an efficient bilateral\nnegotiation scheme to help players reach a trading consensus on the amount of\nresources and the relevant price. For the power optimization problem, we\ndevelop a practical algorithm that enables the buyer to determine its optimal\ntransmission power via convex optimization techniques. Comprehensive\nsimulations demonstrate that the proposed mechanism offers both players\nconsiderable utilities, while outperforming the onsite trading mechanism on\ntrading failures and fairness, negotiation latency, and cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 05:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

A perturbative method is used to\ncalculate the total travel time in the strong field limit, which is found to be\nin quasi-series of the small parameter $a=1-b_c/b$ where $b$ is the impact\nparameter and $b_c$ is its critical value. The coefficients of the series are\ncompletely fixed by the behaviour of the metric functions near the particle\nsphere $r_c$ and only the first term of the series contains a weak logarithmic\ndivergence.

Theoretical analysis of the D2D offloading subproblem leads to\nnew FedL convergence bounds and an efficient sequential convex optimizer. Using\nthis result, we develop a sampling methodology based on graph convolutional\nnetworks (GCNs) which learns the relationship between network attributes,\nsampled nodes, and resulting offloading that maximizes FedL accuracy. Through\nevaluation on real-world datasets and network measurements from our IoT\ntestbed, we find that our methodology while sampling less than 5% of all\ndevices outperforms conventional FedL substantially both in terms of trained\nmodel accuracy and required resource utilization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 05:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

While there has been significant advances in describing the\nshort-time evolution of these systems using a variety of different numerical\nalgorithms, it has been quite difficult to evolve a system from an equilibrium\nstate prior to the application of a driving field, to the long-time steady (or\nperiodically oscillating) state.

The problem reduces, after automata-theoretic constructions, to\nfinding the maximal probability of satisfying a parity condition on a (possibly\nhybrid) state space. While characterizing the exact satisfaction probability is\nopen, we show that a lower bound on this probability can be obtained by (I)\ncomputing an under-approximation of the qualitative winning region, i.e.,\nstates from which the parity condition can be enforced almost surely, and (II)\ncomputing the maximal probability of reaching this qualitative winning region.\nThe heart of our approach is a technique to symbolically compute the\nunder-approximation of the qualitative winning region in step (I) via a\nfinite-state abstraction of the original system as a 2.5-player parity game.\nOur abstraction procedure uses only the support of the probabilistic evolution;\nit does not use precise numerical transition probabilities. We prove that the\nwinning set in the abstract 2.5-player game induces an under-approximation of\nthe qualitative winning region in the original synthesis problem, along with a\npolicy to solve it. By combining these contributions with (a) a symbolic\nfixpoint algorithm to solve 2.5-player games and (b) existing techniques for\nreachability policy synthesis in stochastic nonlinear systems, we get an\nabstraction-based algorithm for finding a lower bound on the maximal\nsatisfaction probability.

The CHP plants could further\nimprove the profit margin of district heating multi-utilities by selling\nelectricity in the power market by adjusting the ratio between generated heat\nand power. The latter is possible only for certain CHP plants, which allow\ndecoupling the two commodities generation, namely the ones provided by two\nindependent variables (degrees-of-freedom) or by integrating them with thermal\nenergy storage and Power-to-Heat (P2H) units. CHP units can, therefore, help in\nthe congestion management of the electricity network. A detailed mixed-integer\nlinear programming (MILP) optimization model is introduced for solving the\nnetwork-constrained unit commitment of integrated electric and thermal\ninfrastructures. The developed model contains a detailed characterization of\nthe useful effects of CHP units, i.e., heat and power, as a function of one and\ntwo independent variables. A lossless DC flow approximation models the\nelectricity transmission network. The district heating model includes the use\nof gas boilers, electric boilers, and thermal energy storage.

Existing proprietary pattern-based or\nport-based third-party DPI tools can suffer from limitations in efficiently\nprocessing a large volume of data traffic. In this paper, a novel\nOpenFlow-enabled deep packet inspection (OFDPI) approach is proposed based on\nthe SDN paradigm to provide adaptive and efficient packet inspection. First,\nOFDPI prescribes an early detection at the flow-level granularity by checking\nthe IP addresses of each new flow via OpenFlow protocols. Then, OFDPI allows\nfor deep packet inspection at the packet-level granularity: (i) for unencrypted\npackets, OFDPI extracts the features of accessible payloads, including tri-gram\nfrequency based on Term Frequency and Inverted Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and\nlinguistic features. These features are concatenated into a sparse matrix\nrepresentation and are then applied to train a binary classifier with logistic\nregression rather than matching with specific pattern combinations. In order to\nbalance the detection accuracy and performance bottleneck of the SDN\ncontroller, OFDPI introduces an adaptive packet sampling window based on the\nlinear prediction; and (ii) for encrypted packets, OFDPI extracts notable\nfeatures of packets and then trains a binary classifier with a decision tree,\ninstead of decrypting the encrypted traffic to weaken user privacy. A prototype\nof OFDPI is implemented on the Ryu SDN controller and the Mininet platform. The\nperformance and the overhead of the proposed sulotion are assessed using the\nreal-world datasets through experiments.

Every\nday, billions of users interact with millions of products in real-time. Systems\naddressing this scenario must work reliably at scale. We propose an efficient\nmodel (LED, for Lightweight Encoder-Decoder) reaching a new trade-off between\ncomplexity, scale and performance. Specifically, we show that combining\nlarge-scale matrix factorization with lightweight embedding fine-tuning unlocks\nstate-of-the-art performance at scale. We further provide the detailed\ndescription of a system architecture and demonstrate its operation over two\nmonths at the scale of the internet. Our design allows serving billions of\nusers across hundreds of millions of items in a few milliseconds using standard\nhardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 10:29:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 10:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

First, we consider the CSC phase transition in the context\nof Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. We analyze the Cooper pair condensate\nin the deconfinement and confinement phases which are dual to the planar\nGB-RN-AdS black hole and GB-AdS soliton, respectively, where the backreaction\nof the matter part is taken into account. By examining the breakdown of the\nBreitenlohner-Freedman bound in the background of the planar GB-RN-AdS black\nhole, we find that the positive GB coupling parameter $\\alpha>0$ leads to a\nlower upper bound of the color number in comparison to Einstein gravity where\nthe CSC phase for $N_c\\geq2$ is not realized. But, with the $\\alpha<0$ case it\nis possible to observe the Cooper pair condensate for $N_c\\geq2$ with the\nreasonable magnitude of $\\alpha$. This is confirmed and the corresponding phase\ndiagram is found by solving numerically the equations of motion for the\ngravitational system. In addition, we show that the CSC phase disappears in the\nconfinement phase for the magnitude of $\\alpha$ below a certain value which\nmeans that beyond that value it might lead to the breakdown region of the EGB\ngravity in investigating the CSC phase. However, the CSC phase transition\noccurring with $N_c\\geq2$ requires the magnitude of the GB coupling parameter\nto be rather large. As a result, the GB term would no longer be considered as\nthe correction and it also violates the boundary causality bound.

They are modelled by a simple\npseudo iso-thermal model containing only two parameters that do not allow to\nobtain insight into physics of the DM halo. We would like to obtain some\ninsight into the physical conditions in DM halos of dwarf galaxies by using a\nsimple physically based model of DM halos. In order to treat a diversity of the\ndwarf galaxy velocity profiles in a unifying framework, we apply the polytropic\nspheres characterised by the polytropic index $n$ and the relativistic\nparameter $\\sigma$ as a model of dwarf-galaxy DM halos and match the velocity\nof circular geodesics of the polytropes to the velocity curves observed in the\ndwarf galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS ensemble. We introduce three classes of\nthe LITTLE THINGS dwarf galaxies in accord with the polytrope models, due to\nthe different character of the velocity profile. The first class corresponds to\npolytropes having $n < 1$ with linearly increasing velocity along with the\nwhole profile, the second class has $1 < n < 2$ and the velocity profile\nbecomes flat in the external region, the third class has $n > 2$ and the\nvelocity profile reaches a maximum and demonstrated a decline in the external\nregion. The $\\sigma$ parameter has to be strongly non-relativistic ($\\sigma <\n10^{-8}$) for all dwarf galaxy models -- it varies for the models of each\nclass, but these variations have a negligible influence on the character of the\nvelocity profile. Our results indicate the possibility that at least two\ndifferent kinds of dark matter are behind the composition of DM halos. The\nmatches of the observational velocity curves are of the same quality as those\nobtained by the pseudo-isothermal, core-like models of dwarf galaxy DM halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 11:17:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 14:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

Originally\nbased on a data fitting process using a least-squares cost function, it\nsuffered from high sensitivity to cycle-skipping and was therefore of poor\nefficiency in handling large time shifts between observed and modelled seismic\nevents. To tackle this problem, a common practice is to start the inversion\nusing the low temporal frequencies of the data and selecting diving wave\nevents. Complementary to this, the use of other cost functions has been\ninvestigated.

The first one is\nbased on an artificial time series to explore how hyperparameters affect the\nCLeaR framework. The second one is designed with data collected from European\nwind farms to evaluate the CLeaR framework's performance in a real-world\napplication. The experimental results demonstrate that the CLeaR framework can\ncontinually acquire knowledge in the data stream and improve the prediction\naccuracy.

As the cost of pixel-level annotations\nis high, image tags are usually used as weak supervisions. However, an image\ntag can only be used to annotate one class of objects. In this paper, we\nintroduce saliency subitizing as the weak supervision since it is\nclass-agnostic. This allows the supervision to be aligned with the property of\nsaliency detection, where the salient objects of an image could be from more\nthan one class. To this end, we propose a model with two modules, Saliency\nSubitizing Module (SSM) and Saliency Updating Module (SUM). While SSM learns to\ngenerate the initial saliency masks using the subitizing information, without\nthe need for any unsupervised methods or some random seeds, SUM helps\niteratively refine the generated saliency masks.

However, much less understood is the phenomenon of network\ncoherence. Network coherence generally refers to nodes' ability in a network to\nhave a similar dynamic response despite heterogeneity in their individual\nbehavior. In this paper, we develop a general framework to analyze and quantify\nthe level of network coherence that a system exhibits by relating coherence\nwith a low-rank property of the system. More precisely, for a networked system\nwith linear dynamics and coupling, we show that, as the network connectivity\ngrows, the system transfer matrix converges to a rank-one transfer matrix\nrepresenting the coherent behavior. Interestingly, the non-zero eigenvalue of\nsuch a rank-one matrix is given by the harmonic mean of individual nodal\ndynamics, and we refer to it as the coherent dynamics. Our analysis unveils the\nfrequency-dependent nature of coherence and a non-trivial interplay between\ndynamics and network topology. We further show that many networked systems can\nexhibit similar coherent behavior by establishing a concentration result in a\nsetting with randomly chosen individual nodal dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 13:55:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 18:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

The quality of these\ngenerated images has recently reached such levels that can often lead both\nmachines and humans into mistaking fake for real examples. However, the process\nperformed by the generator of the GAN has some limitations when we want to\ncondition the network to generate images from subcategories of a specific\nclass. Some recent approaches tackle this \\textit{conditional generation} by\nintroducing extra information prior to the training process, such as image\nsemantic segmentation or textual descriptions. While successful, these\ntechniques still require defining beforehand the desired subcategories and\ncollecting large labeled image datasets representing them to train the GAN from\nscratch.

By downfolding a correlation function covering all of Fock\nspace into the observable portion, we derive a nonlocal Dyson equation which\ndepends on an unknown downfolding frequency. The downfolding frequency is\ndetermined by solving the inverse problem so that the spectral function of the\nsingle-particle propagator is a Dirac-$\\delta$ function. Upon measurement, the\nsystem collapses stochastically onto one of these normalized solutions. This\ncollapse has a nonlocal effect on the path the particle takes, in agreement\nwith quantum entanglement. We postulate that the multiplicity of each quantized\nsolution is directly related to the ensemble averaged spectrum and the entropy\ncreated by measurement of the particle.\n  In the final part, we outline a new picture of dynamics in quantum many-body\nsystems. As a function of the coupling strength, the multiplicity for collapse\nhas a complicated form due to the shape of the quantization condition. This\nstructure creates an entropic force from counting quantized solutions which is\npredominantly attractive but likely also has a narrow repulsive regime at weak\ncoupling. Upon collapse, an internal spacetime forms between the two points in\norder to carry the information gained from the reduction of the probabilistic\nmany-body state. The repeated creation of these spacetime bridges defines an\ninternal spacetime with a complicated shape and history. We treat the quantum\nsystem as a finite informational resource that holds information about possible\nnormalized outcomes, collapses the wave function to reset after encountering a\nconflict, and creates an internal spacetime to carry the information gained\nwith every collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 14:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

In 2D classical systems, or in 1D quantum systems, the commensurate\nmelting of a period-p phase with p larger than 4 is known to take place through\nan intermediate floating phase where correlations between domain walls or\nparticles decay only as a power law, but when p is equal to 3 or 4, it has been\nargued by Huse and Fisher that the transition could also be direct and\ncontinuous in a non-conformal chiral universality class with a dynamical\nexponent larger than 1. This is only possible however if the floating phase\nterminates at a Lifshitz point before reaching the conformal point, a\npossibility debated since then. Here we argue that this is a generic feature of\nmodels where the number of particles is not conserved because the exponent of\nthe floating phase changes along the Pokrovsky-Talapov transition and can thus\nreach the value at which the floating phase becomes unstable. Furthermore, we\nshow numerically that this scenario is realized in an effective model of the\nperiod-3 phase of Rydberg chains in which hard-core bosons are created and\nannihilated three by three: The Luttinger liquid parameter reaches the critical\nvalue $p^2/8=9/8$ along the Pokrovsky-Talapov transition, leading to a Lifshitz\npoint that separates the floating phase from a chiral transition.

However, subsequent hydrogen abstraction reactions of\nSH+, H2S+, and S with vibrationally excited H2, fail to ultimately explain the\nobserved H2S column density (~2.5x10^14 cm^-2, with an ortho-to-para ratio of\n2.9+/-0.3). To overcome these bottlenecks, we build PDR models that include a\nsimple network of grain surface reactions leading to the formation of solid H2S\n(s-H2S). The higher adsorption binding energies of S and SH suggested by recent\nstudies imply that S atoms adsorb on grains (and form s-H2S) at warmer dust\ntemperatures and closer to the UV-illuminated edges of molecular clouds.\nPhotodesorption and, to a lesser extent, chemical desorption, produce roughly\nthe same H2S column density (a few 10^14 cm-^2) and abundance peak (a few\n10^-8) nearly independently of n_H and G_0. This agrees with the observed H2S\ncolumn density in the Orion Bar as well as at the edges of dark clouds without\ninvoking substantial depletion of elemental sulfur abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 14:45:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

Numerous studies have suggested that MFRs require a minimum twist\nin order to remain coherent during their rise. Furthermore, even MFRs that get\nto the photosphere may be unable to successfully emerge into the corona unless\nthey are at least moderately twisted, since the magnetic pressure gradient\nneeds to overcome the weight of the photospheric plasma. To date, however, no\nlower limit has been placed on the critical minimum twist required for an MFR\nto rise coherently through the convection zone or emerge through the\nphotosphere. In this paper, we simulate an untwisted toroidal MFR which is able\nto rise from the convection zone and emerge through the photosphere as an\nactive region that resembles those observed on the Sun. We show that untwisted\nMFRs can remain coherent during their rise and then pile-up near the\nphotosphere, triggering the undular instability, allowing the MFR to emerge\nthrough the photosphere. We propose that the toroidal geometry of our MFR is\ncritical for its coherent rise. Upon emerging, a pair of lobes rises into the\ncorona which interact and reconnect, resulting in a localized high speed jet.\nThe resulting photospheric magnetogram displays the characteristic\nsalt-and-pepper structure often seen in observations. Our major result is that\nMFRs need not be twisted to rise coherently through the convection zone and\nemerge through the photosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 15:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

To give an overall feature of the spectrum of hadronic molecules\ncomposed of a pair of heavy-antiheavy hadrons, namely, which pairs are possible\nto form molecular states, we take charmed hadrons for example to investigate\nthe interaction between them and search for poles by solving the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation.

Most existing black-box attacks fool the\ntarget model by interacting with it many times and producing global\nperturbations. However, global perturbations change the smooth and\ninsignificant background, which not only makes the perturbation more easily be\nperceived but also increases the query overhead. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel framework to perturb the discriminative areas of clean examples only\nwithin limited queries in black-box attacks. Our framework is constructed based\non two types of transferability. The first one is the transferability of model\ninterpretations. Based on this property, we identify the discriminative areas\nof a given clean example easily for local perturbations. The second is the\ntransferability of adversarial examples. It helps us to produce a local\npre-perturbation for improving query efficiency. After identifying the\ndiscriminative areas and pre-perturbing, we generate the final adversarial\nexamples from the pre-perturbed example by querying the targeted model with two\nkinds of black-box attack techniques, i.e., gradient estimation and random\nsearch. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our framework can\nsignificantly improve the query efficiency during black-box perturbing with a\nhigh attack success rate. Experimental results show that our attacks outperform\nstate-of-the-art black-box attacks under various system settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 15:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

We show that the universality and the inclusion problems can be\nsolved with 2-EXPTIME complexity when the input automata are without guessing\nand unambiguous, improving on the currently best-known 2-EXPSPACE upper bound\nby Mottet and Quaas. When the number of registers of both automata is fixed, we\nobtain a lower EXPTIME complexity, also improving the EXPSPACE upper bound from\nMottet and Quaas for fixed number of registers. We reduce inclusion to\nuniversality, and then we reduce universality to the problem of counting the\nnumber of orbits of runs of the automaton. We show that the orbit-counting\nfunction satisfies a system of bidimensional linear recursive equations with\npolynomial coefficients (linrec), which generalises analogous recurrences for\nthe Stirling numbers of the second kind, and then we show that universality\nreduces to the zeroness problem for linrec sequences. While such a counting\napproach is classical and has successfully been applied to unambiguous finite\nautomata and grammars over finite alphabets, its application to register\nautomata over infinite alphabets is novel. We provide two algorithms to decide\nthe zeroness problem for bidimensional linear recursive sequences arising from\norbit-counting functions. Both algorithms rely on techniques from linear\nnon-commutative algebra. The first algorithm performs variable elimination and\nhas elementary complexity. The second algorithm is a refined version of the\nfirst one and it relies on the computation of the Hermite normal form of\nmatrices over a skew polynomial field.

Classical registration methods solve an\noptimization problem to find a set of spatial correspondences between two\nimages, while learning-based methods leverage a training dataset to learn a\nfunction that generates these correspondences. The quality of the results for\nboth types of techniques depends greatly on the choice of hyperparameters.\nUnfortunately, hyperparameter tuning is time-consuming and typically involves\ntraining many separate models with various hyperparameter values, potentially\nleading to suboptimal results. To address this inefficiency, we introduce\namortized hyperparameter learning for image registration, a novel strategy to\nlearn the effects of hyperparameters on deformation fields. The proposed\nframework learns a hypernetwork that takes in an input hyperparameter and\nmodulates a registration network to produce the optimal deformation field for\nthat hyperparameter value. In effect, this strategy trains a single, rich model\nthat enables rapid, fine-grained discovery of hyperparameter values from a\ncontinuous interval at test-time. We demonstrate that this approach can be used\nto optimize multiple hyperparameters considerably faster than existing search\nstrategies, leading to a reduced computational and human burden as well as\nincreased flexibility. We also show several important benefits, including\nincreased robustness to initialization and the ability to rapidly identify\noptimal hyperparameter values specific to a registration task, dataset, or even\na single anatomical region, all without retraining the HyperMorph model.

An epileptic seizure acts like a temporary shock to the\nneuronal system, disrupting normal electrical activity in the brain. Epilepsy\nis frequently diagnosed with electroencephalograms (EEGs). Current methods\nstudy the time-varying spectra and coherence but do not directly model changes\nin extreme behavior. Thus, we propose a new approach to characterize brain\nconnectivity based on the joint tail behavior of the EEGs. Our proposed method,\nthe conditional extremal dependence for brain connectivity (Conex-Connect), is\na pioneering approach that links the association between extreme values of\nhigher oscillations at a reference channel with the other brain network\nchannels. Using the Conex-Connect method, we discover changes in the extremal\ndependence driven by the activity at the foci of the epileptic seizure. Our\nmodel-based approach reveals that, pre-seizure, the dependence is notably\nstable for all channels when conditioning on extreme values of the focal\nseizure area. Post-seizure, by contrast, the dependence between channels is\nweaker, and dependence patterns are more \"chaotic\". Moreover, in terms of\nspectral decomposition, we find that high values of the high-frequency\nGamma-band are the most relevant features to explain the conditional extremal\ndependence of brain connectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 18:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

The studied contact is a\ncobalt-based alloy subjected to fretting against an alumina sample. At high\ntemperature, a protective third body is spontaneously created at the interface\nand presents excellent tribological properties. The formation of the so-called\n''glaze layer'' leads to an absence of wear. The investigation presents on\ncomplete description of the hightemperature tribolayer with microstructural,\nchemical and mechanical characterizations. The glaze layer regime is mainly\nrelated to a threshold temperature above which a thin cobalt-rich layer is\nformed by a tribo-sintering process. A formalization of the tribo-sintering\nprocess is proposed to predict the necessary number of fretting cycles N GL to\nform the glaze layer. The tribo-sintering process prevents wear debris ejection\nby continuously re-incorporating the wear debris particles in the glaze layer.\nThe re-incorporation of the wear debris may be the reason for the absence of\nwear of the fretted interface from a macroscopic point of view. Finally, the\npaper presents an extended friction energy wear approach taking into account\ntribo-oxidation and tribo-sintering considerations.
