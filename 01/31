Our approach consists of modulating the perceived intensity (frequency\nand pulse width modulation) of the electrotactile stimuli according to the\nregistered interpenetration distance. In a user study (N=21), we assessed the\nperformance of four different interpenetration feedback approaches:\nelectrotactile-only, visual-only, electrotactile and visual, and no\ninterpenetration feedback. First, the results showed that contact precision and\naccuracy were significantly improved when using interpenetration feedback.\nSecond, and more interestingly, there were no significant differences between\nvisual and electrotactile feedback when the calibration was optimized and the\nuser was familiarized with electrotactile feedback.

In the database field, various proposals and products address temporal\ndata. The difficulty with most of the current approaches to modeling\ntemporality is that they represent and record time as just another type of data\n(e.g., values of a bank balance or amounts of money), instead of appreciating\nthat time and its values are unique, in comparison to typical data attributes.\nTime is an engulfing phenomenon that lifts a system s entire model from\nstaticity to dynamism and beyond. In this paper, we propose a conceptualization\nof temporality involving the construction of a multilevel modeling method that\nprogresses from static representation to system compositions that form regions\nof dynamism. Then, a chronology of events is used to define the system s\nbehavior. Lastly, the events are viewed as data sources with which to build a\ntemporal model. A case-study model of a temporal banking-management system\ndatabase that extends UML and the object-constraint language is re-modeled\nusing thinging machine (TM) modeling. The resultant TM diagrammatic\nspecification delivers a new approach to temporality that can be extended to be\na holistic monitoring system for historic data and events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2021 16:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

Variation in the objects to-be-imaged is an\nimportant source of variability that can significantly limit observer\nperformance. This object variability can be described by stochastic object\nmodels (SOMs). In order to establish SOMs that can accurately model realistic\nobject variability, it is desirable to use experimental data. To achieve this,\nan augmented generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture called\nAmbientGAN has been developed and investigated. However, AmbientGANs cannot be\nimmediately trained by use of advanced GAN training methods such as the\nprogressive growing of GANs (ProGANs). Therefore, the ability of AmbientGANs to\nestablish realistic object models is limited. To circumvent this, a\nprogressively-growing AmbientGAN (ProAmGAN) has been proposed. However,\nProAmGANs are designed for generating two-dimensional (2D) images while medical\nimaging modalities are commonly employed for imaging three-dimensional (3D)\nobjects. Moreover, ProAmGANs that employ traditional generator architectures\nlack the ability to control specific image features such as fine-scale textures\nthat are frequently considered when optimizing imaging systems. In this study,\nwe address these limitations by proposing two advanced AmbientGAN\narchitectures: 3D ProAmGANs and Style-AmbientGANs (StyAmGANs). Stylized\nnumerical studies involving magnetic resonance (MR) imaging systems are\nconducted. The ability of 3D ProAmGANs to learn 3D SOMs from imaging\nmeasurements and the ability of StyAmGANs to control fine-scale textures of\nsynthesized objects are demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2021 18:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

As it is a very recent technology and is still in its infancy,\nthe current SNOW implementation uses the USRP devices as LPWAN nodes, which has\nhigh costs (~$750 USD per device) and large form-factors, hindering its\napplicability in practical deployment.

Shortening acquisition time and reducing the motion-artifact are two of\nthe most critical issues in MRI. As a promising solution, high-quality MRI\nimage restoration provides a new approach to achieve higher resolution without\ncosting additional acquisition time or modification on the pulse sequences.\nRecently, as to the rise of deep learning, convolutional neural networks have\nbeen proposed for super-resolution (SR) image generation and motion-artifact\nreduction (MAR) for MRI. Recent studies suggest that using perceptual feature\nspace loss and k space loss to capture the perceptual information and\nhigh-frequency information of images, respectively. However, the quality of\nreconstructed SR and MAR MR images is limited because the most important\ndetails of the informative area in the MR image, the edges and the structure,\ncannot be very well restored.

Such\ninconsistencies lead to performance degradation in the reconstruction of SR\nimages as well.

An\nunsolved issue is how to selectively excite one qubit deep in a 3D atomic array\nto Rydberg states. In this work, we show two methods for this purpose. The\nfirst method relies on a well-known result: in a dipole transition between two\nquantum states driven by two off-resonant fields of equal strength but opposite\ndetunings $\\pm\\Delta$, the transition is characterized by two counter-rotating\nRabi frequencies $\\Omega e^{\\pm i\\Delta t}$~[or $\\pm\\Omega e^{\\pm i\\Delta t}$\nif the two fields have a $\\pi$-phase difference]. This pair of detuned fields\nlead to a time-dependent Rabi frequency $2\\Omega \\cos(\\Delta t)$~[or $2i\\Omega\n\\sin(\\Delta t)$], so that a full transition between the two levels is\nrecovered. We show that when the two detuned fields are sent in different\ndirections, one atom in a 3D optical lattice can be selectively addressed for\nRydberg excitation, and when its state is restored, the state of any nontarget\natoms irradiated in the light path is also restored. Moreover, we find that the\nRydberg excitation by this method can significantly suppress the fundamental\nblockade error of a Rydberg gate, paving the way for a high-fidelity entangling\ngate with commonly used quasi-rectangular pulse that is easily obtained by\npulse pickers. Along the way, we find a second method for single-site Rydberg\naddressing in 3D, where a selected target atom can be excited to Rydberg state\nwhile preserving the state of any nontarget atom due to a spin echo sequence.\nThe capability to selectively address a target atom in 3D atomic arrays for\nRydberg excitation makes it possible to design large-scale neutral-atom\ninformation processor based on Rydberg blockade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2021 00:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

Large inter-class similarity and\nintra-class variance is the main challenge of this task. Most exiting methods\ntry to solve this problem by designing complex model structures to explore more\nminute and discriminative regions. In this paper, we argue that mining\nmulti-regional multi-grained features is precisely the key to this task.\nSpecifically, we introduce a new loss function, termed top-down spatial\nattention loss (TDSA-Loss), which contains a multi-stage channel constrained\nmodule and a top-down spatial attention module. The multi-stage channel\nconstrained module aims to make the feature channels in different stages\ncategory-aligned. Meanwhile, the top-down spatial attention module uses the\nattention map generated by high-level aligned feature channels to make\nmiddle-level aligned feature channels to focus on particular regions. Finally,\nwe can obtain multiple discriminative regions on high-level feature channels\nand obtain multiple more minute regions within these discriminative regions on\nmiddle-level feature channels. In summary, we obtain multi-regional\nmulti-grained features. Experimental results over four widely used fine-grained\nimage classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod. Ablative studies further show the superiority of two modules in the\nproposed method.

An efficient simulation method is developed, in which the\ncritical but computationally expensive long-range interaction of dislocations\nis replaced by another projection formulation that maintains the constraint of\nequilibrium of the dislocation structure described by the Frank's formula. This\ncontinuum model is able to describe the grain boundary motion and grain\nrotation due to both coupling and sliding effects, to which the classical\nmotion by mean curvature model does not apply. Comparisons with atomistic\nsimulation results show that our continuum model is able to give excellent\npredictions of evolutions of low angle grain boundaries and their dislocation\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2021 05:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 09:46:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 14:43:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 14:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

A modern technique of estimating adsorption\nisotherms is to solve an inverse problem so that the simulated batch separation\ncoincides with actual experimental results. However, this identification\nprocess is usually ill-posed in the sense that the small noise in the measured\nresponse can lead to a large fluctuation in the estimated quantity of\nadsorption isotherms. The conventional mathematical method of solving this\nproblem is the variational regularization, which is formulated as a non-convex\nminimization problem with a regularized objective functional. However, in this\nmethod, the choice of regularization parameter and the design of a convergent\nsolution algorithm are quite difficult in practice. Moreover, due to the\nrestricted number of injection profiles in experiments, the types of measured\ndata are extremely limited, which may lead to a biased estimation. In order to\novercome these difficulties, in this paper, we develop a new inversion method\n-- the Virtual Injection Promoting Feed-forward Neural Network (VIP-FNN). In\nthis approach, the training data contain various types of artificial injections\nand synthetic noisy measurement at outlet, generated by a conventional physics\nmodel -- a time-dependent convection-diffusion system.

However, existing NAS-based methods are challenged by huge\ncomputational cost and inflexibility of applications. How to deal with multiple\nsparsity constraints simultaneously and speed up NAS-based channel pruning are\nstill open challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Accurate and Automatic\nChannel Pruning (AACP) method to address these problems. Firstly, AACP\nrepresents the structure of a model as a structure vector and introduces a\npruning step vector to control the compressing granularity of each layer.\nSecondly, AACP utilizes Pruned Structure Accuracy Estimator (PSAE) to speed up\nthe performance estimation process. Thirdly, AACP proposes Improved\nDifferential Evolution (IDE) algorithm to search the optimal structure vector\neffectively. Because of IDE, AACP can deal with FLOPs constraint and model size\nconstraint simultaneously and efficiently.

HVS perceives\nluminance differently when under different adaptation levels, and therefore our\nalgorithm uses functions built upon different scales to tone map pixels to\ndifferent values. Functions of large scales are used to maintain image\nbrightness consistency and functions of small scales are used to preserve local\ndetail and contrast.

We investigate in this direction and observe that\nexisting transformations are all applied on a single image, which might limit\nthe adversarial transferability. To this end, we propose a new input\ntransformation based attack method called Admix that considers the input image\nand a set of images randomly sampled from other categories. Instead of directly\ncalculating the gradient on the original input, Admix calculates the gradient\non the input image admixed with a small portion of each add-in image while\nusing the original label of the input to craft more transferable adversaries.\nEmpirical evaluations on standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that Admix could\nachieve significantly better transferability than existing input transformation\nmethods under both single model setting and ensemble-model setting.

The estimated structural lattice\nparameters were consistent with the prior report. The mechanical and dynamical\nstability of these compounds have been established theoretically. The materials\nare brittle in nature and elastically anisotropic. The value of fracture\ntoughness, KIC for the B6S and B6Se are ~ 2.07 MPam0.5, evaluating the\nresistance to limit the crack propagation inside the materials. Both B6S and\nB6Se compounds possess high hardness values in the range 31-35 GPa, and have\nthe potential to be prominent members of the class of hard compounds. Strong\ncovalent bonding and sharp peak at low energy below the Fermi level confirmed\nby partial density of states (PDOS) resulted in the high hardness. The profile\nof band structure, as well as DOS, assesses the indirect semiconducting nature\nof the titled compounds. The comparatively high value of Debye temperature\n({\\Theta}D), minimum thermal conductivity (Kmin), lattice thermal conductivity\n(kph), low thermal expansion coefficient, and low density suggest that both\nboron-rich chalcogenides might be used as thermal management materials. Large\nabsorption capacities in the mid ultraviolet region (3.2-15 eV) of the studied\nmaterials and low reflectivity (~16 %) are significantly noted. Such favorable\nfeatures give promise to the compounds under investigation to be used in UV\nsurface-disinfection devices as well as medical sterilizer equipment\napplications.

It is also shown that the modified TET model equation used in\nthe literature for consideration of repair is inconsistent with the model\nassumptions and requires an additional model parameter.

During the training process, the MOW-Net learns a\nmapping from samples in MOS to the corresponding class-specific weight.

Essential climate variables, such as\nsurface air temperature, describe this dynamics. Our current interglacial, the\nHolocene (11,700 yr ago to today), has been characterized by small variations\nin global mean temperature prior to anthropogenic warming. However, the\nmechanisms and spatiotemporal patterns of fluctuations around this mean, called\ntemperature variability, are poorly understood despite their socio-economic\nrelevance. Here, we examine discrepancies between temperature variability from\nmodel simulations and paleoclimate reconstructions by categorizing the scaling\nbehavior of local and global surface air temperature on the timescale of years\nto centuries. To this end, we contrast power spectral densities (PSD) and their\npower-law scaling using simulated and observation-based temperature series of\nthe last 6000 yr. We further introduce the spectral gain to disentangle the\nexternally forced and internally generated variability as a function of\ntimescale. It is based on our estimate of the joint PSD of radiative forcing,\nwhich exhibits a scale break around the period of 7 yr. We find that local\ntemperature series from paleoclimate reconstructions show a different scaling\nbehavior than simulated ones, with a tendency towards stronger persistence\n(i.e., correlation between successive values within a time series) on periods\nof 10 to 200 yr. Conversely, the PSD and spectral gain of global mean\ntemperature are consistent across data sets. Our results point to the\nlimitation of climate models to fully represent local temperature statistics\nover decades to centuries. By highlighting the key characteristics of\ntemperature variability, we pave a way to better constrain possible changes in\ntemperature variability with global warming and assess future climate risks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2021 14:08:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 15:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

Drawing on feminist\nscience and technology studies (STS) perspectives, we demonstrate how machine\ndesigners are not just crafting neutral objects, but relationships between\nmachines and humans that are entangled in human social issues such as gender\nand power dynamics. Thus, in order to create a more ethical and just future,\nthe dominant assumptions currently underpinning the design of these\nhuman-machine relations must be challenged and reoriented toward relations of\njustice and inclusivity. This paper contributes the \"social machine\" as a model\nfor technology designers who seek to recognize the importance, diversity and\ncomplexity of the social in their work, and to engage with the agential power\nof machines. In our model, the social machine is imagined as a potentially\nequitable relationship partner that has agency and as an \"other\" that is\ndistinct from, yet related to, humans, objects, and animals. We critically\nexamine and contrast our model with tendencies in robotics that consider robots\nas tools, human companions, animals or creatures, and/or slaves. In doing so,\nwe demonstrate ingrained dominant assumptions about human-machine relations and\nreveal the challenges of radical thinking in the social machine design space.\nFinally, we present two design challenges based on non-anthropomorphic\nfiguration and mutuality, and call for experimentation, unlearning dominant\ntendencies, and reimagining of sociotechnical futures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2021 15:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}
