We here make a new\nstep in this direction, for some metrically defined graph classes.\nSpecifically, a subgraph $H$ of a graph $G$ is called a retract of $G$ if it is\nthe image of some idempotent endomorphism of $G$. Two necessary conditions for\n$H$ being a retract of $G$ is to have $H$ is an isometric and isochromatic\nsubgraph of $G$. We say that $H$ is an absolute retract of some graph class\n${\\cal C}$ if it is a retract of any $G \\in {\\cal C}$ of which it is an\nisochromatic and isometric subgraph.

In particular, Bayesian inferences for high-dimensional spatial processes\nare being sought in a variety of remote-sensing applications including, but not\nlimited to, modeling next generation Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)\nsystems and other remotely sensed data. Massively scalable spatial processes,\nin particular Gaussian processes (GPs), are being explored extensively for the\nincreasingly encountered big data settings.

Most of the prior approaches to fairness-aware recommendation have\nbeen situated in a static or one-shot setting, where the protected groups of\nitems are fixed, and the model provides a one-time fairness solution based on\nfairness-constrained optimization. This fails to consider the dynamic nature of\nthe recommender systems, where attributes such as item popularity may change\nover time due to the recommendation policy and user engagement. For example,\nproducts that were once popular may become no longer popular, and vice versa.\nAs a result, the system that aims to maintain long-term fairness on the item\nexposure in different popularity groups must accommodate this change in a\ntimely fashion.\n  Novel to this work, we explore the problem of long-term fairness in\nrecommendation and accomplish the problem through dynamic fairness learning. We\nfocus on the fairness of exposure of items in different groups, while the\ndivision of the groups is based on item popularity, which dynamically changes\nover time in the recommendation process. We tackle this problem by proposing a\nfairness-constrained reinforcement learning algorithm for recommendation, which\nmodels the recommendation problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process\n(CMDP), so that the model can dynamically adjust its recommendation policy to\nmake sure the fairness requirement is always satisfied when the environment\nchanges.

There have been many nods to interpretations similar to ours -\nfor example, in Dunn (1976), Belnap (1977). The laboratory interpretation was\noutlined in Bilkova et al. (2010).\n  Our system is built on the Routley--Meyer semantics for relevant logic\nequipped with a four-valued valuation of formulas, where labs stand in for\nsituations, and the four values reflect the complexity of assessing results of\nexperiments. This semantics avoids using the Routley star, on the cost of\nintroducing a further relation, required in evaluating falsity assignments of\nimplication. We can however provide a natural interpretation of two\naccessibility relations - confirmation and refutation of hypotheses are two\nindependent processes in our laboratory setup. This setup motivates various\nbasic properties of the accessibility relations, as well as a number of other\npossible restrictions. This gives us a flexible modular system which can be\nadjusted to specific epistemic contexts.\n  As perfect regularities are rarely, or perhaps never, actually observed, we\nadd probabilities to the logical framework. As our logical framework is\nnon-classical, the probability is non-classical as well, satisfying a weaker\nversion of Kolmogorov axioms (cf. Priest 2006). We show that these\nprobabilities allow for a relative frequency as well as for a subjective\ninterpretation (we provide a Dutch book argument). We further show how to\nupdate the probabilities and to distinguish conditional probabilities from the\nprobability of conditionals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2021 18:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

A characteristic mark of the inverse proximity effect arises in the\ninduced spin-polarization at the TSC interface. This is unexpectedly stronger\nwhen the magnetic proximity is weaker, thus unveiling immediate detection\nsignatures for spin-triplet pairs. We show that an anomalous magnetic proximity\ncan occur at the interface between the itinerant ferromagnet, SrRuO$_3$, and\nthe unconventional superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.

Traditional methods for reconstructing 3D volumes from 2D\nradiographs, such as filtered backprojection, require radiographs from at least\ntwo different angles or lines of sight (LOS). In ICF experiments, space for\ndiagnostics is limited and cameras that can operate on the fast timescales are\nexpensive to implement, limiting the number of projections that can be\nacquired. To improve the imaging quality as a result of this limitation,\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) have recently been shown to be capable of\nproducing 3D models from visible light images or medical X-ray images rendered\nby volumetric computed tomography LOS (SLOS).

In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for solving two\nvariants of SSPPR: (i) high-precision queries and (ii) approximate queries.

The strength of crust Urca neutrino\ncooling depends sensitively on the electron-capture and $\\beta$-decay\nground-state to ground-state transition strengths of neutron-rich rare\nisotopes. Nuclei with mass number $A=61$ are predicted to be among the most\nabundant in accreted crusts, and the last remaining experimentally undetermined\nground-state to ground-state transition strength was the $\\beta$-decay of\n$^{61}$V. This work reports the first experimental determination of this\ntransition strength, a ground-state branching of 8.1$^{+2.2}_{-2.0} \\%$,\ncorresponding to a log $ft$ value of 5.5$^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$. This result was\nachieved through the measurement of the $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ rays using the\ntotal absorption spectrometer SuN and the measurement of the $\\beta$-delayed\nneutron branch using the neutron long counter system NERO at the National\nSuperconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University. This method\nhelps to mitigate the impact of the Pandemonium effect in extremely\nneutron-rich nuclei on experimental results. The result implies that $A=61$\nnuclei do not provide the strongest cooling in accreted neutron star crusts as\nexpected by some predictions, but that their cooling is still larger compared\nto most other mass numbers. Only nuclei with mass numbers 31, 33, and 55 are\npredicted to be cooling more strongly. However, the theoretical predictions for\nthe transition strengths of these nuclei are not consistently accurate enough\nto draw conclusions on crust cooling. With the experimental approach developed\nin this work all relevant transitions are within reach to be studied in the\nfuture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 02:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

As a whole, our SMG\nsample shows a tight anti-correlation between\n($R_\\mathrm{e,dust}/R_\\mathrm{e,star}$) and far-infrared surface brightness\n($\\Sigma_\\mathrm{IR}$) over a factor of $\\simeq$ 1000 in $\\Sigma_\\mathrm{IR}$.\nThis indicates that SMGs with less vigorous star formation (i.e., lower\n$\\Sigma_\\mathrm{IR}$) lack central starburst and are likely to retain a broader\nspatial distribution of star formation over the whole galaxies (i.e., larger\n$R_\\mathrm{e,dust}/R_\\mathrm{e,star}$). The same trend can be reproduced with\ncosmological simulations as a result of central starburst and potentially\nsubsequent \"inside-out\" quenching, which likely accounts for the emergence of\ncompact quiescent galaxies at $z\\sim2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 02:41:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

A prerequisite ensuring the\nsuccess of these methods depends on a wealth of run-to-failure data, however,\nrun-to-failure data may be insufficient in practice. That is, conducting a\nsubstantial amount of destructive experiments not only is high costs, but also\nmay cause catastrophic consequences. Out of this consideration, an enhanced RUL\nframework focusing on data self-generation is put forward for both non-cyclic\nand cyclic degradation patterns for the first time. It is designed to enrich\ndata from a data-driven way, generating realistic-like time-series to enhance\ncurrent RUL methods. First, high-quality data generation is ensured through the\nproposed convolutional recurrent generative adversarial network (CR-GAN), which\nadopts a two-channel fusion convolutional recurrent neural network. Next, a\nhierarchical framework is proposed to combine generated data into current RUL\nestimation methods. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is verified\nthrough both non-cyclic and cyclic degradation systems. With the enhanced RUL\nframework, an aero-engine system following non-cyclic degradation has been\ntested using three typical RUL models. State-of-art RUL estimation results are\nachieved by enhancing capsule network with generated time-series. Specifically,\nestimation errors evaluated by the index score function have been reduced by\n21.77%, and 32.67% for the two employed operating conditions, respectively.\nBesides, the estimation error is reduced to zero for the Lithium-ion battery\nsystem, which presents cyclic degradation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 02:44:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

The proposed method solves the pattern recognition problem for\ncable damage detection through time series classification (TSC) in deep\nlearning, considering that the cable's behavior can be implicitly represented\nby the measured cable force series. A deep learning model, long short term\nmemory fully convolutional network (LSTM-FCN), is leveraged by assigning\nappropriate inputs and representative class labels for the TSC problem, First,\na TSC classifier is trained and validated using the data collected under intact\nconditions of stay cables, setting the segmented data series as input and the\ncable (or cable pair) ID as class labels. Subsequently, the classifier is\ntested using the data collected under possible damaged conditions. Finally, the\ncable or cable pair corresponding to the least classification accuracy is\nrecommended as the most probable damaged cable or cable pair. The proposed\nmethod was tested on an in-service cable-stayed bridge with damaged stay\ncables. Two scenarios in the proposed TSC scheme were investigated: 1) raw time\nseries of cable forces were fed into the classifiers; and 2) cable force ratios\nwere inputted in the classifiers considering the possible variation of force\ndistribution between cable pairs due to cable damage. Combining the results of\nTSC testing in these two scenarios, the cable with rupture was correctly\nidentified.

Most data-driven SoC models are built for a\nfixed ambient temperature, which neglect the high sensitivity of LiBs to\ntemperature and may cause severe prediction errors. Nevertheless, a systematic\nevaluation of the impact of temperature on SoC estimation and ways for a prompt\nadjustment of the estimation model to new temperatures using limited data have\nbeen hardly discussed. To solve these challenges, a novel SoC estimation method\nis proposed by exploiting temporal dynamics of measurements and transferring\nconsistent estimation ability among different temperatures. First, temporal\ndynamics, which is presented by correlations between the past fluctuation and\nthe future motion, is extracted using canonical variate analysis. Next, two\nmodels, including a reference SoC estimation model and an estimation ability\nmonitoring model, are developed with temporal dynamics. The monitoring model\nprovides a path to quantitatively evaluate the influences of temperature on SoC\nestimation ability. After that, once the inability of the reference SoC\nestimation model is detected, consistent temporal dynamics between temperatures\nare selected for transfer learning. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed\nmethod is verified through a benchmark.

However, for video action recognition,\nthe action of interest might only exist in arbitrary clips of untrimmed web\nvideos, resulting in high label noises in the temporal space. To address this\nissue, we introduce a new method for pre-training video action recognition\nmodels using queried web videos. Instead of trying to filter out, we propose to\nconvert the potential noises in these queried videos to useful supervision\nsignals by defining the concept of Sub-Pseudo Label (SPL). Specifically, SPL\nspans out a new set of meaningful \"middle ground\" label space constructed by\nextrapolating the original weak labels during video querying and the prior\nknowledge distilled from a teacher model. Consequently, SPL provides enriched\nsupervision for video models to learn better representations. SPL is fairly\nsimple and orthogonal to popular teacher-student self-training frameworks\nwithout extra training cost. We validate the effectiveness of our method on\nfour video action recognition datasets and a weakly-labeled image dataset to\nstudy the generalization ability. Experiments show that SPL outperforms several\nexisting pre-training strategies using pseudo-labels and the learned\nrepresentations lead to competitive results when fine-tuning on HMDB-51 and\nUCF-101 compared with recent pre-training methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 05:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

However, the usual experimental measurement may not distinguish the\ndifference between the two categories of edge bands. Here we study the varying\nrule for the edge bands of PNRs under an external electrostatic field. By using\nthe KWANT code based on the tight-binding approach, we find that the\ntwofold-degenerate edge bands can be divided into two separated shuttles until\nthe degeneracy is completely removed and a gap near EFis opened under a\nsufficiently strong in-plane electric field. Importantly, each shuttle from the\nribbon upper or lower edge outmost atoms is identified according to the local\ndensity of states. However, under a small off-plane field the shuttle-shaped\nbands are easily induced into two near-flat bands contributed from the edge\natoms of the top and bottom sublayers, respectively. The evidence provides the\nedge and sublayer degrees of freedom (DOF) for the PNRs with shuttle-shaped\nedge bands, of which is obviously different from another category PNRs\nintrinsically with near-flat edge bands. This is because that the former\ncategory of ribbons solely have four zigzag-like atomic configurations at the\nedges in each unit cell, which also results in that the property is robust\nagainst the point defect in the ribbon center area. As an application,\nfurthermore, based on this issue we propose a homogenous junction of a\nshuttle-edge-band PNR attached by two electric gates. Interestingly, the\ntransport property of the junction with field manipulation well reflects the\ncharacteristics of the two DOFs.

Such compromised practice results in the increasing burden to\ndevelopers in future development. The metaphor, technical debt, describes such\npractice. Prior research has illustrated the negative impact of technical debt,\nand many researchers investigated how developers deal with a certain type of\ntechnical debt. However, few studies focused on the removal of different types\nof technical debt in practice.\n  To fill this gap, we use the introduction and removal of different types of\nself-admitted technical debt (i.e., SATD) in 7 deep learning frameworks as an\nexample. This is because deep learning frameworks are some of the most\nimportant software systems today due to their prevalent use in life-impacting\ndeep learning applications. Moreover, the field of the development of different\ndeep learning frameworks is the same, which enables us to find common behaviors\non the removal of different types of technical debt across projects. By mining\nthe file history of these frameworks, we find that design debt is introduced\nthe most along the development process. As for the removal of technical debt,\nwe find that requirement debt is removed the most, and design debt is removed\nthe fastest. Most of test debt, design debt, and requirement debt are removed\nby the developers who introduced them. Based on the introduction and removal of\ndifferent types of technical debt, we discuss the evolution of the frequencies\nof different types of technical debt to depict the unresolved sub-optimal\ntrade-offs or decisions that are confronted by developers along the development\nprocess. We also discuss the removal patterns of different types of technical\ndebt, highlight future research directions, and provide recommendations for\npractitioners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 07:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

A fermentation process uses living cells with\ncomplex biological mechanisms, and this leads to high variability in the\nprocess outputs, namely, the protein and impurity levels. By building on the\nbiological mechanisms of protein and impurity growth, we introduce a stochastic\nmodel to characterize the accumulation of the protein and impurity levels in\nthe fermentation process. However, a common challenge in the industry is the\navailability of only a very limited amount of data, especially in the\ndevelopment and early stage of production. This adds an additional layer of\nuncertainty, referred to as model risk, due to the difficulty of estimating the\nmodel parameters with limited data. In this paper, we study the harvesting\ndecision for a fermentation process under model risk (i.e., when to stop the\nfermentation and collect the production reward). We adopt a Bayesian approach\nto update the unknown parameters of the growth-rate distributions, and use the\nresulting posterior distributions to characterize the impact of model risk on\nfermentation output variability. The harvesting problem is formulated as a\nMarkov decision process model with knowledge states that summarize the\nposterior distributions and hence incorporate the model risk in\ndecision-making. The resulting model is solved by using a reinforcement\nlearning algorithm based on Bayesian sparse sampling. We provide analytical\nresults on the structure of the optimal policy and its objective function, and\nexplicitly study the impact of model risk on harvesting decisions. Our case\nstudies at MSD Animal Health demonstrate that the proposed model and solution\napproach improve the harvesting decisions in real life by achieving\nsubstantially higher average output from a fermentation batch along with lower\nbatch-to-batch variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 07:47:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 21:35:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 19:09:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 22:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Hierarchial group and attribute based\naccess control (HGABAC) model was recently proposed which introduces the novel\nnotion of attribute inheritance through group membership. GURAG was\nsubsequently proposed to provide an administrative model for user attributes in\nHGABAC, building upon the ARBAC97 and GURA administrative models. The GURA\nmodel uses administrative roles to manage user attributes. The reachability\nproblem for the GURA model is to determine what attributes a particular user\ncan acquire, given a predefined set of administrative rules. This problem has\nbeen previously analyzed in the literature. In this paper, we study the user\nattribute reachability problem based on directly assigned attributes of the\nuser and attributes inherited via group memberships.

This paper discloses a novel visual inspection system for\nliquid crystal display (LCD), which is currently a dominant type in the FPD\nindustry. The system is based on two cornerstones: robust/high-performance\ndefect recognition model and cognitive visual inspection service architecture.\nA hybrid application of conventional computer vision technique and the latest\ndeep convolutional neural network (DCNN) leads to an integrated defect\ndetection, classfication and impact evaluation model that can be economically\ntrained with only image-level class annotations to achieve a high inspection\naccuracy. In addition, the properly trained model is robust to the variation of\nthe image qulity, significantly alleviating the dependency between the model\nprediction performance and the image aquisition environment. This in turn\njustifies the decoupling of the defect recognition functions from the front-end\ndevice to the back-end serivce, motivating the design and realization of the\ncognitive visual inspection service architecture. Empirical case study is\nperformed on a large-scale real-world LCD dataset from a manufacturing line\nwith different layers and products, which shows the promising utility of our\nsystem, which has been deployed in a real-world LCD manufacturing line from a\nmajor player in the world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 08:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

While the presence of hematite\n($\\alpha$-Fe2O3) was confirmed insitu by both Mastcam and ChemCam spectral\nobservations and by the CheMin instrument, neither ChemCam nor APXS observed\nany significant increase in FeO$_T$ (total iron oxide) abundances compared to\nthe Murray formation. Instead, Curiosity discovered dark-toned diagenetic\nfeatures displaying anomalously high FeO$_T$ abundances, commonly observed in\nassociation with light-toned Ca-sulfate veins but also as crystal pseudomorphs\nin the host rock. These iron-rich diagenetic features are predominantly\nobserved in \"grey\" outcrops on the upper part of the ridge, which lack the\ntelltale ferric signature of other Vera Rubin ridge outcrops. Their composition\nis consistent with anhydrous Fe-oxide, as the enrichment in iron is not\nassociated with enrichment in any other elements, nor with detections of\nvolatiles. The lack of ferric absorption features in the ChemCam reflectance\nspectra and the hexagonal crystalline structure associated with dark-toned\ncrystals points toward coarse \"grey\" hematite. In addition, the host rock\nadjacent to these features appears bleached and show low-FeO$_T$ content as\nwell as depletion in Mn, indicating mobilization of these redox-sensitive\nelements during diagenesis. Thus, groundwater fluid circulations could account\nfor the remobilization of iron and recrystallization as crystalline hematite\nduring diagenesis as well as color variations observed in the Vera Rubin ridge\noutcrops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 08:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Adversarial Inconsistent\nCognitive Sampling (DAICS) method for multi-view progressive subspace\nclustering. A multiview binary classification (easy or difficult) loss and a\nfeature similarity loss are proposed to jointly learn a binary classifier and a\ndeep consistent feature embedding network, throughout an adversarial minimax\ngame over difficulty labels of multiview consistent samples. We develop a\nmulti-view cognitive sampling strategy to select the input samples from easy to\ndifficult for multi-view clustering network training. However, the\ndistributions of easy and difficult samples are mixed together, hence not\ntrivial to achieve the goal. To resolve it, we define a sampling probability\nwith theoretical guarantee. Based on that, a golden section mechanism is\nfurther designed to generate a sample set boundary to progressively select the\nsamples with varied difficulty labels via a gate unit, which is utilized to\njointly learn a multi-view common progressive subspace and clustering network\nfor more efficient clustering.

In this work, we considered the\nmolecule fragment as basic building blocks of the metabolic components which\nhad relatively consistent signatures in MS/MS spectra. And from a bottom-up\npoint of view, we built a fragment centered database, MSFragDB, by reorganizing\nthe data from the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and developed an\nintensity-free searching algorithm to search and rank the most relative\nmetabolite according to the users' input.

During\nthis phase the planet is subject to fast type-I migration, which is mostly\ndirected inwards, and the planet can lose a significant fraction of its\nsemi-major axis. The duration of this phase is set by how long the planetary\nenvelope needs to contract until it reaches a mass similar to the mass of the\nplanetary core, which is when runaway gas accretion can set in and the planet\ncan open a deeper gap in the disc, transitioning into the slower type-II\nmigration. This envelope contraction phase depends crucially on the planetary\nmass and on the opacity inside the planetary envelope. Here we study how\ndifferent opacity prescriptions influence the envelope contraction time and how\nthis in turn influences how far the planet migrates through the disc. We find\nwithin our simulations that the size distribution of the grains as well as the\nchemical composition of the grains crucially influences how far the planet\nmigrates before it can reach the runaway gas accretion phase. Grain size\ndistributions with larger grain sizes result in less inward migration of the\ngrowing planet, due to faster gas accretion enabled by more efficient cooling.\nIn addition, we find that planets forming in water poor environments can\ncontract their envelope faster and thus migrate less, implying that gas giants\nforming in water poor environments might be located further away from their\ncentral star compared to gas giants forming in water rich environments. Future\nstudies of planet formation that aim to investigate the chemical composition of\nformed gas giants need to take these effects self consistently into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 11:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

In this\npaper, we propose a novel cross domain iterative detection algorithm to enhance\nthe error performance of OTFS modulation. Different from conventional OTFS\ndetection methods, the proposed algorithm applies basic estimation/detection\napproaches to both the time domain and delay-Doppler (DD) domain and\niteratively updates the extrinsic information from two domains with the unitary\ntransformation. In doing so, the proposed algorithm exploits the time domain\nchannel sparsity and the DD domain symbol constellation constraints. We\nevaluate the estimation/detection error variance in each domain for each\niteration and derive the state evolution to investigate the detection error\nperformance. We show that the performance gain due to iterations comes from the\nnon-Gaussian constellation constraint in the DD domain. More importantly, we\nprove the proposed algorithm can indeed converge and, in the convergence, the\nproposed algorithm can achieve almost the same error performance as the\nmaximum-likelihood sequence detection even in the presence of fractional\nDoppler shifts. Furthermore, the computational complexity associated with the\ndomain transformation is low, thanks to the structure of the discrete Fourier\ntransform (DFT) kernel. Simulation results are consistent with our analysis and\ndemonstrate a significant performance improvement compared to conventional OTFS\ndetection methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 11:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

Here we investigate the hydrodynamics of\nturbines in an infinitely large array with aligned or staggered layouts for a\nrange of streamwise and lateral turbine spacing. First, we present a\ntheoretical analysis based on an extension of the Linear Momentum Actuator Disc\nTheory (LMADT) for perfectly aligned and staggered layouts, employing a hybrid\ninviscid-viscous approach to account for the local blockage effect within each\nturbine row and the viscous (turbulent) wake mixing behind each row in a\ncoupled manner. We perform Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of open-channel flow for\n28 layouts of tidal turbines using an Actuator-Line Method with periodic\nboundary conditions. Both theoretical and LES results show that the efficiency\nof turbines (or the power of turbines for a given bulk velocity) in an aligned\narray decreases as we reduce the streamwise spacing, whereas that in a\nstaggered array remains high and may even increase due to the positive local\nblockage effect (causing the local flow velocity upstream of each turbine to\nexceed the bulk velocity) if the lateral turbine spacing is sufficiently small.\nThe LES results further reveal that the amplitude of wake meandering tends to\ndecrease as we reduce the lateral spacing, which leads to a lower wake recovery\nrate in the near-wake region. These results will help to understand and improve\nthe efficiency of tidal turbines in future large arrays, even though the\nperformance of real tidal arrays may depend not only on turbine-to-turbine\ninteractions but also on macro-scale interactions between the array and natural\ntidal currents, the latter of which are outside the scope of this study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 11:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

Consider, for example, an autonomous robot\nvehicle driving in dense, unregulated urban traffic of cars, motorcycles,\nbuses, etc. The robot vehicle has to plan in both short and long terms, in\norder to interact with many traffic participants with uncertain intentions and\ndrive effectively. Planning explicitly over a long time horizon, however,\nincurs prohibitive computational costs and is impractical under real-time\nconstraints. To achieve real-time performance for large-scale planning, this\nwork introduces a new algorithm Learning from Tree Search for Driving\n(LeTS-Drive), which integrates planning and learning in a closed loop, and\napplies it to autonomous driving in crowded urban traffic in simulation.\nSpecifically, LeTS-Drive learns a policy and its value function from data\nprovided by an online planner, which searches a sparsely-sampled belief tree;\nthe online planner in turn uses the learned policy and value functions as\nheuristics to scale up its run-time performance for real-time robot control.\nThese two steps are repeated to form a closed loop so that the planner and the\nlearner inform each other and improve in synchrony. The algorithm learns on its\nown in a self-supervised manner, without human effort on explicit data\nlabeling. Experimental results demonstrate that LeTS-Drive outperforms either\nplanning or learning alone, as well as open-loop integration of planning and\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 11:59:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 08:28:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 09:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

The detection of these\nstructures requires efficient algorithms dedicated to this task, where\ntraditional methods suffer difficulties. We present our new Detection Algorithm\nwith Wavelets for Intracluster light Studies (DAWIS), developed and optimised\nfor the detection of low surface brightness sources in images, in particular\n(but not limited to) ICL. DAWIS follows a multiresolution vision based on\nwavelet representation to detect sources, embedded in an iterative procedure\ncalled synthesis-by-analysis approach to restore the complete unmasked light\ndistribution of these sources with very good quality. The algorithm is built so\nsources can be classified based on criteria depending on the analysis goal; we\ndisplay in this work the case of ICL detection and the measurement of ICL\nfractions. We test the efficiency of DAWIS on 270 mock images of galaxy\nclusters with various ICL profiles and compare its efficiency to more\ntraditional ICL detection methods such as the surface brightness threshold\nmethod. We also run DAWIS on a real galaxy cluster image, and compare the\noutput to results obtained with previous multiscale analysis algorithms. We\nfind in simulations that in average DAWIS is able to disentangle galaxy light\nfrom ICL more efficiently, and to detect a greater quantity of ICL flux due to\nthe way it handles sky background noise. We also show that the ICL fraction, a\nmetric used on a regular basis to characterise ICL, is subject to several\nmeasurement biases both on galaxies and ICL fluxes. In the real galaxy cluster\nimage, DAWIS detects a faint and extended source with an absolute magnitude two\norders brighter than previous multiscale methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 12:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

The largest sample of possible\nprogenitors of such objects, very massive stars (VMS) with masses up to 300\nMsun, have been identified in the 30 Dor star-forming region in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC). The physics and evolution of VMS is highly uncertain,\nmainly due to their proximity to the Eddington limit. In this work we\ninvestigate the two most important effects that are thought to occur near the\nEddington limit. Enhanced mass loss through optically thick winds, and the\nformation of radially inflated stellar envelopes. We compute evolutionary\nmodels for VMS at LMC metallicity and perform a population synthesis of the\nyoung stellar population in 30 Dor. We find that enhanced mass loss and\nenvelope inflation have a dominant effect on the evolution of the most massive\nstars. While the observed mass-loss properties and the associated surface\nHe-enrichment are well described by our new models, the observed O-star\nmass-loss rates are found to cover a much larger range than theoretically\npredicted, with particularly low mass-loss rates for the youngest objects.\nAlso, the (rotational) surface enrichment in the O-star regime appears to be\nnot well understood. The positions of the most massive stars in the\nHertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) are affected by mass loss and envelope\ninflation. For instance, the majority of luminous B-supergiants in 30 Dor, and\nthe lack thereof at the highest luminosities, can be explained through the\ncombination of envelope inflation and mass loss. Finally, we find that the\nupper limit for the inferred initial stellar masses in the greater 30 Dor\nregion is significantly lower than in its central cluster R 136, implying a\nvariable upper limit for the masses of stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 12:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

We\npropose a new pruning constraint during a frequent temporal-pattern discovery\nprocess, the Semantic Adjacency Criterion [SAC], which exploits domain\nknowledge to filter out patterns that contain potentially semantically\ncontradictory components. We have defined three SAC versions, and tested their\neffect in three medical domains. We embedded these criteria in a\nfrequent-temporal-pattern discovery framework. Previously, we had informally\npresented the SAC principle and showed that using it to prune patterns enhances\nthe repeatability of their discovery in the same clinical domain.

We induced four classifiers for each task, using\nfour machine-learning methods: Random Forests, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic\nRegression. The features were frequent temporal patterns discovered in each\ndata set. SAC-based temporal pattern-discovery reduced by up to 97% the number\nof discovered patterns and by up to 98% the discovery runtime.

In\nthis article we use DNNs to disentangle components of oscillating time series,\nand recover meaningful information. We show that, because DNNs can find useful\nabstract feature representations, they can be used when prior knowledge about\nthe signal-generating process exists, but is not complete, as it is\nparticularly the case in \"new-physics\" searches. To this aim, we train our DNN\non synthetic oscillating time series to perform two tasks: a regression of the\nsignal latent parameters and signal denoising by an Autoencoder-like\narchitecture. We show that the regression and denoising performance is similar\nto those of least-square curve fittings (LS-fit) with true latent parameters'\ninitial guesses, in spite of the DNN needing no initial guesses at all. We then\nexplore applications in which we believe our architecture could prove useful\nfor time-series processing in physics, when prior knowledge is incomplete. As\nan example, we employ DNNs as a tool to inform LS-fits when initial guesses are\nunknown. We show that the regression can be performed on some latent\nparameters, while ignoring the existence of others. Because the Autoencoder\nneeds no prior information about the physical model, the remaining unknown\nlatent parameters can still be captured, thus making use of partial prior\nknowledge, while leaving space for data exploration and discoveries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 12:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

In the literature, this is commonly referred to as\nVolume-of-Fluid (VoF) interface positioning problem. The novelty of our work is\ntwofold: firstly, by recursive application of the Gaussian divergence theorem,\nthe volume of a truncated polyhedron can be computed at high efficiency, based\non summation over quantities associated to the faces of the polyhedron. One\nobtains a very convenient piecewise parametrization (within so-called brackets)\nin terms of the signed distance s to the plane $\\Gamma$. As an implication, one\ncan restrain from the costly necessity to establish topological connectivity,\nrendering the present approach most suitable for the application to\nunstructured computational meshes. Secondly, in the vicinity of the truncation\nposition s, the volume can be expressed exactly, i.e. in terms of a cubic\npolynomial of the normal distance to the PLIC plane. The local knowledge of\nderivatives enables to construct a root-finding algorithm that pairs bracketing\nand higher-order approximation.

Elastic net penalisation is\nwidely used for prediction and covariate selection. Group-adaptive elastic net\npenalisation learns from co-data to improve the prediction and covariate\nselection, by penalising important groups of covariates less than other groups.\nExisting methods are, however, computationally expensive.

The main purpose of this study is to examine the impact\nof double-diffusive convection on magnetic field generation by means of 3D\nglobal geodynamo models, in the so-called \"top-heavy\" regime of\ndouble-diffusive convection, when both thermal and compositional background\ngradients are destabilizing. Using a linear eigensolver, we begin by confirming\nthat, compared to the standard single-diffusive configuration, the onset of\nconvection is facilitated by the addition of a second buoyancy source. We next\ncarry out a systematic parameter survey by performing $79$ numerical dynamo\nsimulations. We show that a good agreement between simulated magnetic fields\nand the geomagnetic field can be attained for any partitioning of the\nconvective input power between its thermal and chemical components. On the\ncontrary, the transition between dipole-dominated and multipolar dynamos is\nfound to strongly depend on the nature of the buoyancy forcing. Classical\nparameters expected to govern this transition, such as the local Rossby number\nor the degree of equatorial symmetry of the flow, fail to capture the dipole\nbreakdown. A scale-dependent analysis of the force balance instead reveals that\nthe transition occurs when the ratio of inertial to Lorentz forces at the\ndominant length scale reaches $0.5$, regardless of the partitioning of the\nbuoyancy power. The ratio of integrated kinetic to magnetic energy $E_k/E_m$\nprovides a reasonable proxy of this force ratio. Given that $E_k/E_m \\ll 1$ in\nthe Earth's core, the geodynamo is expected to operate far from the\ndipole-multipole transition. It hence appears that the occurrence of\ngeomagnetic reversals is unlikely related to dramatic and punctual changes of\nthe amplitude of inertial forces in the Earth's core, and that another\nmechanism must be sought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 13:32:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 09:33:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 12:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

To address this issue, several\nmethods based on surrogate models have been proposed to speed up the inference\nprocess. More specifically, the calibration-emulation-sampling (CES) scheme has\nbeen proven to be successful in large dimensional UQ problems. In this work, we\npropose a novel CES approach for Bayesian inference based on deep neural\nnetwork models for the emulation phase.

In a first part, we present a comprehensive review of\ndivergent versus asymptotic series, with qed as background example, as well as\na method due to Terence Tao which conveys mathematical sense to divergent\nseries. In a second part we apply the method of Tao to the Casimir effect in\nits simplest form, consisting of perfectly conducting parallel plates, arguing\nthat the usual theory, which makes use of the Euler-MacLaurin formula, still\ncontains a residual infinity, which is eliminated in our approach.

One of the most relevant quantities for monitoring the quality of $x_k$\nis the squared $A$-norm of the error vector $x-x_k$. This quantity cannot be\neasily evaluated, however, it can be estimated. Many of the existing estimation\ntechniques are inspired by the view of CG as a procedure for approximating a\ncertain Riemann--Stieltjes integral. The most natural technique is based on the\nGauss quadrature approximation and provides a lower bound on the quantity of\ninterest. The bound can be cheaply evaluated using terms that have to be\ncomputed anyway in the forthcoming CG iterations. If the squared $A$-norm of\nthe error vector decreases rapidly, then the lower bound represents a tight\nestimate. In this paper we suggest a heuristic strategy aiming to answer the\nquestion of how many forthcoming CG iterations are needed to get an estimate\nwith the prescribed accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the\nsuggested strategy is efficient and robust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 14:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

These interactions give rise to complex and\nhigher-order system behaviors, and are encoded using data as the network's\nedges. However, distinguishing between true weak edges and low-weight edges\ncaused by noise remains a challenge. We address this problem by examining the\nhigher-order structure of noisy, weak edges added to model networks. We find\nthat the structure of low-weight, noisy edges varies according to the topology\nof the model network to which it is added. By investigating this variation more\nclosely, we see that at least three qualitative classes of noise structure\nemerge. Furthermore, we observe that the structure of noisy edges contains\nenough model-specific information to classify the model networks with moderate\naccuracy. Finally, we offer network generation rules that can drive different\ntypes of structure in added noisy edges. Our results demonstrate that noise\ndoes not present as a monolithic nuisance, but rather as a nuanced,\ntopology-dependent, and even useful entity in characterizing higher-order\nnetwork interactions. Hence, we provide an alternate approach to noise\nmanagement by embracing its role in such interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 14:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

This is an alternative to the practice of\ndistinctively formulating a custom VRP for every company with its own routing\nrequirements. Instead, we assume the presence of past vehicle routing solutions\nover similar sets of customers, and learn to make similar choices. The learning\napproach is based on the concept of learning a Markov model, which corresponds\nto a probabilistic transition matrix, rather than a deterministic distance\nmatrix. This nevertheless allows us to use existing arc routing VRP software in\ncreating the actual routings, and to optimize over both distances and\npreferences at the same time.

As healthcare is now data rich, it is possible to augment\nsafety analysis with machine learning to discover actual causes of medication\nerror from the data, and to identify where they deviate from what was predicted\nin the safety analysis. Combining these two views has the potential to enable\nthe risk of medication errors to be managed proactively and dynamically.

These\ninstabilities are fast enough to efficiently convert the free energy of plasma\nparticles into enhanced (small-scale) fluctuations with multiple implications,\nregulating the anisotropy of plasma particles. In this paper we use both linear\nand quasilinear (QL) frameworks to describe complex unstable regimes, which\nrealistically combine different temperature anisotropies of electrons and ions\n(protons). Thus parameterized are various instabilities, e.g., proton and\nelectron firehose, electromagnetic ion cyclotron, and whistler instability,\nshowing that their main linear properties are markedly altered by the interplay\nof anisotropic electrons and protons. Linear theory may predict a strong\ncompetition of two instabilities of different nature when their growth rates\nare comparable. In the QL phase wave fluctuations grow and saturate at\ndifferent levels and temporal scales, by comparison to the individual\nexcitation of the proton or electron instabilities. In addition, cumulative\neffects of the combined proton and electron induced fluctuations can markedly\nstimulate the relaxations of their temperature anisotropies. Only whistler\nfluctuations inhibit the efficiency of proton firehose fluctuations in the\nrelaxation of anisotropic protons. These results offer valuable premises for\nfurther investigations in numerical simulations, to decode the full spectrum of\nkinetic instabilities resulting from the interplay of anisotropic electrons and\nprotons in space plasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 12:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}
