The discovery\nof the cation HC3S+ was carried through the observation of four harmonically\nrelated lines in the Q band using the Yebes 40m radiotelescope, and is\nsupported by accurate ab initio calculations and laboratory measurements of its\nrotational spectrum. We derive a column density N(HC3S+) = (2.0 +/- 0.5)e11\ncm-2, which translates to an abundance ratio C3S/HC3S+ of 65 +/- 20. This ratio\nis comparable to the CS/HCS+ ratio (35 +/- 8) and is a factor of about ten\nlarger than the C3O/HC3O+ ratio previously found in the same source. However,\nthe abundance ratio HC3O+/HC3S+ is 1.0 +/- 0.5, while C3O/C3S is just 0.11. We\nalso searched for protonated C2S in TMC-1, based on ab initio calculations of\nits spectroscopic parameters, and derive a 3sigma upper limit of N(HC2S+) <\n9e11 cm-2 and a C2S/HC2S+ > 60. The observational results are compared with a\nstate-of-the-art gas-phase chemical model and conclude that HC3S+ is mostly\nformed through several pathways: proton transfer to C3S, reaction of S+ with\nc-C3H2, and reaction between neutral atomic sulfur and the ion C3H3+.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 16:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

Below we present a short survey of the recently\npublished research in this field, the emphasis being on the characteristics of\nthe variety of quantum phases supported by a few generic uniform- and\nalternating-spin $J_1-J_3$ Heisenberg chains. For the reason that the positive\n($J_3>0$) three-site couplings tend towards the formation of local quantum\ndimers, the $J_1-J_3$ spin models typically experience some spontaneous\ndimerization upon increasing $J_3$. Actually, it occurred that the established\ndimer phases in spin-$S$ $J_1-J_3$ Heisenberg chains ($S>{1}/{2}$) serve as\ncomplete analogues of the famous gapped Majumdar-Ghosh dimer phase in the\nspin-${1}/{2}$ Heisenberg chain with next-nearest-neighbor couplings.

Evaluating linear\ncombinations of the logarithm of carbon dioxide concentration and the\ngeomagnetic aa-index as a proxy for solar activity, we reproduce the sea\nsurface temperature (HadSST) since the middle of the 19th century with an\nadjusted $R^2$ value of around 87 per cent for a climate sensitivity (of TCR\ntype) in the range of 0.6 K until 1.6 K per doubling of CO$_2$. The solution of\nthe regression is quite sensitive: when including data from the last decade,\nthe simultaneous occurrence of a strong El Ni\\~no on one side and low aa-values\non the other side lead to a preponderance of solutions with relatively high\nclimate sensitivities around 1.6 K. If those later data are excluded, the\nregression leads to a significantly higher weight of the aa-index and a\ncorrespondingly lower climate sensitivity going down to 0.6 K. The plausibility\nof such low values is discussed in view of recent experimental and\nsatellite-borne measurements. We argue that a further decade of data collection\nwill be needed to allow for a reliable distinction between low and high\nsensitivity values. Based on recent ideas about a quasi-deterministic planetary\nsynchronization of the solar dynamo, we make a first attempt to predict the\naa-index and the resulting temperature anomaly for various typical CO$_2$\nscenarios. Even for the highest climate sensitivities, and an unabated linear\nCO$_2$ increase, we predict only a mild additional temperature rise of around 1\nK until the end of the century, while for the lower values an imminent\ntemperature drop in the near future, followed by a rather flat temperature\ncurve, is prognosticated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 16:30:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

Since these types of EoS parameters are\ngenerative of appreciable results in the Hilbert-Einstein model, hence we\nintend to investigate all the cases in a homogeneous $F(T)$-gravity ($T$ is the\ntorsion) through phase space analysis in precise detail. In short, three viable\nmodels of interaction between dark matter and dark energy, including\nusual-type, power-law type, and oscillating type, are investigated\ncomprehensively. It is indicated that the power-law interaction in the related\ndynamical systems should be of increasing nature with time to get more critical\npoints. Due to the failure of the oscillating model of ref. [30] in\n$F(T)$-gravity, four modified models are suggested and examined in both $F(T)$\nand Hilbert-Einstein models. As to be seen, the modified models not only are\ngenerative of critical points equivalent to that of ref. [30], but also give\nrise to further critical points covering crucial stages of the evolution of the\nuniverse. In the context of these four models, such as the old one, at early\ntimes the interactions are negligible and they commence to grow as the cosmic\ntime approaches the late-time in which the unification of early inflation and\nlate acceleration is obtained. Using an indirect method, it is shown that the\noscillating models have substantial roles in transitions between eras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 17:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

In this\npaper, we present a novel steganography scheme denoted as ITE-SYN (based on\nITEratively adversarial perturbations onto a SYNchronized-directions\nsub-image), by which security data is embedded with synchronizing modification\ndirections to enhance security and then iteratively increased perturbations are\nadded onto a sub-image to reduce loss with cover class label of the target CNN\nclassifier. Firstly an exist steganographic function is employed to compute\ninitial costs. Then the cover image is decomposed into some non-overlapped\nsub-images. After each sub-image is embedded, costs will be adjusted following\nclustering modification directions profile. And then the next sub-image will be\nembedded with adjusted costs until all secret data has been embedded. If the\ntarget CNN classifier does not discriminate the stego image as a cover image,\nbased on adjusted costs, we change costs with adversarial manners according to\nsigns of gradients back-propagated from the CNN classifier. And then a\nsub-image is chosen to be re-embedded with changed costs. Adversarial intensity\nwill be iteratively increased until the adversarial stego image can fool the\ntarget CNN classifier. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method\neffectively enhances security to counter both conventional feature-based\nclassifiers and CNN classifiers, even other non-target CNN classifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 17:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

To maintain\nrecoverability of the source data, a repairer continually reads data over a\nnetwork from nodes at an average rate $r$, and generates and writes data to\nnodes based on the read data.\n  The distributed storage source capacity is the maximum amount of source that\ncan be reliably stored for long periods of time.

Despite\nthis, existing techniques like maximum likelihood estimation are\ncomputationally inefficient due to the intractability of the normalizing\nconstant. For this reason an interest to score matching has increased being\nindependent on the normalizing constant. However, such estimator is consistent\nonly for distributions with the full space support. One of the approaches to\nmake it consistent is to add noise to the input data which is called Denoising\nScore Matching. In this work we derive analytical expression for the Denoising\nScore matching using the Kernel Exponential Family as a model distribution. The\nusage of the kernel exponential family is motivated by the richness of this\nclass of densities. To tackle the computational complexity we use Random\nFourier Features based approximation of the kernel function. The analytical\nexpression allows to drop additional regularization terms based on the\nhigher-order derivatives as they are already implicitly included. Moreover, the\nobtained expression explicitly depends on the noise variance, so the validation\nloss can be straightforwardly used to tune the noise level. Along with\nbenchmark experiments, the model was tested on various synthetic distributions\nto study the behaviour of the model in different cases. The empirical study\nshows comparable quality to the competing approaches, while the proposed method\nbeing computationally faster. The latter one enables scaling up to complex\nhigh-dimensional data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 18:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

In\nthis class, players control the inputs of smooth but possibly non-linear\nfunctions whose outputs are being applied as inputs to a convex-concave game.\nUnlike general zero-sum games, these games have a well-defined notion of\nsolution; outcomes that implement the von-Neumann equilibrium of the \"hidden\"\nconvex-concave game. We prove that if the hidden game is strictly\nconvex-concave then vanilla GDA converges not merely to local Nash, but\ntypically to the von-Neumann solution. If the game lacks strict convexity\nproperties, GDA may fail to converge to any equilibrium, however, by applying\nstandard regularization techniques we can prove convergence to a von-Neumann\nsolution of a slightly perturbed zero-sum game.

To address this gap, we attempt to analytically quantify the\nviability of RFF based DL. Precisely, in this paper, analytical proofs are\npresented demonstrating that RFF based DL architectures have lower\napproximation-error and probability of misclassification as compared to\nclassical DL architectures. In addition, a new distribution-dependent RFF is\nproposed to facilitate DL architectures with low training-complexity. Through\ncomputer simulations, the practical application of the presented analytical\nresults and the proposed distribution-dependent RFF, are depicted for various\nmachine-learning problems encountered in next-generation communication systems\nsuch as: a) line of sight (LOS)/non-line of sight (NLOS) classification, and b)\nmessage-passing based detection of low-density parity check codes (LDPC) codes\nover nonlinear visible light communication (VLC) channels. Especially in the\nlow training-data regime, the presented simulations show that significant\nperformance gains are achieved when utilizing RFF maps of observations. Lastly,\nin all the presented simulations, it is observed that the proposed\ndistribution-dependent RFFs significantly outperform RFFs, which make them\nuseful for potential machine-learning/DL based applications in the context of\nnext-generation communication systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 18:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

We use the locally measured Cosmic ray\nelectron population, demodulated for effects of the Solar wind, and other\nobservational constraints combined with a turbulent magnetic field model to\npredict the radio synchrotron emission for the Local Bubble. We find that the\nspectral index of the modelled radio emission is roughly consistent with the\nradio background. Our model can approximately reproduce the observed antenna\ntemperatures for a mean magnetic field strength B between 3-5 nT. We argue that\nthis would not violate observational constraints from pulsar measurements.\nHowever, the curvature in the predicted spectrum would mean that other, so far\nunknown sources would have to contribute below 100 MHz. Also, the magnetic\nenergy density would then dominate over thermal and cosmic ray electron energy\ndensity, likely causing an inverse magnetic cascade with large variations of\nthe radio emission in different sky directions as well as high polarisation. We\nargue that this disagrees with several observations and thus that the magnetic\nfield is probably much lower, quite possibly limited by equipartition with the\nenergy density in relativistic or thermal particles (B = 0.2-0.6 nT). In the\nlatter case, we predict a contribution of the Local Bubble to the unexplained\nradio background at most at the per cent level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 18:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

A variety of methods have\npreviously been used to remove telluric features in the optical regime and\ncalculate the planetary transmission spectrum. In this paper we present and\ncompare two such methods, specifically focusing on Na detections using\nhigh-resolution optical transmission spectra: (1) calculating the telluric\nabsorption empirically based on the airmass, and (2) using a model of the\nEarth's transmission spectrum. We test these methods on the transmission\nspectrum of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b using archival data obtained with the\nHARPS spectrograph during three transits. Using models for Centre-to-Limb\nVariation and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, spurious signals which are\nimprinted within the transmission spectrum are reduced. We find that correcting\ntellurics with an atmospheric model of the Earth is more robust and produces\nconsistent results when applied to data from different nights with changing\natmospheric conditions.

Evidence for\nan outflow arising from the Galactic center (GC) has recently been discovered\nat different wavelength. We show that the X-ray, radio, and infrared emissions\nare deeply interconnected, affecting one another and forming coherent features\non scales of hundreds of parsecs, therefore indicating a common physical link\nassociated with the GC outflow. We debate the location of the northern chimney\nand suggest that it might be located on the front side of the GC because of a\nsignificant tilt of the chimneys toward us. We report the presence of strong\nshocks at the interface between the chimneys and the interstellar medium, which\nare traced by radio and warm dust emission. We observe entrained molecular gas\noutflowing within the chimneys, revealing the multiphase nature of the outflow.\nIn particular, the molecular outflow produces a long, strong, and structured\nshock along the northwestern wall of the chimney. Because of the different\ndynamical times of the various components of the outflow, the chimneys appear\nto be shaped by directed large-scale winds launched at different epochs. The\ndata support the idea that the chimneys are embedded in an (often dominant)\nvertical magnetic field, which likely diverges with increasing latitude. We\nobserve that the thermal pressure associated with the hot plasma appears to be\nsmaller than the ram pressure of the molecular outflow and the magnetic\npressure. This leaves open the possibility that either the main driver of the\noutflow is more powerful than the observed hot plasma, or the chimneys\nrepresent a \"relic\" of past and more powerful activity. These multiwavelength\nobservations corroborate the idea that the chimneys represent the channel\nconnecting the quasi-continuous, but intermittent, activity at the GC with the\nbase of the Fermi bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

Many\npotential solutions have been suggested, which make diverse predictions about\nthe details of inflation. In particular, although any valid model must allow\nfor maintaining large planetary radii, only some allow for radii to increase\nwith time. This reinflation process would potentially occur when the incident\nflux on the planet is increased. In this work, we examine the observed\npopulation of hot Jupiters to see if they grow as their parent stars brighten\nalong the main sequence. We consider the relation between radius and other\nobservables, including mass, incident flux, age, and fractional age (age over\nmain sequence lifetime), and show that main sequence brightening is often\nsufficient to produce detectable reinflation. We further argue that these\nprovide strong evidence for the relatively rapid reinflation of giant planets,\nand discuss the implications for proposed heating mechanisms. In our population\nanalysis we also find evidence for a \"delayed-cooling effect\", wherein planets\ncool and contract far more slowly than expected. While not capable of\nexplaining the observed radii alone, it may represent an important component of\nthe effect. Finally, we identify a weak negative relationship between stellar\nmetallicity and planet radius which is presumably the result of enhanced\nplanetary bulk metallicity around metal-rich stars and has important\nimplications for planet formation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 18:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

For higher epsB, synchrotron\nemission quickly comes to dominate the thermalized nebula radiation, and being\nreadily absorbed because of its lower photon energies, results in the SN\noptical light curve tracking the spin-down power even to late times >~ 1 yr,\ninconsistent with observations. For magnetars to remain viable contenders for\npowering SLSNe, we conclude that either magnetic dissipation in the wind/nebula\nis extremely efficient, or that the spin-down luminosity decays significantly\nfaster than the canonical dipole rate ~1/t^2 in a way that coincidentally\nmimicks gamma-ray escape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 19:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

These conditions are preserved by\nstereographic projection, so this theory is essentially the same for\nhypersurfaces in ${\\bf R}^n$ or $S^n$. The theory of compact proper Dupin\nhypersurfaces in $S^n$ is closely related to the theory of isoparametric\nhypersurfaces in $S^n$, and many important results in this field concern\nrelations between these two classes of hypersurfaces.

Thus, there is an imperative need to enhance grid\nemergency control to maintain system reliability and security. Towards this\nend, great progress has been made in developing deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL) based grid control solutions in recent years. However, existing DRL-based\nsolutions have two main limitations: 1) they cannot handle well with a wide\nrange of grid operation conditions, system parameters, and contingencies; 2)\nthey generally lack the ability to fast adapt to new grid operation conditions,\nsystem parameters, and contingencies, limiting their applicability for\nreal-world applications. In this paper, we mitigate these limitations by\ndeveloping a novel deep meta reinforcement learning (DMRL) algorithm. The DMRL\ncombines the meta strategy optimization together with DRL, and trains policies\nmodulated by a latent space that can quickly adapt to new scenarios. We test\nthe developed DMRL algorithm on the IEEE 300-bus system. We demonstrate fast\nadaptation of the meta-trained DRL polices with latent variables to new\noperating conditions and scenarios using the proposed method and achieve\nsuperior performance compared to the state-of-the-art DRL and model predictive\ncontrol (MPC) methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 19:45:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2022 06:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

LHCb was\nconceived primarily as a b-physics experiment, dedicated to CP violation\nstudies and measurements of very rare b decays, however the tremendous\npotential for c-physics was also clear. At first data taking, the versatility\nof the experiment as a general-purpose detector in the forward region also\nbecame evident, with measurements achievable such as electroweak physics, jets\nand new particle searches in open states. These were facilitated by the\nexcellent capability of the detector to identify muons and to reconstruct decay\nvertices close to the primary pp interaction region. By the end of the LHC Run\n2 in 2018, before the accelerator paused for its second long shut down, LHCb\nhad measured the CKM quark mixing matrix elements and CP violation parameters\nto world-leading precision in the heavy-quark systems. The experiment had also\nmeasured many rare decays of b and c quark mesons and baryons to below their\nStandard Model expectations, some down to branching ratios of order 10-9. In\naddition, world knowledge of b and c spectroscopy had improved significantly\nthrough discoveries of many new resonances already anticipated in the quark\nmodel, and also adding new exotic four and five quark states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 20:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

The dispersive delay in the arrival\ntime of pulsar signal changes over time due to the varying ISM electron column\ndensity along the line of sight. Correcting for this delay accurately is\ncrucial for the detection of nanohertz gravitational waves using Pulsar Timing\nArrays. In this work, we present in-band and inter-band DM estimates of four\npulsars observed with uGMRT over the timescale of a year using two different\ntemplate alignment methods. The DMs obtained using both these methods show only\nsubtle differences for PSR 1713+0747 and J1909$-$3744. A considerable offset is\nseen in the DM of PSR J1939+2134 and J2145$-$0750 between the two methods. This\ncould be due to the presence of scattering in the former and profile evolution\nin the latter. We find that both methods are useful but could have a systematic\noffset between the DMs obtained. Irrespective of the template alignment methods\nfollowed, the precision on the DMs obtained is about $10^{-3}$ pc cm$^{-3}$\nusing only BAND3 and $10^{-4}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ after combining data from BAND3 and\nBAND5 of the uGMRT.

This review provides an update on genes\npredisposing to syndromic and nonsyndromic infertility.\n  Main body: The review identified 65 genes linked with infertility and\ninfertility-related disorders. These genes regulate fertility. However,\nmutational loss of the functions of the genes predisposes to infertility.\nTwenty-three (23) genes representing 35% were linked with syndromic\ninfertility, while 42 genes (65%) cause nonsyndromic infertility. Of the 42\nnonsyndromic genes, 26 predispose to spermatogenic failure and sperm\nmorphological abnormalities, 11 cause ovarian failures, and 5 cause sex\nreversal and puberty delay. Overall, 31 genes (48%) predispose to male\ninfertility, 15 genes (23%) cause female infertility, and 19 genes (29%)\npredispose to both. The common feature of male infertility was spermatogenic\nfailure and sperm morphology abnormalities, while ovarian failure has been the\nmost frequently reported among infertile females. The mechanisms leading to\nthese pathologies are gene-specific, which, if targeted in the affected, may\nlead to improved treatment.\n  Conclusions: Mutational loss of the functions of some genes involved in the\ndevelopment and maintenance of fertility may predispose to syndromic or\nnonsyndromic infertility via gene-specific mechanisms. A treatment procedure\nthat targets the affected gene(s) in individuals expressing infertility may\nlead to improved treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 20:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

Through the\ndevelopment of chromosome conformation capture experiments (such as 3C, 4C,\nHi-C) it is now possible to obtain the contact frequencies of the DNA at the\nwhole-genome level. In this paper, we study the problem of reconstructing the\n3D organization of the genome from such whole-genome contact frequencies. A\nstandard approach is to transform the contact frequencies into noisy distance\nmeasurements and then apply semidefinite programming (SDP) formulations to\nobtain the 3D configuration. However, neglected in such reconstructions is the\nfact that most eukaryotes including humans are diploid and therefore contain\ntwo copies of each genomic locus. We prove that the 3D organization of the DNA\nis not identifiable from distance measurements derived from contact frequencies\nin diploid organisms. In fact, there are infinitely many solutions even in the\nnoise-free setting. We then discuss various additional biologically relevant\nand experimentally measurable constraints (including distances between\nneighboring genomic loci and higher-order interactions) and prove\nidentifiability under these conditions. Furthermore, we provide SDP\nformulations for computing the 3D embedding of the DNA with these additional\nconstraints and show that we can recover the true 3D embedding with high\naccuracy from both noiseless and noisy measurements. Finally, we apply our\nalgorithm to real pairwise and higher-order contact frequency data and show\nthat we can recover known genome organization patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 20:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

In this work, we study\nin detail the contribution of rotating massive stars to the production of Sr\nand Ba, in order to explain their chemical evolution, but also to constrain the\nrotational behaviour of massive stars.

In this\nwork, we are inspired by Latent DirichletAllocation (LDA) [4] and consider\nmodeling the edge detectionproblem as estimating a mixture ofmultipleGaussian\ndistribu-tions, where each corresponds to a separate sub-network. Toaddress\nthis problem, we propose a novel model called GaussianMixture Graphical Lasso\n(MGL). It learns the proportionsof signals generated by each mixture component\nand theirparameters iteratively via an EM framework. To obtain\nmoreinterpretable networks, MGL imposes a special regularization,called Mutual\nExclusivity Regularization (MER), to minimize theoverlap between different\nsub-networks. MER also addresses thecommon issues in read-world data sets,i.e.,\nnoisy observationsand small sample size. Through the extensive experiments\nonsynthetic and real brain data sets, the results demonstrate thatMGL can\neffectively discover multiple connectivity structuresfrom the observed node\nactivities\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 21:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

Significant work has been done in the past developing different types\nof algorithms for system identification using reduced equivalent circuit\nmodels. However, little work was done in analyzing the theoretical performance\nbounds of these approaches. Proper understanding of theoretical bounds will\nhelp in designing a system that is economical in cost and robust in\nperformance. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a linear recursive\nleast squares approach to equivalent circuit model identification and show that\nthe least squares approach is both unbiased and efficient when the\nsignal-to-noise ratio is high enough. However, we show that, when the\nsignal-to-noise ratio is low - resembling the case in many practical\napplications - the least squares estimator becomes significantly biased.\nConsequently, we develop a parameter estimation approach based on total least\nsquares method and show it to be asymptotically unbiased and efficient at\npractically low signal-to-noise ratio regions. Further, we develop a recursive\nimplementation of the total least square algorithm and find it to be slow to\nconverge; for this, we employ a Kalman filter to improve the convergence speed\nof the total least squares method. The resulting total Kalman filter is shown\nto be both unbiased and efficient in equivalent circuit model parameter\nidentification. The performance of this filter is analyzed using real-world\ncurrent profile under fluctuating signal-to-noise ratios. Finally, the\napplicability of the algorithms and analysis in this paper in identifying\nhigher order electrical equivalent circuit models is explained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 21:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

On the\none hand, detached EBs hosting at least one star with detectable solar-like\noscillations constitute ideal test objects to calibrate asteroseismic\nmeasurements. On the other hand, the oscillations and surface activity of stars\nthat belong to EBs offer unique information about the evolution of binary\nsystems. This paper builds upon previous works dedicated to red giant stars\n(RG) in EBs -- 20 known systems so far -- discovered by the NASA Kepler\nmission. Here we report the discovery of 16 RGs in EBs also from the Kepler\ndata. This new sample includes three SB2-EBs with oscillations and six close\nsystems where the RG display a clear surface activity and complete oscillation\nsuppression. Based on dedicated high-resolution spectroscopic observations\n(Apache Point Observatory, Observatoire de Haute Provence), we focus on three\nmain aspects. From the extended sample of 14 SB2-EBs, we first confirm that the\nsimple application of the asteroseismic scaling relations to RGs overestimates\nmasses and radii of RGs, by about 15% and 5%. This bias can be reduced by\nemploying either new asteroseismic reference values for RGs, or model-based\ncorrections of the asteroseismic parameters. Secondly, we confirm that close\nbinarity leads to a high level of photometric modulation (up to 10%), and a\nsuppression of solar-like oscillations. In particular, we show that it reduces\nthe lifetime of radial modes by a factor of up to 10. Thirdly, we use our 16\nnew systems to complement previous observational studies that aimed at\nconstraining tidal dissipation in interacting binaries. In particular, we\nidentify systems with circular orbits despite relatively young ages, which\nsuggests exploring complementary tidal dissipation mechanisms in the future.\nFinally, we report the measurements of mass, radius, and age of three M-dwarf\ncompanion stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 21:24:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 19:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Two popular classes of models for\nmixtures analyses are response-surface methods and exposure-index methods.\nResponse-surface methods estimate high-dimensional surfaces and are thus highly\nflexible but difficult to interpret. In contrast, exposure-index methods\ndecompose coefficients from a linear model into an overall mixture effect and\nindividual index weights; these models yield easily interpretable effect\nestimates and efficient inferences when model assumptions hold, but, like most\nparsimonious models, incur bias when these assumptions do not hold.

The\ngenealogical structure is assumed to be given through a supercritical branching\nprocess in the i.i.d. environment and satisfies the Kesten-Stigum condition.\nThe displacements coming from the same parent are assumed to have jointly\nregularly varying tails. Conditioned on the survival of the underlying\ngenealogical tree, we prove that the appropriately normalized (normalization\ndepends on the quenched size of the $n$-th generation) maximum among positions\nat the $n$-th generation converges weakly to a scale-mixture of Frech\\'{e}t\nrandom variable. Furthermore, we derive the weak limit of the point processes\ncomposed of appropriately scaled positions at the $n$-th generation and show\nthat the limit point process is a member of the randomly scaled scale-decorated\nPoisson point processes. Hence, an analog of the predictions by Brunet and\nDerrida (2011) holds. We have obtained an explicit description of the limit\npoint process. This description captures the influence of the environment in\nthe joint asymptotic behavior of the extreme positions. We show that the law of\nthe clusters in the limit depends on the time-reversed environment. The\nasymptotic distribution of the normalized rightmost position is derived as a\nconsequence. This approach (based on weak convergence of extremal processes)\ncan not be adapted when the genealogical structure is given through a\nsupercritical Branching Process in a time-Inhomogeneous Environment (BPIE) (due\nto lack of structural regularity in the genealogical structure). We provide a\nsimple example where the point processes do not converge weakly. The tightness\nof the point processes holds in this example though the point processes do not\n(weakly) converge (due to having different subsequential weak limits).

We present a robust methodology that combines\nfieldwork inquiries and model-based engineering to elicit and formalize rich\nmental models into exploitable design patterns. Our results exhibit how\ninspectors process and apply knowledge to diagnose the component`s condition,\nhow they deal with the institution`s rules and operational constraints (norms,\nsafety policies, standard operating procedures). We suggest how these patterns\ncan be incorporated in software modules or can conceptualize Human-Agent\nTeaming requirements. We argue that this framework can corroborate the right\nfit between a system`s technical and ecological validity (system fit with\noperating context) that enhances data reliability, productivity-related factors\nand system acceptance by end-users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 23:11:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

To solve this problem, we propose a lightweight\nmultiinformation fusion network (LMFN) for image deblurring. The proposed LMFN\nis designed as an encoder-decoder architecture. In the encoding stage, the\nimage feature is reduced to various smallscale spaces for multi-scale\ninformation extraction and fusion without a large amount of information loss.\nThen, a distillation network is used in the decoding stage, which allows the\nnetwork benefit the most from residual learning while remaining sufficiently\nlightweight. Meanwhile, an information fusion strategy between distillation\nmodules and feature channels is also carried out by attention mechanism.\nThrough fusing different information in the proposed approach, our network can\nachieve state-of-the-art image deblurring result with smaller number of\nparameters and outperforms existing methods in model complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 00:37:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

A simple yet effective way to improve recognition\nperformance is to use a dataset as large as possible by combining multiple\ndatasets in the training. However, it is problematic and troublesome to naively\ncombine different datasets due to two major issues. First, the same person can\npossibly appear in different datasets, leading to an identity overlapping issue\nbetween different datasets. Naively treating the same person as different\nclasses in different datasets during training will affect back-propagation and\ngenerate non-representative embeddings. On the other hand, manually cleaning\nlabels may take formidable human efforts, especially when there are millions of\nimages and thousands of identities. Second, different datasets are collected in\ndifferent situations and thus will lead to different domain distributions.\nNaively combining datasets will make it difficult to learn domain invariant\nembeddings across different datasets.

The spectra are dominated by hydrogen\nfeatures in the optical and NIR. The spectral features of SN 2013ai are unique\nin their expansion velocities, which when compared to large samples of SNe II\nare more than 1,000 kms faster at 50 days past explosion. In addition, the long\nrise time of the light curve more closely resembles SNe IIb rather than SNe II.\nIf SN 2013ai is coeval with a nearby compact cluster we infer a progenitor ZAMS\nmass of $\\sim$17 M$_\\odot$.

The density structure and\nexpansion velocities of SN 2013ai are similar to that of the prototypical SN\nIIb, SN 1993J. However, SN 2013ai shows no strong helium features in the\noptical, likely due to the presence of a dense core that prevents the majority\nof $\\gamma$-rays from escaping to excite helium. Our analysis suggests that SN\n2013ai could be a link between SNe II and stripped envelope SNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 02:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

It is often challenging to\ngenerate discrete orthogonal matrices. A common approach widely in use is to\ndiscretize continuous orthogonal functions that have been discovered. The need\nof certain continuous functions is restrictive. To simplify the process while\nimproving the efficiency and flexibility, we present a general method for\ngenerating orthogonal matrices directly through the construction of certain\neven and odd polynomials from a set of distinct positive values, bypassing the\nneed of continuous orthogonal functions. We provide a constructive proof by\ninduction that not only asserts the existence of such polynomials, but also\ntells how to iteratively construct them. Besides the derivation of the method\nas simple as a few nested loops, we discuss two well-known discrete transforms,\nthe Discrete Cosine Transform and the Discrete Tchebichef Transform. How they\ncan be achieved using our method with the specific values, and show how to\nembed them into the transform module of video coding.

The presence of a cold SiO layer extending up to some 60 au\nfrom the star is shown to be the cause. 5) Line emissions from SO, $^{28}$SiO,\nCO and HCN molecules are used to probe the CSE up to some 100 au from the star\nand reveal the presence of two broad back-to-back outflows, the morphology of\nwhich is studied in finer detail than in earlier work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 04:27:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 10:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

As a widely used consensus model in\nprivate chains, the leader-based state-machine replication (SMR) model meets\nthe performance bottleneck in IoT blockchain applications, where\nnontransactional sensor data are generated on a scale. We analyzed IoT private\nchain systems and found that the leader maintains too many connections due to\nhigh latency and client request frequency, which results in lower consensus\nperformance and efficiency.\n  To meet this challenge, we propose a novel solution for maintaining low\nrequest latency and high transactions per second (TPS): replicate\nnontransactional data by followers and confirm by the leader to achieve\nnonconfliction SMR, rather than all by the leader. Our solution, named Leader\nConfirmation Replication (LCR), uses the newly proposed future log and\nconfirmation signal to achieve nontransactional data replication on the\nfollowers, thereby reducing the leader's network traffic and the request\nlatency of transactional data. In addition, the generation replication strategy\nis designed to ensure the reliability and consistency of LCR when meeting\nmembership changes.

The recent emergence of centralized BEV relayer\nportrays BEV as a positive additional revenue source. Because BEV was\nquantitatively shown to deteriorate the blockchain's consensus security, BEV\nrelayers endanger the ledger security by incentivizing rational miners to fork\nthe chain. For example, a rational miner with a 10% hashrate will fork Ethereum\nif a BEV opportunity exceeds 4x the block reward.\n  However, related work is currently missing quantitative insights on past BEV\nextraction to assess the practical risks of BEV objectively. In this work, we\nallow to quantify the BEV danger by deriving the USD extracted from sandwich\nattacks, liquidations, and decentralized exchange arbitrage.

Regardless of their\nintended application, blockchain platforms implicitly assume consensus for the\ncorrect execution of a smart contract, thus requiring that all transactions are\ntotally ordered. It was only recently recognized that consensus is not\nnecessary to prevent double-spending in a cryptocurrency (Guerraoui et al.,\nPODC'19), contrary to common belief. This result suggests that current\nimplementations may be sacrificing efficiency and scalability because they\nsynchronize transactions much more tightly than actually needed. In this work,\nwe study the synchronization requirements of Ethereum's ERC20 token contract,\none of the most widely adopted smart contacts. Namely, we model a\nsmart-contract token as a concurrent object and analyze its consensus number as\na measure of synchronization power. We show that the richer set of methods\nsupported by ERC20 tokens, compared to standard cryptocurrencies, results in\nstrictly stronger synchronization requirements. More surprisingly, the\nsynchronization power of ERC20 tokens depends on the object's state and can\nthus be modified by method invocations. To prove this result, we develop a\ndedicated framework to express how the object's state affects the needed\nsynchronization level. Our findings indicate that ERC20 tokens, as well as\nother token standards, are more powerful and versatile than plain\ncryptocurrencies, and are subject to dynamic requirements. Developing specific\nsynchronization protocols that exploit these dynamic requirements will pave the\nway towards more robust and scalable blockchain platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 10:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

Motivated by arguments from information theory and\nleveraging recent advances in neural estimation of conditional mutual\ninformation, we introduce a novel training criterion called DICE: it increases\ndiversity by reducing spurious correlations among features. The main idea is\nthat features extracted from pairs of members should only share information\nuseful for target class prediction without being conditionally redundant.\nTherefore, besides the classification loss with information bottleneck, we\nadversarially prevent features from being conditionally predictable from each\nother.

It is based on the improvement of the strain\nrepresentation within the element, without altering the degree of the\ndisplacement interpolating functions on the element boundary. The idea is to\nfully exploit polygonal elements with a high number of sides, a peculiar VEM\nfeature, characterized by many displacement degrees of freedom on the element\nboundary, even if a low interpolation order is assumed over each side. The\nproposed approach is framed within a generalization of the classic VEM\nformulation, obtained by introducing an energy norm in the projection operator\ndefinition. Although such generalization may mainly appear to have a formal\nvalue, it allows to effectively point out the mechanical meaning of the\nquantities involved in the projection operator definition and to drive the\nselection of the enhanced representations. Various enhancements are proposed\nand tested through several numerical examples. Numerical results successfully\nshow the capability of the enhanced VEM formulation to (i) considerably\nincrease accuracy (with respect to standard VEM) while keeping the optimal\nconvergence rate, (ii) bypass the need of stabilization terms in many practical\ncases, (iii) obtain natural serendipity elements in many practical cases, and\n(vi) effectively treat also nearly incompressible materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 11:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

For\nthis purpose, time history response data are collected by solving the\nhigh-fidelity model via FEM for a reduced set of parameter values. Then, by\napplying the convolutional autoencoder to this data set, a low-dimensional\nrepresentation of the high-dimensional solution matrices is provided by the\nencoder, while the reconstruction map is obtained by the decoder.

Here we present the first attempt to incorporate immune amnesia into\nstandard models of epidemic spreading. In particular, we analyze diverse\nvariants of a model that describes the spreading of two concurrent pathogens\ncausing measles and another generic disease: the SIR-IA model. Analytical and\ncomputational studies confirm that immune amnesia can indeed have important\nconsequences for epidemic spreading, significantly altering the vaccination\ncoverage required to reach herd-immunity for concurring infectious diseases.\nMore specifically, we uncover the existence of novel propagating and endemic\nphases which are induced by immune amnesia, that appear both in fully-connected\nand more structured networks, such as random networks and power-law\ndegree-distributed ones. In particular, the transitions from a quiescent state\ninto these novel phases can become rather abrupt in some cases that we\nspecifically analyze.

The recognition system is\nconstructed using a distinct category of class-based ensemble convolutional\nneural network (CNN) architecture.

A stochastic process with linear dynamics and Gaussian\nnoise is measured by multiple agent nodes, each equipped with multiple sensors.\nThe agent nodes form a multi-hop network among themselves. Each agent node\ncomputes an estimate of the process by using its sensor observation and\nmessages obtained from neighboring nodes, via Kalman-consensus filtering. An\nexternal attacker, capable of arbitrarily manipulating the sensor observations\nof some or all agent nodes, injects errors into those sensor observations. The\ngoal of the attacker is to steer the estimates at the agent nodes as close as\npossible to a pre-specified value, while respecting a constraint on the attack\ndetection probability. To this end, a constrained optimization problem is\nformulated to find the optimal parameter values of a certain class of linear\nattacks. The parameters of linear attack are learnt on-line via a combination\nof stochastic approximation based update of a Lagrange multiplier, and an\noptimization technique involving either the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions\nor online stochastic gradient descent.

This relation\ncouples the luminosity and angular diameter distances, two of the most often\nused measures of structure in the Universe. We here propose a new\nmodel-independent method to test this relation, using strong gravitational\nlensing (SGL) and the high-redshift quasar Hubble diagram reconstructed with a\nBezier parametric fit. We carry out this test without pre-assuming a zero\nspatial curvature, adopting instead the value Omega_K=0.001 +/- 0.002 optimized\nby Planck in order to improve the reliability of our result. We parametrize the\nCDDR using eta(z)=1 + eta_0 z, 1 + eta_1 z + eta_2 z^2 and 1 + eta_3 z/(1+z),\nand consider both the SIS and non-SIS lens models for the strong lensing. Our\nbest fit results are: eta_0=-0.021^{+0.068}_{-0.048},\neta_1=-0.404^{+0.123}_{-0.090}, eta_2=0.106^{+0.028}_{-0.034}, and\neta_3=-0.507^{+0.193}_{-0.133} for the SIS model, and\neta_0=-0.109^{+0.044}_{-0.031} for the non-SIS model. The measured eta(z),\nbased on the Planck parameter Omega_K, is essentially consistent with the value\n(=1) expected if the CDDR were fully respected. For the sake of comparison, we\nalso carry out the test for other values of Omega_K, but find that deviations\nof spatial flatness beyond the Planck optimization are in even greater tension\nwith the CDDR.

In the Bayesian\napproach, prior knowledge is taken into account with the help of a prior\ndistribution. In addition, the error in the observation equation is formulated\nby means of a distribution. This method naturally results in a whole posterior\ndistribution for the unknown target, not just point estimates. This allows for\nfurther statistical analysis including the computation of credible intervals.\nWe combine the Bayesian setting with the all-at-once formulation, resulting in\na novel approach for investigating inverse problems.

The resulting budget is spent to cover\nadministrative costs and to pay a bonus to cooperative agents, which can be\nidentified correctly only with a probability $p$. Agents decide at each time\nstep to choose either cooperation or defection based on different information.\nIn the local scenario, they compare their potential gains from both strategies.\nIn the global scenario, they compare the gains of the cooperative and defective\nsubpopulations. We derive analytical expressions for the critical bonus needed\nto make cooperation as attractive as defection. We show that for the local\nscenario the government can establish only a medium level of cooperation,\nbecause the critical bonus increases with the level of cooperation. In the\nglobal scenario instead full cooperation can be achieved once the cold-start\nproblem is solved, because the critical bonus decreases with the level of\ncooperation. This allows to lower the tax rate, while maintaining high\ncooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 13:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Our\nmain question of interest is how uncertainties in system parameters propagate\nthrough the possibly highly nonlinear dynamical system and affect the system's\nbifurcation behavior. We come up with a methodology to determine the\nprobability of the occurrence of different types of bifurcations (sub- vs\nsuper-critical) along a given bifurcation curve based on the probability\ndistribution of the input parameters. In a first step, we reduce the system's\nbehavior to the dynamics on its center manifold. We thereby still capture the\nmajor qualitative behavior of the RODEs. In a second step, we analyze the\nreduced RODEs and quantify the probability of the occurrence of different types\nof bifurcations based on the (nonlinear) functional appearance of uncertain\nparameters. To realize this major step, we present three approaches: an\nanalytical one, where the probability can be calculated explicitly based on\nMellin transformation and inversion, a semi-analytical one consisting of a\ncombination of the analytical approach with a moment-based numerical estimation\nprocedure, and a particular sampling-based approach using unscented\ntransformation.

We\nreport the X-ray detection of an eROSITA source securely matched to the\nwell-known quasar SDSS J083643.85+005453.3 (z=5.81). The soft X-ray flux of the\nsource derived from eROSITA is consistent with previous Chandra observations.\nIn addition, we report the detection of the quasar with LOFAR at 145 MHz and\nASKAP at 888 MHz. The reported flux densities confirm a spectral flattening at\nlower frequencies in the emission of the radio core, indicating that the quasar\ncould be a (sub-) gigahertz peaked spectrum source. The inferred spectral shape\nand the parsec-scale radio morphology of SDSS J083643.85+005453.3 suggest that\nit is in an early stage of its evolution into a large-scale radio source or\nconfined in a dense environment. We find no indications for a strong jet\ncontribution to the X-ray emission of the quasar, which is therefore likely to\nbe linked to accretion processes. The detection of this source allows us to\nplace the first constraints on the XLF at z>5.5 based on a secure spectroscopic\nredshift. Compared to extrapolations from lower-redshift observations, this\nfavours a relatively flat slope for the XLF at $z\\sim 6$ beyond $L_*$. The\npopulation of X-ray luminous AGNs at high redshift may be larger than\npreviously thought.

Unlike dark matter, baryonic matter is made\nof elements in the periodic table, and can be directly observed through the\nelectromagnetic signals that it produces. Stars contain only a tiny fraction of\nthe baryonic matter known to be present in the universe. Additional baryons are\nfound to be in diffuse (gaseous) form, in or between galaxies, but a\nsignificant fraction has not yet been seen. The latter (missing baryons) are\nthought to be hiding in low-density warm-hot ionized medium (WHIM), based on\nresults from theoretical studies and recent observations, and be distributed in\nthe vicinity of galaxies (i.e., circum-galactic medium) and between galaxies\n(i.e., intergalactic medium). Such gas would radiate mainly in the soft X-ray\nband and the emission would be very weak, due to its very low density. HUBS is\noptimized to detect the X-ray emission from the hot baryons in the\ncircum-galactic medium, and thus fill a void in observational astronomy. The\ngoal is not only to detect the missing baryons, but to characterize their\nphysical and chemical properties, as well as to measure their spatial\ndistribution. The results would establish the boundary conditions for\nunderstanding galaxy evolution. Though highly challenging, detecting missing\nbaryons in the intergalactic medium could be attempted, perhaps in the\noutskirts of galaxy clusters, and could shed significant light on the\nlarge-scale structures of the universe.

Interestingly, we find that the free energy of\nthe particle, $F$, approaches the free energy of a freely diffusing particle,\n$F_0$, as $\\delta F=F-F_0\\sim 1/t$, i.e., at a rate faster than $E$.

Further, we\npresent a novel rescaling strategy for CNNs based on learnable repetition of\nits parameters. Based on this strategy, we rescale CNNs without changing their\nparameter count, and show that learnable sharing of weights itself can provide\nsignificant boost in the performance of any given model without changing its\nparameter count. We show that small base networks when rescaled, can provide\nperformance comparable to deeper networks with as low as 6% of optimization\nparameters of the deeper one.\n  The relevance of weight sharing is further highlighted through the example of\ngroup-equivariant CNNs. We show that the significant improvements obtained with\ngroup-equivariant CNNs over the regular CNNs on classification problems are\nonly partly due to the added equivariance property, and part of it comes from\nthe learnable repetition of network weights.

Simultaneously, we have seen growing interest in orbital activities\nsuch as satellite servicing and debris removal that depend on proximity\noperations between spacecraft. However, two key challenges currently pose a\nmajor barrier to the use of deep learning for vision-based on-orbit proximity\noperations. Firstly, efficient implementation of these techniques relies on an\neffective system for model development that streamlines data curation,\ntraining, and evaluation. Secondly, a scarcity of labeled training data (images\nof a target spacecraft) hinders creation of robust deep learning models. This\npaper presents an open-source deep learning pipeline, developed specifically\nfor on-orbit visual navigation applications, that addresses these challenges.\nThe core of our work consists of two custom software tools built on top of a\ncloud architecture that interconnects all stages of the model development\nprocess. The first tool leverages Blender, an open-source 3D graphics toolset,\nto generate labeled synthetic training data with configurable model poses\n(positions and orientations), lighting conditions, backgrounds, and commonly\nobserved in-space image aberrations. The second tool is a plugin-based\nframework for effective dataset curation and model training; it provides common\nfunctionality like metadata generation and remote storage access to all\nprojects while giving complete independence to project-specific code.\nTime-consuming, graphics-intensive processes such as synthetic image generation\nand model training run on cloud-based computational resources which scale to\nany scope and budget and allow development of even the largest datasets and\nmodels from any machine. The presented system has been used in the Texas\nSpacecraft Laboratory with marked benefits in development speed and quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

A master\nserver owns two private matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ and hires worker\nnodes to help computing their multiplication. The matrices should remain\ninformation-theoretically private from the workers. Codes with fixed rate\nrequire the master to assign tasks to the workers and then wait for a\npredetermined number of workers to finish their assigned tasks. The size of the\ntasks, hence the rate of the scheme, depends on the number of workers that the\nmaster waits for. We design a rateless private matrix-matrix multiplication\nscheme, called RPM3. In contrast to fixed-rate schemes, our scheme fixes the\nsize of the tasks and allows the master to send multiple tasks to the workers.\nThe master keeps sending tasks and receiving results until it can decode the\nmultiplication; rendering the scheme flexible and adaptive to heterogeneous\nenvironments. Despite resulting in a smaller rate than known straggler-tolerant\nschemes, RPM3 provides a smaller mean waiting time of the master by leveraging\nthe heterogeneity of the workers. The waiting time is studied under two\ndifferent models for the workers' service time. We provide upper bounds for the\nmean waiting time under both models. In addition, we provide lower bounds on\nthe mean waiting time under the worker-dependent fixed service time model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

In this work, we present a\nmachine-learning method to solve this type of equations as an alternative to\nABCs.

The accuracy is tested for\nboth the second-order wave equation and the Schrodinger equation, including the\nnonlinear Schrodinger equation. We examine the accuracy from both\ninterpolations and extrapolations. For initial conditions lying in the training\nset, the learned map has good interpolation accuracy, due to the approximation\nproperty of deep neural networks. The learned map also exhibits some good\nextrapolation accuracy. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for\nproblems in irregular domains.

In this article, we\npropose an approach to automatically identify and quantify customer needs by\nutilizing a novel data source: Users voluntarily and publicly expose\ninformation about themselves via social media, as for instance Facebook or\nTwitter. These posts may contain valuable information about the needs, wants,\nand demands of their authors.

We\nconcentrate on Twitter as a data source and on e-mobility as an application\ndomain. In a first design cycle we conceive, implement and evaluate a method to\ndemonstrate the feasibility of identifying those social media posts that\nactually express customer needs. In a second cycle, we build on this artifact\nto additionally quantify the need information elicited, and prove its\nfeasibility. Third, we integrate both developed methods into an end-user\nsoftware artifact and test usability in an industrial use case.

Compared with the well-studied machine reading comprehension (MRC),\nSQA is a more challenging task: a scenario may contain not only a textual\npassage to read but also structured data like tables, i.e., tabular scenario\nbased question answering (TSQA). AI applications of TSQA such as answering\nmultiple-choice questions in high-school exams require synthesizing data in\nmultiple cells and combining tables with texts and domain knowledge to infer\nanswers. To support the study of this task, we construct GeoTSQA. This dataset\ncontains 1k real questions contextualized by tabular scenarios in the geography\ndomain. To solve the task, we extend state-of-the-art MRC methods with TTGen, a\nnovel table-to-text generator. It generates sentences from variously\nsynthesized tabular data and feeds the downstream MRC method with the most\nuseful sentences. Its sentence ranking model fuses the information in the\nscenario, question, and domain knowledge. Our approach outperforms a variety of\nstrong baseline methods on GeoTSQA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 02:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-28"}

We come up with the Shallow\nand Wide Attention convolutional Mechanism (SWAM), which allows our model to\nlearn local and low-level features for each label. The key idea behind our\nmodel design is to look for the presence of informative snippets in the\nclinical text that correlated with each code, and we infer that there exists a\ncorrespondence between \"informative snippet\" and convolution filter. Results:\nWe evaluate our approach on MIMIC-III, an open-access dataset of ICU medical\nrecords. Our approach substantially outperforms previous results on top-50\nmedical code prediction on MIMIC-III dataset. We attribute this improvement to\nSWAM, by which the wide architecture gives the model ability to more\nextensively learn the unique features of different codes, and we prove it by\nablation experiment. Besides, we perform manual analysis of the performance\nimbalance between different codes, and preliminary conclude the characteristics\nthat determine the difficulty of learning specific codes. Conclusions: We\npresent SWAM, an explainable CNN approach for multi-label document\nclassification, which employs a wide convolution layer to learn local and\nlow-level features for each label, yields strong improvements over previous\nmetrics on the ICD-9 code prediction task, while providing satisfactory\nexplanations for its internal mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 02:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-28"}

We aim to guarantee the user\nfairness in terms of video coding rate under statistical delay constraint and\nedge caching capacity constraint. A hybrid human-artificial intelligence\napproach is developed to improve the user hit rate for video caching.\nSpecifically, individual user interest is first characterized by merging\nfactorization machine (FM) model and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, where\nboth low-order and high-order features can be well learned simultaneously.\nThereafter, a social aware similarity model is constructed to transferred\nindividual user interest to group interest, based on which, videos can be\nselected to cache. Furthermore, a double bisection exploration scheme is\nproposed to optimize wireless resource allocation and video coding rate. The\neffectiveness of the proposed video caching scheme and video delivery scheme is\nfinally validated by extensive experiments with a real-world data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 13:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}
