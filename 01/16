Finally, spin-changing collisions are also\nexploited locally, to compensate local squeezing terms. The correlators\nappearing in the inequality are evaluated using three different approaches. In\nthe first approach, correlators are estimated using normalized expectation\nvalues of number operators, in a similar way to evaluating continuous-variable\nBell inequalities. An improvement to this approach is developed using the\nsign-binning of total spin measurements, which allows for the construction of\ntwo-outcome measurements and violations of the CHSH inequality without\nauxiliary assumptions.

Recently, [Jin et al.,\nICDM'19] proposed an algorithm to approximate this measure probabilistically.\nTheir algorithm processes small inputs quickly, but does not scale well beyond\nhundreds of thousands of vertices.\n  In this paper, we first propose a different approximation algorithm; it is up\nto two orders of magnitude faster and more accurate in practice. Our method\nexploits the strong connection between uniform spanning trees and forest\ndistances by adapting and extending recent approximation algorithms for related\nsingle-vertex problems.

While an agent designer has a\npreference for how this trade-off is resolved, existing approaches further\nrequire that the designer translate these preferences into a fixed learning\ntarget for the agent.

A sampling of alternatives reduces the computational challenge of\nevaluating the denominator of the logit choice probability for large choice\nsets by only using a smaller subset of sampled alternatives including the\nchosen alternative. To correct for the resulting overestimation of the choice\nprobability, a correction factor has to be applied. McFadden (1978) proposes a\ncorrection factor to the utility of each alternative which is based on the\nprobability of sampling the smaller subset of alternatives and that alternative\nbeing chosen. McFadden's correction factor ensures consistency of parameter\nestimates under a wide range of sampling protocols. A special sampling protocol\ndiscussed by McFadden is uniform conditioning, which assigns the same sampling\nprobability and therefore the same correction factor to each alternative in the\nsampled choice set. Since a constant is added to each alternative the\ncorrection factor cancels out, but consistent estimates are still obtained.\nBayesian estimation is focused on describing the full posterior distributions\nof the parameters of interest instead of the consistency of their point\nestimates. We theoretically show that uniform conditioning is sufficient to\nminimise the loss of information from a sampling of alternatives on the\nparameters of interest over the full posterior distribution in Bayesian MNL\nmodels. Minimum loss of information is, however, not guaranteed for other\nsampling protocols. This result extends to Bayesian MMNL models estimated using\nthe principle of data augmentation. The application of uniform conditioning, a\nmore restrictive sampling protocol, is thus sufficient in a Bayesian estimation\ncontext to achieve finite sample properties of MNL and MMNL parameter\nestimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 16:59:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 11:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

We introduce a new model for approximate query enumeration on\nclasses of relational databases of bounded degree. We first prove that on\ndatabases of bounded degree any local first-order definable query can be\nenumerated approximately with constant delay after a constant time\npreprocessing phase. We extend this, showing that on databases of bounded\ntree-width and bounded degree, every query that is expressible in first-order\nlogic can be enumerated approximately with constant delay after a sublinear\n(more precisely, polylogarithmic) time preprocessing phase.\n  Durand and Grandjean (ACM Transactions on Computational Logic 2007) proved\nthat exact enumeration of first-order queries on databases of bounded degree\ncan be done with constant delay after a linear time preprocessing phase. Hence\nwe achieve a significant speed-up in the preprocessing phase. Since sublinear\nrunning time does not allow reading the whole input database even once,\nsacrificing some accuracy is inevitable for our speed-up. Nevertheless, our\nenumeration algorithms come with guarantees: With high probability, (1) only\ntuples are enumerated that are answers to the query or `close' to being answers\nto the query, and (2) if the proportion of tuples that are answers to the query\nis sufficiently large, then all answers will be enumerated. Here the notion of\n`closeness' is a tuple edit distance in the input database. For local\nfirst-order queries, only actual answers are enumerated, strengthening (1).\nMoreover, both the `closeness' and the proportion required in (2) are\ncontrollable.\n  We combine methods from property testing of bounded degree graphs with logic\nand query enumeration, which we believe can inspire further research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 17:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

In the\n`southwest' region of $^{78}$Ni, the development of deformation might trigger a\nmajor shift in our understanding of explosive nucleosynthesis. To this end, new\nspectroscopic information on key close-lying nuclei is very valuable.\n  Purpose: We intend to measure the isomeric and $\\beta$ decay of $^{75}$Co,\nwith one-proton and two-neutron holes relative to $^{78}$Ni, to access new\nnuclear structure information in $^{75}$Co and its $\\beta$-decay daughters\n$^{75}$Ni and $^{74}$Ni.\n  Methods: The nucleus $^{75}$Co is produced in relativistic in-flight fission\nreactions of $^{238}$U at the Radioactive Ion Beam Factory in the RIKEN Nishina\nCenter.

We analyse the magnetic field and plasma parameters\nfrom the FIELDS and SWEAP instruments. The three structures analysed all show\ntypical signatures of magnetic reconnection. The ion velocity and magnetic\nfield are first correlated and then anti-correlated at the inbound and outbound\nedges of the bifurcated current sheets with a central ion flow jet. Most of the\nreconnection events have a strong guide field and moderate magnetic shear but\none current sheet shows indications of quasi anti-parallel reconnection in\nconjunction with a magnetic field magnitude decrease by $90\\%$. Given the\nwealth of intense current sheets observed by PSP, reconnection at switchbacks\nboundaries appears to be rare. However, as the switchback boundaries accomodate\ncurrents one can conjecture that the geometry of these boundaries offers\nfavourable conditions for magnetic reconnection to occur. Such a mechanism\nwould thus contribute in reconfiguring the magnetic field of the switchbacks,\naffecting the dynamics of the solar wind and eventually contributing to the\nblending of the structures with the regular wind as they propagate away from\nthe Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 19:02:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 09:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

It relies on modern fiber\ndesigns that support the propagation of multiple spatial modes. One of these\nfibers, the ring-core fiber (RCF), is able to propagate modes that carry\norbital angular momentum (OAM), and has been shown to enhance not only\nclassical, but also quantum communication systems. Typically, the RCF spatial\nmodes are used as orthogonal transmission channels for data streams that are\ncoupled into the fiber using different Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams. Here, we\nstudy the optimal conditions to multiplex information into ring-core fibers in\nthis scheme. We determine which are the most relevant LG beams to be\nconsidered, and how their coupling efficiency can be maximized by properly\nadjusting the beam width with respect to the fiber parameters. Our results show\nthat the coupling efficiency depends upon the OAM value, and that this can\nlimit the achievable transmission rates. In this regard, we show that LG beams\nare not the optimal choice to couple information into RCF.

Here we present an analysis\nof archival FORS V-band imaging data from 2003-2004, which have previously not\nbeen explored scientifically because the halo substructure of the bright\nstellar point spread function is complex. Through a high-contrast scheme based\non angular differential imaging, with a forward-modelling approach to mitigate\nself-subtraction, we produced the deepest imaging yet for the outer range of\nthe beta Pic disk, and extracted its morphological characteristics. A\nbrightness asymmetry between the two arms of the edge-on disk, which was\npreviously noted in the inner disk, is even more pronounced at larger angular\nseparations, reaching a factor ~10 around 1000 AU. Approaching 2000 AU, the\nbrighter arm is visible at a surface brightness of 27-28 mag/arcsec^2. Much\nlike for the brightness asymmetry, a tilt angle asymmetry exists between the\ntwo arms that becomes increasingly extreme at large separations. The outer tilt\nangle of 7.2 deg can only be explained if the outer disk is farther from an\nedge-on inclination than the inner disk, or if its dust has a stronger\nscattering anisotropy, or (most likely) both. The strong asymmetries imply the\npresence of a highly eccentric kinematic disk component, which may have been\ncaused by a disruptive event thought to have taken place at a closer-in\nlocation in the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 19:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Traditionally, the recommendation\nproblem was considered to be a classification or prediction problem, but it is\nnow widely agreed that formulating it as a sequential decision problem can\nbetter reflect the user-system interaction. Therefore, it can be formulated as\na Markov decision process (MDP) and be solved by reinforcement learning (RL)\nalgorithms. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, including collaborative\nfiltering and content-based filtering, RL is able to handle the sequential,\ndynamic user-system interaction and to take into account the long-term user\nengagement. Although the idea of using RL for recommendation is not new and has\nbeen around for about two decades, it was not very practical, mainly because of\nscalability problems of traditional RL algorithms. However, a new trend has\nemerged in the field since the introduction of deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL), which made it possible to apply RL to the recommendation problem with\nlarge state and action spaces. In this paper, a survey on reinforcement\nlearning based recommender systems (RLRSs) is presented.

We first\nconfirm that previous findings in cognitive psychology transfer to the\nprogramming domain: people can keep about 7 variable/value pairs in WM, and\npeople will accidentally swap associations between variables due to WM load. We\nuse a restricted focus viewing interface to further analyze the strategies\npeople use to trace through programs, and the relationship of tracing strategy\nto WM.

Here, we use three epochs of Keck/NIRC2 imaging, spanning five years,\nin JHK near-infrared bands to obtain 1-mas precision astrometry. We show that\nthe two objects exhibit common proper motion, measure a relative velocity of\n$\\mu=0.14\\pm0.44$ mas yr$^{-1}$ ($\\mu=0.30\\pm0.93$ km s$^{-1}$) and conclude\nthat they are a binary pair at $880\\pm10$ AU projected separation. There is\nmarginal detection of possible orbital motion, but our astrometry is\ninsufficient to characterize the orbit. We show that two other point sources\nare not associated with KIC 8462852. We recommend that attempts to model KIC\n8462852 A's light curve should revisit the possibility that the bound stellar\ncompanion may play a role in causing the irregular brightness variations, for\nexample through disruption of the orbits of bodies around the primary due to\nlong-term orbital evolution of the binary orbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 22:26:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 02:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

We rely on a multi-method analysis to\ninvestigate the correlates, predictive importance, and quasi-causal effects of\nfeatures that describe crowd dynamics in determining the success of crowdfunded\nprojects. By applying a multi-method analysis to a study of fundraising in\nthree different online markets, we uncover general crowd dynamics that\nultimately decide which projects will succeed. In all analyses and across the\nthree different platforms, we consistently find that funders' behavioural\nsignals (1) are significantly correlated with fundraising success; (2)\napproximate fundraising outcomes better than the characteristics of projects\nand their creators such as credit grade, company valuation, and subject domain;\nand (3) have significant quasi-causal effects on fundraising outcomes while\ncontrolling for potentially confounding project variables. By showing that\nuniversal features deduced from crowd behaviour are predictive of fundraising\nsuccess on different crowdfunding platforms, our work provides design-relevant\ninsights about novel types of collective decision-making online.

State-of-the-art techniques leverage modern deep\nlearning techniques such as LSTMs, yielding competitive performance, albeit at\nthe price of longer training times.\n  Recently, Galke and Scherp [18] showed that at least for image recognition, a\ndecades-old feedforward neural network can match the performance of modern deep\nlearning techniques. This motivated us to try the same in the SE literature.\nSpecifically, in this paper, we apply feedforward networks with some\npreprocessing to two analytics tasks: issue close time prediction, and\nvulnerability detection. We test the hypothesis laid by Galke and Scherp [18],\nthat feedforward networks suffice for many analytics tasks (which we call, the\n\"Old but Gold\" hypothesis) for these two tasks. For three out of five datasets\nfrom these tasks, we achieve new high-water mark results (that out-perform the\nprior state-of-the-art results) and for a fourth data set, Old but Gold\nperformed as well as the recent state of the art. Furthermore, the old but gold\nresults were obtained orders of magnitude faster than prior work.

At the\nvery least, this will produce a baseline result against which researchers can\ncompare some other, supposedly more sophisticated, approach.

Such queries fail to express\ntheir true information needs and raise ambiguity as fragmental language often\nyield various interpretations and aspects. This gives search engines a hard\ntime processing and understanding the query, and eventually leads to\nunsatisfactory retrieval results. An alternative approach to direct answer\nwhile facing an ambiguous query is to proactively ask clarifying questions to\nthe user. Recent years have seen many works and shared tasks from both NLP and\nIR community about identifying the need for asking clarifying question and\nmethodology to generate them. An often neglected fact by these works is that\nalthough sometimes the need for clarifying questions is correctly recognized,\nthe clarifying questions these system generate are still off-topic and\ndissatisfaction provoking to users and may just cause users to leave the\nconversation.\n  In this work, we propose a risk-aware conversational search agent model to\nbalance the risk of answering user's query and asking clarifying questions. The\nagent is fully aware that asking clarifying questions can potentially collect\nmore information from user, but it will compare all the choices it has and\nevaluate the risks. Only after then, it will make decision between answering or\nasking. To demonstrate that our system is able to retrieve better answers, we\nconduct experiments on the MSDialog dataset which contains real-world customer\nservice conversations from Microsoft products community. We also purpose a\nreinforcement learning strategy which allows us to train our model on the\noriginal dataset directly and saves us from any further data annotation\nefforts.

Moreover, due to the spectrum\ncrunch, frequency reuse among the deployed APs is inevitable, aggravating the\nproblem of inter-cell interference (ICI). Therefore, ICI mitigation in\nself-organizing networks (SONs) is commonly identified as a key radio resource\nmanagement mechanism to enhance performance in future communication networks.\nWith the aim of reducing ICI in a SON, this paper proposes a novel solution for\nthe uncoordinated channel and power allocation problems. Based on the\nmulti-player multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework, the proposed technique does\nnot require any communication or coordination between the APs. The case of\nvarying channel rewards across APs is considered. In contrast to previous work\non channel allocation using the MAB framework, APs are permitted to choose\nmultiple channels for transmission. Moreover, non-orthogonal multiple access\n(NOMA) is used to allow multiple APs to access each channel simultaneously.\nThis results in an MAB model with varying channel rewards, multiple plays and\nnon-zero reward on collision. The proposed algorithm has an expected regret in\nthe order of O(log^2 T ), which is validated by simulation results. Extensive\nnumerical results also reveal that the proposed technique significantly\noutperforms the well-known upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm, by achieving\nmore than a twofold increase in the energy efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2021 01:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

A crossed-Dragone\nconfiguration was chosen for the low frequency telescope (LFT : 34--161 GHz),\none of LiteBIRD's onboard telescopes. It has a wide field-of-view ($18^\\circ\n\\times 9^\\circ$) with an aperture of 400 mm in diameter, corresponding to an\nangular resolution of about 30 arcminutes around 100 GHz. The focal ratio f/3.0\nand the crossing angle of the optical axes of 90$^\\circ$ are chosen after an\nextensive study of the stray light. The primary and secondary reflectors have\nrectangular shapes with serrations to reduce the diffraction pattern from the\nedges of the mirrors. The reflectors and structure are made of aluminum to\nproportionally contract from warm down to the operating temperature at $5\\,$K.\nA 1/4 scaled model of the LFT has been developed to validate the wide\nfield-of-view design and to demonstrate the reduced far sidelobes. A\npolarization modulation unit (PMU), realized with a half-wave plate (HWP) is\nplaced in front of the aperture stop, the entrance pupil of this system. A\nlarge focal plane with approximately 1000 AlMn TES detectors and frequency\nmultiplexing SQUID amplifiers is cooled to 100 mK. The lens and sinuous\nantennas have broadband capability. Performance specifications of the LFT and\nan outline of the proposed verification plan are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2021 01:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

Our modeling includes two\nrelatively new advances in modern reflection codes: high-density disks, and\nreturning thermal disk radiation. Accretion disks around stellar-mass black\nholes are expected to have densities well above the standard value assumed in\ntraditional reflection models (i.e., $n_{\\rm e}\\sim10^{15}~{\\rm cm^{-3}}$). New\nhigh-density reflection models have important implications in the determination\nof disk truncation (i.e., the disk inner radius). This is because one must\nretain self-consistency in the irradiating flux and corresponding disk\nionization state, which is a function of disk density and system geometry. We\nfind the disk density is $n_{\\rm e}\\ge10^{20}~{\\rm cm^{-3}}$ across all\nspectral states. This density, combined with our constraints on the ionization\nstate of the material, implies an irradiating flux impinging on the disk that\nis consistent with the expected theoretical estimates. Returning thermal disk\nradiation -- the fraction of disk photons which bend back to the disk producing\nadditional reflection components -- is expected predominantly in the soft\nstate. We show that returning radiation models indeed provide a better fit to\nthe soft state data, reinforcing previous results which show that in the soft\nstate the irradiating continuum may be blackbody emission from the disk itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2021 01:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

Earlier research has attempted remote verification of a devices' state\nusing hardware, software, or hybrid approaches. Majority of them have used\nAttestation Key as a hardware root of trust, which does not detect hardware\nmodification or counterfeit issues. In addition, they do not have a secure\ncommunication channel between verifier and prover, which makes them susceptible\nto modern security attacks. This paper presents SEDAT, a novel methodology for\nremote attestation of the device via a security enhanced communication channel.\nSEDAT performs hardware, firmware, and software attestation. SEDAT enhances the\ncommunication protocol security between verifier and prover by using the Single\nPacket Authorization (SPA) technique, which provides replay and Denial of\nService (DoS) protection. SEDAT provides a way for verifier to get on-demand\ndevice integrity and authenticity status via a secure channel. It also enables\nthe verifier to detect counterfeit hardware, change in firmware, and software\ncode on the device. SEDAT validates the manufacturers` root CA certificate,\nplatform certificate, endorsement certificate (EK), and attributes certificates\nto perform platform hardware attestation. SEDAT is the first known tool that\nrepresents firmware, and Integrity Measurement Authority (IMA) event logs in\nthe Canonical Event Logs (CEL) format (recommended by Trusted Computing Group).\nSEDAT is the first implementation, to the best of our knowledge, that showcases\nend to end hardware, firmware, and software remote attestation using Trusted\nPlatform Module (TPM2.0) which is resilient to DoS and replay attacks. SEDAT is\nthe first remote verifier that is capable of retrieving a TPM2.0 quote from\nprover and validate it after regeneration, using a software TPM2.0 quote check.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2021 03:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

For the\ncase of single microcylinder, as the blockage ratio (ratio of the cylinder\ndiameter to that of the channel height) is gradually varied, we find the\nexistence of a flow bifurcation in the system, and also flow transits from\nsteady to unsteady state. For the case of two microcylinders, we observe the\npresence of three distinct flow states in the system, namely, diverging (D),\nasymmetric-diverging (AD) and converging (C) states as the intercylinder\nspacing in between the two cylinders is varied. Similar types of flow states\nare also observed in the recent experiments dealing with wormlike micellar\nsolutions. However, we show that either this transition from one flow state to\nanother in the case of a single microcylinder or the occurrence of any flow\nstate in the case of two microcylinders, is strongly dependent upon the values\nof the Weissenberg number and the nonlinear VCM model parameter \\xi, which\nbasically indicates how easy or hard to break a micelle.

Further we show that the NEGF expression for conductance can be written\nin such a way that there is a one-to-one correspondence of the various terms in\nthe NEGF expression to the amplitudes for normal transmission, Andreev\ntransmission and Andreev reflection in the scattering approach. Thereby, we\nobtain closed form expressions for these. We obtain the wavefunctions of zero\nenergy Majorana bound states(MBS) of the wire connected to leads and prove that\nthey are present in the same parameter regime in which they occur for an\nisolated wire. These bound states give rise to perfect Andreev reflection\nresponsible for zero bias quantized conductance peak. We discuss the dependence\nof the width of this peak on different parameters of the Hamiltonian and relate\nit to the MBS wavefunction properties. We find that the peak broadens if the\nweight of the MBS in the reservoirs increases and vice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2021 05:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

While the accuracy loss\nafter pruning based on the structure sensitivity is relatively slight, the\nprocess is time-consuming and the algorithm complexity is notable. In this\narticle, we propose a novel automatic channel pruning method (ACP).\nSpecifically, we firstly perform layer-wise channel clustering via the\nsimilarity of the feature maps to perform preliminary pruning on the network.\nThen a population initialization method is introduced to transform the pruned\nstructure into a candidate population. Finally, we conduct searching and\noptimizing iteratively based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find\nthe optimal compressed structure.

Besides, these models are\ncomputationally expensive for simply use all textual data indiscriminately. To\ntackle the effectiveness and efficiency problem, we propose a novel\nhierarchical noise filtering model, namely Match-Ignition. The main idea is to\nplug the well-known PageRank algorithm into the Transformer, to identify and\nfilter both sentence and word level noisy information in the matching process.\nNoisy sentences are usually easy to detect because previous work has shown that\ntheir similarity can be explicitly evaluated by the word overlapping, so we\ndirectly use PageRank to filter such information based on a sentence similarity\ngraph. Unlike sentences, words rely on their contexts to express concrete\nmeanings, so we propose to jointly learn the filtering and matching process, to\nwell capture the critical word-level matching signals. Specifically, a word\ngraph is first built based on the attention scores in each self-attention block\nof Transformer, and key words are then selected by applying PageRank on this\ngraph. In this way, noisy words will be filtered out layer by layer in the\nmatching process.

Observations of\ncoronal oscillations are used to infer physical properties of the coronal\nplasma using coronal seismology. Excitation and evolution of oscillations in\ncoronal loops is typically studied using highly idealised models of magnetic\nflux-tubes. In order to improve our understanding of coronal oscillations, it\nis necessary to consider the effect of realistic magnetic field topology and\nevolution. We study excitation and evolution of coronal oscillations in\nthree-dimensional self-consistent simulations of solar atmosphere spanning from\nconvection zone to solar corona using radiation-MHD code Bifrost. We use\nforward-modelled EUV emission and three-dimensional tracing of magnetic field\nto analyse oscillatory behaviour of individual magnetic loops. We further\nanalyse the evolution of individual plasma velocity components along the loops\nusing wavelet power spectra to capture changes in the oscillation periods.\nVarious types of oscillations commonly observed in the corona are present in\nthe simulation. We detect standing oscillations in both transverse and\nlongitudinal velocity components, including higher order oscillation harmonics.\nWe also show that self-consistent simulations reproduce existence of two\ndistinct regimes of transverse coronal oscillations: rapidly decaying\noscillations triggered by impulsive events and sustained small-scale\noscillations showing no observable damping. No harmonic drivers are detected at\nthe footpoints of oscillating loops. We show that coronal loop oscillations are\nabundant in self-consistent 3D MHD simulations of the solar atmosphere. The\ndynamic evolution and variability of individual magnetic loops suggest we need\nto reevaluate our models of monolithic and static coronal loops with constant\nlengths in favour of more realistic models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2021 11:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Conversely, in medical image\nresampling, images are considered as continuous functions, are warped by a\nspatial transformation, and are then sampled on a regular grid. In most cases,\nthe spatial warping changes the frequency characteristics of the continuous\nfunction and no special care is taken to ensure that the resampling grid\nrespects the conditions of the sampling theorem.

Most existing\nsocial recommendation models exploit pairwise relations to mine potential user\npreferences. However, real-life interactions among users are very complicated\nand user relations can be high-order. Hypergraph provides a natural way to\nmodel complex high-order relations, while its potentials for improving social\nrecommendation are under-explored. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose\na multi-channel hypergraph convolutional network to enhance social\nrecommendation by leveraging high-order user relations. Technically, each\nchannel in the network encodes a hypergraph that depicts a common high-order\nuser relation pattern via hypergraph convolution. By aggregating the embeddings\nlearned through multiple channels, we obtain comprehensive user representations\nto generate recommendation results. However, the aggregation operation might\nalso obscure the inherent characteristics of different types of high-order\nconnectivity information. To compensate for the aggregating loss, we\ninnovatively integrate self-supervised learning into the training of the\nhypergraph convolutional network to regain the connectivity information with\nhierarchical mutual information maximization. The experimental results on\nmultiple real-world datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the SOTA\nmethods, and the ablation study verifies the effectiveness of the multi-channel\nsetting and the self-supervised task.

An analytical theory for two specific cases of\ninteractions is formulated: normal situation where all buses board passengers\nfrom every bus stop, versus novel express buses where disjoint subsets of\nnon-interacting buses serve disjoint subsets of bus stops. Our formulation\nallows exact calculation of W for general loops in the two cases examined.\nCompared with regular buses, we present scenarios where express buses show\nimprovement in W. Useful insights are obtained from our theory: 1) there is a\nminimum number of buses needed, 2) splitting a crowded bus stop into two less\ncrowded ones always increases W for regular buses, 3) changing the destination\nof passengers and location of bus stops do not influence W. In the second part,\nwe introduce a reinforcement-learning platform that overcomes limitations of\nour analytical method to search for better allocations of buses to bus stops\nthat minimise W. Compared with the previous cases, any possible interaction\nbetween buses is allowed, unlocking novel emergent strategies. We apply this\ntool to a simple toy model and three empirically-motivated bus loops, based on\ndata collected from the Nanyang Technological University shuttle bus system.

This tool has practical applications because\nit works independently of the specific characteristics of a bus loop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2021 15:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

Besides the planning efficiency, the success of\nmanipulation tasks relies heavily on the accuracy of the perception system\nwhich is often noisy, especially if the target objects are perceived from a\ndistance.

In these contexts,\ninvestigators often choose a polynomial basis, or a Fourier basis, or wavelets,\nor something equally general. They also choose an order, or number of basis\nfunctions to fit, and (often) some kind of regularization.

High inter-arrival time variability of function invocations\nmotivates the providers to start new function instances upon each invocation,\nleading to significant cold-start delays that degrade user experience.

Precoded\ncommunications enable full frequency reuse (FFR) schemes in satellite\ncommunications (SATCOM) to achieve broader service availability and higher\nspectrum efficiency than with the conventional four-color (4CR) and two-color\n(2CR) reuse approaches. In this scope, we develop an over-the-air test-bed for\nend-to-end precoding validations. We use an actual multi-beam satellite to\ntransmit and receive precoded signals using the DVB-S2X standard based gateway\nand user terminals. The developed system is capable of end-to-end real-time\ncommunications over the satellite link including channel measurements and\nprecompensation. It is shown, that by successfully canceling inter-user\ninterference in the actual satellite FFR link precoding brings gains in terms\nof enhanced SINR and increased system goodput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2021 09:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}
