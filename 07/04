A set\nof background particles is used to specify either geometry-based spatial\nresolution, where the resolution is a function of distance to a solid body, or\nsolution-based adaptive resolution, where the resolution is a function of the\ncomputed solution.

We use lightweight piece-wise linear models to\nreplace the hash functions as they have small inference times and are\nsufficiently general to capture complex distributions. We analyze the learned\nmodels in terms of: the model inference time and the number of collisions.\nSurprisingly, we found that learned models are not much slower to compute than\nhash functions if optimized correctly. However, it turns out that learned\nmodels can only reduce the number of collisions (i.e., the number of times\ndifferent keys have the same hash value) if the model is able to over-fit to\nthe data; otherwise, it can not be better than an ordinary hash function.\nHence, how much better a learned model is in avoiding collisions highly depends\non the data and the ability of the model to over-fit. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of learned models, we used them as hash functions in the bucket\nchaining and Cuckoo hash tables. For bucket chaining hash table, we found that\nlearned models can achieve 30% smaller sizes and 10% lower probe latency. For\nCuckoo hash tables, in some datasets, learned models can increase the ratio of\nkeys stored in their primary locations by around 10%.

Pr0201 is known to\nhost a close-in (period of 4.4 days) giant planet (mass of 0.54$\\rm\nM_{\\rm{J}}$), while the other five cluster members in our sample (Pr0133,\nPr0081, Pr0208, Pr0051, and Pr0076) have no detected planets according to RV\nmeasurements. Using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise echelle spectra\nobtained with Keck/HIRES and a novel approach to equivalent width measurements\n(XSpect-EW), we derived abundances of up to 20 elements spanning a range of\ncondensation temperatures (Tc). We find a mean cluster metallicity of [Fe/H] =\n+0.21$\\pm$0.02 dex, in agreement with most previous determinations. We find\nmost of our elements show a [X/Fe] scatter of $\\sim$0.02-0.03 dex and conclude\nthat our stellar sample is chemically homogeneous. The Tc slope for the cluster\nmean abundances is consistent with zero and none of the stars in our sample\nexhibit individually a statistically significant Tc slope. Using a planet\nengulfment model, we find that the planet-host, Pr0201, shows no evidence of\nsignificant enrichment in its refractory elements when compared to the cluster\nmean that would be consistent with a planetary accretion scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2021 17:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

From a statistical point of view, fitting a neural network may\nbe seen as a kind of regression, where we seek a function from the input space\nto a space of classification probabilities that follows the \"general\" shape of\nthe data, but avoids overfitting by avoiding memorization of individual data\npoints. In statistics, this can be done by controlling the geometric complexity\nof the regression function. We propose to do something similar when fitting\nneural networks by controlling the slope of the network.\n  After defining the slope and discussing some of its theoretical properties,\nwe go on to show empirically in examples, using ReLU networks, that the\ndistribution of the slope of a well-trained neural network classifier is\ngenerally independent of the width of the layers in a fully connected network,\nand that the mean of the distribution only has a weak dependence on the model\narchitecture in general. The slope is of similar size throughout the relevant\nvolume, and varies smoothly. It also behaves as predicted in rescaling\nexamples. We discuss possible applications of the slope concept, such as using\nit as a part of the loss function or stopping criterion during network\ntraining, or ranking data sets in terms of their complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2021 17:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

To make the most use of the Gaussian processes, it is\nrequired to understand and utilize suitable mathematical tools such as the\nsymplectic space, symplectic algebra, and Wigner representation. Applying these\nmathematical tools to practical quantum scenarios, we developed various schemes\nfor quantum transduction, interference-based bosonic mode permutation and\nbosonic sensing. We demonstrated that generic coupler characterized by Gaussian\nunitary process can be transformed into a high-fidelity transducer, assuming\nthe access to infinite squeezing and adaptive feedforward with homodyne\nmeasurements. To address the practical limitation of finite squeezing, we\nexplored the interference-based protocols. These protocols let us freely\npermute bosonic modes only assuming the access to single-mode Gaussian\noperations and multiple uses of a given multi-mode Gaussian process. Thus, such\na scheme not only enables universal decoupling for bosonic systems, which is\nuseful for suppressing undesired coupling between the system and the\nenvironment, but also faithful bidirectional single-mode quantum transduction.\nMoreover, noticing that the Gaussian processes are appropriate theoretical\nmodels for optical sensors, we studied the quantum noise theory for optical\nparameter sensing and its potential in providing great measurement precision\nenhancement. We also extended the Gaussian theories to discrete variable\nsystems, with several examples such as quantum (gate) teleportation. All the\nanalyses originated from the fundamental quantum commutation relations, and\ntherefore are widely applicable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2021 18:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

Existing\nrepresentation learning methods on graphs have achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance on various graph-related tasks such as node classification, link\nprediction, etc. However, we observe that these methods could leak serious\nprivate information. For instance, one can accurately infer the links (or node\nidentity) in a graph from a node classifier (or link predictor) trained on the\nlearnt node representations by existing methods. To address the issue, we\npropose a privacy-preserving representation learning framework on graphs from\nthe \\emph{mutual information} perspective. Specifically, our framework includes\na primary learning task and a privacy protection task, and we consider node\nclassification and link prediction as the two tasks of interest. Our goal is to\nlearn node representations such that they can be used to achieve high\nperformance for the primary learning task, while obtaining performance for the\nprivacy protection task close to random guessing. We formally formulate our\ngoal via mutual information objectives. However, it is intractable to compute\nmutual information in practice. Then, we derive tractable variational bounds\nfor the mutual information terms, where each bound can be parameterized via a\nneural network. Next, we train these parameterized neural networks to\napproximate the true mutual information and learn privacy-preserving node\nrepresentations. We finally evaluate our framework on various graph datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2021 18:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

In oncology clinical research, an experimental treatment is\noften added to the standard of care therapy in multiple treatment phases to\nimprove patient outcomes. When the resulting new regimen provides a meaningful\nbenefit over standard of care, gaining insights into the contribution of each\ntreatment phase becomes important to properly guide clinical practice. New\nstatistical approaches are needed since traditional methods are inadequate in\nanswering such questions. RPSFT modelling is an approach for causal inference,\ntypically used to adjust for treatment switching in randomized clinical trials\nwith time-to-event endpoints. A tipping-point analysis is commonly used in\nsituations where a statistically significant treatment effect is suspected to\nbe an artifact of missing or unobserved data rather than a real treatment\ndifference. The methodology proposed in this article is an amalgamation of\nthese two ideas to investigate the contribution of a specific component of a\nregimen comprising multiple treatment phases.

Such trends allow the jitter to be detected with continuous\nmeasurements, in which case it can interfere with planet detectability.

By\nsplitting the energy or altering the active number of STAR-IOS elements,\nSTAR-IOSs provide high flexibility of successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) orders for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. Based on the\naforementioned advantages, this paper investigates a STAR-IOS-aided downlink\nNOMA network with randomly deployed users. We first propose three tractable\nchannel models for different application scenarios, namely the central limit\nmodel, the curve fitting model, and the M-fold convolution model. More\nspecifically, the central limit model fits the scenarios with large-size\nSTAR-IOSs while the curve fitting model is extended to evaluate multi-cell\nnetworks. However, these two models cannot obtain accurate diversity orders.\nHence, we figure out the M-fold convolution model to derive accurate diversity\norders. We consider three protocols for STAR-IOSs, namely, the energy splitting\n(ES) protocol, the time switching (TS) protocol, and the mode switching (MS)\nprotocol. Based on the ES protocol, we derive analytical outage probability\nexpressions for the paired NOMA users by the central limit model and the curve\nfitting model. Based on three STAR-IOS protocols, we derive the diversity gains\nof NOMA users by the M-fold convolution model. The analytical results reveal\nthat the diversity gain of NOMA users is equal to the active number of STAR-IOS\nelements. Numerical results indicate that 1) in high signal-to-noise ratio\nregions, the central limit model performs as an upper bound, while a lower\nbound is obtained by the curve fitting model; 2) the TS protocol has the best\nperformance but requesting more time blocks than other protocols; 3) the ES\nprotocol outperforms the MS protocol as the ES protocol has higher diversity\ngains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2021 05:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

For example,\npresidential elections often require a deterministic rule to be used [Liu et\nal., 2020], and small noises can lead to dramatic decreases in the prediction\naccuracy of deep neural networks, especially the underrepresented classes\n[Bagdasaryan et al., 2019].\n  In this paper, we propose a natural extension and relaxation of DP following\nthe worst average-case idea behind the celebrated smoothed analysis [Spielman\nand Teng, 2004]. Our notion, the smoothed DP, can effectively measure the\nprivacy leakage of mechanisms without external noises under realistic settings.\n  We prove several strong properties of the smoothed DP, including\ncomposability, robustness to post-processing and etc. We proved that any\ndiscrete mechanism with sampling procedures is more private than what DP\npredicts. In comparison, many continuous mechanisms with sampling procedures\nare still non-private under smoothed DP. Experimentally, we first verified that\nthe discrete sampling mechanisms are private in real-world elections. Then, we\napply the smoothed DP notion on quantized gradient descent, which indicates\nsome neural networks can be private without adding any extra noises. We believe\nthat these results contribute to the theoretical foundation of realistic\nprivacy measures beyond worst-case analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2021 06:55:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 18:30:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 22:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

When both fluid are Newtonian and discharged at constant flux, global\nsimilarity solutions were found. However, when the top fluid is strain-rate\nsoftening experiments have shown that each fluid front evolved with a different\nexponent. Here we explore theoretically and numerically such lubricated GCs in\na model that describes the axisymmetric spreading of a power-law fluid on top\nof a Newtonian fluid, where the discharge of both fluids is power law in time.\nWe find that the model admits similarity solutions only in specific cases,\nincluding the purely Newtonian case, for a certain discharge exponent, at\nasymptotic limits of the fluids viscosity ratio, and at the vicinity of the\nfluid fronts. Generally, each fluid front has a power-law time evolution with a\nsimilar exponent as a non-lubricated GC of the corresponding fluid, and\nintercepts that depend on both fluid properties. Consequently, we identify two\nmechanisms by which the inner lubricating fluid front outstrips the outer fluid\nfront. Many aspects of our theory are found consistent with recent laboratory\nexperiments. Discrepancies suggest that hydrofracturing or wall slip may be\nimportant near the fronts.

Due to the existence of a wide range of domains\nacross different products and services, cross-domain sentiment analysis methods\nhave received significant attention. These methods mitigate the domain gap\nbetween different applications by training cross-domain generalizable\nclassifiers which help to relax the need for data annotation for each domain.\nMost existing methods focus on learning domain-agnostic representations that\nare invariant with respect to both the source and the target domains. As a\nresult, a classifier that is trained using the source domain annotated data\nwould generalize well in a related target domain. We introduce a new domain\nadaptation method which induces large margins between different classes in an\nembedding space. This embedding space is trained to be domain-agnostic by\nmatching the data distributions across the domains. Large intraclass margins in\nthe source domain help to reduce the effect of \"domain shift\" on the classifier\nperformance in the target domain.

This study employs three kernel estimator\nfunctions to test the stationarity assumption in five software engineering\ndatasets that have been used in the construction of software effort estimation\nmodels. The kernel estimators are used in the generation of nonuniform weights\nwhich are subsequently employed in weighted linear regression modeling. In each\nmodel, older projects are assigned smaller weights while the more recently\ncompleted projects are assigned larger weights, to reflect their potentially\ngreater relevance to present or future projects that need to be estimated.\nPrediction errors are compared to those obtained from uniform models. Our\nresults indicate that, for the datasets that exhibit underlying nonstationary\nprocesses, uniform models are more accurate than the nonuniform models; that\nis, models based on kernel estimator functions are worse than the models where\nno weighting was applied. In contrast, the accuracies of uniform and nonuniform\nmodels for datasets that exhibited stationary processes were essentially\nequivalent.

Historically, this\nconstruction was motivated by the well-known Riemann's quartic length element\nexample. Quite surprisingly, the same quartic expression emerges in solid-state\nelectrodynamics as a basic dispersion relation -- covariant Fresnel equation.\nConsequently, Riemann's quartic length expression can be interpreted as a\nmathematical model of a well-established physics phenomena. In this paper, we\npresent various examples of Riemann's quartic that demonstrate that Finsler's\ngeometry is too restrictive even in the case of a positive definite Euclidean\nsignature space. In the case of the spaces endowed with an indefinite\n(Minkowski) signature, there are much more singular hypersurfaces where the\nstrong axioms of Finsler's geometry are broken down.

Since the data owner does not have the full\ncontrol over his sensitive data in a cloud-based database solution, many\norganizations are reluctant to move forward with Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS)\nsolutions.

In order to thoroughly\nanalyze the various parameters of the stars, we developed three models by\nchoosing various physically acceptable forms of metric potential $ e^{d(r)} $\nand radial pressure $ p_r(r) $. We also analyze the impact of teleparallel\ngravity's parameters $ \\beta $ and $ \\beta_1 $ on the description of the\nstellar structures. We calculated model parameters such that models describing\nvarious observed neutron stars obey all physical conditions to be potentially\nstable and causal. By analyzing the impact of various parameters of\nteleparallel gravity on the description of anisotropic stellar structures, we\nfound that three models developed in this paper can describe anisotropic\nneutron stars ranging from low density to high density. Finally, we obtain a\nquadratic Equation of State for each model describing various neutron stars,\nwhich can be utilized to find compositions of the stellar structures. It is\nvery useful to find models that can exhibit quadratic EOS, since material\ncompositions of real neutron stars and strange stars are found to exhibit\nquadratic EOS by various authors. Non linear $ f(T) $ model gives high\ndeviation of EOS from quadratic behaviour, thus, in this paper we work with\nlinear $ f(T) $ function by using diagonal tetrad to model realistic compact\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2021 14:24:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 16:29:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 09:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Yet, cleanly extracting spreading vulnerability of a complex system\ndirectly from the topological information of the temporal network remains a\nchallenge. Here, using data from a diverse set of real-world complex systems,\nwe develop the `entropy of temporal entanglement' as a novel and insightful\nquantity to measure topological complexities of temporal networks. We show that\nthis parameter-free quantity naturally allows for topological comparisons\nacross vastly different complex systems. Importantly, by simulating three\ndifferent types of stochastic dynamical processes playing out on top of\ntemporal networks, we demonstrate that the entropy of temporal entanglement\nserves as a quantitative embodiment of the systems' spreading vulnerability,\nirrespective of the details of the processes. In being able to do so, i.e., in\nbeing able to quantitatively extract a complex system's proneness to facilitate\nspreading phenomena from topology, this entropic measure opens itself for\napplications in a wide variety of natural, social, biological and engineered\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2021 14:37:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 07:29:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 10:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

Though recent methods start to\nincorporate pre-defined attribute information (e.g., colour, style, length,\netc.) for learning item representations and improving the model\ninterpretability, their utilisation of attribute information is still mainly\nreserved for enhancing the learned item representations and generating\nexplanations via post-processing.

Using the combined Suzaku\nobservations, we have carefully investigated this interesting region by\nanalyzing the spectra of various annuli and extracting projected thermodynamic\nprofiles. We find that the projected temperature profile shows a break near\nr200, indicating a shock with M = 1.9+-0.3. Corresponding discontinuities are\nalso found in the projected emission measure and the density profiles at the\nsame location. This evidence of a shock front so far away from the cluster\ncenter is unprecedented, and may provide a first insight into the properties of\nlarge-scale virial shocks which shape the process of galaxy cluster growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2021 15:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

For an UBCMPG $G$ with respect to an UBC $C$, the\nsubgraph of $G$ induced by the set of edges belonging to $C$ and its interior\n(or exterior), denoted by $G^C$, is called a base-module of $G$; in particular,\nwhen the length of $C$ is equal to four, we use $C_4$ instead of $C$ and call\n$G^{C_4}$ a 4-base-module. In this paper, we first study the properties of\nUBCMPGs and show that every 4-base-module $G^{C_4}$ contains a 4-coloring under\nwhich $C_4$ is bichromatic and there are at least two bichromatic paths with\ndifferent colors between one pair of diagonal vertices of $C_4$ (these paths\nare called module-paths). We further prove that every 4-base-module $G^{C_4}$\ncontains a 4-coloring (called decycle coloring) for which the ends of a\nmodule-path are colored by distinct colors. Finally, based on the technique of\nthe contracting and extending operations of MPGs, we prove that\n55-configurations and 56-configurations are reducible by converting the\nreducibility problem of these two classes of configurations into the decycle\ncoloring problem of 4-base-modules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2021 13:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

However, the performance of the\nestablished models has been limited by their incapability of dealing with the\ninteractions between drugs and proteins, which play an important role in the\nmechanism behind the BBB penetrating behaviors. To address this limitation, we\nemployed the relational graph convolutional network (RGCN) to handle the\ndrug-protein interactions as well as the properties of each individual drug.\nThe RGCN model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.872, an AUROC of 0.919 and an\nAUPRC of 0.838 for the testing dataset with the drug-protein interactions and\nthe Mordred descriptors as the input. Introducing drug-drug similarity to\nconnect structurally similar drugs in the data graph further improved the\ntesting results, giving an overall accuracy of 0.876, an AUROC of 0.926 and an\nAUPRC of 0.865.
