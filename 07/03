This heating, which is orders of\nmagnitude larger than that expected from Johnson-Nyquist noise, results in ion\nmotion that leads to decoherence and reduced fidelity in quantum logic gates.\nThe exact origin of anomalous heating is an open question, but experiments\npoint to adsorbates on trap electrodes as a likely source. Many different\nmodels of anomalous heating have been proposed, but these models have yet to\npinpoint the atomistic origin of the experimentally-observed $1/\\omega$\nelectric field noise scaling observed in ion traps at frequencies between\n0.1-10 MHz. In this work, we perform the first computational study of the ion\ntrap electric field noise produced by the motions of multiple monolayers of\nadsorbates described by first principles potentials. In so doing, we show that\ncorrelated adsorbate motions play a definitive role in producing $1/\\omega$\nnoise and identify candidate collective adsorbate motions, including\ntranslational and rotational motions of adsorbate patches and multilayer\nexchanges, that give rise to $1/\\omega$ scaling at the MHz frequencies\ntypically employed in ion traps. These results demonstrate that multi-adsorbate\nsystems, even simple ones, can give rise to a set of activated motions that can\nproduce the $1/\\omega$ noise observed in ion traps and that collective, rather\nthan individual, adsorbate motions are much more likely to give rise to\nlow-frequency heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 16:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-05"}

Finally, quadruped\nrobots are more stable than bipeds and can carry larger payloads than snakes\nand bipeds but struggle to navigate soft soil, sand, ice, and constrained\nenvironments. A reconfigurable robot can achieve the best of all worlds.\nUnfortunately, state-of-the-art reconfigurable robots rely on the rearrangement\nof modules through complicated mechanisms to dissemble and assemble at\ndifferent places, increasing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements.\nWe propose Reconfigurable Quadrupedal-Bipedal Snake Robots (ReQuBiS), which can\ntransform between mobility modes without rearranging modules. Hence, requiring\njust a single modification mechanism. Furthermore, our design allows the robot\nto split into two agents to perform tasks in parallel for biped and snake\nmobility. Experimental results demonstrate these mobility capabilities in\nsnake, quadruped, and biped modes and transitions between them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 17:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-05"}

For the X-ray weighted metallicity $Z_X$, stellar feedback impacts the\nenrichment of halo gas.

In this work,\nwe explore connections between these analog algorithms, as well as limits in\nwhich they become approximations of the optimal procedure.Notably, we explore\nhow the optimal procedure approaches a smooth adiabatic procedure but with a\nsuperposed oscillatory pattern that can be explained in terms of the\ninteractions between the ground state and first excited state that effect the\ncoherent error cancellation of diabatic transitions.

The primary\nobjective of this work is a direct numerical simulation of multiple particles\nundergoing Brownian motion in a three-dimensional sphere with boundary traps,\ncompute MFPT values by averaging Brownian escape times, and compare the results\nwith asymptotic results obtained by solving the Poisson PDE problem. A\ncomprehensive study of results obtained from the simulations shows that the\ndifference between Brownian and asymptotic results for the escape times mostly\nnot exceed $1\\%$ accuracy. This comparison in some sense validates the narrow\nescape PDE problem itself as an approximation (averaging) of the multiple\nphysical Brownian motion runs. This work also predicted that how many\nsingle-particle simulations are required to match the predicted asymptotic\naveraged MFPT values. The next objective of this work is to study dynamics of\nBrownian particles near the boundary by estimating the average percentage of\ntime spent by Brownian particle near the domain boundary for both the\nanisotropic and isotropic diffusion. It is shown that the Brownian particles\nspend more in the boundary layer than predicted by the boundary layer relative\nvolume, with the effect being more pronounced in a narrow layer near the\nspherical wall. It is also shown that taking into account anisotropic diffusion\nyields larger times a particle spends near the boundary, and smaller escape\ntimes than those predicted by the isotropic diffusion model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 18:38:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 01:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Since the first systematic\nobservations in the 1990's, these lines have been seldom observed due to the\ninstrumental challenges involved at these longer wavelengths. We revisit these\nlines and investigate their formation in different solar features. We\nsynthesize the Ti I multiplet using a snapshot from 3D MHD simulation of a\nsunspot and explore the properties of two of its lines in comparison with two\ncommonly used iron lines at 630.25 nm and $1.5648\\,\\mu$m.

Consequently, inside the sunspot it is easier to invert these lines and\nto infer the atmospheric properties, compared to the iron lines. The Cryo-NIRSP\ninstrument at the DKIST will provide the first ever high resolution\nobservations in this wavelength range. In this preparatory study, we\ndemonstrate the unique temperature and magnetic sensitivities of the Ti\nmultiplet, by probing the Sun's coolest regions which are not favourable for\nthe formation of other commonly used spectral lines.

We demonstrate\nthat small design decisions in how deletions are implemented have dramatic\neffects on the asymptotic performance of insertions, so that, even if a hash\ntable operates continuously at a load factor $1 - \\Theta(1/x)$, the expected\namortized cost per operation is $\\tilde{O}(x)$. This is because tombstones\ncreated by deletions actually cause an anti-clustering effect that combats\nprimary clustering.\n  We also present a new variant of linear probing (which we call graveyard\nhashing) that completely eliminates primary clustering on \\emph{any} sequence\nof operations: if, when an operation is performed, the current load factor is\n$1 - 1/x$ for some $x$, then the expected cost of the operation is $O(x)$. One\ncorollary is that, in the external-memory model with a data blocks of size $B$,\ngraveyard hashing offers the following remarkable guarantee: at any load factor\n$1 - 1/x$ satisfying $x = o(B)$, graveyard hashing achieves $1 + o(1)$ expected\nblock transfers per operation. Past external-memory hash tables have only been\nable to offer a $1 + o(1)$ guarantee when the block size $B$ is at least\n$\\Omega(x^2)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 19:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

An accurate and\nefficient traveltime computation for P and S waves is crucial for the success\nof these applications. However, solutions to the Eikonal equation with a\ncomplex phase velocity field in anisotropic media is challenging. The Eikonal\nequation is a first-order, hyperbolic, nonlinear partial differential equation\n(PDE) that represents the high-frequency asymptotic approximation of the wave\nequation. The fast marching and sweeping methods are commonly used due to their\nefficiency in numercally solving Eikonal equation. However, these methods\nsuffer from numerical inaccuracy in anisotropic media with sharp heterogeneity,\nirregular surface topography and complex phase velocity fields. This study\npresents a new method to solving the Eikonal equation by employing the\nperidynamic differential operator (PDDO). The PDDO provides the nonlocal form\nof the Eikonal equation by introducing an internal length parameter (horizon)\nand a weight function with directional nonlocality. The operator is immune to\ndiscontinuities in the form sharp changes in field or model variables and\ninvokes the direction of traveltime in a consistent manner. The weight function\ncontrols the degree of association among points within the horizon. Solutions\nare constructed in a consistent manner without upwind assumptions through\nsimple discretization. The capability of this approach is demonstrated by\nconsidering different types of Eikonal equations on complex velocity models in\nanisotropic media. The examples demonstrate its unconditional numerical\nstability and results compare well with the reference solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 20:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Although Bayesian tests overcome\nseveral criticisms, some limits remain. We propose a Bayesian two-interval test\n(2IT) in which two hypotheses on an effect being present or absent are\nexpressed as prespecified joint or disjoint intervals and their posterior\nprobabilities are computed. The same formalism can be applied for superiority,\nnon-inferiority, or equivalence tests. The 2IT was studied for three real\nexamples and three sets of simulations (comparison of a proportion and a mean\nto a reference and comparison of two proportions). Several scenarios were\ncreated (with different sample sizes), and simulations were conducted to\ncompute the probabilities of the parameter of interest being in the interval\ncorresponding to either hypothesis given the data generated under one of the\nhypotheses. Posterior estimates were obtained using conjugacy with a\nlow-informative prior. Bias was also estimated. The probability of accepting a\nhypothesis when that hypothesis is true progressively increases the sample\nsize, tending towards 1, while the probability of accepting the other\nhypothesis is always very low (less than 5%) and tends towards 0. The speed of\nconvergence varies with the gap between the hypotheses and with their width. In\nthe case of a mean, the bias is low and rapidly becomes negligible. We propose\na Bayesian test that follows a scientifically sound process, in which two\ninterval hypotheses are explicitly used and tested. The proposed test has\nalmost none of the limitations of the NHT and suggests new features, such as a\nrationale for serendipity or a justification for a \"trend in data\". The\nconceptual framework of the 2-IT also allows the calculation of a sample size\nand the use of sequential methods in numerous contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 20:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

Muscular effort distribution, representing the participation of each\nmuscle in the training activity, was measured with electromyography sensors\n(EMG) and defined as the individual activation divided by the total muscle\ngroup activation. A four degrees-of-freedom robot and its impedance control\nsystem are used to create advanced exercise protocols whereby the user is asked\nto follow a path against the machine's neutral path and resistance. In this\nwork, the robot establishes a zero-effort circular path, and the subject is\nasked to follow an elliptical trajectory. The control system produces a\nuser-defined stiffness between the deviations from the neutral path and the\ntorque applied by the subject. The trajectory and resistance settings used in\nthe experiments were the orientation of the ellipse and a stiffness parameter.\nMultiple combinations of these parameters were used to measure their effects on\nthe muscle effort distribution. An artificial neural network (ANN) used part of\nthe data for training the model. Then, the accuracy of the model was evaluated\nusing the rest of the data.

Understanding the discharge mechanism at\natomic length scales will improve practical CFx energy density, rate\ncapability, and rechargeability. So far, purely experimental techniques have\nnot identified the correct discharge mechanism or explained the discharge\nvoltage.

If the emitting particle energies are high enough, this inverse Compton\n(IC) scattering enters the Klein-Nishina regime, which differs from the\nlow-energy Thomson IC limit in two significant ways. First, radiative losses\nbecome inherently discrete, with particles delivering an order-unity fraction\nof their energies to single photons.

We\ncompare the marginal posterior precision of the precision matrix under four\npriors: flat, conjugate Normal-Wishart, Normal-MGIG and a general independent.\nUnder the flat and conjugate priors, the Laplace-approximated posterior\nprecision is not a function of the design matrix rendering useless any efforts\nto find an optimal experimental design to infer the precision matrix. In\ncontrast, the Normal-MGIG and general independent priors do allow for the\nsearch of optimal experimental designs, yet there is a sharp upper bound on the\ninformation that can be extracted from a given experiment.

Under this mapping, void properties are affected by three effects:\n(i) a systematic expansion as a consequence of the distortions induced by\ngalaxy dynamics, (ii) the Alcock-Paczynski volume effect, which manifests as an\noverall expansion or contraction depending on the fiducial cosmology, and (iii)\na systematic off-centring along the line of sight as a consequence of the\ndistortions induced by void dynamics. We found that correlations are also\naffected by an additional source of distortions: the ellipticity of voids. This\nis the first time that distortions due to the off-centring and ellipticity\neffects are detected and quantified. With a simplified test, we verified that\nthe Gaussian streaming model is still robust provided all these effects are\ntaken into account, laying the foundations for improvements in current models\nin order to obtain unbiased cosmological constraints from spectroscopic\nsurveys.

Existing sensor-based approaches rely on various features extracted\nfrom images and point clouds. However, any selected features are not available\nconsistently, because the visual and geometrical characteristics of orchard\nrows change drastically when tree types, growth stages, canopy management\npractices, seasons, and weather conditions change. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel localization method that doesn't rely on features; instead, it relies on\nthe concept of a row-sensing template, which is the expected observation of a\n3D sensor traveling in an orchard row, when the sensor is anywhere on the\ncenterline and perfectly aligned with it. First, the template is built using a\nfew measurements, provided that the sensor's true pose with respect to the\ncenterline is available. Then, during navigation, the best pose estimate (and\nits confidence) is estimated by maximizing the match between the template and\nthe sensed point cloud using particle-filtering. The method can adapt to\nvarious orchards and conditions by re-building the template. Experiments were\nperformed in a vineyard, and in an orchard in different seasons. Results showed\nthat the lateral mean absolute error (MAE) was less than 3.6% of the row width,\nand the heading MAE was less than 1.72 degrees. Localization was robust, as\nerrors didn't increase when less than 75% of measurement points were missing.\nThe results indicate that template-based localization can provide a generic\napproach for accurate and robust localization in real-world orchards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2021 01:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

The TUS was\ndeveloped and manufactured as a prototype of the larger project K-EUSO with the\nmain purpose of testing the efficiency of the method for measuring the\nultraviolet signal of extensive air shower (EAS) in the Earth's night\natmosphere. Despite the low spatial resolution ($\\sim5\\times5$ km$^2$ at sea\nlevel), several events were recorded which are very similar to EAS as for the\nsignal profile and kinematics. Reconstruction of the parameters of such events\nis complicated by a short track length, an asymmetry of the image, and an\nuncertainty in the sensitivity distribution of the TUS channels.

Two cases of boundary\nconditions on the outer surface of the cylinder, namely, free and constrained\nare studied to understand their influence on the buckling behaviour. The\nderived equations are solved numerically using the compound matrix method to\nevaluate the critical pressure. The effects of the thickness of the cylinder\nand the compressibility of the material on the critical pressure are\ninvestigated for both the boundary conditions. The results reveal that for an\nisotropic material, the bifurcation occurs along the axial direction of the\ncylinder at lower critical pressure compared to the circumferential direction\nfor all cases considered. Finally, we demonstrate the tailorability of\nbifurcation behaviour of the cylinder by adding reinforcements along the length\nof cylinder. The anisotropic hyperelastic material behaviour for triggering the\nbifurcation in the circumferential direction is studied by varying the material\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2021 08:13:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 17:32:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

Some patients with MD\nexperience vestibular drop attacks (VDAs), which are violent falls caused by\nspurious vestibular signals from the utricle and/or saccule. Recent surgical\nwork has shown that patients who experience VDAs also show distrupted utricular\notolithic membranes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine if\notolithic membrane damage alone is sufficient to induce spurious vestibular\nsignals, thus potentially eliciting VDAs and the vestibular dysfunction seen in\npatients with MD. METHODS: We use a previously developed numerical model to\ndescribe the nonlinear dynamics of an array of active, elastically coupled hair\ncells. We then reduce the coupling strength of a selected region of the\nmembrane to model the effects of tissue damage. RESULTS: As we reduce the\ncoupling strength, we observe large and abrupt spikes in hair bundle position.\nAs bundle displacements from the equilibrium position have been shown to lead\nto depolarization of the hair-cell soma and hence trigger neural activity, this\nspontaneous activity could elicit false detection of a vestibular signal.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this numerical model suggest that otolithic\nmembrane damage alone may be sufficient to induce VDAs and the vestibular\ndysfunction seen in patients with MD. Future experimental work is needed to\nconfirm these results in vitro.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2021 08:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

Nevertheless, due to the proliferation of smart devices\nequipped with various sensors, it is very difficult to profile the workers in\nterms of sensing ability.

Intuitively, we expect the soft labels and\nhard labels to be concordant w.r.t. their orders of probabilities. However, we\nfound critical order violations between hard labels and soft labels in\naugmented samples. For example, for an augmented sample $x=0.7*panda+0.3*cat$,\nwe expect the order of meaningful soft labels to be\n$P_\\text{soft}(panda|x)>P_\\text{soft}(cat|x)>P_\\text{soft}(other|x)$. But real\nsoft labels usually violate the order, e.g.\n$P_\\text{soft}(tiger|x)>P_\\text{soft}(panda|x)>P_\\text{soft}(cat|x)$. We\nattribute this to the unsatisfactory generalization ability of the teacher,\nwhich leads to the prediction error of augmented samples. Empirically, we found\nthe violations are common and injure the knowledge transfer. In this paper, we\nintroduce order restrictions to data augmentation for knowledge distillation,\nwhich is denoted as isotonic data augmentation (IDA).

This resemblance has been known for decades, but the\ncorrespondence between the two systems has never been properly assessed. Here\nwe demonstrate that this correspondence can be exact, approximate, or break\ndown, depending on the cavity nonlinear response and driving frequency. For\nweak on-resonance driving, the nonlinearity vanishes and the correspondence is\nexact: The cavity dissipation and driving amplitude define a scalar potential,\nthe noise variance defines an effective temperature, and the intra-cavity field\nsatisfies Boltzmann statistics. For moderately strong non-resonant driving, the\ncorrespondence is approximate: We introduce a potential that approximately\ncaptures the nonlinear dynamics of the intra-cavity field, and we quantify the\naccuracy of this approximation via deviations from Boltzmann statistics. For\nvery strong non-resonant driving, the correspondence breaks down: The\nintra-cavity field dynamics is governed by non-conservative forces which\npreclude a description based on a scalar potential only. We furthermore show\nthat this breakdown is accompanied by a phase transition for the intra-cavity\nfield fluctuations, reminiscent of a non-Hermitian phase transition.

The core of MOCC is a novel multi-objective\nreinforcement learning framework for CC that can automatically learn the\ncorrelations between different application requirements and the corresponding\noptimal control policies. Under this framework, MOCC further applies transfer\nlearning to transfer the knowledge from past experience to new applications,\nquickly adapting itself to a new objective even if it is unforeseen.

In particular, infinite-domain CSPs have been\nintensively used in subareas of AI such as spatio-temporal reasoning. Since\nconstraint satisfaction is a computationally hard problem, much work has been\ndevoted to identifying restricted problems that are efficiently solvable. One\nway of doing this is to restrict the interactions of variables and constraints,\nand a highly successful approach is to bound the treewidth of the underlying\nprimal graph. Bodirsky & Dalmau [J. Comput. System. Sci. 79(1), 2013] and Huang\net al. [Artif. Intell. 195, 2013] proved that CSP$(\\Gamma)$ can be solved in\n$n^{f(w)}$ time (where $n$ is the size of the instance, $w$ is the treewidth of\nthe primal graph and $f$ is a computable function) for certain classes of\nconstraint languages $\\Gamma$. We improve this bound to $f(w) \\cdot n^{O(1)}$,\nwhere the function $f$ only depends on the language $\\Gamma$, for CSPs whose\nbasic relations have the patchwork property. Hence, such problems are\nfixed-parameter tractable and our algorithm is asymptotically faster than the\nprevious ones. Additionally, our approach is not restricted to binary\nconstraints, so it is applicable to a strictly larger class of problems than\nthat of Huang et al. However, there exist natural problems that are covered by\nBodirsky & Dalmau's algorithm but not by ours, and we begin investigating ways\nof generalising our results to larger families of languages. We also analyse\nour algorithm with respect to its running time and show that it is optimal\n(under the Exponential Time Hypothesis) for certain languages such as Allen's\nInterval Algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2021 13:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

QKSA is a general\nreinforcement learning agent that can be used to model classical and quantum\ndynamics. It merges ideas from universal artificial general intelligence,\nconstructor theory and genetic programming to build a robust and general\nframework for testing the capabilities of the agent in a variety of\nenvironments. It takes the artificial life (or, animat) path to artificial\ngeneral intelligence where a population of intelligent agents are instantiated\nto explore valid ways of modelling the perceptions. The multiplicity and\nsurvivability of the agents are defined by the fitness, with respect to the\nexplainability and predictability, of a resource-bounded computational model of\nthe environment. This general learning approach is then employed to model the\nphysics of an environment based on subjective observer states of the agents.

Our NS-Solver consists of a problem\nreader to encode problems, a programmer to generate symbolic equations, and a\nsymbolic executor to obtain answers. Along with target expression supervision,\nour solver is also optimized via 4 new auxiliary objectives to enforce\ndifferent symbolic reasoning: a) self-supervised number prediction task\npredicting both number quantity and number locations; b) commonsense constant\nprediction task predicting what prior knowledge (e.g. how many legs a chicken\nhas) is required; c) program consistency checker computing the semantic loss\nbetween predicted equation and target equation to ensure reasonable equation\nmapping; d) duality exploiting task exploiting the quasi duality between\nsymbolic equation generation and problem's part-of-speech generation to enhance\nthe understanding ability of a solver.

The multiple partners matching game generalizes the matching\ngame by allowing each player to have more than one possibly repeated partner.\nIn this paper, we study profit-sharing in multiple partners matching games. A\ncentral concept for profit-sharing is the core which consists of all possible\nways of distributing the profit among individual players such that the grand\ncoalition remains intact. The core of multiple partners matching games may be\nempty [Deng et al., Algorithmic aspects of the core of combinatorial\noptimization games, Math. Oper.

We provide an LP-based\nmechanism guaranteeing that no coalition is paid less than $2/3$ times the\nprofit it makes on its own.

Social interactions determine the contact\nnetwork among individuals, while spreading, requiring individual-to-individual\ntransmission, takes place on top of the network. Studying the topological\naspects of a contact network, therefore, not only has the potential of leading\nto valuable insights into how the behavior of individuals impacts spreading\nphenomena, but it may also open up possibilities for devising effective\nbehavioral interventions. Because of the temporal nature of interactions -\nsince the topology of the network, containing who is in contact with whom,\nwhen, for how long, and in which precise sequence, varies (rapidly) in time -\nanalyzing them requires developing network methods and metrics that respect\ntemporal variability, in contrast to those developed for static (i.e.,\ntime-invariant) networks. Here, by means of event mapping, we propose a method\nto quantify how quickly agents mingle by transforming temporal network data of\nagent contacts. We define a novel measure called 'contact sequence centrality',\nwhich quantifies the impact of an individual on the contact sequences,\nreflecting the individual's behavioral potential for spreading. Comparing\ncontact sequence centrality across agents allows for ranking the impact of\nagents and identifying potential 'behavioral super-spreaders'. The method is\napplied to social interaction data collected at an art fair in Amsterdam. We\nrelate the measure to the existing network metrics, both temporal and static,\nand find that (mostly at longer time scales) traditional metrics lose their\nresemblance to contact sequence centrality. Our work highlights the importance\nof accounting for the sequential nature of contacts when analyzing social\ninteractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2021 14:21:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 10:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

Intrusion\ndetection systems seek to address this threat by preemptively detecting attacks\nin real time while attempting to block them or minimizing their damage. These\nsystems can function in many ways being some of them based on artificial\nintelligence methods. Datasets containing both normal network traffic and cyber\nattacks are used for training these algorithms so that they can learn the\nunderlying patterns of network-based data. The CIDDS-001 is one of the most\nused datasets for network-based intrusion detection research. Regarding this\ndataset, in the majority of works published so far, the Class label was used\nfor training machine learning algorithms. However, there is another label in\nthe CIDDS-001, AttackType, that seems very promising for this purpose and\nremains considerably unexplored. This work seeks to make a comparison between\ntwo machine learning models, K-Nearest Neighbours and Random Forest, which were\ntrained with both these labels in order to ascertain whether AttackType can\nproduce reliable results in comparison with the Class label.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 22:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

For astronomical\nspectrometry applications, SRON develops a Frequency Domain Multiplexing (FDM)\nread-out system for kilopixel arrays of such TESs. Each TES is voltage biased\nat a specific frequency in the range 1 to 5 MHz. Isolation between the\nindividual pixels is obtained through very narrow-band (high-Q) lithographic LC\nresonators. To prevent energy resolution degradation due to intermodulation\nline noise, the bias frequencies are distributed on a regular grid. The\nrequirements on the accuracy of the LC resonance frequency are very high. The\ndeviation of the resonance frequencies due to production tolerances is\nsignificant with respect to the bandwidth, and a controller is necessary to\ncompensate for the LC series impedance. We present two such controllers: a\nsimple orthogonal proportional-integrating (PI) controller and a more complex\nimpedance estimator. Both controllers operate in baseband and try to make the\nTES current in-phase with the bias voltage, effectively operating as\nphase-locked loops (PLL). They allow off-LC-resonance operation of the TES\npixels, while preserving TES thermal response and energy resolution. Extensive\nexperimental results -- published in a companion paper recently -- with the\nproposed methods, show that these controllers allow the preservation of single\npixel energy resolution in multiplexed operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 18:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

Boost-R\nconstructs an ensemble of gradient boosted additive trees to estimate the\ncumulative intensity function of the recurrent event process, where a new tree\nis added to the ensemble by minimizing the regularized L2 distance between the\nobserved and predicted cumulative intensity. Unlike conventional regression\ntrees, a time-dependent function is constructed by Boost-R on each tree leaf.\nThe sum of these functions, from multiple trees, yields the ensemble estimator\nof the cumulative intensity. The divide-and-conquer nature of tree-based\nmethods is appealing when hidden sub-populations exist within a heterogeneous\npopulation. The non-parametric nature of regression trees helps to avoid\nparametric assumptions on the complex interactions between event processes and\nfeatures. Critical insights and advantages of Boost-R are investigated through\ncomprehensive numerical examples. Datasets and computer code of Boost-R are\nmade available on GitHub. To our best knowledge, Boost-R is the first gradient\nboosted additive-tree-based approach for modeling large-scale recurrent event\ndata with both static and dynamic feature information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2021 02:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

This can lead to unwanted consequences such as overloading\nhealth care systems and overtreatment, with potential harms to healthy\nindividuals. The advent of machine-learning tools to assist diagnosis -- while\npromising rapid and more personalised patient management and screening -- might\ncontribute to this issue. The identification of overdiagnosis is usually post\nhoc and demonstrated after long periods (from years to decades) and costly\nrandomised control trials. In this paper, we present an innovative approach\nthat allows us to preemptively detect potential cases of overdiagnosis during\npredictive model development. This approach is based on the combination of\nlabels obtained from a prediction model and clustered medical trajectories,\nusing sepsis in adults as a test case. This is one of the first attempts to\nquantify machine-learning induced overdiagnosis and we believe will serves as a\nplatform for further development, leading to guidelines for safe deployment of\ncomputational diagnostic tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2021 11:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

Automatically tagging\nnew questions with existing taxonomy will help organize these questions into\ndifferent classes of hierarchical taxonomy so that they can be searched based\non the facets like chapter. This task can be formulated as a flat multi-class\nclassification problem. Usually, flat classification based methods ignore the\nsemantic relatedness between the terms in the hierarchical taxonomy and the\nquestions. Some traditional methods also suffer from the class imbalance issues\nas they consider only the leaf nodes ignoring the hierarchy. Hence, we\nformulate the problem as a similarity-based retrieval task where we optimize\nthe semantic relatedness between the taxonomy and the questions. We demonstrate\nthat our method helps to handle the unseen labels and hence can be used for\ntaxonomy tagging in the wild. In this method, we augment the question with its\ncorresponding answer to capture more semantic information and then align the\nquestion-answer pair's contextualized embedding with the corresponding label\n(taxonomy) vector representations. The representations are aligned by\nfine-tuning a transformer based model with a loss function that is a\ncombination of the cosine similarity and hinge rank loss. The loss function\nmaximizes the similarity between the question-answer pair and the correct label\nrepresentations and minimizes the similarity to unrelated labels. Finally, we\nperform experiments on two real-world datasets. We show that the proposed\nlearning method outperforms representations learned using the multi-class\nclassification method and other state of the art methods by 6% as measured by\nRecall@k. We also demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on unseen\nbut related learning content like the learning objectives without re-training\nthe network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2021 11:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

Why is which-way (welcher weg)\ninformation incompatible with wave interference? How to explain Wheeler's\ndelayed choice experiment? Most crucially, how can the photon divide at the\nfirst beam splitter and yet terminate on either arm with its undiminished\nenergy? The position advanced is that the photon has two identities, one\nsupporting particle features and the other wave features. There is photon\nkinetic energy that never splits (on half-silvered mirrors) or diffracts (in\npinholes or slits). Then there are photon probability waves that do diffract\nand can reinforce or cancel. Photon kinetic energy is oscillatory; its cycles\nrequire/occupy time. E = mc2 suggests that kinetic energy is physically real as\noccurrence in time just as rest mass is physically real as existence in space;\nboth are quantized and both occupy/require a dimension for their occurrence or\nexistence. Photon kinetic energy (KE) thus resides in time, but is still\npresent/available for interactions (events) in space; rest mass (e.g., your\ndesk) resides in space but is still present/available for interactions (events)\nin time. While photon probability waves progress in space and diffract there,\nphoton KE resides in time and never diffracts in space; at reception it always\narrives whole and imitates particle impact without being a particle. Photon\nprobability waves are real; they diffract in space. Acknowledging that the\nphoton has two identities (residing energy and progressing probability),\nexplains photon dual nature. And wave-particle duality is central to quantum\nmechanics. Understanding it leads to new insights into entanglement,\nnonlocality and the measurement problem.
