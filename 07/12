Nonlinear methods differ from\nlinear based techniques by their use of a nonlinear mapping instead of adding\nnew vectors to enlarge the projection basis. Invariant manifolds have been\nfirst introduced in vibration theory within the context of nonlinear normal\nmodes (NNMs) and have been initially computed from the modal basis, using\neither a graph representation or a normal form approach to compute mappings and\nreduced dynamics. These developments are first recalled following a historical\nperspective, where the main applications were first oriented toward structural\nmodels that can be expressed thanks to partial differential equations (PDE).\nThey are then replaced in the more general context of the parametrisation of\ninvariant manifold that allows unifying the approaches. Then the specific case\nof structures discretized with the finite element method is addressed. Implicit\ncondensation, giving rise to a projection onto a stress manifold, and modal\nderivatives, used in the framework of the quadratic manifold, are first\nreviewed. Finally, recent developments allowing direct computation of\nreduced-order models (ROMs) relying on invariant manifolds theory are detailed.\nApplicative examples are shown and the extension of the methods to deal with\nfurther complications are reviewed.

Even though this effect is enhanced by the\nsquare of the gravitational compactness, the coefficient of bulk viscosity is\nlikely too small to lead to observable effects in the waveform during the late\ninspiral, when only considering the orbital motion itself. In the post-merger,\nhowever, the characteristic time-scales and spatial scales are different,\npotentially leading to the opposite conclusion. We post-process data from a\nstate-of-the-art equal-mass binary neutron star merger simulation to estimate\nthe effects of bulk viscosity (which was not included in the simulation\nitself). In that scenario, we find that bulk viscosity can reach high values in\nregions of the merger.

Determiningrepository similarity is an essential\nbuilding block in studying the dynamics and the evolution of such software\necosystems. The key challenge is to determine the right representation for the\ndiverse repository features in a way that: (a) it captures all aspects of the\navailable information, and (b) it is readily usable by MLalgorithms. We propose\nRepo2Vec, a comprehensive embedding approach to represent a repository as a\ndistributed vector by combining features from three types of information\nsources. As our key novelty, we consider three types of information:\n(a)metadata, (b) the structure of the repository, and (c) the source code. We\nalso introduce a series of embedding approaches to represent and combine these\ninformation types into a single embedding. We evaluate our method with two real\ndatasets from GitHub for a combined 1013 repositories. First, we show that our\nmethod outperforms previous methods in terms of precision (93%vs 78%), with\nnearly twice as many Strongly Similar repositories and 30% fewer False\nPositives. Second, we show how Repo2Vecprovides a solid basis for: (a)\ndistinguishing between malware and benign repositories, and (b) identifying a\nmeaningful hierarchical clustering. For example, we achieve 98% precision and\n96%recall in distinguishing malware and benign repositories. Overall, our work\nis a fundamental building block for enabling many repository analysis functions\nsuch as repository categorization by target platform or intention, detecting\ncode-reuse and clones, and identifying lineage and evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 18:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

The Generalized Haar-Walsh\nTransform (GHWT) developed by Irion and Saito (2014) is a multiscale transform\nfor signals on graphs, which is a generalization of the classical Haar and\nWalsh-Hadamard Transforms. We propose the extended Generalized Haar-Walsh\nTransform (eGHWT), which is a generalization of the adapted time-frequency\ntilings of Thiele and Villemoes (1996).

While the GHWT\nbest-basis algorithm seeks the most suitable orthonormal basis for a given task\namong more than $(1.5)^N$ possible orthonormal bases in $\\mathbb{R}^N$, the\neGHWT best-basis algorithm can find a better one by searching through more than\n$0.618\\cdot(1.84)^N$ possible orthonormal bases in $\\mathbb{R}^N$.

In this study, we address action prediction by\ninvestigating how action patterns evolve over time in a spatial feature space.\nThere are three key components to our system. First, we work with\nintermediate-layer ConvNet features, which allow for abstraction from raw data,\nwhile retaining spatial layout. Second, instead of propagating features per se,\nwe propagate their residuals across time, which allows for a compact\nrepresentation that reduces redundancy. Third, we employ a Kalman filter to\ncombat error build-up and unify across prediction start times. Extensive\nexperimental results on multiple benchmarks show that our approach leads to\ncompetitive performance in action prediction. Notably, we investigate the\nlearned components of our system to shed light on their otherwise opaque\nnatures in two ways. First, we document that our learned feature propagation\nmodule works as a spatial shifting mechanism under convolution to propagate\ncurrent observations into the future. Thus, it captures flow-based image motion\ninformation.

In this paper, we study the existence of optimal dynamic\npricing schemes in combinatorial markets. In particular, we concentrate on\nmulti-demand valuations, a natural extension of unit-demand valuations. The\nproposed approach is based on computing an optimal dual solution of the maximum\nsocial welfare problem with distinguished structural properties.\n  Our contribution is twofold. By relying on an optimal dual solution, we show\nthe existence of optimal dynamic prices in unit-demand markets and in\nmulti-demand markets up to three buyers, thus giving new interpretations of\nresults of Cohen-Addad et al. and Berger et al., respectively. Furthermore, we\nprovide an optimal dynamic pricing scheme for bi-demand valuations with an\narbitrary number of buyers.

However, these studies are limited to generic text and thus lack\ntechnical and scientific nuances such as domain specific vocabulary,\nabbreviations, or scientific formulas which are commonly used in academic\ncontext. This research focuses on the performance of word embeddings applied to\na large scale academic corpus. More specifically, we compare quality and\nefficiency of trained word embeddings to TFIDF representations in modeling\ncontent of scientific articles. We use a word2vec skip-gram model trained on\ntitles and abstracts of about 70 million scientific articles. Furthermore, we\nhave developed a benchmark to evaluate content models in a scientific context.\nThe benchmark is based on a categorization task that matches articles to\njournals for about 1.3 million articles published in 2017. Our results show\nthat content models based on word embeddings are better for titles (short text)\nwhile TFIDF works better for abstracts (longer text). However, the slight\nimprovement of TFIDF for larger text comes at the expense of 3.7 times more\nmemory requirement as well as up to 184 times higher computation times which\nmay make it inefficient for online applications. In addition, we have created a\n2-dimensional visualization of the journals modeled via embeddings to\nqualitatively inspect embedding model.

The information in the lastly predicted dialogue states is\ndirect, but when there is a prediction error, the dialogue information from\nthis source will be incomplete or erroneous. In this paper, we propose the\nDialogue State Tracking with Multi-Level Fusion of Predicted Dialogue States\nand Conversations network (FPDSC). This model extracts information of each\ndialogue turn by modeling interactions among each turn utterance, the\ncorresponding last dialogue states, and dialogue slots. Then the representation\nof each dialogue turn is aggregated by a hierarchical structure to form the\npassage information, which is utilized in the current turn of DST.

A conditionally expected integral cost function has been considered\nunder an agent's opinion filtration. The dynamic cost functional is minimized\nsubject to a stochastic differential opinion dynamics. As opinion dynamics\nrepresents an agent's differences of opinion from the others as well as from\ntheir previous opinions, random influences and stubbornness make it more\nvolatile. An agent uses their rate of change of opinion at certain time point\nas a control input. This turns out to be a non-cooperative stochastic\ndifferential game which have a feedback Nash equilibrium. A Feynman-type path\nintegral approach has been used to determine an optimal feedback opinion and\ncontrol. This is a new approach in this literature.

To avoid the above problems, in this\nstudy, inspired by multi-task learning, a novel model called category-aware\nvariational recurrent neural network (CatVRNN) is proposed. In this model,\ngeneration and classification tasks are trained simultaneously to generate\ntexts of different categories. The use of multi-task learning can improve the\nquality of the generated texts, when the classification task is appropriate. In\naddition, a function is proposed to initialize the hidden state of the CatVRNN\nto force the model to generate texts of a specific category. Experimental\nresults on three datasets demonstrate that the model can outperform\nstate-of-the-art text generation methods based on GAN in terms of diversity of\ngenerated texts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 06:42:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 07:48:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 07:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

This, combined with\nthe confession of some governmental institutions that they actually collaborate\nwith these Internet giants to collect or deduce information about people,\ncreates a worrisome situation of several co-existing Panopticons that can act\nseparately or in close collaboration. Thus, they can only be detected and\nidentified through the expense of (perhaps considerable) effort. In this paper\nwe provide a theoretical framework for studying the detectability status of\nPanopticons that fall under two theoretical, but not unrealistic, definitions.\nWe show, using Oracle Turing Machines, that detecting modern day, ICT-based,\nPanopticons is an undecidable problem.

For a broad class of\nreneging distributions with finite mean and service distributions with finite\nmean and hazard rate function that is either decreasing or bounded away from\nzero and infinity, it is shown that if the fluid equations have a unique\ninvariant state, then the Dirac measure at this state is the unique random\nfixed point of the fluid equations, which implies that the stationary\ndistributions of scaled $N$-server systems converge to the unique invariant\nstate of the corresponding fluid equations.

Training was conducted using\nseveral datasets acquired from patients with head and neck cancer. The size of\nthe datasets ranged from 16 slices (two patients) to 2745 slices (137 patients)\nfor MVCT and 2824 slices (98 patients) for kVCT. The required size of the\ntraining data was found to be as small as a few hundred slices. By statistical\nand visual evaluations, the quality improvement and structure preservation of\nthe MVCT images converted by the proposed model were investigated. As a\nclinical benefit, it was observed by medical doctors that the converted images\nenhanced the precision of contouring. We developed an MVCT to kVCT conversion\nmodel based on deep learning, which can be trained using only a few hundred\nunpaired images.

Recently, it\nhas been predicted that the particle creation may drastically change from the\nHawking radiation to a strong double burst if the gravitational collapse\nsuddenly stops just before the formation of the event horizon. By contrast with\nthe Hawking radiation, the burst may be so strong that it can be of\nobservational interest even for collapsing objects with astrophysical mass\nscales. However, the burst phenomenon has been predicted through the studies of\nidealized models in which a spherical hollow shell begins to collapse, but\nstops shrinking and eventually settles down to a static \"star\". Therefore, one\nmight guess that it could be particular to the hollow shell model. In this\npaper, we study the particle creation due to the gravitational collapse of a\nspherical object whose interior is filled with matter. In this model, we obtain\nsimilar results to those in the case of the hollow shell model.

In addition, disc dust sizes are\nconsistent with tidal truncation only if they orbit very eccentric binaries. In\na previous study we showed that the presence of a stellar companion hastens the\nradial migration of solids, shortening disc lifetime and challenging planet\nformation.

In recent years,\nconvolutional encoder-decoder solutions have achieved substantial progress in\nthe field of automatic medical image segmentation. Due to the inherent bias in\nthe convolution operations, prior models mainly focus on local visual cues\nformed by the neighboring pixels, but fail to fully model the long-range\ncontextual dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based\nAttention Guided Network called TransAttUnet, in which the multi-level guided\nattention and multi-scale skip connection are designed to jointly enhance the\nperformance of the semantical segmentation architecture. Inspired by\nTransformer, the self-aware attention (SAA) module with Transformer Self\nAttention (TSA) and Global Spatial Attention (GSA) is incorporated into\nTransAttUnet to effectively learn the non-local interactions among encoder\nfeatures. Moreover, we also use additional multi-scale skip connections between\ndecoder blocks to aggregate the upsampled features with different semantic\nscales. In this way, the representation ability of multi-scale context\ninformation is strengthened to generate discriminative features. Benefitting\nfrom these complementary components, the proposed TransAttUnet can effectively\nalleviate the loss of fine details caused by the stacking of convolution layers\nand the consecutive sampling operations, finally improving the segmentation\nquality of medical images. Extensive experiments on multiple medical image\nsegmentation datasets from different imaging modalities demonstrate that the\nproposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

A scenario-based assessment approach is accepted\nby many players in the field as part of the complete safety assessment. A\nscenario is a representation of a situation on the road to which the AV needs\nto respond appropriately. One way to generate the required scenario-based test\ndescriptions is to parameterize the scenarios and to draw these parameters from\na probability density function (pdf). Because the shape of the pdf is unknown\nbeforehand, assuming a functional form of the pdf and fitting the parameters to\nthe data may lead to inaccurate fits. As an alternative, Kernel Density\nEstimation (KDE) is a promising candidate for estimating the underlying pdf,\nbecause it is flexible with the underlying distribution of the parameters.\nDrawing random samples from a pdf estimated with KDE is possible without the\nneed of evaluating the actual pdf, which makes it suitable for drawing random\nsamples for, e.g., Monte Carlo methods. Sampling from a KDE while the samples\nsatisfy a linear equality constraint, however, has not been described in the\nliterature, as far as the authors know.\n  In this paper, we propose a method to sample from a pdf estimated using KDE,\nsuch that the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint.

The method can be used to generating\nscenarios that have, e.g., a predetermined starting speed or to generate\ndifferent types of scenarios. This paper also shows that the method for\nsampling scenarios can be used in case a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is\nused to reduce the dimension of the parameter vectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 09:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Thus,\nusing the complementary but noisy color and depth channels, CurveFusion first\nautomatically identifies point samples on potential thin structures and groups\nthem into bundles, each being a group of a fixed number of aligned consecutive\nframes. Then, the algorithm extracts per-bundle skeleton curves using L1 axes,\nand aligns and iteratively merges the L1 segments from all the bundles to form\nthe final complete curve skeleton. Thus, unlike previous methods,\nreconstruction happens via integration along a data-dependent fusion primitive,\ni.e., the extracted curve skeleton.

The application of these ratios to the total H$_{\\rm 2}$ mass of\nour Galaxy yields a correction factor of at least 1.4, meaning that the H$_{\\rm\n2}$ mass of our Galaxy should be at least 40% more massive than previously\ndetermined. Including the completeness correction, an even more significant\nfraction of the matter should be contributed by baryonic matter.

Thus, there is a tradeoff between obtaining\nlarge reward and incurring sampling cost as a function of the sampling\nfrequency. The goal is to design a learning algorithm that minimizes regret,\nthat is defined as the difference of the payoff of the oracle policy and that\nof the learning algorithm. CTMAB is fundamentally different than the usual\nmulti-arm bandit problem (MAB), e.g., even the single-arm case is non-trivial\nin CTMAB, since the optimal sampling frequency depends on the mean of the arm,\nwhich needs to be estimated.

Without any historical interaction on cold-start items, CF\nscheme fails to use collaborative signals to infer user preference on these\nitems. To solve this problem, extensive studies have been conducted to\nincorporate side information into the CF scheme. Specifically, they employ\nmodern neural network techniques (e.g., dropout, consistency constraint) to\ndiscover and exploit the coalition effect of content features and collaborative\nrepresentations. However, we argue that these works less explore the mutual\ndependencies between content features and collaborative representations and\nlack sufficient theoretical supports, thus resulting in unsatisfactory\nperformance. In this work, we reformulate the cold-start item representation\nlearning from an information-theoretic standpoint. It aims to maximize the\nmutual dependencies between item content and collaborative signals.\nSpecifically, the representation learning is theoretically lower-bounded by the\nintegration of two terms: mutual information between collaborative embeddings\nof users and items, and mutual information between collaborative embeddings and\nfeature representations of items. To model such a learning process, we devise a\nnew objective function founded upon contrastive learning and develop a simple\nyet effective Contrastive Learning-based Cold-start Recommendation\nframework(CLCRec).

We enhance this approach in two\ndimensions. Firstly, we take into account the probability of a payment actually\nbeing possible due to the unknown balance distributions in the channels.\nSecondly, we use minimum cost flows as a proper generalization of shortest\npaths to multi-part payments (MPP). In particular we show that under plausible\nassumptions about the balance distributions we can find the most likely MPP for\nany given set of senders, recipients and amounts by solving for a (generalized)\ninteger minimum cost flow with a separable and convex cost function. Polynomial\ntime exact algorithms as well as approximations are known for this optimization\nproblem. We present a round-based algorithm of min-cost flow computations for\ndelivering large payment amounts over the Lightning Network. This algorithm\nworks by updating the probability distributions with the information gained\nfrom both successful and unsuccessful paths on prior rounds. In all our\nexperiments a single digit number of rounds sufficed to deliver payments of\nsizes that were close to the total local balance of the sender. Early\nexperiments indicate that our approach increases the size of payments that can\nbe reliably delivered by several orders of magnitude compared to the current\nstate of the art.

The\ntotal size of the population is constant and equal to some K $\\in$ N * , and\nthe number of infectives vanishes almost surely in finite time. We prove that,\nas K $\\rightarrow$ $\\infty$, the process composed of the proportions of\ninfectives of each type X^K and the state of the environment $\\Xi$^K ,\nconverges to a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) given by a system\nof randomly switched ODEs.

In Landau gauge QCD this\nmass gap, and hence confinement, is encoded in a mass gap of the gluon\npropagator, which is found both in lattice simulations and with functional\napproaches. While functional methods are well suited to unravel the mechanism\nbehind the generation of the mass gap, a fully satisfactory answer has not yet\nbeen found. In this work we solve the coupled Dyson-Schwinger equations for the\nghost propagator, gluon propagator and three-gluon vertex. We corroborate the\nfindings of earlier works, namely that the mass gap generation is tied to the\nlongitudinal projection of the gluon self-energy, which acts as an effective\nmass term in the equations. Because an explicit mass term is in conflict with\ngauge invariance, this leaves two possible scenarios: If it is viewed as an\nartifact, only the scaling solution survives; if it is dynamical, gauge\ninvariance can only be preserved if there are longitudinal massless poles in\neither of the vertices. We find that there is indeed a massless pole in the\nghost-gluon vertex, however in our approximation with the assumption of\ncomplete infrared dominance of the ghost this pole is only present for the\nscaling solution. We also put forward a possible mechanism that may reconcile\nthe scaling solution, with an infrared dominance of the ghost, with the\ndecoupling solutions based on longitudinal poles in the three-gluon vertex as\nseen in the PT-BFM scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 12:19:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 12:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

A major issue with EW images is that the cross-polarized HV and VH\nchannels have prominent additive noise patterns relative to low backscatter\nintensity, which disrupts tasks that require manual or automated\ninterpretation. The European Space Agency (ESA) provides a method for removing\nthe additive noise pattern by means of lookup tables, but applying them\ndirectly produces unsatisfactory results because characteristics of the noise\nstill remain. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the magnitude of the additive\nnoise dynamically depends on factors that are not considered by the ESA\nestimated noise field.\n  To address these issues we propose a quadratic objective function to model\nthe mis-scale of the provided noise field on an image. We consider a linear\ndenoising model that re-scales the noise field for each subswath, whose\nparameters are found from a least-squares solution over the objective function.\nThis method greatly reduces the presence of additive noise while not requiring\na set of training images, is robust to heterogeneity in images, dynamically\nestimates parameters for each image, and finds parameters using a closed-form\nsolution.\n  Two experiments were performed to validate the proposed method. The first\nexperiment simulated noise removal on a set of RADARSAT-2 images with noise\nfields artificially imposed on them. The second experiment conducted noise\nremoval on a set of Sentinel-1 images taken over the five oceans. Afterwards,\nquality of the noise removal was evaluated based on the appearance of\nopen-water. The two experiments indicate that the proposed method marks an\nimprovement both visually and through numerical measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

This provides a formal\nexplanation for why individuals exhibit inconsistent behavioural preferences\nwhen confronted with similar choices. For example, greedy preferences are a\nconsequence of confident (or precise) beliefs over certain outcomes. Here, we\noffer an alternative account of behavioural variability using R\\'enyi\ndivergences and their associated variational bounds. R\\'enyi bounds are\nanalogous to the variational free energy (or evidence lower bound) and can be\nderived under the same assumptions. Importantly, these bounds provide a formal\nway to establish behavioural differences through an $\\alpha$ parameter, given\nfixed priors. This rests on changes in $\\alpha$ that alter the bound (on a\ncontinuous scale), inducing different posterior estimates and consequent\nvariations in behaviour. Thus, it looks as if individuals have different\npriors, and have reached different conclusions. More specifically, $\\alpha \\to\n0^{+}$ optimisation leads to mass-covering variational estimates and increased\nvariability in choice behaviour. Furthermore, $\\alpha \\to + \\infty$\noptimisation leads to mass-seeking variational posteriors and greedy\npreferences. We exemplify this formulation through simulations of the\nmulti-armed bandit task. We note that these $\\alpha$ parameterisations may be\nespecially relevant, i.e., shape preferences, when the true posterior is not in\nthe same family of distributions as the assumed (simpler) approximate density,\nwhich may be the case in many real-world scenarios. The ensuing departure from\nvanilla variational inference provides a potentially useful explanation for\ndifferences in behavioural preferences of biological (or artificial) agents\nunder the assumption that the brain performs variational Bayesian inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

An\nintermediate step would be to construct quantum computers of limited accuracy\nenhanced by lower-level, and hence lower-cost, noise-removal techniques. This\nis the motivation for our work, which looks into fault-tolerant encoded quantum\ncomputation targeted at the dominant noise afflicting the quantum device.\nSpecifically, we develop a protocol for fault-tolerant encoded quantum\ncomputing components in the presence of amplitude-damping noise, using a\n4-qubit code and a recovery procedure tailored to such noise.

Our goal in\nthis paper is to fill in this gap and obtain strong inapproximability results\nby studying the prototypical problem in this class of CSPs, hypergraph\ncolourings.\n  More precisely, we focus on the problem of approximately counting\n$q$-colourings on $K$-uniform hypergraphs with bounded degree $\\Delta$.

It\ngenerally involves a set of measurements, to which one attempts to fit a\nnumerical model of the measurement process. The model evaluation typically\ninvolves to solve Maxwell's equations and is thus time consuming. This makes\nthe reconstruction computationally demanding. Several methods exist for fitting\nthe model to the measurements. On the one hand, Bayesian optimization methods\nfor expensive black-box optimization enable an efficient reconstruction by\ntraining a machine learning model of the squared sum of deviations. On the\nother hand, curve fitting algorithms, such as the Levenberg-Marquardt method,\ntake the deviations between all model outputs and corresponding measurement\nvalues into account which enables a fast local convergence. In this paper we\npresent a Bayesian Target Vector Optimization scheme which combines these two\napproaches. We compare the performance of the presented method against a\nstandard Levenberg-Marquardt-like algorithm, a conventional Bayesian\noptimization scheme, and the L-BFGS-B and Nelder-Mead simplex algorithms. As a\nstand-in for problems from nano metrology, we employ a non-linear least-square\nproblem from the NIST Standard Reference Database. We find that the presented\nmethod generally uses fewer calls of the model function than any of the\ncompeting schemes to achieve similar reconstruction performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 15:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

We consider here the\nparticular instance of a planar air shock impinging on a spherical\nwater-droplet and discuss to what extent this interaction can lead to the\ninception of cavitation inside the droplet. The effort centers on the early\nphases of the interaction process during which the geometry and amplitude of\nthe propagating wavefront is modified by refraction and the subsequent internal\nreflections at the droplet interface. The problem is analysed using both simple\nray theory and a 2-D multiphase, compressible hydrodynamic code (ECOGEN).\nWithin the context of ray theory, the occurrence of focusing is examined in\ndetails and parametric equations are derived for the transmitted wavefront and\nits multiple internal reflections. It is found that wave patterns predicted by\nray calculations compare extremely well with the more accurate numerical\nsolutions from simulations. In particular, it is shown that the internal\nwavefront assumes a complex time-dependent shape whose dominant feature is the\nexistence of cusp singularities. These singular points are shown to trace out\nsurfaces that are the caustics of the associated system of rays. From the\nsingularities of the energy flux density of the refracted wave, the parametric\nequations of the caustic surface associated to the $k$-th reflected wavefront\nare deduced. As a consequence of the focusing process, the simulations show the\nformation of negative-pressure regions in the internal flow field. These\nlow-pressure zones are identified as possible spots where cavitation may occur,\ndepending on the magnitude of the pressure reached. Finally, the numerical\nresults provide quantitative information on the dependence of negative pressure\npeak upon incident-shock-wave strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 15:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

However, there are currently two major limitations faced by PGAS\napplications. The first relates to scalability: despite the availability of\nAPIs that support non-blocking operations in special cases, many PGAS\noperations on remote locations are synchronous by default, which can lead to\nlong-latency stalls and poor scalability. The second relates to productivity:\nwhile it is simpler for the developer to express all communications at a\nfine-grained granularity that is natural to the application, experiments have\nshown that such a natural expression results in performance that is 20x slower\nthan more efficient but less productive code that requires manual message\naggregation and termination detection.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new programming system for PGAS applications,\nin which point-to-point remote operations can be expressed as fine-grained\nasynchronous actor messages.

It is formed from its\nprecursor tropoelastin, a 60-72 kDa water-soluble and temperature-responsive\nprotein that coacervates at physiological temperature, undergoing a phenomenon\ntermed lower critical solution temperature (LCST). Inspired by this behaviour,\nmany scientists and engineers are developing recombinantly produced\nelastin-inspired biopolymers, usually termed elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs).\nThese ELPs are generally comprised of repetitive motifs with the sequence\nVPGXG, which corresponds to repeats of a small part of the tropoelastin\nsequence, X being any amino acid except proline. ELPs display LCST and\nmechanical properties similar to tropoelastin, which renders them promising\ncandidates for the development of elastic and stimuli-responsive protein-based\nmaterials. Unveiling the structure-property relationships of ELPs can aid in\nthe development of these materials by establishing the connections between the\nELP amino acid sequence and the macroscopic properties of the materials.

A key challenge is how to ensure the learned\npolicy is safe, which requires quantifying the risk associated with different\nactions. In the online setting, distributional RL algorithms do so by learning\nthe distribution over returns (i.e., cumulative rewards) instead of the\nexpected return; beyond quantifying risk, they have also been shown to learn\nbetter representations for planning. We propose Conservative Offline\nDistributional Actor Critic (CODAC), an offline RL algorithm suitable for both\nrisk-neutral and risk-averse domains. CODAC adapts distributional RL to the\noffline setting by penalizing the predicted quantiles of the return for\nout-of-distribution actions. We prove that CODAC learns a conservative return\ndistribution -- in particular, for finite MDPs, CODAC converges to an uniform\nlower bound on the quantiles of the return distribution; our proof relies on a\nnovel analysis of the distributional Bellman operator. In our experiments, on\ntwo challenging robot navigation tasks, CODAC successfully learns risk-averse\npolicies using offline data collected purely from risk-neutral agents.\nFurthermore, CODAC is state-of-the-art on the D4RL MuJoCo benchmark in terms of\nboth expected and risk-sensitive performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 15:38:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 18:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

We consider an environment with biological tissues and apply the\nstrategy to a two-dimensional digital human phantom from the abdomen. A\nstronger disruption is introduced where the forward waves suffer a history of\nhigher attenuation, with a weaker disruption elsewhere. Computer simulations\nshow heterogeneous ITM is a promising technique to improve time reversal\nrefocusing in heterogeneous, lossy, and dispersive spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:50:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 20:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

The current scenario of assigning codes is a manual process which is\nvery expensive, time-consuming and error prone. In recent years, many\nresearchers have studied the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), related\nMachine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods and techniques to resolve\nthe problem of manual coding of clinical narratives and to assist human coders\nto assign clinical codes more accurately and efficiently. This systematic\nliterature review provides a comprehensive overview of automated clinical\ncoding systems that utilises appropriate NLP, ML and DL methods and techniques\nto assign ICD codes to discharge summaries. We have followed the Preferred\nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) guidelines and\nconducted a comprehensive search of publications from January, 2010 to December\n2020 in four academic databases- PubMed, ScienceDirect, Association for\nComputing Machinery(ACM) Digital Library, and the Association for Computational\nLinguistics(ACL) Anthology. We reviewed 7,556 publications; 38 met the\ninclusion criteria. This review identified: datasets having discharge\nsummaries; NLP techniques along with some other data extraction processes,\ndifferent feature extraction and embedding techniques. To measure the\nperformance of classification methods, different evaluation metrics are used.\nLastly, future research directions are provided to scholars who are interested\nin automated ICD code assignment. Efforts are still required to improve ICD\ncode prediction accuracy, availability of large-scale de-identified clinical\ncorpora with the latest version of the classification system. This can be a\nplatform to guide and share knowledge with the less experienced coders and\nresearchers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 03:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

Lumen was\ntrained with a newly developed dataset of 3K texts comprised of disinformation,\nphishing, hyperpartisan news, and mainstream news. Evaluation of Lumen in\ncomparison to other learning models showed that Lumen and LSTM presented the\nbest F1-micro score, but Lumen yielded better interpretability. Our results\nhighlight the promise of ML to expose influence cues in text, towards the goal\nof application in automatic labeling tools to improve the accuracy of\nhuman-based detection and reduce the likelihood of users falling for deceptive\nonline content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 15:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

In this study, we\nbuilt up an optical random scattering system based on an LCD and an RGB laser\nsource. We found that the image classification can be improved by the help of\nrandom scattering which is considered as a feedforward neural network to\nextracts features from image. Along with the ridge classification deployed on\ncomputer, we achieved excellent classification accuracy higher than 94%, for a\nvariety of data sets covering medical, agricultural, environmental protection\nand other fields. In addition, the proposed optical scattering system has the\nadvantages of high speed, low power consumption, and miniaturization, which is\nsuitable for deploying in edge computing applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 04:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

Numerical analysis shows that the local electric\nfield in the metamolecule can be enhanced by decreasing the electrode size and\nthe gap of the capacitor structure of the cut-wire resonators while keeping the\nequivalent electrical circuit parameters of the metamolecule constant. We\nmeasure and compare the threshold incident power for a gas discharge in the\nmetamolecule fabricated in our previous study and that in the metamolecule with\nshrunken capacitor structures. The experiment reveals that shrinking the\ncapacitor structure while keeping the resonance frequency of the metamolecule\ndecreases the threshold incident power for a gas discharge and may increase the\ngas pressure where the threshold incident power is minimum.

The 3-OOD mechanism\nhelps in achieving the novel result of eliminating slip and drag in the robot\ntracks during motion. The proposed differential realizes the functional\nabilities of the traditional two-output differential, which is achieved the\nfirst time for a differential with three outputs. The 3-OOD mechanism\nmechanically modulates the track speeds of the robot based on the forces\nexerted on each track inside the pipe network, by eliminating the need for any\nactive control.

Such networks, however, are characterized by a highly dynamic and\nmobile environment with no guarantee of a central network infrastructure which\ncan cause both connectivity and security issues. While wireless mesh networks\nare envisioned as a solution for such scenarios, these networks come with their\nown challenges and security vulnerabilities.

Specifically, we highlight the main challenges of\napplying current mesh technologies within the domain of UAV swarms and expose\nexisting vulnerabilities across the communication stack.
