Such accelerators are thus well suited for resource-constrained\nembedded systems. However, mapping sophisticated neural network models on these\naccelerators still entails significant energy and memory consumption, along\nwith high inference time overhead. Binarized neural networks (BNNs), which\nutilize single-bit weights, represent an efficient way to implement and deploy\nneural network models on accelerators. In this paper, we present a novel\noptical-domain BNN accelerator, named ROBIN, which intelligently integrates\nheterogeneous microring resonator optical devices with complementary\ncapabilities to efficiently implement the key functionalities in BNNs. We\nperform detailed fabrication-process variation analyses at the optical device\nlevel, explore efficient corrective tuning for these devices, and integrate\ncircuit-level optimization to counter thermal variations. As a result, our\nproposed ROBIN architecture possesses the desirable traits of being robust,\nenergy-efficient, low latency, and high throughput, when executing BNN models.\nOur analysis shows that ROBIN can outperform the best-known optical BNN\naccelerators and also many electronic accelerators. Specifically, our\nenergy-efficient ROBIN design exhibits energy-per-bit values that are ~4x lower\nthan electronic BNN accelerators and ~933x lower than a recently proposed\nphotonic BNN accelerator, while a performance-efficient ROBIN design shows ~3x\nand ~25x better performance than electronic and photonic BNN accelerators,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 16:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Based on\nnumerical simulations using the bar-hinge approach and experiments, this study\nexamines the multi-stability of a stacked Miura-origami cellular structure with\ndifferent levels of facet compliance. The simulation and experiment results\nshow that a unit cell in such cellular solid exhibits only two stable states if\nit follows the rigid origami kinematics; however, two more stable states are\nreachable if the origami facets become sufficiently compliant. Moreover, the\nswitch between two certain stable states shows an asymmetric energy barrier,\nmeaning that the unit cell follows fundamentally different deformation paths\nwhen it extends from one state to another compared to the opposite compression\nswitch. As a result, the reaction force required for extending this unit cell\nbetween these two states can be higher than the compression switch. Such\nasymmetric multi-stability can be fine-tuned by tailoring the underlying\norigami design, and it can be extended into cellular solids with carefully\nplaced voids.

In this paper, we point out two potential reasons for this\nproblem: 1) the random episodic labels can only provide limited supervision\ninformation, while the relatedness information between the query and support\nsamples is not fully exploited; 2) the meta-learner is usually constrained by\nthe limited contextual information of the local episode. To overcome these\nproblems, we propose a new Global Relatedness Decoupled-Distillation (GRDD)\nmethod using the global category knowledge and the Relatedness\nDecoupled-Distillation (RDD) strategy. Our GRDD learns new visual concepts\nquickly by imitating the habit of humans, i.e. learning from the deep knowledge\ndistilled from the teacher. More specifically, we first train a global learner\non the entire base subset using category labels as supervision to leverage the\nglobal context information of the categories. Then, the well-trained global\nlearner is used to simulate the query-support relatedness in global\ndependencies. Finally, the distilled global query-support relatedness is\nexplicitly used to train the meta-learner using the RDD strategy, with the goal\nof making the meta-learner more discriminative. The RDD strategy aims to\ndecouple the dense query-support relatedness into the groups of sparse\ndecoupled relatedness. Moreover, only the relatedness of a single support\nsample with other query samples is considered in each group. By distilling the\nsparse decoupled relatedness group by group, sharper relatedness can be\neffectively distilled to the meta-learner, thereby facilitating the learning of\na discriminative meta-learner. We conduct extensive experiments on the\nminiImagenet and CIFAR-FS datasets, which show the state-of-the-art performance\nof our GRDD method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 17:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 05:34:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 03:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

The study of\nsuch systems, both as individual systems and as a population, leads to a better\nunderstanding of planetary formation and evolution. Kepler-80, a K-dwarf\nhosting six super-Earths, was the first system known to have four planets in a\nchain of resonances, a repeated geometric configuration. Transiting planets in\nresonant chains can enable us to estimate not only the planets' orbits and\nsizes but also their masses. Since the original resonance analysis and TTV\nfitting of Kepler-80, a new planet has been discovered whose signal likely\naltered the measured masses of the other planets. Here, we determine masses and\norbits for all six planets hosted by Kepler-80 by direct forward photodynamical\nmodeling of the lightcurve of this system. We then explore the resonant\nbehaviour of the system. We find that the four middle planets are in a resonant\nchain, but that the outermost planet only dynamically interacts in $\\sim14$\\%\nof our solutions. We also find that the system and its dynamic behaviour are\nconsistent with \\emph{in situ} formation and compare our results to two other\nresonant chain systems, Kepler-60 and TRAPPIST-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 17:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

The readout scheme in gravitational-wave detectors specifies the directly\nmeasured quantum operator in the detection. This specification is necessary\nwhen we apply the recently developed quantum measurement theory to\ngravitational-wave detections. We examine the two models of measurement. One is\nthe model in which the directly measured quantum operator at the photodetector\nis Glauber's photon number operator, and the other is the model in which the\npower operator of the optical field is directly measured. These two are\nregarded as ideal models of photodetectors. We first show these two models\nyield the same expectation value of the measurement. Since it is consensus in\nthe gravitational-wave community that vacuum fluctuations contribute to the\nnoises in the detectors, we also clarify the contributions of vacuum\nfluctuations to the quantum noise spectral density without using the two-photon\nformulation which is used in the gravitational-wave community. We found that\nthe conventional noise spectral density in the two-photon formulation includes\nvacuum fluctuations from the main interferometer but does not include those\nfrom the local oscillator.

The\nfamily of nonlinear dynamical system-based methods have successfully\ndemonstrated dynamic robot behaviors but have difficulty in generalizing to\nunseen configurations as well as learning from image inputs. Recent works\napproach this issue by using deep network policies and reparameterize actions\nto embed the structure of dynamical systems but still struggle in domains with\ndiverse configurations of image goals, and hence, find it difficult to\ngeneralize. In this paper, we address this dichotomy by leveraging embedding\nthe structure of dynamical systems in a hierarchical deep policy learning\nframework, called Hierarchical Neural Dynamical Policies (H-NDPs). Instead of\nfitting deep dynamical systems to diverse data directly, H-NDPs form a\ncurriculum by learning local dynamical system-based policies on small regions\nin state-space and then distill them into a global dynamical system-based\npolicy that operates only from high-dimensional images. H-NDPs additionally\nprovide smooth trajectories, a strong safety benefit in the real world. We\nperform extensive experiments on dynamic tasks both in the real world (digit\nwriting, scooping, and pouring) and simulation (catching, throwing, picking).\nWe show that H-NDPs are easily integrated with both imitation as well as\nreinforcement learning setups and achieve state-of-the-art results.

The DDCNet\ndesign was intentionally simple and compact allowing it to be used as a\nbuilding block for designing more complex yet compact networks. In this work,\nwe extend the DDCNet strategies to handle heterogeneous motion dynamics by\ncascading DDCNet based sub-nets with decreasing extents of their ERF. Our\nDDCNet with multiresolution capability (DDCNet-Multires) is compact without any\nspecialized network layers. We evaluate the performance of the DDCNet-Multires\nnetwork using standard optical flow benchmark datasets. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that DDCNet-Multires improves over the DDCNet-B0 and -B1 and\nprovides optical flow estimates with accuracy comparable to similar lightweight\nlearning-based methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 17:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

However, we still expect to\nobserve the basic characteristics of bulk states and current carrying edge\nstates. Here, we show that for quasicrystals in magnetic fields, there is also\na third option; the bulk localised transport states. These states share the\nin-gap nature of the well-known edge states and can support transport along\nthem, but they are fully contained within the bulk of the system, with no\nsupport along the edge. We consider both finite and infinite systems, using\nrigorous error controlled computational techniques that are not prone to\nfinite-size effects. The bulk localised transport states are preserved for\ninfinite systems, in stark contrast to the normal edge states. This allows for\ntransport to be observed in infinite systems, without any perturbations,\ndefects, or boundaries being introduced. We confirm the in-gap topological\nnature of the bulk localised transport states for finite and infinite systems\nby computing common topological measures; namely the Bott index and local Chern\nmarker. The bulk localised transport states form due to a magnetic aperiodicity\narising from the interplay of length scales between the magnetic field and\nquasiperiodic lattice. Bulk localised transport could have interesting\napplications similar to those of the edge states on the boundary, but that\ncould now take advantage of the larger bulk of the lattice.

In this article we discuss a class of genus one\nfibered Calabi-Yau threefolds with 5-sections from various perspectives. In\nalgebraic geometry, such Calabi-Yaus can be constructed as complete\nintersections in Grassmannian fibrations and as Pfaffian varieties. These\nconstructions naturally fit into the framework of homological projective\nduality and lead to dual pairs of Calabi-Yaus. From a physics perspective,\nthese spaces can be realised as low-energy configurations (\"phases\") of gauged\nlinear sigma models (GLSMs) with non-Abelian gauge groups, where the dual\ngeometries arise as phases of the same GLSM. Using the modular bootstrap\napproach of topological string theory, one can compute all-genus Gopakumar-Vafa\ninvariants of these Calabi-Yaus. We observe that homological projective duality\nacts as an element of $\\Gamma_0(5)$ on the topological string partition\nfunction and the partition functions of dual geometries transform into each\nother. Moreover, we study the geometries from an M-/F-theory perspective. We\ncompute the F-theory spectrum and show how the genus one-fibered Calabi-Yaus\nare connected to certain Calabi-Yaus in toric varieties via a series of Higgs\ntransitions. Based on the F-theory physics, we conjecture that dual geometries\nare elements of the same Tate-Shafarevich group. Our analysis also leads to a\nclassification of 5-section geometries, as well as the construction of F-theory\nmodels with charge 5 hypermultiplets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

However, the stellar theory that first predicted\nmagnetospheric clouds also anticipated an associated mass-loss mechanism known\nas centrifugal breakout for which there has been limited empirical evidence. In\nthis paper, we present data from TESS, LCO, ASAS-SN, and Veloce on the 45 Myr\nM3.5 star TIC 234284556, and propose that it is a candidate for the direct\ndetection of centrifugal breakout.

After demonstrating that our spectral and\nphotometric data support a magnetospheric clouds and centrifugal breakout model\nand disfavor alternate scenarios, we discuss the possibility of a coronal mass\nejection (CME) or stellar wind origin of the corotating material and we\nintroduce a reionization mechanism as a potential explanation for more gradual\nvariations in eclipse parameters.

Very Long\nBaseline Interferometry (VLBI), triggered by FRB detections from CHIME/FRB will\nsolve the challenge of localization for non-repeating events. Using a\nrefurbished 10-m radio dish at the Algonquin Radio Observatory located in\nOntario Canada, we developed a testbed for a VLBI experiment with a theoretical\n~<30 masec precision. We provide an overview of the 10-m system and describe\nits refurbishment, the data acquisition, and a procedure for fringe fitting\nthat simultaneously estimates the geometric delay used for localization and the\ndispersive delay from the ionosphere. Using single pulses from the Crab pulsar,\nwe validate the system and localization procedure, and analyze the clock\nstability between sites, which is critical for phase-referencing an FRB event.\nWe find a localization of 50 masec is possible with the performance of the\ncurrent system. Furthermore, for sources with insufficient signal or restricted\nwideband to simultaneously measure both geometric and ionospheric delays, we\nshow that the differential ionospheric contribution between the two sites must\nbe measured to a precision of 1e-8 pc/cc to provide a reasonable localization\nfrom a detection in the 400--800 MHz band. Finally we show detection of an FRB\nobserved simultaneously in the CHIME and the Algonquin 10-m telescope, the\nfirst FRB cross-correlated in this very long baseline. This project serves as a\ntestbed for the forthcoming CHIME/FRB Outriggers project.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 18:01:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 02:05:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 16:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-17"}

However, the assumptions leading to\nthe problem are often overlooked and, in fact, a careful inspection of the main\nhypothesises suggests a radical reformulation of the problem. Indeed, we\npresent a thought experiment involving a black hole that emits radiation and,\nindependently of the nature of the radiation, we show the existence of an\nincompatibility between (i) the validity of the laws of general relativity to\ndescribe infalling matter far from the Planckian regime, and (ii) the so-called\ncentral dogma which states that as seen from an outside observer a black hole\nbehaves like a quantum system whose number of degrees of freedom is\nproportional to the horizon area. We critically revise the standard arguments\nin support of the central dogma, and argue that they cannot hold true unless\nsome new physics is invoked even before reaching Planck scales. This suggests\nthat the information loss problem, in its current formulation, is not\nnecessarily related to any loss of information or lack of unitarity. Therefore,\nin principle, semiclassical general relativity and quantum mechanics can be\nperfectly compatible before reaching the final stage of the black hole\nevaporation where, instead, a consistent theory of quantum gravity is needed to\nmake any prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 18:09:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 05:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

Analytic arguments suggest\nthe opposite for minor mergers. In this work, we verify the analytic\npredictions for MOND by high-resolution $N$-body simulations of globular\nclusters (GCs) moving in isolated ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). We test the\nMOND analog of the Chandrasekhar formula for the dynamical friction proposed by\nS\\'anchez-Salcedo on a single GC.

The mass resolution is $20\\,M_\\odot$ and the spatial resolution\n$50\\,$pc. The GCs are modeled as point masses. Simulations including a single\nGC reveal that, as long as the apocenter of the GC is over about 0.5 effective\nradii, the S\\'anchez-Salcedo formula works excellently, with an effective\nCoulomb logarithm increasing with orbital circularity. Once the GC reaches the\ncentral kiloparsec, its sinking virtually stops, likely because of the core\nstalling mechanism. In simulations with multiple GCs, many of them sink toward\nthe center, but the core stalling effect seems to prevent them from forming a\nnuclear star cluster.

The state-of-the-art PUF methods that provide\nreliability guarantees to each extracted bit are shown to be inadequate to\nguarantee the same reliability level for all PUF outputs. Thus, a quality of\nservice parameter is introduced to control the percentage of PUF outputs for\nwhich a target reliability level can be guaranteed. A public ring oscillator\n(RO) output dataset is used to illustrate that a truncated Gaussian\ndistribution can be fitted to transformed RO outputs that are inputs to uniform\nscalar quantizers such that reliability guarantees can be provided for each bit\nextracted from any PUF device under additive Gaussian noise components by\neliminating a small subset of PUF outputs.

These kinds of events are possibly recurrent since a previous\nXMM-Newton archival observation in 2003 also showed signatures of partial\nobscuration. We have analyzed the high-resolution X-ray spectra of NGC 985\nobtained by the RGS in 2003, 2013, and 2015 in order to characterize the\nionized absorbers superimposed to the continuum and to study their response as\nthe ionizing flux varies. We found that up to four warm absorber (WA)\ncomponents were present in the grating spectra of NGC 985, plus a mildy ionized\n(log xi ranging between 0.2 and 0.5) obscuring (log N(H) of about 22.3) wind\noutflowing at about 6000 km/s. The absorbers have a log N(H) ranging from 21 to\nabout 22.5, and ionization parameters ranging from 1.6 to 2.9. The most ionized\ncomponent is also the fastest, moving away at 5100 km/s, while the others\noutflow in two kinematic regimes, at about 600 and 350 km/s. These components\nshowed variability at different time scales in response to changes in the\nionizing continuum. Assuming that these changes are due to photoionization we\nhave obtained upper and lower limits on the density of the gas and therefore on\nits distance, finding that the closest two components are at pc-scale\ndistances, while the rest may extend up to tens of pc from the central source.\nThe fastest, most ionized WA component accounts for the bulk of the kinetic\nluminosity injected back into the ISM of the host galaxy, which is on the order\nof 0.8% of the bolometric luminosity of NGC 985. According to the models, this\namount of kinetic energy per unit time would be sufficient to account for\ncosmic feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 18:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

In this paper, we use N-body\nsimulation to produce twin Universes that share the same initial conditions on\nsmall scales but different on large scales. This is achieved by changing the\nrandom seeds for the phase of those k modes smaller than a given scale in the\ninitial conditions. In this way, we are able to disentangle the formation of\nhalo and large-scale structure, making it possible to investigate how halo spin\nand shape correspond to the change of environment on large scales. We identify\nmatching halo pairs in the twin simulations as those sharing the maximum number\nof identical particles within each other. Using these matched halo pairs, we\nstudy the cross match of halo spin and their correlation with the large-scale\nstructure. It is found that when the large-scale environment changes\n(eigenvector) between the twin simulations, the halo spin has to rotate\naccordingly, although not significantly, to maintain the universal correlation\nseen in each simulation. Our results suggest that the large-scale structure is\nthe main factor to drive the correlation between halo properties and their\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 19:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

We\nconsider the competitive ratio between the hindsight optimal welfare and the\noptimal worst-case welfare among all item-pricing mechanisms, when the order of\nthe arriving buyers is adversarial. We assume that buyers own the\n\\emph{tie-breaking} power, i.e. they can choose whether or not to buy the\ndemand path at 0 utility. We prove a tight competitive ratio of $3/2$ when the\nunderlying graph is a single path (also known as the \\emph{highway} problem),\nwhereas item-pricing can achieve the hindsight optimal if the seller is allowed\nto choose a proper tie-breaking rule to maximize the welfare. Moreover, we\nprove an $O(1)$ upper bound of competitive ratio when the underlying graph is a\ntree.\n  For general graphs, we prove an $\\Omega(m^{1/8})$ lower bound of the\ncompetitive ratio.

The Higgs mode splits\ninto two branches also: a massive one, whose energy gap vanishes at the\ncritical temperature $T_{c}$, another massive one, whose energy gap does not\nvanish at $T_{c}$. It is demonstrated, that the second branch of the Higgs mode\nis nonphysical, and it, together with the Leggett mode, can be removed by the\nspecial choice of coefficient at the \"drag\" term in the Lagrangian.

We propose a causal CoP analysis that estimates the controlled\nvaccine efficacy curve across biomarker levels $s$, $CVE(s)$, equal to one\nminus the ratio of the controlled-risk curve $r_C(s)$ at $s$ and placebo risk,\nwhere $r_C(s)$ is causal risk if all participants are assigned vaccine and the\nbiomarker is set to $s$.

Moreover, its biological plausibility may help overcome\nimportant limitations of artificial algorithms, such as their susceptibility to\nadversarial attacks, and their high demands for training-example quantity and\nrepetition. However, Hebbian WTA learning has found little use in machine\nlearning (ML), likely because it has been missing an optimization theory\ncompatible with deep learning (DL). Here we show rigorously that WTA networks\nconstructed by standard DL elements, combined with a Hebbian-like plasticity\nthat we derive, maintain a Bayesian generative model of the data. Importantly,\nwithout any supervision, our algorithm, SoftHebb, minimizes cross-entropy, i.e.\na common loss function in supervised DL. We show this theoretically and in\npractice. The key is a \"soft\" WTA where there is no absolute \"hard\" winner\nneuron. Strikingly, in shallow-network comparisons with backpropagation (BP),\nSoftHebb shows advantages beyond its Hebbian efficiency. Namely, it converges\nin fewer iterations, and is significantly more robust to noise and adversarial\nattacks. Notably, attacks that maximally confuse SoftHebb are also confusing to\nthe human eye, potentially linking human perceptual robustness, with Hebbian\nWTA circuits of cortex. Finally, SoftHebb can generate synthetic objects as\ninterpolations of real object classes. All in all, Hebbian efficiency,\ntheoretical underpinning, cross-entropy-minimization, and surprising empirical\nadvantages, suggest that SoftHebb may inspire highly neuromorphic and radically\ndifferent, but practical and advantageous learning algorithms and hardware\naccelerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 21:34:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 15:17:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 16:57:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 21:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Power system operation during\nwildfires require resiliency-driven proactive control for load shedding, line\nswitching and resource allocation considering the dynamics of the wildfire and\nfailure propagation. However, possible number of line- and load-switching in a\nlarge system during an event make traditional prediction-driven and stochastic\napproaches computationally intractable, leading operators to often use greedy\nalgorithms.

The data consists of observed\nmultinomial counts of $p$ words across $n$ independent documents. In topic\nmodels, the $p\\times n$ expected word frequency matrix is assumed to be\nfactorized as a $p\\times K$ word-topic matrix $A$ and a $K\\times n$\ntopic-document matrix $T$. Since columns of both matrices represent conditional\nprobabilities belonging to probability simplices, columns of $A$ are viewed as\n$p$-dimensional mixture components that are common to all documents while\ncolumns of $T$ are viewed as the $K$-dimensional mixture weights that are\ndocument specific and are allowed to be sparse. The main interest is to provide\nsharp, finite sample, $\\ell_1$-norm convergence rates for estimators of the\nmixture weights $T$ when $A$ is either known or unknown. For known $A$, we\nsuggest MLE estimation of $T$. Our non-standard analysis of the MLE not only\nestablishes its $\\ell_1$ convergence rate, but reveals a remarkable property:\nthe MLE, with no extra regularization, can be exactly sparse and contain the\ntrue zero pattern of $T$. We further show that the MLE is both minimax optimal\nand adaptive to the unknown sparsity in a large class of sparse topic\ndistributions. When $A$ is unknown, we estimate $T$ by optimizing the\nlikelihood function corresponding to a plug in, generic, estimator $\\hat{A}$ of\n$A$. For any estimator $\\hat{A}$ that satisfies carefully detailed conditions\nfor proximity to $A$, the resulting estimator of $T$ is shown to retain the\nproperties established for the MLE.

Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or\nlow-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice\nexpressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention\ncapability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory\ncomplexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a\nconditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the\nconditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can\nattend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect\nattention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of\nembeddings from corresponding local regions.

Some inputs violate preconditions or\ncause domain errors. Others cause the algorithm to enter an infinite loop and\nfail to compute a ground truth. Plus, finding valid inputs is itself a\nchallenge when invalid and unsamplable points make up the vast majority of the\ninput space. These issues can make interval arithmetic brittle and\ntemperamental.\n  This paper introduces three extensions to interval arithmetic to address\nthese challenges. Error intervals express rich notions of input validity and\nindicate whether all or some points in an interval violate implicit or explicit\npreconditions. Movability flags detect futile recomputations and prevent\ntimeouts by indicating whether a higher-precision recomputation will yield a\nmore accurate result.

This paper presents the Visual Parser (ViP) that explicitly\nconstructs such a hierarchy with transformers. ViP divides visual\nrepresentations into two levels, the part level and the whole level.\nInformation of each part represents a combination of several independent\nvectors within the whole. To model the representations of the two levels, we\nfirst encode the information from the whole into part vectors through an\nattention mechanism, then decode the global information within the part vectors\nback into the whole representation. By iteratively parsing the two levels with\nthe proposed encoder-decoder interaction, the model can gradually refine the\nfeatures on both levels. Experimental results demonstrate that ViP can achieve\nvery competitive performance on three major tasks e.g. classification,\ndetection and instance segmentation.

While both of the quantization schemes resolve\nthe central singularity, they lead to different mass gaps at which a trapped\nsurface forms. This trapped surface which is matched to an exterior generalized\nVaidya spacetime disappears when the density of the dust shell is in the Planck\nregime. We find that the quantization based on holonomies and gauge-covariant\nfluxes generically results in an asymmetric evolution of the dust shell in\nwhich the effective mass associated with the white hole as seen by an external\nobserver is $2/\\pi$ of the one for the black hole. This effective difference in\nmasses results from difference in the classical limits in pre- and post-bounce\nregimes in the two quantizations. This distinctive feature rules out formation\nof any black hole-white hole twin in presence of gauge-covariant flux\nmodifications which is in contrast to the quantization using holonomies and\ntriads where the gravitational collapse always leads to a black hole-white hole\ntwins. In another striking difference, for the quantization based on holonomies\nand gauge-covariant fluxes there can be situations in which during a\nnon-singular collapse only a black hole forms without a white hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 00:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

We\nanalyze this phenomenon for random subspaces by first examining the success\nprobability of hitting a training loss sub-level set when training within a\nrandom subspace of a given training dimensionality. We find a sharp phase\ntransition in the success probability from $0$ to $1$ as the training dimension\nsurpasses a threshold. This threshold training dimension increases as the\ndesired final loss decreases, but decreases as the initial loss decreases. We\nthen theoretically explain the origin of this phase transition, and its\ndependence on initialization and final desired loss, in terms of properties of\nthe high-dimensional geometry of the loss landscape. In particular, we show via\nGordon's escape theorem, that the training dimension plus the Gaussian width of\nthe desired loss sub-level set, projected onto a unit sphere surrounding the\ninitialization, must exceed the total number of parameters for the success\nprobability to be large. In several architectures and datasets, we measure the\nthreshold training dimension as a function of initialization and demonstrate\nthat it is a small fraction of the total parameters, implying by our theory\nthat successful training with so few dimensions is possible precisely because\nthe Gaussian width of low loss sub-level sets is very large.

The barrier treatment has several attractive\nfeatures, including: (i) it does not introduce any additional degrees of\nfreedom or iterative steps, (ii) it is free of inter-penetration, (iii) it\navoids an ill-conditioned matrix system, and (iv) it allows one to control the\nsolution accuracy directly. We derive the contact pressure from a smooth\nbarrier energy function that is designed to satisfy the non-penetration\nconstraint. Likewise, we make use of a smoothed friction law in which the\nstick-slip transition is described by a continuous function of the slip\ndisplacement. We discretize the formulation using the extended finite element\nmethod to embed interfaces inside elements, and devise an averaged surface\nintegration scheme that effectively provides stable solutions without traction\noscillations. Subsequently, we develop a way to tailor the parameters of the\nbarrier method to embedded interfaces, such that the method can be used without\nparameter tuning. We verify and investigate the proposed method through\nnumerical examples with varied levels of complexity. The numerical results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method is remarkably robust for challenging\nfrictional contact problems, while requiring low cost comparable to that of the\npenalty method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 02:25:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 01:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

Our reactive planner selects a waypoint on the local\nVoronoi diagram and we use a pure-pursuit controller to navigate towards the\nwaypoint. Our safety and performance analysis has two parts. The first part\ndemonstrates that the reactive planner computes a plan that is locally\nconsistent with the Voronoi plan computed with full map. The second part\ninvolves modeling of the evolution of vehicle navigating along the Voronoi\ndiagram as a hybrid automata. For proving the safety and performance\nspecification, we compute the reachable set of this hybrid automata and employ\nsome enhancements that make this computation easier. We demonstrate that an\nautonomous vehicle implementing our reactive planner and controller is safe and\nsuccessfully completes a lap for five different circuits.

To address this issue, we propose a framework,\ncalled Multitask Identity-Aware Image Steganography (MIAIS), to achieve direct\nrecognition on container images without restoring secret images. The key issue\nof the direct recognition is to preserve identity information of secret images\ninto container images and make container images look similar to cover images at\nthe same time. Thus, we introduce a simple content loss to preserve the\nidentity information, and design a minimax optimization to deal with the\ncontradictory aspects. We demonstrate that the robustness results can be\ntransferred across different cover datasets. In order to be flexible for the\nsecret image restoration in some cases, we incorporate an optional restoration\nnetwork into our method, providing a multitask framework.

However,\nprevious observations have been limited to small data sets and fields-of-view.\nThe TESS mission provides far larger samples and, for the first time, the\nopportunity to perform asteroseimic inference from full-frame images full-sky,\ninstead of narrow fields and pre-selected targets. Here, we seek to detect\noscillations in TESS data of the red giants in the Kepler field using the 4-yr\nKepler results as benchmark. Because we use 1-2 sectors of observation, our\nresults are representative of the typical scenario from TESS data. We detect\nclear oscillations in ~3000 stars with another ~1000 borderline (low S/N)\ncases. In comparison, best-case predictions suggests ~4500 detectable\noscillating giants. Of the clear detections, we measure Dnu in 570 stars,\nmeaning a ~20% Dnu yield (14% for one sector and 26% for two sectors). These\nyields imply that typical (1-2 sector) TESS data will result in significant\ndetection biases. Hence, to boost the number of stars, one might need to use\nonly Numax as the seismic input for stellar property estimation.

A difficult problem in this scenario is the inevitable angular\nmomentum which prevents the collapse of BEC. To overcome this difficulty, in\nthis paper, we consider the very early Universe when the BEC-DM acquires its\nproper angular momentum by the tidal torque mechanism. The balance of the\ndensity evolution and the acquisition of the angular momentum determines the\nmass of the SMBH as well as the mass ratio of BH and the surrounding dark halo\n(DH).

To aid in the understanding transferability of\nplanning solutions, it is necessary to have a rich and comprehensible\nrepresentation for both human and computers beyond the current line-by-line\ntext notation. In particular, it is desirable to encode the trace of literals\nthroughout the plan to capture the dependencies between actions selected. The\napproach of this paper is to view the actions as maps between literals and the\nselected plan as a composition of those maps. The mathematical theory, called\ncategory theory, provides the relevant structures for capturing maps, their\ncompositions, and maps between compositions. We employ this theory to propose\nan algorithm agnostic, model-based representation for domains, problems, and\nplans expressed in the commonly used planning description language, PDDL. This\ncategory theoretic representation is accompanied by a graphical syntax in\naddition to a linear notation, similar to algebraic expressions, that can be\nused to infer literals used at every step of the plan. This provides the\nappropriate constructive abstraction and facilitates comprehension for human\noperators. In this paper, we demonstrate this on a plan within the Blocksworld\ndomain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 05:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

In this paper, we propose to use a lightweight visual-inertial\nsystem with a 2D georeference map to obtain accurate and consecutive geodetic\npositions for UAVs. The proposed system firstly integrates a micro inertial\nmeasurement unit (MIMU) and a monocular camera as odometry to consecutively\nestimate the navigation states and reconstruct the 3D position of the observed\nvisual features in the local world frame. To obtain the geolocation, the visual\nfeatures tracked by the odometry are further registered to the 2D georeferenced\nmap. While most conventional methods perform image-level aerial image\nregistration, we propose to align the reconstructed points to the map points in\nthe geodetic frame; this helps to filter out the large portion of outliers and\ndecouples the negative effects from the horizontal angles. The registered\npoints are then used to relocalize the vehicle in the geodetic frame. Finally,\na pose graph is deployed to fuse the geolocation from the aerial image\nregistration and the local navigation result from the visual-inertial odometry\n(VIO) to achieve consecutive and drift-free geolocalization performance. We\nhave validated the proposed method by installing the sensors to a UAV body\nrigidly and have conducted two flights in different environments with unknown\ninitials.

A prominent example is the market for carbon emission allowances.\nThese allowances are commonly allocated by the government using uniform-price\nauctions, and firms can typically trade these allowances among themselves in an\naftermarket that may not be fully under the auctioneer's control. While the\nuniform-price auction is approximately efficient in isolation, we show that\nspeculation and resale in aftermarkets might result in a significant welfare\nloss. Motivated by this issue, we consider three approaches, each ensuring high\nequilibrium welfare in the combined market. The first approach is to adopt\nsmooth auctions such as discriminatory auctions. This approach is robust to\ncorrelated valuations and to participants acquiring information about others'\ntypes. However, discriminatory auctions have several downsides, notably that of\ncharging bidders different prices for identical items, resulting in fairness\nconcerns that make the format unpopular. Two other approaches we suggest are\neither using posted-pricing mechanisms, or using uniform-price auctions with\nanonymous reserves. We show that when using balanced prices, both these\napproaches ensure high equilibrium welfare in the combined market.

Our main\ntechnical finding is that the template of every PCSP that is solvable in\nbounded width satisfies a certain structural condition implying that its\nalgebraic closure-properties include weak near unanimity polymorphisms of all\nlarge arities. While this parallels the standard (non-promise) CSP theory, the\nmethod of proof is quite different and applies even to the regime of sublinear\nwidth. We also show that, in contrast with the CSP world, the presence of weak\nnear unanimity polymorphisms of all large arities does not guarantee\nsolvability in bounded width. The separating example is even solvable in the\nsecond level of the Sherali-Adams (SA) hierarchy of linear programming\nrelaxations. This shows that, unlike for CSPs, linear programming can be\nstronger than bounded width. A direct application of these methods also show\nthat the problem of $q$-coloring $p$-colorable graphs is not solvable in\nbounded or even sublinear width, for any two constants $p$ and $q$ such that $3\n\\leq p \\leq q$. Turning to algorithms, we note that Wigderson's algorithm for\n$O(\\sqrt{n})$-coloring $3$-colorable graphs with $n$ vertices is implementable\nin width $4$. Indeed, by generalizing the method we see that, for any $\\epsilon\n> 0$ smaller than $1/2$, the optimal width for solving the problem of\n$O(n^\\epsilon)$-coloring $3$-colorable graphs with $n$ vertices lies between\n$n^{1-3\\epsilon}$ and $n^{1-2\\epsilon}$. The upper bound gives a simple\n$2^{\\Theta(n^{1-2\\epsilon}\\log(n))}$-time algorithm that, asymptotically, beats\nthe straightforward $2^{\\Theta(n^{1-\\epsilon})}$ bound that follows from\npartitioning the graph into $O(n^\\epsilon)$ many independent parts each of size\n$O(n^{1-\\epsilon})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 07:36:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Solutions for automated epileptic seizure detection can help\nimprove the current problem of incomplete and erroneous manual documentation of\nepileptic seizures.

However, detecting seizures with subtle symptoms\nremains difficult and current solutions tend to have a high false alarm rate.\nSeizures can also affect the patient's arterial blood pressure, which has not\nyet been studied for detection with sensors. The pulse transit time (PTT)\nprovides a noninvasive estimate of arterial blood pressure.

One of the hardest problems in\nthis task is how to represent text instances of arbitrary shapes. Although many\nmethods have been proposed to model irregular texts in a flexible manner, most\nof them lose simplicity and robustness. Their complicated post-processings and\nthe regression under Dirac delta distribution undermine the detection\nperformance and the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose an\nefficient text instance representation named CentripetalText (CT), which\ndecomposes text instances into the combination of text kernels and centripetal\nshifts. Specifically, we utilize the centripetal shifts to implement pixel\naggregation, guiding the external text pixels to the internal text kernels. The\nrelaxation operation is integrated into the dense regression for centripetal\nshifts, allowing the correct prediction in a range instead of a specific value.\nThe convenient reconstruction of text contours and the tolerance of prediction\nerrors in our method guarantee the high detection accuracy and the fast\ninference speed, respectively. Besides, we shrink our text detector into a\nproposal generation module, namely CentripetalText Proposal Network, replacing\nSegmentation Proposal Network in Mask TextSpotter v3 and producing more\naccurate proposals. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct\nexperiments on several commonly used scene text benchmarks, including both\ncurved and multi-oriented text datasets.

We validate the practicality and usefulness of our\nmethodology by generating 10000 iid realizations from the standard\ndistributions such as normal, Student's t with 5 degrees of freedom and Cauchy,\nfor dimensions d = 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, as well as from a 50-dimensional mixture\nnormal distribution. The implementation time in all the cases are very\nreasonable, and often less than a minute in our parallel implementation. The\nresults turned out to be highly accurate.\n  We also apply our method to draw 10000 iid realizations from the posterior\ndistributions associated with the well-known Challenger data, a Salmonella data\nand the 160-dimensional challenging spatial example of the radionuclide count\ndata on Rongelap Island. Again, we are able to obtain quite encouraging results\nwith very reasonable computing time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 09:58:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 07:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

These systems are impotent in affecting users to choose the behavior\nthat the system expects. Meanwhile, providing incentives has been proven to be\na more proactive way to affect users' behaviors. Due to the budget limitation,\nthe number of users who can be incentivized is restricted. In this light, we\nintend to utilize social influence existing among users to enhance the effect\nof incentivization. Through incentivizing influential users directly, their\nfollowers in the social network are possibly incentivized indirectly. However,\nin many real-world scenarios, the topological structure of the network is\nusually unknown, which makes identifying influential users difficult. To tackle\nthe aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for\nexploring influential users in unknown networks, which can estimate the\ninfluential relationships among users based on their historical behaviors and\nwithout knowing the topology of the network. Meanwhile, we design an adaptive\nincentive allocation approach that determines incentive values based on users'\npreferences and their influence ability. We evaluate the performance of the\nproposed approaches by conducting experiments on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 11:20:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 13:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

Traditional cascaded approaches for ST, using\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) systems, are\nprone to error propagation. End-to-end approaches use only one system to avoid\npropagating error, yet are difficult to employ due to data scarcity. We explore\nzero-shot translation, which enables translating a pair of languages that is\nunseen during training, thus avoid the use of end-to-end ST data. Zero-shot\ntranslation has been shown to work for multilingual machine translation, yet\nhas not been studied for speech translation. We attempt to build zero-shot ST\nmodels that are trained only on ASR and MT tasks but can do ST task during\ninference. The challenge is that the representation of text and audio is\nsignificantly different, thus the models learn ASR and MT tasks in different\nways, making it non-trivial to perform zero-shot. These models tend to output\nthe wrong language when performing zero-shot ST. We tackle the issues by\nincluding additional training data and an auxiliary loss function that\nminimizes the text-audio difference. Our experiment results and analysis show\nthat the methods are promising for zero-shot ST. Moreover, our methods are\nparticularly useful in the few-shot settings where a limited amount of ST data\nis available, with improvements of up to +11.8 BLEU points compared to direct\nend-to-end ST models and +3.9 BLEU points compared to ST models fine-tuned from\npre-trained ASR model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 12:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Industrial alliances and companies are\nrunning anti-piracy incentive campaigns, but their effectiveness is publicly\nquestioned due to the lack of transparency. We believe that full transparency\nof a campaign is necessary to truly incentivize people. It means that every\nrole, e.g., content owner, licensee of the content, or every person in the open\npopulation, can understand the mechanism and be assured about its execution\nwithout trusting any single role.\n  We see this as a distributed system problem. In this paper, we present Argus,\na fully transparent incentive system for anti-piracy campaigns. The groundwork\nof Argus is to formulate the objectives for fully transparent incentive\nmechanisms, which securely and comprehensively consolidate the different\ninterests of all roles. These objectives form the core of the Argus design,\nhighlighted by our innovations about a Sybil-proof incentive function, a\ncommit-and-reveal scheme, and an oblivious transfer scheme. In the\nimplementation, we overcome a set of unavoidable obstacles to ensure security\ndespite full transparency. Moreover, we effectively optimize several\ncryptographic operations so that the cost for a piracy reporting is reduced to\nan equivalent cost of sending about 14 ETH-transfer transactions to run on the\npublic Ethereum network, which would otherwise correspond to thousands of\ntransactions. With the security and practicality of Argus, we hope real-world\nanti-piracy campaigns will be truly effective by shifting to a fully\ntransparent incentive mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 13:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

However, existing score\ntests address only jointly testing all parameters of interest; a leading\nexample is testing all ARCH parameters or variances of random coefficients\nbeing zero or not. In such testing problems rejection of the null hypothesis\ndoes not provide evidence on rejection of specific elements of parameter of\ninterest. This paper proposes a class of one-sided score tests for testing a\nmodel parameter that is subject to inequality constraints.

In Jupiter's\nstratosphere, the equatorial oscillation of its relative temperature structure\nabout the equator, is characterized by a quasi-period of 4.4 years. The\nstratospheric wind field in Jupiter's equatorial zone has never been directly\nobserved. In this paper, we aim at mapping the absolute wind speeds in\nJupiter's equatorial stratosphere to quantify vertical and horizontal wind and\ntemperature shear. Assuming geostrophic equilibrium, we apply the thermal wind\nbalance using nearly simultaneous stratospheric temperature measurements\nbetween 0.1 and 30 mbar performed with Gemini/TEXES and direct zonal wind\nmeasurements derived at 1 mbar from ALMA observations, all carried out between\nMarch 14th and 22nd, 2017.

We obtain\nstratospheric map of the zonal wind speeds as a function of latitude and\npressure about Jupiter's equator for the first time. The winds are vertically\nlayered with successive eastward and westward jets. We find a 200 m/s westward\njet at 4 mbar at the equator, with a typical longitudinal variability on the\norder of ~50 m/s. By extending our wind calculations to the upper troposphere,\nwe find a wind structure qualitatively close to the wind observed using\ncloud-tracking techniques.

Valid inference can then be\nobtained so long as both predictions converge (sufficiently fast) to the truth.\nFocusing on partially linear regression models, we show that a specific\nimplementation of the machine learning techniques can yield exposure effect\nestimators that have small bias even when one of the first-stage predictions\ndoes not converge to the truth. The resulting tests and confidence intervals\nare doubly robust. We also show that the proposed estimators may fail to be\nregular when only one nuisance parameter is consistently estimated;\nnevertheless, we observe in simulation studies that our proposal can lead to\nreduced bias and improved confidence interval coverage in moderate samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 14:24:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 12:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

In order to combat this, first-principles methods\nhave been coupled with statistical methods such as the Cluster Expansion\nformalism in order to construct the energy hull diagram, which helps to\ndetermine if an alloyed structure can exist in nature. Traditionally, density\nfunctional theory (DFT) has been used in such workflows. In this work we\npropose to use chemically accurate many-body variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and\ndiffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods to construct the energy hull diagram of an\nalloy system, due to the fact that such methods have a weaker dependence on the\nstarting wavefunction and density functional, scale similarly to DFT with the\nnumber of electrons, and have had demonstrated success for a variety of\nmaterials. To carry out these simulations in a high-throughput manner, we\npropose a method called Jastrow sharing, which involves recycling the optimized\nJastrow parameters between alloys with different stoichiometries. We show that\nthis eliminates the need for extra VMC Jastrow optimization calculations and\nresults in a significant computational cost savings (on average 1/4 savings of\ntotal computational time).

This paper presents MINERVAS, a Massive INterior EnviRonments VirtuAl\nSynthesis system, to facilitate the 3D scene modification and the 2D image\nsynthesis for various vision tasks. In particular, we design a programmable\npipeline with Domain-Specific Language, allowing users to (1) select scenes\nfrom the commercial indoor scene database, (2) synthesize scenes for different\ntasks with customized rules, and (3) render various imagery data, such as\nvisual color, geometric structures, semantic label. Our system eases the\ndifficulty of customizing massive numbers of scenes for different tasks and\nrelieves users from manipulating fine-grained scene configurations by providing\nuser-controllable randomness using multi-level samplers. Most importantly, it\nempowers users to access commercial scene databases with millions of indoor\nscenes and protects the copyright of core data assets, e.g., 3D CAD models. We\ndemonstrate the validity and flexibility of our system by using our synthesized\ndata to improve the performance on different kinds of computer vision tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 14:53:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 14:21:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2022 02:45:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 09:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

A common solution is to minimize the Shannon Entropy\nto push the decision boundary away from the high density area. However, entropy\nminimization also leads to severe reduction of prediction diversity, and\nunfortunately brings harm to the domain adaptation. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the prediction discriminability and diversity by studying the\nstructure of the classification output matrix of a randomly selected data\nbatch. We find by theoretical analysis that the prediction discriminability and\ndiversity could be separately measured by the Frobenius-norm and rank of the\nbatch output matrix. The nuclear-norm is an upperbound of the former, and a\nconvex approximation of the latter. Accordingly, we propose Batch Nuclear-norm\nMaximization and Minimization, which performs nuclear-norm maximization on the\ntarget output matrix to enhance the target prediction ability, and nuclear-norm\nminimization on the source batch output matrix to increase applicability of the\nsource domain knowledge. We further approximate the nuclear-norm by\nL_{1,2}-norm, and design multi-batch optimization for stable solution on large\nnumber of categories. The fast approximation method achieves O(n^2)\ncomputational complexity and better convergence property.

We discuss two\nprototypical aqueous salt solutions, NaI(aq) and tetrabutylammonium iodide,\nTBAI(aq), with the latter being a strong surfactant. Considerably different\nbehavior is revealed: In the NaI(aq) solutions, water's 1b1 energy increases by\n300 meV upon increasing the concentration near-saturation concentrations,\nwhereas for TBAI the energy decreases by about 0.7 eV upon formation of a\nsurface layer.

The slit width ratio S/D (slit width/diameter) on\nthe modified cylinder plays an essential role to control the vortex shedding.\nThe additional flow through the slit leads to the suppression of the global\ninstability and vortex shedding, whereas a large amount of flow through the\nslit drastically alters the behavior of vortex shedding. The nature of vortex\nshedding remains periodic for all S/D, and the root mean square (rms) value of\nthe lift coefficient decreases (in turn, vortex shedding suppression) with S/D\nup to Re = 300. For the range Re > 300, the root mean square (rms) value of the\nlift coefficient decreases up to S/D < 0.15, and the flow exhibits periodic\nvortex shedding, while the root mean square (rms) increases beyond S/D > 0.15\ndue to irregular vortex shedding downstream of cylinder. The variation of the\nRe for the S/D=0.20 shows bifurcation points where the flow changes its\nbehavior from symmetric to asymmetric solution at Re=232 and again becomes\nsymmetric at Re=304. The unsteady flow analysis over the modified cylinder also\nindicates the suppression in the vortex shedding; however, the analysis\nprovides the qualitative property of suppression.

Incidents are\nincreasing that range from natural disasters to cyber attacks. These incidents\nthreaten the reliability of power systems and create disturbances that affect\nthe whole society. While existing standards and technologies are being applied\nto proactively improve power system reliability and resilience, there are still\nwidespread electricity outages that cause billions of dollars in economic loss\nannually and threaten societal function and safety. Improving resilience in\npreparation for such events warrants strategic network design to harden the\nsystem. This paper presents an approach to strengthen power system security and\nreliability against disturbances by expanding the network structure from an\necosystems perspective.\n  Ecosystems have survived a wide range of disturbances over a long time\nperiod, and an ecosystem's robust structure has been identified as the key\nelement for its survivability. In this paper, we first present a study of the\ncorrelation of ecological robustness and power system structures.

KDD GAN formulates the training as a\nlikelihood ratio optimization problem where the data distributions are written\nexplicitly via (local) Kernel Density Estimates (KDE). This is inspired by the\nrecent progress in contrastive learning and its relation to KDE. We define the\nKDEs directly in feature space and forgo the requirement of invertibility of\nthe kernel feature mappings. In our approach, features are no longer optimized\nfor linear separability, as in the original GAN formulation, but for the more\ngeneral discrimination of distributions in the feature space. We analyze the\ngradient of our loss with respect to the feature representation and show that\nit is better behaved than that of the original hinge loss. We perform\nexperiments with the proposed KDE-based loss, used either as a training loss or\na regularization term, on both CIFAR10 and scaled versions of ImageNet.

Using lower precision can\noffer significant savings in computation and communication costs with\nproportional savings in energy. Motivated by this, there has been a renewed\ninterest in mixed precision iterative refinement for solving linear systems\n$Ax=b$, and new variants of GMRES-based iterative refinement have been\ndeveloped. Each particular variant with a given combination of precisions leads\nto different condition number-based constraints for convergence of the backward\nand forward errors, and each has different performance costs. The constraints\nfor convergence given in the literature are, as an artifact of the analyses,\noften overly strict in practice, and thus could lead a user to select a more\nexpensive variant when a less expensive one would have sufficed.\n  In this work, we develop a multistage mixed precision iterative refinement\nsolver which aims to combine existing mixed precision approaches to balance\nperformance and accuracy and improve usability. For an initial combination of\nprecisions, the algorithm begins with the least expensive approach and\nconvergence is monitored via inexpensive computations with quantities produced\nduring the iteration. If slow convergence or divergence is detected using\nparticular stopping criteria, the algorithm switches to use a more expensive,\nbut more reliable variant. A novel aspect of our approach is that, unlike\nexisting implementations, our algorithm first attempts to use ``stronger''\nsolvers for the solution update before resorting to increasing the\nprecision(s). In some scenarios, this can avoid the need to refactorize the\nmatrix in higher precision. We perform extensive numerical experiments on\nrandom dense problems and problems from real applications which confirm the\nbenefits of the multistage approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 15:59:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 15:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

On the one hand, our purpose is to develop a\ntheoretical foundation in order to explain the occurrence and formation of\nvortices in non-collisional astrophysical plasmas. On the other hand, to apply\nthe latter in order to study the vorticity in the wakes of Venus and Mars. We\nintroduce two theorems and two corollaries, which may be applicable to any\nnon-collisional plasma system, that relate the vorticity to electromagnetic\nvariables such as the magnetic field and the electric current density. We also\nintroduce a toy vortex model for the wakes of non-magnetized planetary bodies.\nFrom the proposed theorems and model and using magnetic data of the VEX and the\nMars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft, we identify vortices in the wakes of\nVenus and Mars in single spacecraft wake crossings. We also identify a spatial\ncoincidence between current density and vorticity maxima confirming the\nconsistency of our theorems and model. We conclude that vortices in\nnon-collisional magnetized plasmas are always linked to electric currents and\nthat both vortices and currents always coexist. This suggests that the\nmechanism that produces this type of vortices is the mutual interaction between\nthe electric current and the magnetic field, that to a first approximation is\nexplained considering that plasma currents due to a non-zero net charge density\ninduce magnetic fields that modify the existing field and also produce a\nhelical field configuration that drives charged particles along helical\ntrajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 15:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

It is well-known that,\neven with linear utilities, the set of CEEI may be non-convex and disconnected,\nand the problem is PPAD-hard in the more general exchange model. In contrast to\nthese negative results, we design FPTAS: A polynomial-time algorithm to compute\n$\\epsilon$-approximate CEEI where the running-time depends polynomially on\n$1/\\epsilon$.\n  Our algorithm relies on the recent characterization due to Bogomolnaia et\nal.~(2017) of the CEEI set as exactly the KKT points of a non-convex\nminimization problem that have all coordinates non-zero.

This was proved for weak model sets having a compact\nwindow. In this note, we argue that the same results hold for arbitrary\nmeasurable and relatively compact windows. Our arguments crucially rely on\nMoody's work on uniform distribution in model sets. We also discuss\nimplications for the diffraction of such weak model sets and discuss a new\nclass of examples which are generic for the Mirsky measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 19:04:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 09:45:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 05:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

PDEs are commonly solved numerically using the finite-difference\n(FD) method, with stencils constructed from truncated Taylor series expansions\nwhich, whilst typically providing good approximation of the PDE in the\nspace-time domain, often differ considerably from the original partial\ndifferential in the wavenumber-frequency domain where the dispersion\nrelationship is defined. Consequentially, stable, high-order FD schemes may not\nnecessarily result in realistic wave behavior, commonly exhibiting numerical\ndispersion: lagging high-frequency components as a product of discretization. A\nmethod for optimizing FD stencil weightings via constrained minimization to\nbetter approximate the partial derivative in the wavenumber domain is proposed,\nallowing for accurate propagation with coarser grids than would be otherwise\npossible. This was applied to second derivatives on a standard grid and first\nderivatives on a staggered grid.
