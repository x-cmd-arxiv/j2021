Importantly, this equivalence reveals that the solution path\ncan be viewed as the flow of a hybrid of gradient descent and Newton method\napplying to the empirical loss, which is similar to a widely used optimization\ntechnique called trust region method. This provides an interesting algorithmic\nview of $\\ell_2$ regularization, and is in contrast to the conventional view\nthat the $\\ell_2$ regularization solution path is similar to the gradient flow\nof the empirical loss.New path-following algorithms based on homotopy methods\nand numerical ODE solvers are proposed to numerically approximate the solution\npath. In particular, we consider respectively Newton method and gradient\ndescent method as the basis algorithm for the homotopy method, and establish\ntheir approximation error rates over the solution path. Importantly, our theory\nsuggests novel schemes to choose grid points that guarantee an arbitrarily\nsmall suboptimality for the solution path. In terms of computational cost, we\nprove that in order to achieve an $\\epsilon$-suboptimality for the entire\nsolution path, the number of Newton steps required for the Newton method is\n$\\mathcal O(\\epsilon^{-1/2})$, while the number of gradient steps required for\nthe gradient descent method is $\\mathcal O\\left(\\epsilon^{-1}\n\\ln(\\epsilon^{-1})\\right)$. Finally, we use $\\ell_2$-regularized logistic\nregression as an illustrating example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed path-following algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 16:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

In time-encoding, the\nsignal is encoded using a sequence of time instants where an event occurs, and\nhence fall under event-driven sampling methods. Time-encoding can be designed\nagnostic to the global clock of the sampling hardware, which makes sampling\nasynchronous. Moreover, the encoding is sparse. This makes time-encoding energy\nefficient. However, the signal representation is nonstandard and in general,\nnonuniform. In this paper, we consider time-encoding of\nfinite-rate-of-innovation signals, and in particular, periodic signals composed\nof weighted and time-shifted versions of a known pulse. We consider encoding\nusing both crossing-time-encoding machine (C-TEM) and integrate-and-fire\ntime-encoding machine (IF-TEM). We analyze how time-encoding manifests in the\nFourier domain and arrive at the familiar sum-of-sinusoids structure of the\nFourier coefficients that can be obtained starting from the time-encoded\nmeasurements via a suitable linear transformation. Thereafter, standard FRI\ntechniques become applicable. Further, we extend the theory to multichannel\ntime-encoding such that each channel operates with a lower sampling\nrequirement. We also study the effect of measurement noise, where the temporal\nmeasurements are perturbed by additive noise. To combat the effect of noise, we\npropose a robust optimization framework to simultaneously denoise the Fourier\ncoefficients and estimate the annihilating filter accurately.

Due to its inflated radius, low gravity, and ultra-hot equilibrium\ntemperature, WASP-76b is an ideal case study for the impact of internal\nevolution on observable properties. Hot interiors should most strongly affect\nthe non-irradiated side of the planet, and thus full phase curve observations\nare critical to ascertain the effect of the interior on the atmospheres of hot\nJupiters. In this work, we present the first Spitzer phase curve observations\nof WASP-76b.

To date, the survival of volatile interstellar material in the\ndisk stage has not been modeled using realistic disk physics. Here, we present\na modeling framework to track the destruction of interstellar ices on dust\ngrains undergoing transport processes within a disk, with a particular focus on\nexplaining the incorporation of pristine material into icy planetesimals. We\nfind it is difficult to explain inheritance through the local assembly of\ncomets, as ice destruction is rapid for small (<10um) grains in the inner few\ntens of au. Instead, a plausible pathway to inheritance is to form pebbles at\nlarger disk radii, which then drift inwards to the comet-forming zone with\ntheir ices mostly preserved. Small grains beyond ~100 au can experience ice\nphotodissociation at the tens of percent level, however little of the ice is\nactually lost from the grain, likely making this a robust site for in situ ice\nchemistry. Our models also indicate that many complex organic species should\nsurvive passage through the disk intact.

In this scenario, instability during the Laplace Plane\ntransition, when the Moon's orbit transitions from the gravitational influence\nof Earth's figure to that of the Sun, would both lower the system's angular\nmomentum to its present-day value and generate the Moon's orbital inclination.\nRecently, Tian and Wisdom (2020) discovered new dynamical constraints on the\nLaplace Plane transition and concluded that the Earth-Moon system could not\nhave evolved from an initial state with high obliquity.

A recent\nresearch line focuses on incorporating neural networks with the statistical\nmodel -- marked point processes, which is the conventional tool for dealing\nwith attributed event sequences. Neural marked point processes possess good\ninterpretability of probabilistic models as well as the representational power\nof neural networks. However, we find that performance of neural marked point\nprocesses is not always increasing as the network architecture becomes more\ncomplicated and larger, which is what we call the performance saturation\nphenomenon. This is due to the fact that the generalization error of neural\nmarked point processes is determined by both the network representational\nability and the model specification at the same time. Therefore we can draw two\nmajor conclusions: first, simple network structures can perform no worse than\ncomplicated ones for some cases; second, using a proper probabilistic\nassumption is as equally, if not more, important as improving the complexity of\nthe network. Based on this observation, we propose a simple graph-based network\nstructure called GCHP, which utilizes only graph convolutional layers, thus it\ncan be easily accelerated by the parallel mechanism. We directly consider the\ndistribution of interarrival times instead of imposing a specific assumption on\nthe conditional intensity function, and propose to use a likelihood ratio loss\nwith a moment matching mechanism for optimization and model selection.\nExperimental results show that GCHP can significantly reduce training time and\nthe likelihood ratio loss with interarrival time probability assumptions can\ngreatly improve the model performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 16:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

Yet, most\nexisting methods to approximate second-order information have high\ncomputational or storage costs, which can limit their practicality. In this\nwork, we investigate matrix-free, linear-time approaches for estimating\nInverse-Hessian Vector Products (IHVPs) for the case when the Hessian can be\napproximated as a sum of rank-one matrices, as in the classic approximation of\nthe Hessian by the empirical Fisher matrix. We propose two new algorithms as\npart of a framework called M-FAC: the first algorithm is tailored towards\nnetwork compression and can compute the IHVP for dimension $d$, if the Hessian\nis given as a sum of $m$ rank-one matrices, using $O(dm^2)$ precomputation,\n$O(dm)$ cost for computing the IHVP, and query cost $O(m)$ for any single\nelement of the inverse Hessian. The second algorithm targets an optimization\nsetting, where we wish to compute the product between the inverse Hessian,\nestimated over a sliding window of optimization steps, and a given gradient\ndirection, as required for preconditioned SGD. We give an algorithm with cost\n$O(dm + m^2)$ for computing the IHVP and $O(dm + m^3)$ for adding or removing\nany gradient from the sliding window.

The\nstrategy has been recently explored for neuromorphic engineering by\nestablishing link between the electrical signals and the dendrites' shapes.\nSince the geometry of these structures determines their electrochemical\nproperties, understanding the mechanisms that regulate the polymer assembly\nunder electrically programmed conditions is an important aspect. In this\nmanuscript, we simulate this phenomenon using mesoscale simulations, taking\ninto account the important features of spatial-temporal potential mapping based\non the time-varying signal, the motion of charged particles in the liquid due\nto the electric field, and the attachment of particles on the electrode. The\nstudy helps in visualizing the motion of particles in different electrical\nconditions, which is not possible to probe experimentally. Consistent with the\nexperiments, the higher AC frequency of electrical activities favors linear\nwire-like growth, while lower frequency leads to more dense and fractal\ndendrites growth, and voltage offset leads to asymmetrical growth. We find that\ndendrites' shape and growth process systematically depend on particle\nconcentration and random scattering. We discover that the different dendrites'\narchitectures are associated with different Laplace and diffusion fields, which\ngovern the monomers trajectory and subsequent dendrites' growth. Such\nunconventional engineering routes could have a variety of applications from\nneuromorphic engineering to bottom-up computing strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 17:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

Meanwhile, HIs between swimming\nappendages (e.g. cilia and flagella) influence the emergence of swimming gaits,\nsynchronised bundles and metachronal waves. In this study, we address the issue\nof HIs between slender filaments separated by a distance larger than their\ncontour length (d>L) by means of asymptotic calculations and numerical\nsimulations. We first derive analytical expressions for the extended resistance\nmatrix of two arbitrarily-shaped rigid filaments as a series expansion in\ninverse powers of d/L>1. The coefficients in our asymptotic series expansion\nare then evaluated using two well-established methods for slender filaments,\nresistive-force theory (RFT) and slender-body theory (SBT), and our asymptotic\ntheory is verified using numerical simulations based on SBT for the case of two\nparallel helices. The theory captures the qualitative features of the\ninteractions in the regime d/L>1, which opens the path to a deeper physical\nunderstanding of hydrodynamically governed phenomena such as inter-filament\nsynchronisation and multiflagellar propulsion. To demonstrate the usefulness of\nour results, we next apply our theory to the case of two helices rotating\nside-by-side, where we quantify the dependence of all forces and torques on the\ndistance and phase difference between them.

Applying the\npreviously developed chemical evolution code, GalIMF, which allows an\nenvironment-dependent stellar initial mass function (IMF) to be applied in the\nintegrated galaxy initial mass function (IGIMF) theory instead of an invariant\ncanonical IMF, the star formation timescales (SFT) of E galaxies are\nre-evaluated. The code's uniqueness lies in it allowing the galaxy-wide IMF and\nassociated chemical enrichment to evolve as the physical conditions in the\ngalaxy change. The calculated SFTs become consistent with the independent SPS\nresults if the number of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) per unit stellar mass\nincreases for more massive E~galaxies.

This work achieves, for the\nfirst time, consistency of the SFTs for early-type galaxies between\nchemical-enrichment and SPS modelling and leads to an improved understanding of\nhow the star formation environment may affect the total number of SNIa per unit\nstellar mass formed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Studying statistical\ncorrelations in large simulated populations sheds some light on these impacts,\nbut the causal effect of an environment on individual objects is harder to\npinpoint. Addressing this, we present a new method for resimulating a single\ndark matter halo in multiple large-scale environments. In the initial\nconditions, we 'splice' (i.e. insert) the Lagrangian region of a halo into\ndifferent Gaussian random fields, while enforcing consistency with the\nstatistical properties of $\\Lambda$CDM. Applying this technique, we demonstrate\nthat the mass of halos is primarily determined by the density structure inside\ntheir Lagrangian patches, while the halos' concentration is more strongly\naffected by environment. The splicing approach will also allow us to study, for\nexample, the impact of the cosmic web on accretion processes and galaxy\nquenching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 18:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 08:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

As a result, their current orbital locations require\nan explanation beyond standard disk migration or in situ formation. Modern\ntheories of planet-disk interactions indicate that once a planet migrates close\nto the disk's inner truncation radius, Type I torques vanish or switch\ndirection, depending on the stellar and disk conditions, so that the planet is\nexpected to stop its orbital decay and become trapped. In this work, we show\nthat that magnetically-driven sub-Keplerian gas flow in the inner disk can\nnaturally counteract these effects and produce systems with USP planets at\ntheir observed orbital radii. The sub-Keplerian gas flow provides a headwind to\nsmall planets, and the resulting torque can overcome the effects of outward\nType I migration near the co-rotation radius. For suitable disk and planet\nparameters, the torques due to the sub-Keplerian gas flow lead to inward\nmigration on a rapid timescale. Over the time span of an FU Ori outburst, which\nmoves the disk truncation radius inward, the rapid headwind migration can place\nplanets in USP orbits. The combination of headwind migration and FU Ori\noutbursts thus provides a plausible mechanism to move small planets from\n$a=0.05-0.1$ AU down to $a=0.01-0.02$ AU. This effect is amplified for low-mass\nplanets, consistent with existing observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 18:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

Modeling demonstrates that this efficient generation of\nelasticity is the consequence of the combined effects of shape anisotropy on\nthe hierarchical fractal microstructure of the gel network, the anisotropy of\nthe attractive interparticle pair potentials, and the volumetric compactness of\nthe fractal cluster. The findings show how and why particle anisotropy can be\nexploited to generate elasticity at ultra-low colloidal volume fractions in\nthis important class of soft matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 18:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

However, the lack of transparency and\naccountability of most accurate models often hinders their safe use. Thus,\nthere is a clear need for developing explainable artificial intelligence\nmechanisms. There exist model-agnostic methods that summarize feature\ncontributions, but their interpretability is limited to predictions made by\nblack-box models. An open challenge is to develop models that have intrinsic\ninterpretability and produce their own explanations, even for classes of models\nthat are traditionally considered black boxes like (recurrent) neural networks.\nIn this paper, we propose a Long-Term Cognitive Network for interpretable\npattern classification of structured data. Our method brings its own mechanism\nfor providing explanations by quantifying the relevance of each feature in the\ndecision process. For supporting the interpretability without affecting the\nperformance, the model incorporates more flexibility through a quasi-nonlinear\nreasoning rule that allows controlling nonlinearity. Besides, we propose a\nrecurrence-aware decision model that evades the issues posed by the unique\nfixed point while introducing a deterministic learning algorithm to compute the\ntunable parameters. The simulations show that our interpretable model obtains\ncompetitive results when compared to state-of-the-art white and black-box\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 18:14:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:42:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 13:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

Groups are\nselected from COSMOS and SXDF, based on X-ray imaging and sparse spectroscopy.\nStellar mass ($M_{\\mathrm{stellar}}$) functions are computed for quiescent and\nstar-forming galaxies separately, based on their rest-frame $UVJ$ colours. From\nthese we compute the quiescent fraction and quiescent fraction excess (QFE)\nrelative to the field as a function of $M_{\\mathrm{stellar}}$. QFE increases\nwith $M_{\\mathrm{stellar}}$, similar to more massive clusters at $1<z<1.5$.\nThis contrasts with the apparent separability of $M_{\\mathrm{stellar}}$ and\nenvironmental factors on galaxy quiescent fractions at $z\\sim 0$.

Delay times appear to be\nhalo mass dependent, with a significantly stronger dependence required without\npre-processing.

The fundamental requirement of the method consists of setting a\nrelational system (D,S), where S and D are reflexive and transitive relations,\nrespectively, S should be compatible with the order of the set of classes, and\nD is a subset of S. An asymmetric preference relation P is defined from S.\nOther requirements are imposed on the actions which compose the limiting\nboundaries between adjacent classes, in such a way that each class is closed\nbelow and above. The paper proposes S-based and P-based assignment procedures.\nEach of them is composed of two complementary assignment procedures, which\ncorrespond through the transposition operation and should be used conjointly.\nThe methods work under several basic conditions on the set of limiting\nboundaries. Under other more demanding separability requirements, each\nprocedure fulfills the set of structural properties established for other\noutranking-based ordinal classification methods. Our proposal avoids the\nconflict between the required correspondence through the transposition\noperation and the assignment of limiting actions to the classes to which they\nbelong.

Here we discuss some intrinsic effects that limit the coherence in\nsuch a device and propose a scheme that overcomes these limitations and enables\na multi-pass guiding Sagnac interferometer with a Bose-Einstein condensate\n(BEC) on a chip in a ring potential. We analyze crucial dephasing effects:\npotential roughness, phase diffusion due to atom-atom interactions and number\nuncertainty, and phase fluctuations. Owing to the recent progress in achieving\nhigh momentum beam splitting, creating smooth guides, and manipulating the\nmatter-wavepacket propagation, guided interferometry can be implemented within\nthe coherence time allowed by phase diffusion. Despite the lower particle flux\nin a guided Sagnac ring and the miniaturization of the interferometer, the\nestimated sensitivity, for reasonable and practical realizations of an atom\nchip-based gyroscope, is comparable to that of free-space interferometers,\nreaching 45 nrads^{-1}Hz^{-1/2}. A significant improvement over\nstate-of-the-art free-space gyrocope sensitivities can be envisioned by using\nthermal atoms instead of a BEC, whereby the interferometer can be operated in a\ncontinuous fashion with the coherence limited by the scattering rate of the\natoms with the background gas. Taking into account the sensitivity times length\nof the interferometer as the figure of merit which takes into account\ncompactness, our configuration is expected to deliver a potential improvement\nof 2-4 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art free-space gyroscopes for a\nBEC, and 4-6 orders of magnitude for thermal atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 19:16:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 08:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

The core of modern social networks consists of\nrelatively few influential users, whose interest profiles are publicly\navailable, while the majority of peripheral users follow enough of them based\non common interests. Our approach is to predict the interests of the peripheral\nnodes starting from the interests of their influential connections. To this\nend, we need a formal model that explains how common interests lead to network\nconnections. Thus, we propose a stochastic interest formation model, the\nNearest Neighbor Influence Model (NNIM), which is inspired by the\nHegselmann-Krause opinion formation model and aims to explain how homophily\nshapes the network. Based on NNIM, we develop an efficient approach for\npredicting the interests of the peripheral users. At the technical level, we\nuse Variational Expectation-Maximization to optimize the instantaneous\nlikelihood function using a mean-field approximation of NNIM.

Therefore, a larger sample could allow us to make a\nsignificant step forward in our understanding of the Milky Way disk as a whole.\nWe present preliminary evidence that CCs favor: a spiral arm model with two\nmain arms (Perseus and Scutum-Centaurus) branching out into four arms at\ngalactocentric distances, $R_\\mathrm {GC}\\gtrsim5-6\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$; the\nextension of the Scutum-Centaurus arm behind the Galactic center; a possible\nconnection between the Perseus arm and the Norma tangency direction. The\ncurrent sample of CCs in the far side of the Galaxy are in the mid-plane,\narguing against the presence of a severely warped disk at small Galactocentric\ndistances ($R_\\mathrm {GC}\\lesssim12\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$) in the studied area. The\ndiscovery and characterization of CCs at near-IR wavelengths appears to be a\npromising tool to complement studies based on other spiral arm tracers and\nextend them to the far side of our Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 20:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

However, VM startup time has been\nlittle studied, and available measurement results performed previously did not\nconsider various configurations of VMs for modern cloud applications. In this\nwork, we perform comprehensive measurements and analysis of VM startup time\nfrom two major cloud providers, namely Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google\nCloud Platform (GCP).

Moreover, by comparing with\nprevious measurement results, we confirm that cloud providers (specifically\nAWS) made significant improvements for the VM startup times and currently have\nmuch quicker VM startup times than in the past.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 20:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

First, we establish new sharp\nquantitative estimates for Faber-Krahn inequalities on simply connected space\nforms. We prove that the gap between the first eigenvalue of a given set\n$\\Omega$ and that of the ball quantitatively controls both the $L^1$ distance\nof this set from a ball {\\it and} the $L^2$ distance between the corresponding\neigenfunctions: \\[ \\lambda_1(\\Omega) - \\lambda_1(B) \\gtrsim |\\Omega \\Delta B|^2\n+ \\int |u_{\\Omega} - u_B|^2, \\] where $B$ denotes the nearest geodesic ball to\n$\\Omega$ with $|B|=|\\Omega|$ and $u_\\Omega$ denotes the first eigenfunction\nwith suitable normalization.

On the round sphere and hyperbolic\nspace, the present results are the first sharp quantitative results with\nrespect to any distance; here the local portion of the analysis is based on new\nimplicit spectral analysis techniques.\n  Second, we apply these sharp quantitative Faber-Krahn inequalities in order\nto establish a quantitative form of the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman (ACF)\nmonotonicity formula. We show that the energy drop in the ACF monotonicity\nformula from one scale to the next controls how close a pair of admissible\nfunctions is from a pair of complementary half-plane solutions.

Specifically, while co-contribution (i.e. bipartite networks) are\noften investigated in online collaboration, the role of interpersonal\ncommunication in coordination of online peer-production is much less\ninvestigated. To address this gap we have reconstructed networks of personal\ncommunication (direct messaging) between Wikipedia editors gathered in so\ncalled Wikiprojects - teams of contributors who focus on articles within\nspecific topical areas. We found that effective projects exchange larger volume\nof direct messages and that their communication structure allows for complex\ncoordination: for sharing of information locally through selective ties, and at\nthe same time globally across the whole group. To verify how these network\nmeasures relate to the subjective perception of importance of group\ncommunication we conducted semi-structured interviews with members of selected\nprojects.

This includes both quantum annealing (QA) and the\nquantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). The target is to minimize\nthe energy of the final ``problem'' Hamiltonian $C$, for a time-dependent and\nbounded control schedule $s(t)\\in [0,1]$ and $t\\in \\mc{I}:= [0,t_f]$. It was\nrecently shown, in a purely closed system setting, that the optimal solution to\nthis problem is a ``bang-anneal-bang'' schedule, with the bangs characterized\nby $s(t)= 0$ and $s(t)= 1$ in finite subintervals of $\\mc{I}$, in particular\n$s(0)=0$ and $s(t_f)=1$, in contrast to the standard prescription $s(0)=1$ and\n$s(t_f)=0$ of quantum annealing. Here we extend this result to the open system\nsetting, where the system is described by a density matrix rather than a pure\nstate. This is the natural setting for experimental realizations of QA and\nQAOA. For finite-dimensional environments and without any approximations we\nidentify sufficient conditions ensuring that either the bang-anneal,\nanneal-bang, or bang-anneal-bang schedules are optimal, and recover the\noptimality of $s(0)=0$ and $s(t_f)=1$. However, for infinite-dimensional\nenvironments and a system described by an adiabatic Redfield master equation we\ndo not recover the bang-type optimal solution. In fact we can only identify\nconditions under which $s(t_f)=1$, and even this result is not recovered in the\nfully Markovian limit.

The entanglement of quantum many-body systems exhibits\ndifferent complex structures in different phases. It is a natural way to\ndistinguish different quantum phases by detecting different entanglement\nstructures. As a method that works directly on the detection of the\nentanglement structure, disentanglement can provide factual information on the\nentanglement structure. In this work, we follow a radically different approach\nto identifying quantum phases: we utilize disentanglement to determine the\nentanglement structures under different phases to distinguish the phases of\nIsing spin chain systems. Here, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach to finding phase transitions based on the performance of the\nRL-designed disentangling circuit. Further, our method uses limited local\noperations and one qubit measurement, making the quantum circuit scalable and\neasily extended to large-sized systems. We demonstrate the success of this\nmethod on the quantum phase transition in the transverse field Ising model\n(TFIM) and the XXZ model.

We\nstart from a regularized boundary element method and apply a small-slope\napproximation of the fault geometry. Making this assumption, it is possible to\nshow that the main effect of non-planar fault geometry is to change the normal\ntraction along the fault, which is controlled by the local curvature along the\nfault. We then convert this space--time boundary integral equation of the\nnormal traction into a spectral-time formulation and incorporate this change in\nnormal traction into the existing sBIEM methodology.

These signatures manifest locally as unmixed phase-spirals in\n$z$--$v_z$ space (\"snails-in-phase\") and globally as nonzero mean $z$ and $v_z$\nwhich wraps around as a physical spiral across the $x$--$y$ plane\n(\"snails-in-space\"). We explore the connection between these local and global\nspirals through the example of a satellite perturbing a test-particle Milky Way\n(MW)-like disk. We anticipate our results to broadly apply to any vertical\nperturbation.\n  Using a $z$--$v_z$ asymmetry metric we demonstrate that in test-particle\nsimulations: (a) multiple local phase-spiral morphologies appear when stars are\nbinned by azimuthal action $J_\\phi$, excited by a single event (in our case, a\nsatellite disk-crossing); (b) these distinct phase-spirals are traced back to\ndistinct disk locations; and (c) they are excited at distinct times. Thus,\nlocal phase-spirals offer a global view of the MW's perturbation history from\nmultiple perspectives.\n  Using a toy model for a Sagittarius (Sgr)-like satellite crossing the disk,\nwe show that the full interaction takes place on timescales comparable to\norbital periods of disk stars within $R \\lesssim 10$ kpc. Hence such\nperturbations have widespread influence which peaks in distinct regions of the\ndisk at different times.\n  This leads us to examine the ongoing MW-Sgr interaction. While Sgr has not\nyet crossed the disk (currently, $z_{Sgr} \\approx -6$ kpc, $v_{z,Sgr} \\approx\n210$ km/s), we demonstrate that the peak of the impact has already passed.\nSgr's pull over the past 150 Myr creates a global $v_z$ signature with\namplitude $\\propto M_{Sgr}$, which might be detectable in future spectroscopic\nsurveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 01:53:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

The standard\napproach to data-race detection is via dynamic analyses, which work over\nexecutions of concurrent programs, instead of the program source code. The rich\nliterature on the topic has created various notions of dynamic data races,\nwhich are known to be detected efficiently when certain parameters (e.g.,\nnumber of threads) are small. However, the \\emph{fine-grained} complexity of\nall these notions of races has remained elusive, making it impossible to\ncharacterize their trade-offs between precision and efficiency.\n  In this work we establish several fine-grained separations between many\npopular notions of dynamic data races. The input is an execution trace with $N$\nevents, $T$ threads and $L$ locks. Our main results are as follows. First, we\nshow that happens-before (HB) races can be detected in $O(N\\cdot \\min(T, L))$\ntime, improving over the standard $O(N\\cdot T)$ bound when $L=o(T)$. Moreover,\nwe show that even reporting an HB race that involves a read access is hard for\n2-orthogonal vectors (2-OV). This is the first rigorous proof of the\nconjectured quadratic lower-bound in detecting HB races. Second, we show that\nthe recently introduced synchronization-preserving races are hard to detect for\nOV-3 and thus have a cubic lower bound, when $T=\\Omega(N)$. This establishes a\ncomplexity separation from HB races which are known to be less expressive.\nThird, we show that lock-cover races are hard for 2-OV, and thus have a\nquadratic lower-bound, even when $T=2$ and $L = \\omega(\\log N)$. The similar\nnotion of lock-set races is known to be detectable in $O(N\\cdot L)$ time, and\nthus we achieve a complexity separation between the two. Moreover, we show that\nlock-set races become hitting-set (HS)-hard when $L=\\Theta(N)$, and thus also\nhave a quadratic lower bound, when the input is sufficiently complex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 02:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

First, given that there is no explicit\nand complete definition of pedestrian attribute recognition, we formally define\nand distinguish pedestrian attribute recognition from other similar tasks.\nSecond, based on the proposed definition, we expose the limitations of the\nexisting datasets, which violate the academic norm and are inconsistent with\nthe essential requirement of practical industry application. Thus, we propose\ntwo datasets, PETA\\textsubscript{$ZS$} and RAP\\textsubscript{$ZS$}, constructed\nfollowing the zero-shot settings on pedestrian identity. In addition, we also\nintroduce several realistic criteria for future pedestrian attribute dataset\nconstruction. Finally, we reimplement existing state-of-the-art methods and\nintroduce a strong baseline method to give reliable evaluations and fair\ncomparisons. Experiments are conducted on four existing datasets and two\nproposed datasets to measure progress on pedestrian attribute recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 03:12:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 08:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

Unlike prior\nmethods, we design a lightweight and plug-and-play joint relation extractor\n(JRE) to model the associative relationship between joints explicitly and\nautomatically. The JRE takes the pseudo heatmaps of joints as input and\ncalculates the similarity between pseudo heatmaps. In this way, the JRE\nflexibly learns the relationship between any two joints, allowing it to learn\nthe rich spatial configuration of human poses. Moreover, the JRE can infer\ninvisible joints according to the relationship between joints, which is\nbeneficial for the model to locate occluded joints.

Using a pair of\n56.4 Million quality factor (Q) Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguide ring-resonators, we\nreduce the free running Brillouin laser linewidth by over an order of magnitude\nto 330 Hz integral linewidth and stabilize the carrier to 6.5$\\times$10$^{-13}$\nfractional frequency at 8 ms, reaching the cavity-intrinsic thermorefractive\nnoise limit for frequencies down to 80 Hz. This work demonstrates the lowest\nlinewidth and highest carrier stability achieved to date using planar, CMOS\ncompatible photonic integrated resonators, to the best of our knowledge. These\nresults pave the way to transfer stabilized laser technology from the tabletop\nto the chip-scale. This advance makes possible scaling the number of stabilized\nlasers and complexity of atomic and molecular experiments as well as reduced\nsensitivity to environmental disturbances and portable precision atomic,\nmolecular and optical (AMO) solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 04:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

This is observed as topological Hall effect in a conventional Hall\nset-up. While this effect has been observed at the interface of TI/MI, where MI\nbeholds perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, non-trivial spin-textures that\ndevelop in interfacial MI with in-plane magnetic anisotropy is under-reported.\nIn this work, we study Bi$_2$Te$_3$/EuS hetero-structure using planar Hall\neffect (PHE). We observe planar topological Hall and spontaneous planar Hall\nfeatures that are characteristic of non-trivial in-plane spin textures at the\ninterface. We find that the latter is minimum when the current and magnetic\nfield directions are aligned parallel, and maximum when they are aligned\nperpendicularly within the sample plane, which maybe attributed to the\nunderlying planar anisotropy of the spin-texture. These results demonstrate the\nimportance of PHE for sensitive detection and characterization of non-trivial\nmagnetic phase that has evaded exploration in the TI/MI interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 04:21:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 07:28:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-24"}

Recently, it has also\nfound application in HIV prevention, substance abuse prevention, micro-finance\nadoption, etc., where the goal is to identify the set of peer leaders in a\nreal-world physical social network who can disseminate information to a large\ngroup of people.

Attention mapping is a key\ntechnology for human perceptual activity analysis or Human-Robot Interaction\n(HRI) to support human visual cognition; however, measuring human attention in\ndynamic environments is challenging owing to the difficulty in localizing the\nsubject and dealing with moving objects. To address this, we present a\ncomprehensive framework, 4D Attention, for unified gaze mapping onto static and\ndynamic objects. Specifically, we estimate the glasses pose by leveraging a\nloose coupling of direct visual localization and Inertial Measurement Unit\n(IMU) values. Further, by installing reconstruction components into our\nframework, dynamic objects not captured in the 3D environment map are\ninstantiated based on the input images. Finally, a scene rendering component\nsynthesizes a first-person view with identification (ID) textures and performs\ndirect 2D-3D gaze association. Quantitative evaluations showed the\neffectiveness of our framework. Additionally, we demonstrated the applications\nof 4D Attention through experiments in real situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 04:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

Videos given by endoscopy bring both richer\ncontextual information as well as more challenges than still images. The\ncamera-moving situation, instead of the common camera-fixed-object-moving one,\nleads to significant background variation between frames. Severe internal\nartifacts (e.g. water flow in the human body, specular reflection by tissues)\ncan make the quality of adjacent frames vary considerately. These factors\nhinder a video-based model to effectively aggregate features from neighborhood\nframes and give better predictions. In this paper, we present Spatial-Temporal\nFeature Transformation (STFT), a multi-frame collaborative framework to address\nthese issues. Spatially, STFT mitigates inter-frame variations in the\ncamera-moving situation with feature alignment by proposal-guided deformable\nconvolutions. Temporally, STFT proposes a channel-aware attention module to\nsimultaneously estimate the quality and correlation of adjacent frames for\nadaptive feature aggregation. Empirical studies and superior results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method. For example, STFT\nimproves the still image baseline FCOS by 10.6% and 20.6% on the comprehensive\nF1-score of the polyp localization task in CVC-Clinic and ASUMayo datasets,\nrespectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art video-based method by 3.6%\nand 8.0%, respectively.

This\npaper reveals novel geometric laws of optical flow based on the insight and\ndetailed definition of non-occlusion. Then, two novel loss functions are\nproposed for the unsupervised learning of optical flow based on the geometric\nlaws of non-occlusion. Specifically, after the occlusion part of the images are\nmasked, the flowing process of pixels is carefully considered and geometric\nconstraints are conducted based on the geometric laws of optical flow. First,\nneighboring pixels in the first frame will not intersect during the pixel\ndisplacement to the second frame. Secondly, when the cluster containing\nadjacent four pixels in the first frame moves to the second frame, no other\npixels will flow into the quadrilateral formed by them. According to the two\ngeometrical constraints, the optical flow non-intersection loss and the optical\nflow non-blocking loss in the non-occlusion regions are proposed. Two loss\nfunctions punish the irregular and inexact optical flows in the non-occlusion\nregions. The experiments on datasets demonstrated that the proposed\nunsupervised losses of optical flow based on the geometric laws in\nnon-occlusion regions make the estimated optical flow more refined in detail,\nand improve the performance of unsupervised learning of optical flow.

For\nreasons of simplicity and familiarity, nearly all quantum many-body\ncalculations have been performed on simple cubic lattices. Since the removal of\nlattice artifacts is often an important concern, it would be useful to perform\ncalculations using more than one lattice geometry. In this work we show how to\nperform quantum many-body calculations using auxiliary-field Monte Carlo\nsimulations on a three-dimensional body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice. As a\nbenchmark test we compute the ground state energy of 33 spin-up and 33\nspin-down fermions in the unitary limit, which is an idealized limit where the\ninteraction range is zero and scattering length is infinite. As a fraction of\nthe free Fermi gas energy $E_{\\rm FG}$, we find that the ground state energy is\n$E_0/E_{\\rm FG}= 0.369(2), 0.371(2),$ using two different definitions of the\nfinite-system energy ratio. This is in excellent agreement with recent results\nobtained on a cubic lattice \\cite{He:2019ipt}. We find that the computational\neffort and performance on a BCC lattice is approximately the same as that for a\ncubic lattice with the same number of lattice points.

A\nhigh-resolution CT scan of the paranasal sinuses of a 25-year-old, healthy\nfemale patient was segmented to create a three-dimensional nasal airway model.\nVirtual nasal adhesions of 2.5~mm diameter were added to various locations\nwithin the nasal cavity, representing common sites seen following NAO surgery.\nA series of models with single adhesions were created. CFD analysis was\nperformed on each model and compared with a baseline no-adhesion model,\ncomparing airflow and heat and mass transfer. The nasal adhesions resulted in\nno significant change in bulk airflow patterns through the nasal cavity.\nHowever, significant changes were observed in local airflow and mucosal cooling\naround and immediately downstream to the nasal adhesions. These were most\nevident with anterior nasal adhesions at the internal valve and anterior\ninferior turbinate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 07:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

In this paper, the\ndiscrete Boltzmann method based on non-equilibrium statistical physics is\nutilized to study the effects of the specific heat ratio on compressible RT\ninstability. The evolution process of the compressible RT system with different\nspecific heat ratios can be analyzed by the temperature gradient and the\nproportion of the non-equilibrium region. Firstly, as a result of the\ncompetition between the macroscopic magnitude gradient and the non-equilibrium\nregion, the average TNE intensity first increases and then reduces, and it\nincreases with the specific heat ratio decreasing; the specific heat ratio has\nthe same effect on the global strength of the viscous stress tensor. Secondly,\nthe moment when the total temperature gradient in y direction deviates from the\nfixed value can be regarded as a physical criterion for judging the formation\nof the vortex structure. Thirdly, under the competition between the temperature\ngradients and the contact area of the two fluids, the average intensity of the\nnon-equilibrium quantity related to the heat flux shows diversity, and the\ninfluence of the specific heat ratio is also quite remarkable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 07:47:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

For\nexample, the recent work (Ludeman et al., 2014) has demonstrated interesting\n'sneezing' dynamics of a freshwater sponge, when the sponge contracts and\nexpands to clear itself from surrounding polluted water. We derive the\nequations of motion for the dynamics of such an active porous media (i.e., a\ndeformable porous media that is capable of applying a force to itself with\ninternal muscles), filled with an incompressible fluid. These equations of\nmotion extend the earlier derived equation for a passive porous media filled\nwith an incompressible fluid. We use a variational approach with a Lagrangian\nwritten as the sum of terms representing the kinetic and potential energy of\nthe elastic matrix, and the kinetic energy of the fluid, coupled through the\nconstraint of incompressibility. We then proceed to extend this theory by\ncomputing the case when both the active porous media and the fluid are\nincompressible, with the porous media still being deformable, which is often\nthe case for biological applications. For the particular case of a uniform\ninitial state, we rewrite the equations of motion in terms of two coupled\ntelegraph-like equations for the material (Lagrangian) particles expressed in\nthe Eulerian frame of reference, particularly suitable for numerical\nsimulations, formulated for both the compressible media/incompressible fluid\ncase and the doubly incompressible case. We derive interesting conservation\nlaws for the motion, perform numerical simulations in both cases and show the\npossibility of self-propulsion of a biological organism due to particular\nrunning wave-like application of the muscle stress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 07:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

One of\nthe main issues in this task is how to handle the dramatic scale variations of\npedestrians caused by the perspective effect. To address this issue, this paper\nproposes a novel convolution neural network-based crowd counting method, termed\nPerspective-guided Fractional-Dilation Network (PFDNet). By modeling the\ncontinuous scale variations, the proposed PFDNet is able to select the proper\nfractional dilation kernels for adapting to different spatial locations. It\nsignificantly improves the flexibility of the state-of-the-arts that only\nconsider the discrete representative scales. In addition, by avoiding the\nmulti-scale or multi-column architecture that used in other methods, it is\ncomputationally more efficient. In practice, the proposed PFDNet is constructed\nby stacking multiple Perspective-guided Fractional-Dilation Convolutions (PFC)\non a VGG16-BN backbone. By introducing a novel generalized dilation convolution\noperation, the PFC can handle fractional dilation ratios in the spatial domain\nunder the guidance of perspective annotations, achieving continuous scales\nmodeling of pedestrians. To deal with the problem of unavailable perspective\ninformation in some cases, we further introduce an effective perspective\nestimation branch to the proposed PFDNet, which can be trained in either\nsupervised or weakly-supervised setting once the branch has been pre-trained.\nExtensive experiments show that the proposed PFDNet outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on ShanghaiTech A, ShanghaiTech B, WorldExpo'10,\nUCF-QNRF, UCF_CC_50 and TRANCOS dataset, achieving MAE 53.8, 6.5, 6.8, 84.3,\n205.8, and 3.06 respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 07:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

The following picture explains the observed \\dt in several TDEs\nas a consequence of the circularization and disk accretion processes as long as\nthe sub-Eddington accretion. At the beginning of the circularization, the\nfallback debris is thermalized by the self-crossing shock caused by\nrelativistic precession, providing the peak optical emission. During the\ncircularization process, the mass fallback rate decreases with time to form a\nring around the supermassive black hole (SMBH). The formation timescale\ncorresponds to the circularization timescale of the most tightly bound debris,\nwhich is less than a year to several decades, depending mostly on the\npenetration factor, the circularization efficiency, and the black hole mass.\nThe ring will subsequently evolve viscously over the viscous diffusion time. We\nfind that it accretes onto the SMBH on a fraction of the viscous timescale,\nwhich is $2$ years for given typical parameters, leading to X-ray emission at\nlate times. The resultant \\dt\\,is given by the sum of the circularization\ntimescale and the accretion timescale and significantly decreases with\nincreasing penetration factor to several to $\\sim10$ years typically. Since the\nX-ray luminosity substantially decreases as the viewing angle between the\nnormal to the disk plane and line-of-sight increases from $0^\\circ$ to\n$90^\\circ$, a low late-time X-ray luminosity can be explained by an edge-on\nview.

Their claim that previously\nonly `point coordinates' for nova/SN candidates were published, is fabricated.\nTheir estimate of expected nova detection rates is off by a factor of 10 due to\nmiscalculation.

When they\ndiscuss previously suggested identifications of historical novae, which they\nall doubt, they do not present new facts (Hoffmann 2019). Their catalog of `24\nmost promising events' for novae (Hoffmann et al. 2020) neglects important\nrecent literature (e.g. Pankenier et al. 2008 and Stephenson and Green 2009),\nthe claimed methods are not followed, etc. At least half of their short-list\ncandidates were and are to be considered comets.

In transient black-hole\nbinaries, a lot of mass stored in an accretion disk is suddenly drained to the\ncentral black hole because of thermal-viscous instability. This phenomenon is\ncalled an outburst and is observable at various wavelengths (Frank et al.,\n2002). During the outburst, the accretion structure in the vicinity of a black\nhole shows dramatical transitions from a geometrically-thick hot accretion flow\nto a geometrically-thin disk, and the transition is observed at X-ray\nwavelengths (Remillard, McClintock, 2006; Done et al., 2007). However, how that\nX-ray transition occurs remains a major unsolved problem (Dunn et al., 2008).\nHere we report extensive optical photometry during the 2018 outburst of\nASASSN-18ey (MAXI J1820$+$070), a black-hole binary at a distance of 3.06 kpc\n(Tucker et al., 2018; Torres et al., 2019) containing a black hole and a donor\nstar of less than one solar mass. We found optical large-amplitude periodic\nvariations similar to superhumps which are well observed in a subclass of\nwhite-dwarf binaries (Kato et al., 2009). In addition, the start of the stage\ntransition of the optical variations was observed 5 days earlier than the X-ray\ntransition. This is naturally explained on the basis of our knowledge regarding\nwhite dwarf binaries as follows: propagation of the eccentricity inward in the\ndisk makes an increase of the accretion rate in the outer disk, resulting in\nhuge mass accretion to the black hole. Moreover, we provide the dynamical\nestimate of the binary mass ratio by using the optical periodic variations for\nthe first time in transient black-hole binaries. This paper opens a new window\nto measure black-hole masses accurately by systematic optical time-series\nobservations which can be performed even by amateur observers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 08:54:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

A common approach to topic modeling is to\nassociate each topic with a probability distribution on the dictionary of words\nand to consider each document as a mixture of topics. Since the number of\ntopics is typically substantially smaller than the size of the corpus and of\nthe dictionary, the methods of topic modeling can lead to a dramatic dimension\nreduction.

The aim is to determine which physical components are traced by\ndifferent molecules at sub-arcsecond scales (100 - 400 au). We use a suite of\nAtacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) datasets in Band 6 (1 mm),\nBand 5 (1.8 mm) and Band 3 (3 mm) at spatial resolutions 0.5 - 3\" for 16\nprotostellar sources. The protostellar envelope is well traced by C$^{18}$O,\nDCO$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$, with the freeze-out of CO governing the chemistry at\nenvelope scales. Molecular outflows are seen in classical shock tracers like\nSiO and SO, but ice-mantle products such as CH$_3$OH and HNCO released with the\nshock are also observed. The molecular jet is prominent not only in SiO and SO\nbut also occasionally in H$_2$CO. The cavity walls show tracers of\nUV-irradiation such as C$_2$H c-C$_3$H$_2$ and CN. The hot inner envelope,\napart from showing emission from complex organic molecules (COMs), also\npresents compact emission from small molecules like H$_2$S, SO, OCS and\nH$^{13}$CN, most likely related to ice sublimation and high-temperature\nchemistry. Sub-arcsecond millimeter-wave observations allow to identify those\n(simple) molecules that best trace each of the physical components of a\nprotostellar system. COMs are found both in the hot inner envelope (high\nexcitation lines) and in the outflows (lower-excitation lines) with comparable\nabundances. COMs can coexist with hydrocarbons in the same protostellar\nsources, but they trace different components. In the near future, mid-IR\nobservations with JWST-MIRI will provide complementary information about the\nhottest gas and the ice mantle content, at unprecedented sensitivity and at\nresolutions comparable to ALMA for the same sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 09:20:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 14:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

The field work was carried out\nat Van Mijen Fjord on Svalbard, where a 3x4 m ice floe was sawed out in the\nfast ice. Wave motion was simulated by pulling the ice floe back and forth in\nan oscillatory manner in a 4x6 m pool, using two electrical winches. Ice floe\nmotion was measured with a range meter and accelerometers, and the water\nturbulence was measured acoustically with an acoustic Doppler current profiler\nand optically with a remotely operated vehicle and bubbles as tracers. TKE\nfrequency spectra were found to contain an inertial subrange where energy was\ncascading at a rate proportional to the -5/3 power law. The TKE dissipation\nrate was found to decrease exponentially with depth.

In this work, we first analyze the impact of image\nresolutions on face verification performance with a state-of-the-art face\nrecognition model. For images synthetically reduced to $5\\,\\times\\,5$ px\nresolution, the verification performance drops from $99.23\\%$ increasingly down\nto almost $55\\%$.

The\nperformances for particular testing image resolutions are slightly worse, but\nthe advantage is that this model can be applied to arbitrary resolution images\nand achieves an overall better performance ($97.72\\%$ compared to $96.86\\%$).\nDue to the lack of a benchmark for arbitrary resolution images for the\ncross-resolution and equal-resolution task, we propose an evaluation protocol\nfor five well-known datasets, focusing on high, mid, and low-resolution images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 11:30:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 11:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

This generalizes a conjecture by M. Riesz,\nand has e.g. the Mozzi-Chasles' theorem as its 3D Euclidean special case. To\ndemonstrate its utility, we briefly discuss various examples such as Lorentz\ntransformations, Wigner rotations, and screw transformations. The invariant\ndecomposition also directly leads to closed form formulas for the exponential\nand logarithmic function for all Spin groups, and identifies element of\ngeometry such as planes, lines, points, as the invariants of $k$-reflections.\nWe conclude by presenting novel matrix/vector representations for geometric\nalgebras $\\mathbb{R}_{pqr}$, and use this in E(3) to illustrate the\nrelationship with the classic covariant, contravariant and adjoint\nrepresentations for the transformation of points, planes and lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 11:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

The description of a\nmechanical system subject to a non-conservative force requires an external\nforce together with the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian function.

Let us call these two variables the causal and caused variables,\nrespectively. We shall assume that both variables are continuous and\none-dimensional. In this work we consider a procedure to transform each\nvariable, using transformations that are differentiable and strictly\nincreasing. We call these increasing transformations. Any causal relationship\n(as defined here) is associated with a channel capacity, which is the maximum\nrate that information could be sent if the causal relationship was used as a\nsignalling system. Channel capacity is unaffected when the two variables are\nchanged by use of increasing transformations. For any causal relationship we\nshow that there is always a way to transform the caused variable such that the\nentropy associated with the caused variable is independent of the value of the\ncausal variable. Furthermore, the resulting universal entropy has an absolute\nvalue that is equal to the channel capacity associated with the causal\nrelationship. This observation may be useful in statistical applications. Also,\nfor any causal relationship, it implies that there is a 'natural' way to\ntransform a continuous caused variable. We also show that, with additional\nconstraints on the causal relationship, a natural increasing transformation of\nboth variables leads to a transformed causal relationship that has properties\nthat might be expected from a well-engineered measuring device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 12:02:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 20:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

Here, we develop a fully deterministic model in\nwhich adhesive interactions are described by Lennard-Jones potential and the\nmaterial behaviour with the standard linear solid model. Normal\nloading-unloading cycles are carried out under different driving conditions.\nWhen loading is performed in quasi-static conditions and, hence, unloading\nstarts from a completely relaxed state of the material, the effective surface\nenergy is found to monotonically increase with the contact line velocity up to\nan asymptotic value reached at high unloading rates.

However, individual stream fits can be limited by\nsystematic biases. To study these individual stream systematics, we fit streams\nin Milky Way-like galaxies from FIRE cosmological galaxy formation simulations\nwith an analytic gravitational potential by maximizing the clustering of stream\nstars in action space. We show that for coherent streams the quality of the\nconstraints depends on the orbital phase of the observed stream stars, despite\nthe fact that the phase information is discarded in action-clustering methods.\nStreams on intermediate phases give the most accurate results, whereas\npericentre streams can be highly biased. This behaviour is tied to the amount\nof correlation present between positions and momenta in each stream's data:\nweak correlation in pericentre streams prohibits efficient differentiation\nbetween potentials, while strong correlation in intermediate streams promotes\nit.

The difference in elastic properties (sound\nvelocity) between Ge0.87Mn0.05Sb0.08Te and WC results in a high AIM that leads\nto a large interface thermal resistance (Rint) between the phases.

Additionally, this defense has low\noverhead and is easily implemented, allowing it to be used together with other\ndefenses across various model architectures.

Almost all existing works\nrely on item transition patterns, and neglect the impact of user historical\nsessions while modeling user preference, which often leads to non-personalized\nrecommendation. Additionally, existing personalized session-based recommenders\ncapture user preference only based on the sessions of the current user, but\nignore the useful item-transition patterns from other user's historical\nsessions. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Global\nGraph Neural Networks (HG-GNN) to exploit the item transitions over all\nsessions in a subtle manner for better inferring user preference from the\ncurrent and historical sessions. To effectively exploit the item transitions\nover all sessions from users, we propose a novel heterogeneous global graph\nthat contains item transitions of sessions, user-item interactions and global\nco-occurrence items. Moreover, to capture user preference from sessions\ncomprehensively, we propose to learn two levels of user representations from\nthe global graph via two graph augmented preference encoders. Specifically, we\ndesign a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) on the heterogeneous\nglobal graph to learn the long-term user preference and item representations\nwith rich semantics. Based on the HGNN, we propose the Current Preference\nEncoder and the Historical Preference Encoder to capture the different levels\nof user preference from the current and historical sessions, respectively.

Realistic\nand detailed environments are often omitted in order to concentrate on the\ninteraction possibilities within the application. Creating an accurate and\nrealistic virtual environment is not a task for laypeople, but for experts in\n3D design and modeling. To save costs and avoid hiring experts, panorama images\nare often used to create realistic looking virtual environments. These images\ncan be captured and provided by non-experts. Panorama images are an alternative\nto handcrafted 3D models in many cases because they offer immersion and a scene\ncan be captured in great detail with the touch of a button. This work\ninvestigates whether it is advisable to recreate an environment in detail by\nhand or whether it is recommended to use panorama images for virtual\nenvironments in certain scenarios. For this purpose, an interactive virtual\nenvironment was created in which a handmade 3D environment is almost\nindistinguishable from an environment created with panorama images. Interactive\nelements were added and a user study was conducted to investigate the effect of\nboth environments to the user. The study conducted indicates that panorama\nimages can be a useful substitute for 3D modeled environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 13:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

Recently, two works have been proposed\nto detect saliency ranking by assigning different degrees of saliency to\ndifferent objects. However, one of these models cannot differentiate object\ninstances and the other focuses more on sequential attention shift order\ninference. In this paper, we investigate a practical problem setting that\nrequires simultaneously segment salient instances and infer their relative\nsaliency rank order. We present a novel unified model as the first end-to-end\nsolution, where an improved Mask R-CNN is first used to segment salient\ninstances and a saliency ranking branch is then added to infer the relative\nsaliency. For relative saliency ranking, we build a new graph reasoning module\nby combining four graphs to incorporate the instance interaction relation,\nlocal contrast, global contrast, and a high-level semantic prior, respectively.\nA novel loss function is also proposed to effectively train the saliency\nranking branch. Besides, a new dataset and an evaluation metric are proposed\nfor this task, aiming at pushing forward this field of research. Finally,\nexperimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is more effective than\nprevious methods.

In particular, users should have the right to prohibit the use of\ntheir data for training machine learning systems, and to have it erased from\nalready trained systems. While several sample erasure methods have been\nproposed, all of them have drawbacks which have prevented them from gaining\nwidespread adoption. Most methods are either only applicable to very specific\nfamilies of models, sacrifice too much of the original model's accuracy, or\nthey have prohibitive memory or computational requirements. In this paper, we\npropose an efficient and effective algorithm, SSSE, for samples erasure, that\nis applicable to a wide class of machine learning models. From a second-order\nanalysis of the model's loss landscape we derive a closed-form update step of\nthe model parameters that only requires access to the data to be erased, not to\nthe original training set. Experiments on three datasets, CelebFaces attributes\n(CelebA), Animals with Attributes 2 (AwA2) and CIFAR10, show that in certain\ncases SSSE can erase samples almost as well as the optimal, yet impractical,\ngold standard of training a new model from scratch with only the permitted\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 14:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

Local\ninformation propagates in the system by creating complex correlations known as\ninformation scrambling, as this process prevents extracting the information\nfrom local measurements. In this work, we develop a model adapted from\nsolid-state NMR methods, to quantify the information scrambling. The scrambling\nis measured via time-reversal Loschmidt echoes (LE) and Multiple Quantum\nCoherences experiments that intrinsically contain imperfections. Considering\nthese imperfections, we derive expressions for out-of-time-order correlators\n(OTOCs) to quantify the observable information scrambling based on measuring\nthe number of active spins where the information was spread. Based on the OTOC\nexpressions, decoherence effects arise naturally by the effects of the\nnonreverted terms in the LE experiment. Decoherence induces localization of the\nmeasurable degree of information scrambling. These effects define a\nlocalization cluster size for the observable number of active spins that\ndetermines a dynamical equilibrium. We contrast the model's predictions with\nquantum simulations performed with solid-state NMR experiments, that measure\nthe information scrambling with time-reversal echoes with controlled\nimperfections. An excellent quantitative agreement is found with the dynamics\nof quantum information scrambling and its localization effects determined from\nthe experimental data.

This turns\nout to be unexpectedly delicate. We trace the difficulty back to a geometric\nobstacle: On a nonsmooth set, there may be sequences of points along which\nstandard measures of stationarity tend to zero, but whose limit points are not\nstationary. We name such events apocalypses, as they can cause optimization\nalgorithms to converge to non-stationary points. We illustrate this explicitly\nfor an existing optimization algorithm on bounded-rank matrices. To provably\nfind stationary points, we modify a trust-region method on a standard smooth\nparameterization of the variety. The method relies on the known fact that\nsecond-order stationary points on the parameter space map to stationary points\non the variety. Our geometric observations and proposed algorithm generalize\nbeyond bounded-rank matrices.

At\nthe beginning of the game, the Dealer holds a deck of $n$ cards (labeled $1,\n..., n$). For $n$ turns, the Dealer draws a card from the deck, the Guesser\nguesses which card was drawn, and then the card is discarded from the deck. The\nGuesser receives a point for each correctly guessed card. With perfect memory,\na Guesser can keep track of all cards that were played so far and pick at\nrandom a card that has not appeared so far, yielding in expectation $\\ln n$\ncorrect guesses.

The segmentation of these images provides a low-resolution\nrepresentation of cardiac anatomy, which may contain artefacts caused by\nmotion. Here we propose a novel latent optimisation framework that jointly\nperforms motion correction and super resolution for cardiac image\nsegmentations. Given a low-resolution segmentation as input, the framework\naccounts for inter-slice motion in cardiac MR imaging and super-resolves the\ninput into a high-resolution segmentation consistent with input. A multi-view\nloss is incorporated to leverage information from both short-axis view and\nlong-axis view of cardiac imaging. To solve the inverse problem, iterative\noptimisation is performed in a latent space, which ensures the anatomical\nplausibility. This alleviates the need of paired low-resolution and\nhigh-resolution images for supervised learning.

In the classical Two-Choice process a ball first queries the load\nof two randomly chosen bins and is then placed in the least loaded bin. In our\nsetting, each ball also samples two random bins but can only estimate a bin's\nload by sending binary queries of the form \"Is the load at least the median?\"\nor \"Is the load at least 100?\".\n  For the lightly loaded case $m=O(n)$, Feldheim and Gurel-Gurevich (2021)\nshowed that with one query it is possible to achieve a maximum load of\n$O(\\sqrt{\\log n/\\log \\log n})$, and posed the question whether a maximum load\nof $m/n+O(\\sqrt{\\log n/\\log \\log n})$ is possible for any $m = \\Omega(n)$. In\nthis work, we resolve this open problem by proving a lower bound of\n$m/n+\\Omega( \\sqrt{\\log n})$ for a fixed $m=\\Theta(n \\sqrt{\\log n})$, and a\nlower bound of $m/n+\\Omega(\\log n/\\log \\log n)$ for some $m$ depending on the\nused strategy.\n  We complement this negative result by proving a positive result for multiple\nqueries. In particular, we show that with only two binary queries per chosen\nbin, there is an oblivious strategy which ensures a maximum load of\n$m/n+O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ for any $m \\geq 1$. Further, for any number of $k =\nO(\\log \\log n)$ binary queries, the upper bound on the maximum load improves to\n$m/n + O(k(\\log n)^{1/k})$ for any $m \\geq 1$.\n  Further, this result for $k$ queries implies (i) new bounds for the\n$(1+\\beta)$-process introduced by Peres et al (2015), (ii) new bounds for the\ngraphical balanced allocation process on dense expander graphs, and (iii) the\nbound of $m/n+O(\\log \\log n)$ on the maximum load achieved by the Two-Choice\nprocess, including the heavily loaded case $m=\\Omega(n)$ derived by Berenbrink\net al.

The objective of this study is to evaluate\nthe hemodynamic effects of stent-graft introducer sheath during TEVAR. Three\nidealized representative diseased aortas of aortic aneurysm, coarctation of the\naorta, and aortic dissection were designed. Computational fluid dynamics\nstudies were performed in the above idealized aortic geometries. An introducer\nsheath routinely used in the clinic was virtually-delivered into diseased\naortas. Comparative analysis was carried out to evaluate the hemodynamic\neffects of the introducer sheath. Results show that the blood flow to the\nsupra-aortic branches would increase above 9% due to the obstruction of the\nintroducer sheath. The region exposed to high endothelial cell activation\npotential (ECAP) expands in the scenarios of coarctation of the aorta and\naortic dissection, which indicates that the probability of thrombus formation\nmay increase during TEVAR. The pressure magnitude in peak systole shows an\nobvious rise and a similar phenomenon is not observed in early diastole. The\nblood viscosity in the aortic arch and descending aorta is remarkably altered\nby the introducer sheath. The uneven viscosity distribution confirms the\nnecessity of using non-Newtonian models and high viscosity region with high\nECAP further promotes thrombosis.

These expert models are\ngeneralizable and require the calibration of a number of parameters to fit\nexperimental data. However, inherent pitfalls stemming from the restriction to\na specific functional form include poor fits to the data, non-uniqueness of\nfit, and high sensitivity to parameters. In this study we design and train\nfully connected neural networks as material models to replace or augment expert\nmodels. To guarantee objectivity, the neural network takes isochoric strain\ninvariants as inputs, and outputs the value of strain energy and its\nderivatives with respect to the invariants. Convexity of the material model is\nenforced through the loss function. Direct prediction of the derivative\nfunctions -- rather than just predicting the energy -- serves two purposes: it\nprovides flexibility during training, and it enables the calculation of the\nelasticity tensor through back-propagation. We showcase the ability of the\nneural network to learn the mechanical behavior of porcine and murine skin from\nbiaxial test data. Crucially, we show that a multi-fidelity scheme which\ncombines high fidelity experimental data with low fidelity analytical data\nyields the best performance. The neural network material model can then be\ninterpreted as the best extension of an expert model: it learns the features\nthat an expert has encoded in the analytical model while fitting the\nexperimental data better. Finally, we implemented a general user material\nsubroutine (UMAT) for the finite element software Abaqus and thereby make our\nadvances available to the broader computational community.

In the\ntopic of multi-label classification for medical code prediction, one\ninfluential paper conducted a proper parameter selection on a set, but when\nmoving to a subset of frequently occurring labels, the authors used the same\nparameters without a separate tuning. The set of frequent labels became a\npopular benchmark in subsequent studies, which kept pushing the state of the\nart.

As shown in experiment results, the model presented in\nthis study provides better performance than the persistence baseline and a\nConvolutional Bidirectional GRU network for the selected study area in\nshort-term streamflow prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 20:26:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

Inspired by the principle that a representative model is\nthe one simplest possible, a new model selection criteria considering both\nmodel's Parsimony and Sparsity is proposed. A Parsimony Enhanced Sparse\nBayesian Learning (PeSBL) method is developed for discovering the governing\nPartial Differential Equations (PDEs) of nonlinear dynamical systems. Compared\nwith the conventional Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) method, the PeSBL method\npromotes parsimony of the learned model in addition to its sparsity. In this\nmethod, the parsimony of model terms is evaluated using their locations in the\nprescribed candidate library, for the first time, considering the increased\ncomplexity with the power of polynomials and the order of spatial derivatives.\nSubsequently, the model parameters are updated through Bayesian inference with\nthe raw data. This procedure aims to reduce the error associated with the\npossible loss of information in data preprocessing and numerical\ndifferentiation prior to sparse regression. Results of numerical case studies\nindicate that the governing PDEs of many canonical dynamical systems can be\ncorrectly identified using the proposed PeSBL method from highly noisy data (up\nto 50% in the current study). Next, the proposed methodology is extended for\nstochastic PDE learning where all parameters and modeling error are considered\nas random variables. Hierarchical Bayesian Inference (HBI) is integrated with\nthe proposed framework for stochastic PDE learning from a population of\nobservations. Finally, the proposed PeSBL is demonstrated for system response\nprediction with uncertainties and anomaly diagnosis.

In\npractice this often means identifying a constant known as the doubling time,\ndescribing the time period over which the technology roughly doubles in some\nmeasure of performance or of performance per dollar. Moore's law is,\nclassically, the empirical observation that the number of electronic components\nthat can be put on a chip doubles every 18 months to 2 years. Today it is\nfrequently stated as the number of computations available per unit of cost.\nGeneralized to the appropriate doubling time, it describes the rate of\nadvancement in many technologies. A frequently noted competitor to Moore's law\nis known as Wright's law, which has aeronautical roots. Wright's law (also\ncalled power law, experience curve and Henderson's law) relates some quality of\na manufactured unit (for Wright, airplanes) to the volume of units\nmanufactured. The Wright's law equation expresses the idea that performance -\nprice or a quality metric - improves according to a power of the number\nproduced, or alternatively stated, improves by a constant percentage for every\ndoubling of the total number produced.\n  Does exploration of outer space conform to Moore's law or Wright's law-like\nbehavior? Our results below are broadly consistent with these laws. This is\ntrue for many technologies. Although the two laws can make somewhat different\npredictions, Sahal found that they converge to the same predictions when\nmanufacturing volume increases exponentially over time. When space exploration\ntransitions into an independent commercial sector, as many people hope and\nexpect, spacecraft technology will then likely enter an era of unambiguously\nexponential advancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 03:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

We approach this problem by training a compression\nmodel through human-in-the-loop learning as the user performs tasks with the\ncompressed images. The key insight is to train the model to produce a\ncompressed image that induces the user to take the same action that they would\nhave taken had they seen the original image.
