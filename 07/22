A solar pore was observed on the 1st\nSeptember 2019 using the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph for around one hour.\nFull-Stokes vectors were sampled in a 37 A window containing the Fe I 15648.52\nA line (effective Lande g-factor of 3). The LOS magnetic field strength is\ninferred using the strong-field approximation. The Stokes Inversion based on\nResponse functions code is used to gain a more complete understanding the\nproperties of the solar atmosphere at the locations of these oscillations.\nOscillations of more than 100 G are observed in the LOS magnetic field in the\nperiod window 600-1272 s at three localised (>1\"^2) regions. These oscillations\nhave coherence across individual regions indicating that jitter cannot account\nfor their occurrence. Longer-period amplitude variations, amplitudes over 200\nG, are also detected but these have periods outside of the cone-of-influence.\nNumerical inversions confirm both oscillations in the LOS magnetic field\nstrength at optical depths of around log-tau_5000=-0.5 (potentially caused by\ncompression) and other effects (e.g., changes in the optical depth or the\ninclination of the field) may account for these changes.

Linear optimization predicts an optimal growth for streamwse and\nspanwise wavenumbers $k_x = 1.2$, $k_z = - 1.75$, corresponding to the peak\nvalues of the premultiplied energy spectra of direct numerical simulations. At\ntarget time, the linear optimal perturbation is composed by oblique streaks,\nwhich, for a sufficiently large initial energy, induce turbulence in the whole\ndomain, due to the lack of spatial localization. When localization is achieved\nby adding nonlinear effects to the optimization, or by artificially confining\nthe linear optimal to a localized region in the spanwise direction, a\nlarge-scale flow is created, which leads to the generation of a localised\nturbulent band. These results suggest that inducing transition towards\nturbulent bands in a tilted domain, two main elements are needed: a linear\nenergy growth mechanism such as the lift-up for generating large-amplitude flow\nstructures which produce inflection points; large-scale vortices ensuring\nspatial localisation.

Based on this technique, we can\ngenerate a quantitative map of the pinning potential for the core, which we\nidentify as being governed by grain boundaries. Furthermore, we investigate the\neffects of pinning on the dynamic behavior of the vortex core using\nstroboscopic Lorentz microscopy, harnessing a new photoemission source that\naccelerates image acquisition by about two orders of magnitude. We find\ncharacteristic changes to the vortex gyration in the form of increased\ndissipation and enhanced bistability in samples with larger grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 17:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

The elusive nature\nindicates AFMs' unique properties: At large scale, due to the absence of global\nmagnetization, AFMs may appear to behave like any non-magnetic material;\nHowever, such a seemingly mundane macroscopic magnetic property is highly\nnontrivial at microscopic level, where opposite spin alignment within the AFM\nunit cell forms a rich internal structure. In topological AFMs, such an\ninternal structure leads to a new possibility, where topology and Berry phase\ncan acquire distinct spatial textures. Here, we study this exciting possibility\nin an AFM Axion insulator, even-layered MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ flakes, where spatial\ndegrees of freedom correspond to different layers. Remarkably, we report the\nobservation of a new type of Hall effect, the layer Hall effect, where\nelectrons from the top and bottom layers spontaneously deflect in opposite\ndirections. Specifically, under no net electric field, even-layered\nMnBi$_2$Te$_4$ shows no anomalous Hall effect (AHE); However, applying an\nelectric field isolates the response from one layer and leads to the surprising\nemergence of a large layer-polarized AHE (~50%$\\frac{e^2}{h}$). Such a layer\nHall effect uncovers a highly rare layer-locked Berry curvature, which serves\nas a unique character of the space-time $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric AFM\ntopological insulator state. Moreover, we found that the layer-locked Berry\ncurvature can be manipulated by the Axion field, E$\\cdot$B, which drives the\nsystem between the opposite AFM states. Our results achieve previously\nunavailable pathways to detect and manipulate the rich internal spatial\nstructure of fully-compensated topological AFMs. The layer-locked Berry\ncurvature represents a first step towards spatial engineering of Berry phase,\nsuch as through layer-specific moir\\'e potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 17:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

Naturally, such learning will be slow, but often new behaviors are\nnot completely unseen: they share subtasks with behaviors we have previously\nlearned. In this work, we aim to exploit this shared subtask structure to\nincrease the efficiency of demonstration-guided RL. We first learn a set of\nreusable skills from large offline datasets of prior experience collected\nacross many tasks. We then propose Skill-based Learning with Demonstrations\n(SkiLD), an algorithm for demonstration-guided RL that efficiently leverages\nthe provided demonstrations by following the demonstrated skills instead of the\nprimitive actions, resulting in substantial performance improvements over prior\ndemonstration-guided RL approaches.

The widespread\nsolar energetic particle (SEP) event was associated with a coronal mass\nejection (CME) that came from a region located near the far-side central\nmeridian from Earth's perspective. The CME erupted in two stages, and was\naccompanied by a late M-class flare observed as a post-eruptive arcade,\npersisting low-frequency (interplanetary) type II and groups of\nshock-accelerated type III radio bursts, all of them making this SEP event\nunusual. Aims: There are two main objectives of this study, disentangling the\nreasons for the different intensity-time profiles observed by the spacecraft,\nespecially at MESSENGER and STEREO-A locations, longitudinally separated by\nonly 15{\\deg}, and unravelling the single solar source related with the\nwidespread SEP event. Results: The solar source associated with the widespread\nSEP event is the shock driven by the CME, as the flare observed as a\npost-eruptive arcade is too late to explain the estimated particle onset. The\ndifferent intensity-time profiles observed by STEREO-A, located at 0.97 au, and\nMESSENGER, at 0.33 au, can be interpreted as enhanced particle scattering\nbeyond Mercury's orbit. The longitudinal extent of the shock does not explain\nby itself the wide spread of particles in the heliosphere. The particle\nincrease observed at L1 may be attributed to cross-field diffusion transport,\nand this is also the case for STEREO-B, at least until the spacecraft is\neventually magnetically connected to the shock when it reaches ~0.6 au.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 17:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

For Australia, we estimate the emission for each coal mine by\ndistributing the state-level reported total emissions using proxies of coal\nproduction and the coal basin-specific gas content profile of underground\nmines. Comparison of our total coal mine methane emission from India with\nexisting global inventories showed our estimates are about a factor 3 lower,\nbut well within the range of the national Indian estimate reported to the\nUnited Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC).

The AdaBoost Random Forest\nClassifier, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) distinguished the\nbaseline corrected Raman spectra of cancer EVs from those of healthy controls\n(18 spectra) with a classification accuracy of above 90 percent when reduced to\na spectral frequency range of 1800 to 1940 inverse cm and subjected to a 50:50\ntraining: testing split. FTIR classification accuracy on 14 spectra showed an\n80 percent classification accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that basic machine\nlearning algorithms are powerful applied intelligence tools to distinguish the\ncomplex vibrational spectra of cancer patient EVs from those of healthy\npatients. These experimental methods hold promise as valid and efficient liquid\nbiopsy for artificial intelligence-assisted early cancer screening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 19:56:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 15:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 15:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 16:14:36 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 19:03:29 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 21:11:38 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 15:45:58 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 18:54:27 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 04:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

When the mini-batch is raised at a geometric\n(polynomial) rate, the rate statement can be strengthened to a linear (suitable\npolynomial) rate while the oracle complexity of computing an\n$\\epsilon$-solution improves to $O(1/\\epsilon)$. Importantly, the latter claim\nallows for possibly biased oracles, a key theoretical advancement allowing for\nfar broader applicability.

In this study we developed an electrical resistivity tomography\ninversion algorithm that combines parametric and smooth inversion strategies.\nIn regions where the subsurface is well constrained, the model was\nparameterized with only a few variables, while the rest of the subsurface was\nparameterized with voxels. We tested this hybrid inversion strategy on two\nsynthetic models that contained a well constrained highly resistive or\nconductive near-surface horizontal layer and a target beneath.

PS, however, can result in poorly understood mortality. Here, a\npatient-specific geometrical multiscale model of PAH physiology and PS is\ndeveloped for a paediatric PAH patient with stent-based PS. In the model,\n7.6mm-diameter PS produces near-equalisation of the aortic and PA pressures and\nQp/Qs (oxygenated vs deoxygenated blood flow) ratio of 0.72 associated with a\n16% decrease of left ventricular (LV) output and 18% increase of RV output. The\nflow from LV to aortic arch branches increases by 16%, while LV contribution to\nthe lower body flow decreases by 29%. Total flow in the descending aorta (DAo)\nincreases by 18% due to RV contribution through the PS with flow into the\ndistal PA branches decreasing. PS induces 18% increase of RV work due to its\nlarger stroke volume pumped against lower afterload. Nonetheless, larger RV\nwork does not lead to increased RV end-diastolic volume. Three-dimensional flow\nassessment demonstrates the PS jet impinging with a high velocity and wall\nshear stress on the opposite DAo wall with the most of the shunt flow being\ndiverted to the DAo. Increasing the PS diameter from 5mm up to 10mm results in\nnearly linear decrease in post-operative Qp/Qs ratio. In conclusion, this model\nreasonably represents patient-specific haemodynamics pre- and post-creation of\nthe PS, providing insights into physiology of this complex condition, and\npresents a predictive tool that could be useful for clinical decision-making\nregarding suitability for reversed PS in PAH patients with drug-resistant\nsuprasystemic PAH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 21:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

In this\nframework, several evacuation assistants are established to observe the partial\ninformation of pedestrians' location and adjust the guiding signals of the\ndynamic guiding assistant systems. A simple on-off-based density control\nalgorithm is proposed for the evacuation assistants according to the delayed\ndata of the observed information (i.e., pedestrian densities in the observed\nregions near the corresponding exits). This paper provides strategic\nsuggestions on how to set the observed region and the target density by\ninvolving a force-driven cellular automaton model. It is observed that the\nproposed density control algorithm can control (positively affect) the global\ndistribution of the pedestrians' locations and suppress arching phenomena in\nthe evacuation process even using the observed partial information under time\ndelays. By imposing a moderate target density, the dynamic guiding assistant\nsystem also suppresses the triggers of collisions around the exits and avoids\ninefficiently separating the pedestrians.

Our results indicate that the\ncharge transport efficiency is nearly independent of contact position in the\nweak disorder regime, and is dramatically declined by the occurrence of a\nsingle base-pair mismatch between the source and the drain, in accordance with\nexperimental results [J.

Based on this observation, we propose a simple\nplug-in RandOm MApping (ROMA) strategy by randomly mapping samples into other\nspaces and enforcing these randomly projected samples to satisfy the same\ncorrelation requirement. The proposed ROMA strategy not only achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance in conjunction with the triplet-based loss, but\nalso can further effectively boost other SSL methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 02:06:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 06:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Despite its success, its critical schedule strategies are merely\nbased on training steps, ignoring the real-time model competence, which limits\nits potential performance and convergence speed. To address this issue, we\npropose confidence-aware scheduled sampling. Specifically, we quantify\nreal-time model competence by the confidence of model predictions, based on\nwhich we design fine-grained schedule strategies. In this way, the model is\nexactly exposed to predicted tokens for high-confidence positions and still\nground-truth tokens for low-confidence positions. Moreover, we observe vanilla\nscheduled sampling suffers from degenerating into the original teacher forcing\nmode since most predicted tokens are the same as ground-truth tokens.\nTherefore, under the above confidence-aware strategy, we further expose more\nnoisy tokens (e.g., wordy and incorrect word order) instead of predicted ones\nfor high-confidence token positions.

A volume of fluid\n(VOF) model based two-phase solver was developed with simplified Maxwell\nequations implemented in the open-source platform OpenFOAM\\textsuperscript. The\nnumerically obtained critical value for the linear stability matches well with\nthe theoretical values. To highlight the effect of the slip boundary at\ninterface, the deformation of the interface is ignored. A bifurcation diagram\nwith hysteresis loop linking the linear and finite amplitude criteria, which is\nUf = 0.059, was obtained in this situation. It is concluded that the lack of\nviscous effect at interface leads to a significant increase in the flow\nintensity, which is the reason for the smaller instability threshold in\ntwo-phase system. The presence of interface also changes the flow structure and\nmakes the flow vortices shift closer to the interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 03:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

This is possible because the quantum distance can capture the shape\nof the space formed by the Bloch wavefunctions as we sweep over the Brillouin\nzone. Therefore, if we minimize the volume of the space formed by the\nwavefunction through a continuous deformation, the wavefunctions will end up\nforming distinct spaces which depend on the topology of the wavefunctions.\nCombining this observation with the topological data analysis, which provides\ntools such as the persistence diagram to capture the topology of the space\nformed by the wavefunctions, we can cluster together Hamiltonians that give\nrise to similar persistence diagrams after the deformation. By examining these\nclusters as well as representative persistence diagrams in the clusters, we can\ndraw the phase diagram as well as distinguish between topologically trivial and\nnontrivial phases.

In this work, two GaN-diamond bonded\ncomposites are prepared via modified surface activated bonding (SAB) at room\ntemperature with silicon interlayers of different thicknesses (15 nm and 22\nnm). Before and after post-annealing process at 800 oC, thermal boundary\nconductance (TBC) across the bonded interface including the interlayer and the\nstress of GaN layer are investigated by time-domain thermoreflectance and Raman\nspectroscopy, respectively. After bonding, the 15 nm Si interlayer achieved a\nhigher TBC. The post-annealing significantly increased the TBC of both\ninterfaces, while the TBC of 22 nm silicon interlayer increased greater and\nbecame higher than that of 15 nm. Detailed investigation of the microstructure\nand composition of the interfaces were carried out to understand the difference\nin interfacial thermal conduction. The obtained stress was no more than 230 MPa\nfor both before and after the annealing, and this high thermal stability of the\nbonded composites indicates that the room temperature bonding can realize a\nGaN-on-diamond template suitable for further epitaxial growth or device\nprocess.

The adequate image quality\nof OCTA is the prerequisite for the subsequent quantification of retinal\nmicrovasculature. Traditionally, the image quality score based on signal\nstrength is used for discriminating low quality. However, it is insufficient\nfor identifying artefacts such as motion and off-centration, which rely\nspecialized knowledge and need tedious and time-consuming manual\nidentification. One of the most primary issues in OCTA analysis is to sort out\nthe foveal avascular zone (FAZ) region in the retina, which highly correlates\nwith any visual acuity disease. However, the variations in OCTA visual quality\naffect the performance of deep learning in any downstream marginally. Moreover,\nfiltering the low-quality OCTA images out is both labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming. To address these issues, we develop an automated computer-aided\nOCTA image processing system using deep neural networks as the classifier and\nsegmentor to help ophthalmologists in clinical diagnosis and research.

Adopting Sagdeev pseudopotential technique, and assuming a simple\nplasma model, it was shown that a slow moving offset bipolar pulse in the\nauroral region can be interpreted as an ion acoustic flat top solitary wave.\nThe proposed theory is a generic one and can easily be extended to a fast\nmoving one under an appropriate plasma model. One important characteristic of\nsuch structures is that they generally occur at the boundary of two different\nphases of nonlinear dynamical processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 07:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

Specifically, we define a notion that we call\nhigh-dimensional-expanding-system (HDE-system). This is a set system defined by\nincidence relations with certain high dimensional expansion relations between\nits sets. We say that a linear code is modelled over HDE-system, if the\ncollection of linear constraints that the code satisfies could by described via\nthe HDE-system. We show that a code that can be modelled over HDE-system is\nlocally testable.\n  This implies that high dimensional expansion phenomenon solely implies local\ntestability of codes. Prior work had to rely to local notions of local\ntestability to get some global forms of testability (e.g. co-systolic expansion\nfrom local one, global agreement from local one), while our work infers global\ntestability directly from high dimensional expansion without relying on some\nlocal form of testability.\n  The local testability result that we obtain from HDE-systems is, in fact,\nstronger than standard one, and we term it amplified local testability.\n  We further show that most of the well studied locally testable codes as\nReed-Muller codes and more generally affine invariant codes with single-orbit\nproperty fall into our framework. Namely, it is possible to show that they are\nmodelled over an HDE-system, and hence the family of all p-ary affine invariant\ncodes is amplified locally testable. This yields the strongest known testing\nresults for affine invariant codes with single orbit, strengthening the work of\nKaufman and Sudan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 07:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

We refer to this instability as ``coagulation\ninstability\" and regard it as a promising mechanism to concentrate dust\nparticles and assist planetesimal formation in the very early stages of disk\nevolution. Because of dust-density dependence of collisional coagulation\nefficiency, dust particles efficiently (inefficiently) grow in a region of\npositive (negative) dust density perturbations, which lead to a small radial\nvariation of dust sizes and as a result radial velocity perturbations. The\nresultant velocity perturbations lead to dust concentration and amplify dust\ndensity perturbations. This positive feedback makes a disk unstable. The growth\ntimescale of coagulation instability is a few tens of orbital periods even when\ndust-to-gas mass ratio is of the order of $10^{-3}$. In a protoplanetary disk,\nradial drift and coagulation of dust particles tend to result in dust\ndepletion. The present instability locally concentrates dust particles even in\nsuch a dust-depleted region. The resulting concentration provides preferable\nsites for dust-gas instabilities to develop, which leads to further\nconcentration. Dust diffusion and aerodynamical feedback tend to stabilize\nshort-wavelength modes, but do not completely suppress the growth of\ncoagulation instability. Therefore, coagulation instability is expected to play\nan important role in setting up the next stage for other instabilities to\nfurther develop toward planetesimal formation, such as streaming instability or\nsecular gravitational instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 08:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Existing techniques to enforce spatial\nsafety work broadly at either object or pointer granularity. Object-based\napproaches tend to incur high CPU overheads, whereas pointer-based approaches\nincur both high CPU and memory overheads. SGXBounds, an object-based approach,\nis so far the most efficient technique that provides complete out-of-bounds\nprotection for objects. However, a major drawback of this approach is that it\ncan't support address space larger than 32-bit.\n  In this paper, we present CGuard, a tool that provides object-bounds\nprotection for C applications with comparable overheads to SGXBounds without\nrestricting the application address space. CGuard stores the bounds information\njust before the base address of an object and encodes the relative offset of\nthe base address in the spare bits of the virtual address available in x86_64\narchitecture. For an object that can't fit in the spare bits, CGuard uses a\ncustom memory layout that enables it to find the base address of the object in\njust one memory access. Our study revealed spatial safety violations in the gcc\nand x264 benchmarks from the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite and the string_match\nbenchmark from the Phoenix benchmark suite. The execution time overheads for\nthe SPEC CPU2017 and Phoenix benchmark suites were 42% and 26% respectively,\nwhereas the reduction in the throughput for the Apache webserver when the CPUs\nwere fully saturated was 30%. These results indicate that CGuard can be highly\neffective while maintaining a reasonable degree of efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 09:09:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2021 04:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

For this, data structures that store pre-computed\ncell inverses of the Jacobian for all hierarchical levels and require only a\nreasonable amount of memory overhead are generated. The GMG method is built for\nthe \\emph{deal.II} finite element library.

The richness of information available in LFs\nhas enabled novel applications like post-capture depth-of-field editing, 3D\nreconstruction, segmentation and matting, saliency detection, object detection\nand recognition, and mixed reality. The efficacy of such applications depends\non certain underlying requirements, which are often ignored. For example, some\noperations such as noise-reduction, or hyperfan-filtering are only possible if\na scene point Lambertian radiator. Some other operations such as the removal of\nobstacles or looking behind objects are only possible if there is at least one\nray capturing the required scene point. Consequently, the ray distribution\nrepresenting a certain scene point is an important characteristic for\nevaluating processing possibilities. The primary idea in this paper is to\nestablish a relation between the capturing setup and the rays of the LF. To\nthis end, we discretize the view frustum. Traditionally, a uniform\ndiscretization of the view frustum results in voxels that represents a single\nsample on a regularly spaced, 3-D grid. Instead, we use frustum-shaped voxels\n(froxels), by using depth and capturing-setup dependent discretization of the\nview frustum. Based on such discretization, we count the number of rays mapping\nto the same pixel on the capturing device(s). By means of this count, we\npropose histograms of ray-counts over the froxels (fristograms). Fristograms\ncan be used as a tool to analyze and reveal interesting aspects of the\nunderlying LF, like the number of rays originating from a scene point and the\ncolor distribution of these rays. As an example, we show its ability by\nsignificantly reducing the number of rays which enables noise reduction while\nmaintaining the realistic rendering of non-Lambertian or partially occluded\nregions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 10:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

Their operating\nfrequency, however, is generally fixed once designed and fabricated. Here, we\npropose to overcome this limitation by utilizing soft topological phononic\ncrystals. In particular, we design a simple one-dimensional periodic system of\nsoft cylindrical waveguides to realize mechanically tunable topological\ninterface states for longitudinal waves. To this end, we employ the nonlinear\nelasticity theory and its linearized incremental version to fully account for\nboth geometric and material nonlinearities of the system. We derive the\ndispersion relation for small-amplitude longitudinal motions superimposed on\nthe finitely deformed state. In addition, our analytical results provide\ninformation about the corresponding Bloch wave modes, displacement field\ndistributions, and signal transmission coefficients for finite cylindrical\nwaveguides with identical or various unit-cell topologies. Our numerical\nresults illustrate the low-frequency topological interface state occurring at\nthe interface between two topologically distinct soft phononic cylinders.\nMoreover, we show that the corresponding frequency in the overlapped band gap\ncan be continuously adjusted by an external force. This analytical result is\nalso validated by the finite element simulations. Finally, we provide the\ntopological phase diagrams to demonstrate the tunable position and existence\ncondition of the topological interface states when tuning the external loading.\nThe low-frequency tunable topological interface states with remarkable field\nenhancement may find a wide range of potential applications such as tunable\nenergy harvesters, low-pass filters and high-sensitivity detectors for\nbiomedical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 11:25:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

One reason is the lack of market transparency and\nstakeholder's trust in the systems' performance as a consequence of poor use of\nTest and Evaluation (T&E) methods and transferability of the obtained T&E\nresults. The T&E 4Log (Test and Evaluation for Logistics) Framework was\ndeveloped to examine how the transferability of T&E results to practical\nscenarios in warehouse environments can be increased.

The application of the proposed framework in\nstandard and application-dependent test cases leads to a set of performance\ncriteria and corresponding application-specific requirements.

Once the flow rate exceeds a critical value in such\nflows, an elastic instability with fluctuating flow field is observed, which\nultimately transits to a more chaotic and turbulence-like flow structure as the\nflow rate further increases. In a recent study, it has been experimentally\nshown that this chaotic flow behaviour of viscoelastic fluids can be suppressed\nby increasing the geometric disorder in a model porous media consisting of a\nmicrochannel with several micropillars placed in it. However, the present\nnumerical study demonstrates that this is not always true. We show that it\ndepends on the initial arrangement of the micropillars for mimicking the porous\nmedia. In particular, we find that for an initial ordered and aligned\nconfiguration of the micropillars, the introduction of geometric order actually\nincreases the chaotic flow dynamics as opposed to that seen for an initial\nordered and staggered configuration of the micropillars. We suggest that this\nchaotic flow behaviour actually depends on the number of the stagnation points\nrevealed to the flow field where maximum stretching of the viscoelastic\nmicrostructure happens. Our findings and explanation are perfectly in line with\nthat observed and provided in a more recent experimental study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 12:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Thus far, however, there is\nno clear consensus on the microscopic origin underlying the spin-orbit torques\nobserved in these TMD/ferromagnet bilayers. To shine light on the microscopic\nmechanisms at play, here we perform thickness dependent spin-orbit torque\nmeasurements on the semiconducting WSe$_{2}$/permalloy bilayer with various\nWSe$_{2}$ layer thickness, down to the monolayer limit.

Three independent\ncases for sterile mass matrices are studied in both normal and inverted\nhierarchy mass ordering.

On the other hand, an extended multi Higgs\ndoublet model is studied in the scalar sector. Among the three Higgs doublet,\none of them does not acquire any vacuum expectation value (VEV); hence, it\nbehaves as an inert Higgs. The lightest component of this behaves as a viable\ndark matter candidate. Within MES, sterile mass can be stressed up to the $keV$\nscale. In the fourth chapter, we studied various phenomenologies considering\nsterile neutrino mass in the $keV$ range. This $keV$ scaled sterile neutrino\nalso plays the role of dark matter candidate in our study. The fifth chapter is\ndedicated to the texture-zero neutrino dark matter model.

DNNs can extract useful features, and so\nproduce a lower dimensional representation, which is more amenable to\nclustering techniques. As clustering is typically performed in a purely\nunsupervised setting, where no training labels are available, the question then\narises as to how the DNN feature extractor can be trained. The most accurate\nexisting approaches combine the training of the DNN with the clustering\nobjective, so that information from the clustering process can be used to\nupdate the DNN to produce better features for clustering. One problem with this\napproach is that these ``pseudo-labels'' produced by the clustering algorithm\nare noisy, and any errors that they contain will hurt the training of the DNN.\nIn this paper, we propose selective pseudo-label clustering, which uses only\nthe most confident pseudo-labels for training the~DNN.

A micromechanics-based model\nis proposed in which the field variables are linked to physical mechanisms at\nthe microcrack level: damage is related to the growth of microcracks, while\nplasticity is related to the frictional sliding of closed microcracks.\nConsequently, the hardening/softening functions and parameters entering the\nfree energy follow from the definition of a single degradation function and the\nelastic material properties. The evolution of opening microcracks in tension\nleads to brittle behavior and mode I fracture, while the evolution of closed\nmicrocracks under frictional sliding in compression/shear leads to ductile\nbehavior and mode II fracture. Frictional sliding is endowed with a\nnon-associative law, a crucial aspect of the model that considers the effect of\ndilation and allows for realistic material responses with non-vanishing\nfrictional energy dissipation. Despite the non-associative law, a variationally\nconsistent formulation is presented using notions of energy balance and\nstability, following the energetic formulation for rate-independent systems.\nThe material response of the model is first described, followed by the\nnumerical implementation procedure and several benchmark finite element\nsimulations. The results highlight the ability of the model to describe\ntensile, shear, and mixed-mode fracture, as well as responses with\nbrittle-to-ductile transition. A key result is that, by virtue of the\nmicromechanical arguments, realistic failure modes can be captured, without\nresorting to the usual heuristic modifications considered in the phase-field\nliterature. The numerical results are thoroughly discussed with reference to\nprevious numerical studies, experimental evidence, and analytical fracture\ncriteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 14:16:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 16:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-12"}

Using our\nmodel, we identify two important opportunities of TPV systems operating in the\nnear-field. First, we show analytically that enhancement of radiative\nrecombination is a natural consequence of operating in the near-field. Second,\nwe note that, owing to photon recycling and minimal radiation leakage in\nnear-field operation, the PV cell used in near-field TPV systems can be much\nthinner compared to those used in solar PV systems. Since non-radiative\nrecombination is a volumetric effect, use of a thinner cell reduces\nnon-radiative losses per unit area. The combination of these two opportunities\nleads to increasingly large values of Voc as the TPV vacuum gap decreases.\nHence, although operation in the near-field was previously perceived to be\nbeneficial for electrical power density enhancement, here, we emphasize that\nthin-film near-field TPVs are also significantly advantageous in terms of Voc\nand consequently conversion efficiency as well as power density.

There, however, are\na number of limitations identified in CNN models, such as limited\ninterpretability and high complexity, thus limiting their use in clinical\npractice. In this work, to address the limitations, we propose a lightweight\nand interpretable machine learning model, successive subspace learning with the\nsubspace approximation with adjusted bias (Saab) transform, for accurate and\nefficient segmentation from cine MRI. Specifically, our segmentation framework\nis comprised of the following steps: (1) sequential expansion of near-to-far\nneighborhood at different resolutions; (2) channel-wise subspace approximation\nusing the Saab transform for unsupervised dimension reduction; (3) class-wise\nentropy guided feature selection for supervised dimension reduction; (4)\nconcatenation of features and pixel-wise classification with gradient boost;\nand (5) conditional random field for post-processing. Experimental results on\nthe ACDC 2017 segmentation database, showed that our framework performed better\nthan state-of-the-art U-Net models with 200$\\times$ fewer parameters in\ndelineating the left ventricle, right ventricle, and myocardium, thus showing\nits potential to be used in clinical practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 14:50:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

It is shown that the friction factor correlations from the\nliterature, which primarily focus on larger conventional offset strip fin\ngeometries in the transitional flow regime, do not predict the correct trends\nfor laminar flow in micro-and mini-channels. Therefore, a new friction factor\ncorrelation for micro-and mini-channels with offset strip fin arrays is\nconstructed from an extensive set of numerical simulations through a\nleast-squares fitting procedure. The suitability of this new correlation is\nfurther supported by means of the Bayesian approach for parameter estimation\nand model validation.

It\nsimply claims that \"the coupling constants of a theory are tuned to one of the\nmulti-critical points, where some of the extrema of the effective potential are\ndegenerate.\" One of the simplest examples is the vanishing of the second\nderivative of the effective potential around a minimum. This corresponds to the\nso-called classical conformality, because it implies that the renormalized mass\n$m^2$ vanishes. More generally, the form of the effective potential of a model\ndepends on several coupling constants, and we should sweep them to find all the\nmulti-critical points. In this paper, we study the multi-critical points of a\ngeneral scalar field $\\phi$ at one-loop level under the circumstance that the\nvacuum expectation values of the other fields are all zero. For simplicity, we\nalso assume that the other fields are either massless or so heavy that they do\nnot contribute to the low energy effective potential of $\\phi$. This assumption\nmakes our discussion very simple because the resultant one-loop effective\npotential is parametrized by only four effective couplings. Although our\nanalysis is not completely general because of the assumption, it still can be\nwidely applicable to many models of the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism and its\ngeneralizations. After classifying the multi-critical points at low-energy\nscales, we will briefly mention the possibility of criticalities at high-energy\nscales and their implications for cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 14:53:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 05:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

FPC is a natural candidate for a power standard resorting to the\nmost basic definition of the watt -- energy, which is traceable to Planck's\nconstant $h$, emitted per unit of time.

In the equilibrium,\nanalytical solutions have been found for internal energy per particle and\ntemperature using standard procedures through statistical mechanics such as the\ncalculation of the partition function in the canonical ensemble and the\ncalculation of the number of microstates accessible in the microcanonical\nensemble. The results indicate that there is an equivalence of ensembles.\nAdditionally, we found the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) equilibrium distribution, which\ncoincides with the analytical results of the canonical and microcanonical\nensembles and molecular dynamics simulations. Then we focused on describing the\nQuasi-Stationary-States (QSS) present in this system, by means of molecular\ndynamics simulations. Two types of QSS states are found out of equilibrium. For\nits description, a combination of two techniques is used; the methods of\nmolecular dynamics and stationary solutions of the Vlasov equation associated\nwith the equations of motion of the system.

As a particularly straightforward one we propose to\ninclude parametrizations of self-energies based on explicit analytic one-loop\nexpressions. To exemplify this scheme we calculate the spectral functions of\npion and sigma meson of the $O(4)$ model at vanishing temperature in the broken\nphase. Comparing the results with those from previous aFRG calculations, we\nexplicitly demonstrate how self-consistency at all momenta fixes the tight\nrelation between particle masses and decay thresholds. In addition, the\ntwo-point functions from our new semi-analytic FRG scheme have the desired\ndomain of holomorphy built in and can readily be studied in the entire\ncut-complex frequency plane, on physical as well as other Riemann sheets. This\nis very illustrative and allows, for example, to trace the flow of the\nresonance pole of the sigma meson across an unphysical sheet. In order to\nassess the limitations due to the underlying one-loop structure, we also\nintroduce a fully self-consistent numerical scheme based on spectral\nrepresentations with scale-dependent spectral functions. The most notable\nimprovement of this numerically involved calculation is that it describes the\nthree-particle resonance decay of an off-shell pion, $\\pi^* \\to\n\\sigma\\pi\\to3\\pi$. Apart from this further conceptual improvement, overall\nagreement with the results from the considerably simpler semi-analytic one-loop\nscheme is very encouraging, however.

To achieve this goal, state-of-the-art methods typically\nemploy the convolution operator and the dense interaction modules such as\nnon-local blocks. However, these methods cannot accurately fit the diverse\nevents in videos. On the one hand, the adopted convolutions are with fixed\nscales, thus struggling with events of various scales. On the other hand, the\ndense interaction modeling paradigm only achieves sub-optimal performance as\naction-irrelevant parts bring additional noises for the final prediction. In\nthis paper, we propose a unified action recognition framework to investigate\nthe dynamic nature of video content by introducing the following designs.\nFirst, when extracting local cues, we generate the spatial-temporal kernels of\ndynamic-scale to adaptively fit the diverse events. Second, to accurately\naggregate these cues into a global video representation, we propose to mine the\ninteractions only among a few selected foreground objects by a Transformer,\nwhich yields a sparse paradigm. We call the proposed framework as Event\nAdaptive Network (EAN) because both key designs are adaptive to the input video\ncontent. To exploit the short-term motions within local segments, we propose a\nnovel and efficient Latent Motion Code (LMC) module, further improving the\nperformance of the framework.

Moreover, ablation studies demonstrate that\nthe adoption of the calendar of days to be forecasted contributes to the\nforecasting performance of the proposed Tsformer.

Here, I revisit de Broglie's idea and demonstrate that a special extreme\ncase of classical mechanics yields in a natural way time-crystal type dynamics.\nRemarkably, it is found that time-crystal particles are characterized by a spin\n4-vector that has a purely kinematic origin and is determined by the binormal\nof the velocity trajectory in the Bloch sphere. The dynamics of time-crystal\nparticles is ruled by a generalized least action principle, such that the\nparticle dynamically probes the nearby space and moves on average towards the\ndirection that minimizes the action.

Now we show that it can be done\nintuitionistically, with the aid of the Church counting axiom. We also prove,\nwithout the aid of the counting axiom, that if the set of Church numbers is not\nfinite, then it is infinite, and Church successor is one-to-one. Consequently,\nHeyting's arithmetic is interpretable in INF plus the Church counting axiom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 21:16:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 06:52:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 21:05:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 19:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}
