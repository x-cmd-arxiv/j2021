As universities prepare to re-start in-class activities, students'\nadherence to physical distancing requirements is a priority topic. While\nphysical distancing in classrooms can be easily managed, the movement of\nstudents inside common spaces can pose higher risks due to individuals'\nproximity. This paper provides an experimental analysis of unidirectional\nstudent flow inside a case-study university building, by investigating\nstudents' movements and grouping behaviour according to physical distancing\nrequirements. Results show general adherence with the minimum required physical\ndistancing guidance, but some spaces, such as corridors, pose higher exposure\nthan doorways. Their width, in combination with group behaviour, affects the\nstudents' capacity to keep the recommended distance. Furthermore, students\nreport higher perceived vulnerability while moving along corridors.\nEvidence-based results can support decision-makers in understanding\nindividuals' exposure in universities and researchers in developing behavioural\nmodels in preparation of future outbreaks and pandemics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 16:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

The agent can either report his prior prediction or access a\ncostly signal and report the posterior prediction. Given a collection of\npossible distributions containing the agent's posterior prediction\ndistribution, the principal's objective is to design a bounded scoring rule to\nmaximize the agent's worst-case payoff increment between reporting his\nposterior prediction and reporting his prior prediction.\n  We study two settings of such optimization for proper scoring rules: static\nand asymptotic settings. In the static setting, where the agent can access one\nsignal, we propose an efficient algorithm to compute an optimal scoring rule\nwhen the collection of distributions is finite. The agent can adaptively and\nindefinitely refine his prediction in the asymptotic setting. We first consider\na sequence of collections of posterior distributions with vanishing covariance,\nwhich emulates general estimators with large samples, and show the optimality\nof the quadratic scoring rule. Then, when the agent's posterior distribution is\na Beta-Bernoulli process, we find that the log scoring rule is optimal. We also\nprove the optimality of the log scoring rule over a smaller set of functions\nfor categorical distributions with Dirichlet priors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 16:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

By placing our analysis in the context of an indoor OWC IoT uplink\nsetup, and employing the standard OWC channel model, we investigate the\ntrade-offs between the reliability and the OWC system parameters such as the\ncell area or the transmitter's semi-angle. We obtain valuable insights into the\ndesign of an SA-based random access solution for a typical indoor OWC cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 16:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

Using archival spectroscopic, photometric,\nand temporal data for the archetypal dusty star, Mira, we identify its\ncircumstellar silicate dust grains. This is achieved by matching the positions\nand widths of observed spectral features with laboratory data. To do this\ncomparison properly, it is necessary to account for the continuum emission.\nHere we investigate various ways in which a continuum is eliminated from\nobservational spectra and how it affects the interpretation of spectral\nfeatures.

It is\nimportant to understand what contributes to the spectrum in order to remove the\ncontinuum in a way that allows comparison with laboratory spectra of candidate\ndust species. Our methodologies are applicable to optically thin systems, like\nthat of Mira. Higher optical depths will require RT modeling, which cannot\ninclude many different potential astrominerals because there is a lack of\ncomplex refractive indices.

However,\nconsidering different features of their Tanner graph, such as short cycles,\ngirth and other graphical structures, is harder than for Tanner graphs from\nsingle-edge protographs. In this paper, we provide a novel approach to\nconstruct the parity-check matrix of an LDPC code which is based on trades\nobtained from block designs. We employ our method to construct two important\ncategories of LDPC codes; quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC and spatially-coupled LDPC\n(SC-LDPC) codes.\n  We use those trade-based matrices to define base matrices of multiple-edge\nprotographs. The construction of exponent matrices corresponding to these base\nmatrices has less complexity compared to the ones proposed in the literature.\nWe prove that these base matrices result in QC-LDPC codes with smaller lower\nbounds on the lifting degree than existing ones.\n  There are three categories of SC-LDPC codes: periodic, time-invariant and\ntime-varying. Constructing the parity-check matrix of the third one is more\ndifficult because of the time dependency in the parity-check matrix. We use a\ntrade-based matrix to obtain the parity-check matrix of a time-varying SC-LDPC\ncode in which each downwards row displacement of the trade-based matrix yields\nsyndrome matrices of a particular time. Combining the different row shifts the\nwhole parity-check matrix is obtained.\n  Our proposed method to construct parity-check and base matrices from trade\ndesigns is applicable to any type of super-simple directed block designs.

This paper reviews two\nnonlinear, non-Gaussian extensions of the Ensemble Kalman Filter: Gaussian\nanamorphosis (GA) methods and two-step updates, of which the rank histogram\nfilter (RHF) is a prototypical example. GA-EnKF methods apply univariate\ntransforms to the state and observation variables to make their distribution\nmore Gaussian before applying an EnKF. The two-step methods use a scalar\nBayesian update for the first step, followed by linear regression for the\nsecond step. The connection of the two-step framework to the full Bayesian\nproblem is made, which opens the door to more advanced two-step methods in the\nfull Bayesian setting. A new method for the first part of the two-step\nframework is proposed, with a similar form to the RHF but a different\nmotivation, called the `improved RHF' (iRHF). A suite of experiments with the\nLorenz-`96 model demonstrate situations where the GA-EnKF methods are similar\nto EnKF, and where they outperform EnKF. The experiments also strongly support\nthe accuracy of the RHF and iRHF filters for nonlinear and non-Gaussian\nobservations; these methods uniformly beat the EnKF and GA-EnKF methods in the\nexperiments reported here. The new iRHF method is only more accurate than RHF\nat small ensemble sizes in the experiments reported here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 17:23:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:28:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

Randomized\nsketching has emerged as a powerful technique for constructing estimates of the\nHessian which can be used to perform approximate Newton steps. This involves\nmultiplication by a random sketching matrix, which introduces a trade-off\nbetween the computational cost of sketching and the convergence rate of the\noptimization algorithm. A theoretically desirable but practically much too\nexpensive choice is to use a dense Gaussian sketching matrix, which produces\nunbiased estimates of the exact Newton step and which offers strong\nproblem-independent convergence guarantees. We show that the Gaussian sketching\nmatrix can be drastically sparsified, significantly reducing the computational\ncost of sketching, without substantially affecting its convergence properties.\nThis approach, called Newton-LESS, is based on a recently introduced sketching\ntechnique: LEverage Score Sparsified (LESS) embeddings. We prove that\nNewton-LESS enjoys nearly the same problem-independent local convergence rate\nas Gaussian embeddings, not just up to constant factors but even down to lower\norder terms, for a large class of optimization tasks.

Since\nthe useful data is correlated with the private data $X$, the agent employs a\nprivacy mechanism to generate data $U$ that can be released. We study the\nprivacy mechanism design that maximizes the revealed information about $Y$\nwhile satisfying a strong $\\ell_1$-privacy criterion. When a sufficiently small\nleakage is allowed, we show that the optimizer vectors of the privacy mechanism\ndesign problem have a specific geometry, i.e., they are perturbations of fixed\nvector distributions. This geometrical structure allows us to use a local\napproximation of the conditional entropy. By using this approximation the\noriginal optimization problem can be reduced to a linear program so that an\napproximate solution for privacy mechanism can be easily obtained. The main\ncontribution of this work is to consider non-zero leakage with a non-invertible\nleakage matrix. In an example inspired by water mark application, we first\ninvestigate the accuracy of the approximation. Then, we employ different\nmeasures for utility and privacy leakage to compare the privacy-utility\ntrade-off using our approach with other methods.

It enables a new type of\nphoton-induced near-field electron microscopy, mapping local optical near\nfields around nanoparticles with exquisite spatial and spectral resolution and\nlies at the heart of quantum state manipulation and attosecond pulse shaping of\nfree electrons. The corresponding interaction of optical near fields with slow\nelectrons has achieved much less attention, even though the lower electron\nvelocity may enhance electron-near-field coupling for small nanoparticles. A\nfirst-principle theoretical study of such interactions has been reported very\nrecently [N. Talebi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 080401 (2020)]. Building up on this\nwork, we investigate, both analytically and numerically, the inelastic\nscattering of slow electrons by near fields of small nanostructures. For weak\nfields, this results in distinct angular diffraction patterns that represent,\nto first order, the Fourier transform of the transverse variation of the scalar\nnear-field potential along the direction perpendicular to the electron\npropagation. For stronger fields, scattering by the near-field component along\nthe electron trajectory results in a break-up of the energy spectrum into\nmultiple photon orders. Their angular diffraction patterns are given by integer\npowers of the Fourier transform of the transverse potential variation and are\nshifting in phase with photon order. Our analytical model offers an efficient\napproach for studying the effects of electron kinetic energy, near field shape\nand strength on the diffraction and thus may facilitate the experimental\nobservation of these phenomena by, e.g., ultrafast low-energy point-projection\nmicroscopy or related techniques.

To shed light on this\nproblem, various Gedankenexperiments have been proposed. One popular example is\nan interference experiment with a massive system that interacts gravitationally\nwith another distant system, where an apparent paradox arises: even for\nspace-like separation the outcome of the interference experiment depends on\nactions on the distant system, leading to a violation of either complementarity\nor no-signalling. A recent resolution shows that the paradox is avoided when\nquantizing gravitational radiation and including quantum fluctuations of the\ngravitational field. Here we show that the paradox in question can also be\nresolved without considering gravitational radiation, relying only on the\nPlanck length as a limit on spatial resolution. Therefore, in contrast to\nconclusions previously drawn, we find that the necessity for a quantum field\ntheory of gravity does not follow from so far considered Gedankenexperiments of\nthis type. In addition, we point out that in the common realization of the\nsetup the effects are governed by the mass octopole rather than the quadrupole.\nOur results highlight that no Gedankenexperiment to date compels a quantum\nfield theory of gravity, in contrast to the electromagnetic case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 09:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

The accumulation of many stellar-mass black\nholes (BHs) embedded in AGN gas eventually displaces radiation, winds and\nsupernovae from massive stars as the dominant feedback source. The nonlocality\nof feedback heating, in combination with the need for heat to efficiently mix\nthroughout the gas, gives rise to steady-state AGN solutions that can have Q>>1\nand no ongoing star formation.

These planets can still exert dynamical\ninfluence on known planets and have such influence exerted upon them in turn.\nIn certain configurations, this influence can destabilize the system; in\nothers, the star's gravitational influence can instead further stabilize the\nsystem. For example, in systems with planets close to the host star, effects\narising from general relativity can help to stabilize the configuration. We\nderive criteria for hidden planets orbiting both beyond and within known\nplanets that quantify how strongly general relativistic effects can stabilize\nsystems that would otherwise be unstable. As a proof-of-concept, we investigate\nthe several planets in a system based on Kepler 56, and show that the outermost\nplanet will not disrupt the system even at high eccentricities, and show that\nan Earth-radius planet could be stable within this system if it orbits below\n0.08 au. Furthermore, we provide specific predictions to known observed systems\nby constraining the parameter space of possible hidden planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 18:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 19:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Their dimension reducing nature alleviates the problems\nassociated with visualising high dimensional datasets, enabling improved\nunderstanding of design spaces and potentially providing valuable physical\ninsights.\n  The proposed framework is computationally efficient; consisting of either\nreadily parallelisable tasks, or linear algebra operations. To further reduce\nthe computational cost, ridge functions need only be computed at only a small\nnumber of subsampled locations.

Our\nmultivariate COM-Poisson (MultCOMP) model has desirable features such as (i) it\nadmits a flexible covariance matrix allowing for both negative and positive\nnon-diagonal entries; (ii) it overcomes the limitation of the existing\nbivariate COM-Poisson distributions in the literature that do not have\nCOM-Poisson marginals; (iii) it allows for the analysis of multivariate counts\nand is not just limited to bivariate counts. Inferential challenges are\npresented by the likelihood specification as it depends on a number of\nintractable normalizing constants involving the model parameters. These\nobstacles motivate us to propose a Bayesian inferential approach where the\nresulting doubly-intractable posterior is dealt with via the exchange algorithm\nand the Grouped Independence Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Numerical\nexperiments based on simulations are presented to illustrate the proposed\nBayesian approach. We analyze the potential of the MultCOMP model through a\nreal data application on the numbers of goals scored by the home and away teams\nin the Premier League from 2018 to 2021. Here, our interest is to assess the\neffect of a lack of crowds during the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-known home\nteam advantage. A MultCOMP model fit shows that there is evidence of a\ndecreased number of goals scored by the home team, not accompanied by a reduced\nscore from the opponent. Hence, our analysis suggests a smaller home team\nadvantage in the absence of crowds, which agrees with the opinion of several\nfootball experts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 18:48:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-19"}

Aims: We aim to constrain the input\nphysics of accretion on protostellar seeds with observed spectroscopic\nparameters and stellar pulsations of young stellar objects and pre-main\nsequence stars.

Its\npresence can cause traditional and modern model selection methods to fail\nbecause such procedures commonly presume that each potential parameter is\nequally worthy of entering into the final model - we call this presumption\n\"covariate equipoise\". However, this presumption does not always hold,\nespecially in the presence of derived variables.

For example, in bioinformatics, they are crucial for\nanalyses of single-cell data such as mass cytometry (CyTOF) data. Some of the\nmost effective algorithms for clustering HD data are based on representing the\ndata by nodes in a graph, with edges connecting neighbouring nodes according to\nsome measure of similarity or distance. However, users of graph-based\nalgorithms are typically faced with the critical but challenging task of\nchoosing the value of an input parameter that sets the size of neighbourhoods\nin the graph, e.g. the number of nearest neighbours to which to connect each\nnode or a threshold distance for connecting nodes. The burden on the user could\nbe alleviated by a measure of inter-node similarity that can have value 0 for\ndissimilar nodes without requiring any user-defined parameters or thresholds.\nThis would determine the neighbourhoods automatically while still yielding a\nsparse graph. To this end, I propose a new method called ASTRICS to measure\nsimilarity between clusters of HD data points based on local dimensionality\nreduction and triangulation of critical alpha shapes. I show that my ASTRICS\nsimilarity measure can facilitate both clustering and visualization of HD data\nby using it in Stage 2 of a three-stage pipeline: Stage 1 = perform an initial\nclustering of the data by any method; Stage 2 = let graph nodes represent\ninitial clusters instead of individual data points and use ASTRICS to\nautomatically define edges between nodes; Stage 3 = use the graph for further\nclustering and visualization. This trades the critical task of choosing a graph\nneighbourhood size for the easier task of essentially choosing a resolution at\nwhich to view the data. The graph and consequently downstream clustering and\nvisualization are then automatically adapted to the chosen resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 20:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-19"}

In\nthis paper, we train a random forest classification model on a set of\nforward-modeled observable quantities, namely the emission measure slope, the\npeak temperature of the emission measure distribution, and the time lag and\nmaximum cross-correlation between multiple pairs of AIA channels.

Importantly, other than the knowledge of channel\ncorrelation matrices, we make no assumption as to the structure of the channel.\nTo address the limitation in the number of RF chains, we employ hybrid\nbeamforming, comprising a low dimensional digital beamformer followed by an\nanalog beamformer implemented using phase shifters. Since there is no dedicated\nRF chain per transmitter/receiver antenna, the conventional channel estimation\ntechniques for fully-digital systems are impractical. By exploiting the fact\nthat the channel entries are uncorrelated in its eigen-domain, we seek to\nestimate the channel entries in this domain. Due to the limited number of RF\nchains, channel estimation is typically performed in multiple time slots. Under\na total energy budget, we aim to design the hybrid transmit beamformer\n(precoder) and the receive beamformer (combiner) in each training time slot, in\norder to estimate the channel using the minimum mean squared error criterion.\nTo this end, we choose the precoder and combiner in each time slot such that\nthey are aligned to transmitter and receiver eigen-directions, respectively.\nFurther, we derive a water-filling-type expression for the optimal energy\nallocation at each time slot. This expression illustrates that, with a low\ntraining energy budget, only significant components of the channel need to be\nestimated. In contrast, with a large training energy budget, the energy is\nalmost equally distributed among all eigen-directions.

For these applications it typically suffices to compute convolutions\nof nonnegative vectors. This problem can be classically solved in time $O(n\\log\nn)$ using the Fast Fourier Transform.\n  However, often the involved vectors are sparse and hence one could hope for\noutput-sensitive algorithms to compute nonnegative convolutions. This question\nwas raised by Muthukrishnan and solved by Cole and Hariharan (STOC '02) by a\nrandomized algorithm running in near-linear time in the (unknown) output-size\n$t$.

Although\na phoneme classifier can be used for KWS, exploiting a large amount of\ntranscribed data for automatic speech recognition (ASR), there is a mismatch\nbetween the training criterion (phoneme recognition) and the target task (KWS).\nRecently, multi-task learning has been applied to KWS to exploit both ASR and\nKWS training data. In this approach, an output of an acoustic model is split\ninto two branches for the two tasks, one for phoneme transcription trained with\nthe ASR data and one for keyword classification trained with the KWS data. In\nthis paper, we introduce a cross attention decoder in the multi-task learning\nframework. Unlike the conventional multi-task learning approach with the simple\nsplit of the output layer, the cross attention decoder summarizes information\nfrom a phonetic encoder by performing cross attention between the encoder\noutputs and a trainable query sequence to predict a confidence score for the\nKWS task. Experimental results on KWS tasks show that the proposed approach\nachieves a 12% relative reduction in the false reject ratios compared to the\nconventional multi-task learning with split branches and a bi-directional long\nshort-team memory decoder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 22:38:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 17:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

In this paper, we introduce a contrastive loss\nto ALign the image and text representations BEfore Fusing (ALBEF) them through\ncross-modal attention, which enables more grounded vision and language\nrepresentation learning. Unlike most existing methods, our method does not\nrequire bounding box annotations nor high-resolution images.

Proper peak identification and alignment across\ndifferent chromatograms is critical prior to any subsequent analysis. This work\nintroduces a peak identification method called retention time trajectory (RTT)\nmatching, which uses chromatographic retention times as the only input and\nidentifies peaks associated with any subset of a predefined set of target\ncompounds. RTT matching is also capable of reporting interferents. An RTT is a\n2-dimensional (2D) curve formed uniquely by the retention times of the\nchromatographic peaks. The RTTs obtained from the chromatogram of a test sample\nand of pre-characterized library are matched and statistically compared. The\nbest matched pair implies identification.

Based on the\nexperimentally characterized RTT, an RTT hybridization method is developed to\nrapidly generate more RTTs without performing actual time-consuming\nchromatographic measurements. This enables successful identification even for\nchromatograms with serious retention time drift.

Further we test the\npractical feasibility of the method with state-of-the-art theorem provers,\ncomparing it to solvers' native techniques for handling induction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 02:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-19"}

After working out the expressions\nfor the power spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations in the case of a\ngeneral non-minimal coupling function that depends solely on the scalar field\nand a general scalar potential, we focus on the special cases of the power-law\ncoupling function and chaotic quadratic inflation. Thus, under the slow-roll\napproximation we confront the predictions of the model with the current PLANCK\nconstraints on the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$\nusing the $n_{s}-r$ plane. We found that the combination of the non-minimal\ncoupling and Galileon self-interaction effects allows us to obtain better\nresults for $r$ than in the case in which each effect is considered separately.\nParticularly, we obtained that the predictions of the model are in agreement\nwith the current observational bounds on $n_{s}$ and $r$ within the $95 \\%$ C.L\nregion and also slightly inside the $68 \\%$ C.L region. Also, we investigate\nthe oscillatory regime after the end of inflation by solving the full\nbackground equations, and then we determine the upper bound for the Galileon\nand non-minimal coupling parameters under the condition that the scalar field\noscillates coherently during reheating. Finally, after approximating reheating\nby a constant equation of state, we derive the relations between the reheating\nduration, the temperature at the end of reheating, its equation of state, and\nthe number of $e$-folds of inflation and then we relate them all to the\ninflationary observables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 02:55:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 18:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

In this paper, we present a\nframework for optimizing the build orientation with respect to removability of\nsupport structures. In particular, given a general multi-axis machining setup\nand sampled build orientations, we define a Pareto-optimality criterion based\non the total support volume and the \"secluded\" support volume defined as the\nsupport volume that is not accessible by a given set of machining tools. Since\ntotal support volume mainly depends on the build orientation and the secluded\nvolume is dictated by the machining setup, in many cases the two objectives are\ncompeting and their trade-off needs to be taken into account. The accessibility\nanalysis relies on the inaccessibility measure field (IMF), which is a\ncontinuous field in the Euclidean space that quantifies the inaccessibility of\neach point given a collection of tools and fixturing devices. The value of IMF\nat each point indicates the minimum possible volumetric collision between\nobjects in relative motion including the part, fixtures, and the tools, over\nall possible tool orientations and sharp points on the tool.

In doing so, AD-EnKFs leverage the ability of ensemble\nKalman filters to scale to high-dimensional states and the power of automatic\ndifferentiation to train high-dimensional surrogate models for the dynamics.\nNumerical results using the Lorenz-96 model show that AD-EnKFs outperform\nexisting methods that use expectation-maximization or particle filters to merge\ndata assimilation and machine learning. In addition, AD-EnKFs are easy to\nimplement and require minimal tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 03:25:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 18:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

For\ndeterministic swapping, the key ingredient is the maximal entanglement that was\ninitially contained in two pairs of qubits and the capacity of projecting onto\na Bell basis. Thus the basic and deterministic entanglement swapping scheme\ninvolves three maximal level of entanglement. In this work we propose\nprobabilistic entanglement swapping processes performed with different amounts\nof initial entanglement. Besides that we suggest a non Bell measuring-basis, to\nintroduce a third entanglement level in the process. Additionally, we propose\nthe \\emph{unambiguous state extraction scheme} as the local mechanism for\nprobabilistically achieving the EPR projection. The combination of these three\nelements allows us to design four strategies for performing probabilistic\nentanglement swapping.

Recently, Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) based\ndeep neural network models have achieved remarkable success in learning robust\nlow-dimensional representations. The basic idea in RAEs is to learn a\nnon-linear mapping from the high-dimensional data space to a low-dimensional\nlatent space and vice-versa, simultaneously imposing a distributional prior on\nthe latent space, which brings in a regularization effect. This paper argues\nthat RAEs suffer from the infamous problem of bias-variance trade-off in their\nnaive formulation.

We also study the\neffects of mass and volume-weighted thermal heating and weak ICM magnetic\nfields. For low $f_{\\mathrm{turb}}$, the gas is distribution is bimodal between\nthe hot and cold phases.

Specifically,\nfederated learning learns a shared global model in a central server from\nrenewable sites at network edges, which enables the Fed-LSGAN to generate\nscenarios in a privacy-preserving manner without sacrificing the generation\nquality by transferring model parameters, rather than all data. Meanwhile, the\nLSGANs-based deep generative model generates scenarios that conform to the\ndistribution of historical data through fully capturing the spatial-temporal\ncharacteristics of renewable powers, which leverages the least squares loss\nfunction to improve the training stability and generation quality. The\nsimulation results demonstrate that the proposal manages to generate\nhigh-quality renewable scenarios and outperforms the state-of-the-art\ncentralized methods.

Although several studies have adopted domain adaptation (DA)\napproaches to tackle this problem, most of them treat multiple EEG data from\ndifferent subjects and sessions together as a single source domain for\ntransfer, which either fails to satisfy the assumption of domain adaptation\nthat the source has a certain marginal distribution, or increases the\ndifficulty of adaptation.

A connection can made between a\nclassical view of shape optimization and the differential-geometric structure\nof shape spaces. To handle problems where a shape functional depends on\nmultiple shapes, a theoretical framework is presented, whereby the optimization\nvariable can be represented as a vector of shapes belonging to a product shape\nspace. The multi-shape gradient and multi-shape derivative are defined, which\nallows for a rigorous justification of a steepest descent method with Armijo\nbacktracking. As long as the shapes as subsets of a hold-all domain do not\nintersect, solving a single deformation equation is enough to provide descent\ndirections with respect to each shape.

To\nhandle potentially high-dimensional stochastic spaces, a stochastic gradient\nmethod is proposed.

Existing dense retrievers\noptimize representations of queries and documents with contrastive training and\nmap them to the embedding space. The embedding space is optimized by aligning\nthe matched query-document pairs and pushing the negative documents away from\nthe query. However, in such training paradigm, the queries are only optimized\nto align to the documents and are coarsely positioned, leading to an\nanisotropic query embedding space. In this paper, we analyze the embedding\nspace distributions and propose an effective training paradigm, Contrastive\nDual Learning for Approximate Nearest Neighbor (DANCE) to learn fine-grained\nquery representations for dense retrieval. DANCE incorporates an additional\ndual training object of query retrieval, inspired by the classic information\nretrieval training axiom, query likelihood. With contrastive learning, the dual\ntraining object of DANCE learns more tailored representations for queries and\ndocuments to keep the embedding space smooth and uniform, thriving on the\nranking performance of DANCE on the MS MARCO document retrieval task. Different\nfrom ANCE that only optimized with the document retrieval task, DANCE\nconcentrates the query embeddings closer to document representations while\nmaking the document distribution more discriminative. Such concentrated query\nembedding distribution assigns more uniform negative sampling probabilities to\nqueries and helps to sufficiently optimize query representations in the query\nretrieval task.

On the contrary, the AlTiBN coatings grown by HiPIMS present a dense\nnanocomposite type microstructure, formed by nanocrystalline Ti(Al)N domains\nand amorphous regions composed of Ti(Al)B2 and BN. As a result, high-Al content\n(x>0.6) AlTiBN coatings grown by HiPIMS offer higher hardness, elasticity and\nfracture toughness than AlTiN coatings. Moreover, the thermal stability and the\nhot hardness are substantially enhanced, delaying the onset of formation of the\ndetrimental hexagonal AlN phase from 850 C in the case of AlTiN, to 1000 C in\nthe case of AlTiBN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 09:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-26"}

We\nshow that for any $0 < \\varepsilon \\leq 1$ an approximation factor of\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$ can be achieved within the same asymptotic time bounds as the\npreviously best result for $(2+\\varepsilon)$. Moreover, we show that an\napproximation factor of $(2+\\varepsilon)$ can be obtained by using\npreprocessing time and space $O(nm)$, which is linear in the input size, and\nquery time in $O(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})^{k+2}$, where the previously best\nresult used preprocessing time in $n \\cdot O(\\frac{m}{\\varepsilon k})^k$ and\nquery time in $O(1)^k$. We complement our upper bounds with matching\nconditional lower bounds based on the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis.\nInterestingly, some of our lower bounds already hold for any super-constant\nvalue of $k$. This is achieved by proving hardness of a one-sided sparse\nversion of the Orthogonal Vectors problem as an intermediate problem, which we\nbelieve to be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 09:35:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 21:29:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}

To avoid an\nimpractically long, single drift space of a dual-phase detector, it seems\nbeneficial to use the single-phase technique. Since electrons then can drift in\nany direction, we can segment the homogeneous medium and thus avoid an\nexcessive maximum drift path of order 4 m. The shorter detector length has\nseveral benefits, e.g. requiring a lower cathode voltage for the same drift\nfield. We can easily split the TPC into two regions with the cathode in the\ncenter and two anodes at the top and bottom. One also can use multiple TPCs\nstacked on top of each other in the same liquid volume to reduce the maximum\ndrift length even further.\n  A further division of the drift space by installing an additional anode in\nthe center would require S2 photons to traverse the liquid for several times\nthe Rayleigh scattering length in LXe, which is only 30 - 40 cm. This seems to\nbe excessive for good x - y localization. We therefore suggest a geometry of\ntwo independent TPCs with two drift spaces each.\n  Despite earlier publications concerns persisted about the effect of\nshadowing. A detailed FEM model of the anode regions shows that with an aligned\nwire arrangement the drifting electrons impinge sideways on the anode in a\nnarrow angular range of width 15$^{\\circ}$ - 20$^{\\circ}$. Most S2 photons are\nemitted in full view of the close-by PMT array. About 37% of the S2 photons are\nshadowed by the anode wire out of which 30\\% will be reflected back again on\nthe gold plating of the wires. Thus we can observe 74% of the total S2 light.\nCompared to a dual-phase detector, however, we do not suffer from the\nextraction efficiency, sometimes reported as low as 50%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 09:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Results: We developed the algorithms for\nthe following operations: preprocessing assembly code, searching data accesses,\nextracting system values, decompiling arithmetic operations and recovering data\ntypes.

A meaningful set of quantitative features reflecting\nthe geophysical properties help us better understand the formation and\nevolution of rivers. Typically, river sub-basins are analysed using Cartosat\nDigital Elevation Models (DEMs), obtained at regular time epochs. One of the\nuseful geophysical features of a river sub-basin is that of a roughness measure\non DEMs. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not much literature\navailable on theoretical analysis of roughness measures. In this article, we\nrevisit the roughness measure on DEM data adapted from multiscale\ngranulometries in mathematical morphology, namely multiscale directional\ngranulometric index (MDGI). This measure was classically used to obtain\nshape-size analysis in greyscale images. In earlier works, MDGIs were\nintroduced to capture the characteristic surficial roughness of a river\nsub-basin along specific directions. Also, MDGIs can be efficiently computed\nand are known to be useful features for classification of river sub-basins. In\nthis article, we provide a theoretical analysis of a MDGI. In particular, we\ncharacterize non-trivial sufficient conditions on the structure of DEMs under\nwhich MDGIs are invariant. These properties are illustrated with some\nfictitious DEMs. We also provide connections to a discrete derivative of volume\nof a DEM. Based on these connections, we provide intuition as to why a MDGI is\nconsidered a roughness measure. Further, we experimentally illustrate on\nLower-Indus, Wardha, and Barmer river sub-basins that the proposed features\ncapture the characteristics of the river sub-basin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 11:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-19"}

The design of locomotion control is, however, still challenging.\nCurrently, controllers must be either manually designed for specific robots and\ntasks, or automatically designed via machine learning methods that require long\ntraining times and yield large opaque controllers. Drawing inspiration from\nanimal locomotion, we propose a simple yet versatile modular neural control\nstructure with fast learning. The key advantages of our approach are that\nbehavior-specific control modules can be added incrementally to obtain\nincreasingly complex emergent locomotion behaviors, and that neural connections\ninterfacing with existing modules can be quickly and automatically learned. In\na series of experiments, we show how eight modules can be quickly learned and\nadded to a base control module to obtain emergent adaptive behaviors allowing a\nhexapod robot to navigate in complex environments. We also show that modules\ncan be added and removed during operation without affecting the functionality\nof the remaining controller. Finally, the control approach was successfully\ndemonstrated on a physical hexapod robot. Taken together, our study reveals a\nsignificant step towards fast automatic design of versatile neural locomotion\ncontrol for complex robotic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 12:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-19"}

Autonomous vehicles are becoming technically effective at\ndriving from A to B and parking in a proper spot, with a default way.

Our analysis shows a relevant example for which\n$w(\\tau)$ gives independent information on the photon-emission statistics with\nrespect to $g^{(2)}(\\tau)$, leading to a physical insight on the problem.

These measurements are dense but have a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\nThe measurements can be de-noised by imposing physical constraints on the flow,\nwhich are encapsulated in governing equations for mass and momentum. Previous\nstudies have required the shape of the boundary (for example, a blood vessel)\nto be known a priori. This, however, requires a set of additional measurements,\nwhich can be expensive to obtain. In this paper, we present a physics-informed\nneural network that instead uses the noisy MRV data alone to simultaneously\ninfer the most likely boundary shape and de-noised velocity field. We achieve\nthis by training an auxiliary neural network that takes the value 1.0 within\nthe inferred domain of the governing PDE and 0.0 outside. This network is used\nto weight the PDE residual term in the loss function accordingly and implicitly\nlearns the geometry of the system. We test our algorithm by assimilating both\nsynthetic and real MRV measurements for flows that can be well modeled by the\nPoisson and Stokes equations. We find that we are able to reconstruct very\nnoisy (SNR = 2.5) MRV signals and recover the ground truth with low\nreconstruction errors of 3.7 - 7.5%. The simplicity and flexibility of our\nphysics-informed neural network approach can readily scale to assimilating MRV\ndata with complex 3D geometries, time-varying 4D data, or unknown parameters in\nthe physical model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 12:56:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-19"}

Drivers' ride acceptance behaviour can significantly influence system\nperformance in terms of riders' waiting time (associated with the level of\nservice), drivers' occupation rate and idle time (related to drivers' income),\nand platform revenue and reputation. Hence, it is of great importance to\nidentify the underlying determinants of the ride acceptance behaviour of\ndrivers. To this end, we collected a unique dataset from ride-sourcing drivers\nworking in the United States and the Netherlands through a cross-sectional\nstated preference experiment designed based upon disparate information conveyed\nto the respondents. Using a choice modelling approach, we estimated the effects\nof various existing and hypothetical attributes influencing the ride acceptance\nchoice.

Compared\nto classical numerical methods PINNs have several advantages, for example their\nability to provide mesh-free solutions of differential equations and their\nability to carry out forward and inverse modelling within the same optimisation\nproblem. Whilst promising, a key limitation to date is that PINNs have\nstruggled to accurately and efficiently solve problems with large domains\nand/or multi-scale solutions, which is crucial for their real-world\napplication. Multiple significant and related factors contribute to this issue,\nincluding the increasing complexity of the underlying PINN optimisation problem\nas the problem size grows and the spectral bias of neural networks. In this\nwork we propose a new, scalable approach for solving large problems relating to\ndifferential equations called Finite Basis PINNs (FBPINNs). FBPINNs are\ninspired by classical finite element methods, where the solution of the\ndifferential equation is expressed as the sum of a finite set of basis\nfunctions with compact support. In FBPINNs neural networks are used to learn\nthese basis functions, which are defined over small, overlapping subdomains.\nFBINNs are designed to address the spectral bias of neural networks by using\nseparate input normalisation over each subdomain, and reduce the complexity of\nthe underlying optimisation problem by using many smaller neural networks in a\nparallel divide-and-conquer approach.

A very important special case is the\nlikelihood function $f\\left( A \\right ) = \\log{\\left( \\left| a_{ij}\\right|\n+1\\right)}$. A natural way to do this would be to simply apply $f$ to each\nentry of $A$, and then compute the matrix decomposition, but this requires\nstoring all of $A$ as well as multiple passes over its entries. Recent work of\nLiang et al.\\ shows how to find a rank-$k$ factorization to $f(A)$ for an $n\n\\times n$ matrix $A$ using only $n \\cdot \\operatorname{poly}(\\epsilon^{-1}k\\log\nn)$ words of memory, with overall error $10\\|f(A)-[f(A)]_k\\|_F^2 +\n\\operatorname{poly}(\\epsilon/k) \\|f(A)\\|_{1,2}^2$, where $[f(A)]_k$ is the best\nrank-$k$ approximation to $f(A)$ and $\\|f(A)\\|_{1,2}^2$ is the square of the\nsum of Euclidean lengths of rows of $f(A)$. Their algorithm uses three passes\nover the entries of $A$. The authors pose the open question of obtaining an\nalgorithm with $n \\cdot \\operatorname{poly}(\\epsilon^{-1}k\\log n)$ words of\nmemory using only a single pass over the entries of $A$. In this paper we\nresolve this open question, obtaining the first single-pass algorithm for this\nproblem and for the same class of functions $f$ studied by Liang et al.\nMoreover, our error is $\\|f(A)-[f(A)]_k\\|_F^2 + \\operatorname{poly}(\\epsilon/k)\n\\|f(A)\\|_F^2$, where $\\|f(A)\\|_F^2$ is the sum of squares of Euclidean lengths\nof rows of $f(A)$. Thus our error is significantly smaller, as it removes the\nfactor of $10$ and also $\\|f(A)\\|_F^2 \\leq \\|f(A)\\|_{1,2}^2$. We also give an\nalgorithm for regression, pointing out an error in previous work, and\nempirically validate our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 13:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-19"}

Here we numerically examine the\npossibility of using particles to capture the dynamics of isolated vortex rings\npropagating in a quiescent fluid. The analysis is performed starting from\nnumerical simulations of the Navier--Stokes and the\nHall--Vinen--Bekarevich--Khalatnikov equations, respectively describing the\ndynamics of a Newtonian fluid and a finite-temperature superfluid. The\nflow-induced positions and velocities of particles suspended in the fluid are\nspecifically used to compute the Lagrangian pseudovorticity field, a proxy for\nthe Eulerian vorticity field recently employed in the context of superfluid\n$^4$He experiments. We show that, when calculated from ideal Lagrangian tracers\nor from particles with low inertia, the pseudovorticity field can be accurately\nused to estimate the propagation velocity and the growth of isolated vortex\nrings, although the quantitative reconstruction of the corresponding vorticity\nfields remains challenging. On the other hand, particles with high inertia tend\nto preferentially sample specific flow regions, resulting in biased\npseudovorticity fields that pollute the estimation of the vortex ring\nproperties. Overall, this work neatly demonstrates that the Lagrangian\npseudovorticity is a valuable tool for estimating the strength of macroscopic\nvortical structures in the absence of Eulerian data, which is, for example, the\ncase of superfluid $^4$He experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 13:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

To study how\ncorrelation affects phase coherence, we analyzed the TFTC model by means of\nnumerical simulations and exact dimensional reduction methods allowing to study\nthe collective dynamics in terms of local order parameters. The competition\nresulting from distributed coupling strengths and natural frequencies produces\nnontrivial dynamic states.

We find\nthat, in an X-ray background, protostellar discs have lower surface density and\nhigher Toomre $Q$ parameter, so they are more stable. For this reason, X-ray\nirradiated discs undergo fewer fragmentations and typically produce either\nbinary systems or low-multiplicity systems. In contrast, the cases with weak or\nno X-ray irradiation produce systems with a typical multiplicity of $6 \\pm 3$.\nIn addition, the most massive protostar in each system is smaller by roughly a\nfactor of two when the disc is irradiated by X-rays, due to lower accretion\nrate. With these two effects combined, the initial mass function of fragments\nbecomes more top-heavy in a strong X-ray background and is well described by a\npower-law with slope $1.53$ and high-mass cutoff of $61$ M$_\\odot$. Without\nX-rays, we find a slope $0.49$ and cutoff mass of $229$ M$_\\odot$.

It was first observed using stellar occultation in 2013. Stellar\noccultations allow the determination of sizes and shapes with kilometre\naccuracy and obtain characteristics of the occulting object and its vicinity.\nUsing stellar occultations observed between 2017 and 2020, we aim at\nconstraining Chariklo's and its rings physical parameters. We also determine\nthe rings' structure, and obtain precise astrometrical positions of Chariklo.\nWe predicted and organised several observational campaigns of stellar\noccultations by Chariklo. Occultation light curves were measured from the data\nsets, from which ingress and egress times, and rings' width and opacity were\nobtained. These measurements, combined with results from previous works, allow\nus to obtain significant constraints on Chariklo's shape and rings' structure.\nWe characterise Chariklo's ring system (C1R and C2R), and obtain radii and pole\norientations that are consistent with, but more accurate than, results from\nprevious occultations. We confirmed the detection of W-shaped structures within\nC1R and an evident variation of radial width. The observed width ranges between\n4.8 and 9.1 km with a mean value of 6.5 km. One dual observation (visible and\nred) does not reveal any differences in the C1R opacity profiles, indicating\nring particle's size larger than a few microns. The C1R ring eccentricity is\nfound to be smaller than 0.022 (3-sigma), and its width variations may indicate\nan eccentricity higher than 0.005. We fit a tri-axial shape to Chariklo's\ndetections over eleven occultations and determine that Chariklo is consistent\nwith an ellipsoid with semi-axes of 143.8, 135.2 and 99.1 km. Ultimately, we\nprovided seven astrometric positions at a milliarcseconds accuracy level, based\non Gaia EDR3, and use it to improve Chariklo's ephemeris.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 13:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

The paradox of the arrow of time\narises because the laws of physics are invariably time reversal invariant, in\nwhich case we are led to ask what determines the direction of time.\nInvestigations of time's arrow are usually framed in the context of a\nmathematical formalism where the parameter t represents time, and then proceed\nto logical analyses of how the direction of time emerges.

SG stars are assumed\nto form once first generation asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars start\nreleasing their ejecta; during this phase, external gas is accreted by the\nsystem and SNe Ia begin exploding, carving hot and tenuous bubbles. Given the\nlarge uncertainty on SNe Ia explosion times, we test two different values for\nthe 'delay time'. We run two different models for the external gas density: in\nthe low-density scenario with short delay time, the explosions start at the\nbeginning of the SG star formation, halting it in its earliest phases. The\nexternal gas hardly penetrates the system, therefore most SG stars present\nextreme helium abundances (Y > 0.33). The low-density model with delayed SN\nexplosions has a more extended SG star formation epoch and includes SG stars\nwith modest helium enrichment. On the contrary, the high-density model is\nweakly affected by SN explosions, with a final SG mass similar to the one\nobtained without SNe Ia. Most of the stars form from a mix of AGB ejecta and\npristine gas and have a modest helium enrichment. We show that gas from SNe Ia\nmay produce an iron spread of $\\sim 0.14$ dex, consistent with the spread found\nin about 20% of Galactic GCs, suggesting that SNe Ia might have played a key\nrole in the formation of this sub-sample of GCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 15:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

We rigorously define causal estimands in the presence of selection bias.\nWe elucidate the conditions under which standard covariate adjustment methods\ncan validly estimate these estimands.

Adopting the principal stratification framework in causal\ninference, we clarify there are two average treatment effect (ATE) estimands in\ncluster randomized trials: one for the overall population and one for the\nrecruited population.

The energy dissipation depends on the latent heat generated by\nthe austenitic-martensitic transformation and the convection of that heat. Due\nto the thermomechanical coupling, the martensitic nucleation stress level and\nthus the propagation of martensitic phase fronts strongly depends on the\nmaterial temperature. High strain-rate interferes with the release of the\nlatent heat to the environment and determines quantity, position and\npropagation of martensitic transformation bands. Lastly, high strain-rate\nreduces the hysteresis surface. The propagation velocity and quantity of\nmartensitic bands have an impact on martensitic phase stability. The degree of\natomic disorder and accordingly the change in entropy influences the reverse\nphase transformation from martensite to austenite. In other words, the\nstability of the martensitic state affects the stress level of the reverse\ntransformation. However, in phenomenological superelastic SMA models, which are\nused to simulate energy dissipation behavior, the effects of the rate-dependent\nentropy change are not considered in particular. To incorporate the\nrate-dependent entropy change, we improved a one-dimensional numerical model by\nintroducing an additional control variable in the free energy formulation for\nsolid-solid phase transformation of superelastic SMAs. In this model, the\nobserved effects of the strain-rate on the reverse transformation are taken\ninto account by calculating the rate-dependent entropy change. A comparison of\nthe numerical results with the experimental data shows that the model\ncalculates the dynamic superelastic hysteresis of SMAs more accurately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 09:39:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

An efficient LSMOP algorithm should have\nthe ability to escape the local optimal solution from the huge search space and\nfind the global optimal. Most of the current researches focus on how to deal\nwith decision variables. However, due to the large number of decision\nvariables, it is easy to lead to high computational cost. Maintaining the\ndiversity of the population is one of the effective ways to improve search\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic prediction model based on\ntrend prediction model and generating-filtering strategy, called LT-PPM, to\ntackle the LSMOP. The proposed method enhances the diversity of the population\nthrough importance sampling. At the same time, due to the adoption of an\nindividual-based evolution mechanism, the computational cost of the proposed\nmethod is independent of the number of decision variables, thus avoiding the\nproblem of exponential growth of the search space. We compared the proposed\nalgorithm with several state-of-the-art algorithms for different benchmark\nfunctions. The experimental results and complexity analysis have demonstrated\nthat the proposed algorithm has significant improvement in terms of its\nperformance and computational efficiency in large-scale multi-objective\noptimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 09:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

Furthermore, we show that the CAS loss function\nis sparse, bounded, and robust to class-imbalance.

Using some of the most widely accepted\nevolutionary death and aging theories, we observed that senescent death (in\nvarious forms) can lower the total run-time of genetic algorithms, increase the\noptimality of a solution, and decrease the variance in an algorithm's\nperformance.
