However, there is no available\ndatabase to support in-depth research of this problem, and state-of-arts gait\nrecognition methods have not paid enough attention to it, thus this paper\nfocuses on gait recognition under occlusion. We collect a new gait recognition\ndatabase called OG RGB+D database, which breaks through the limitation of other\ngait databases and includes multimodal gait data of various occlusions\n(self-occlusion, active occlusion, and passive occlusion) by our multiple\nsynchronous Azure Kinect DK sensors data acquisition system (multi-Kinect SDAS)\nthat can be also applied in security situations. Because Azure Kinect DK can\nsimultaneously collect multimodal data to support different types of gait\nrecognition algorithms, especially enables us to effectively obtain\ncamera-centric multi-person 3D poses, and multi-view is better to deal with\nocclusion than single-view. In particular, the OG RGB+D database provides\naccurate silhouettes and the optimized human 3D joints data (OJ) by fusing data\ncollected by multi-Kinects which are more accurate in human pose representation\nunder occlusion. We also use the OJ data to train an advanced 3D multi-person\npose estimation model to improve its accuracy of pose estimation under\nocclusion for universality. Besides, as human pose is less sensitive to\nocclusion than human appearance, we propose a novel gait recognition method\nSkeletonGait based on human dual skeleton model using a framework of siamese\nspatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (siamese ST-GCN).

In this paper we propose a dense mapping framework to\ncomplement sparse visual SLAM systems which takes as input the camera poses,\nkeyframes and sparse points produced by the SLAM system and predicts a dense\ndepth image for every keyframe. We build on CodeSLAM and use a variational\nautoencoder (VAE) which is conditioned on intensity, sparse depth and\nreprojection error images from sparse SLAM to predict an uncertainty-aware\ndense depth map. The use of a VAE then enables us to refine the dense depth\nimages through multi-view optimization which improves the consistency of\noverlapping frames. Our mapper runs in a separate thread in parallel to the\nSLAM system in a loosely coupled manner. This flexible design allows for\nintegration with arbitrary metric sparse SLAM systems without delaying the main\nSLAM process.

In this paper, we conduct four large-scale within-study comparisons on\nTwitter aimed at assessing the effectiveness of observational studies derived\nfrom user self-selection on online platforms.

For very large\nproblems, an iterative solver is needed and, in general, a preconditioner is\nrequired to achieve good convergence. In recent years, a number of\npreconditioners have been proposed. These are largely serial and reported\nresults demonstrate that none of the commonly used preconditioners for the\nnormal equations matrix is capable of solving all sparse least-squares\nproblems. Our interest is thus in designing new preconditioners for the normal\nequations that are efficient, robust, and can be implemented in parallel. Our\nproposed preconditioners can be constructed efficiently and algebraically\nwithout any knowledge of the problem and without any assumption on the\nleast-squares matrix except that it is sparse. We exploit the structure of the\nsymmetric positive definite normal equations matrix and use the concept of\nalgebraic local symmetric positive semi-definite splittings to introduce\ntwo-level Schwarz preconditioners for least-squares problems. The condition\nnumber of the preconditioned normal equations is shown to be theoretically\nbounded independently of the number of subdomains in the splitting. This upper\nbound can be adjusted using a single parameter $\\tau$ that the user can\nspecify. We discuss how the new preconditioners can be implemented on top of\nthe PETSc library using only 150 lines of Fortran, C, or Python code. Problems\narising from practical applications are used to compare the performance of the\nproposed new preconditioner with that of other preconditioners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 16:33:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2022 15:39:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

In this paper, we present a novel\nframework that will allow moderation researchers and practitioners to not only\nkeep-up with the diverse landscape of available platforms and affordances, but\nalso comprehensively represent and analyze moderation on these platforms. The\nMIC framework represents a social platform's moderation ecosystem using a\nbase-set of 12 platform-level affordances, along with a notion of the\ninter-affordance relationships that can exist between them. These affordances\nfall into the three categories -- Members, Infrastructure, and Content -- that\nare derived from Grimmelmann's taxonomy of moderation, a framework that is\nalready widely accepted and used by the moderation research community. To show\nhow MIC serves as an insightful augmentation of Grimmelmann's lens, we begin by\ndescribing how its components have already been shown to impact Grimmelmann's\ntechniques for moderation. Then, we demonstrate the advantages of using an\naffordance-aware framework like MIC by analyzing several social platforms over\nthe course of two case studies. First, we analyze individual platforms using\nMIC and demonstrate how MIC can be used to examine the effects of platform\nchanges on the moderation ecosystem and identify potential new challenges in\nmoderation. Next, use MIC to systematically compare three platforms and propose\npotential moderation mechanisms that each can adapt.

Despite the plethora of available methods to estimate\nPSBW, there is little guidance on what one defines as adequate balance, and\nunbiased and robust estimation of the causal treatment effect is not guaranteed\nunless several conditions hold.

We describe these\nscenarios using an analogy to musical performance: small collaborative team\nmeetings are akin to jam session, while more structured presentations can range\nfrom semi-improvisational performances among peers to formal recitals given to\nexecutives or customers. In our second study, we grounded the discussion around\nthree design probes, each examining a different aspect of presenting data: the\nprogressive reveal of visualization to direct attention and advance a\nnarrative, visualization presentation controls that are hidden from the\naudience's view, and the coordination of a presenter's video with interactive\nvisualization. Our distillation of interviewees' responses surfaced twelve\nthemes, from ways of authoring presentations to creating accessible and\nengaging audience experiences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 17:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

Resisting exact results sought since Lifshitz's account in 1962, central\nquantities in 2d Model A $-$ most scaling exponents and correlation functions\n$-$ remain known up to approximate theories whose disparate outcomes urge\nexperimental assessment. Here, we perform such assessment from a comprehensive\nstudy of the coarsening of 2d twisted nematic liquid crystals whose kinetics is\ninduced by a super-fast switching from a spatiotemporally chaotic state to a\ntwo-phase concurrent, equilibrium one. Tracking the dynamics via optical\nmicroscopy, we firstly show the sharp evidence of well-established Model A\naspects, such as the dynamic exponent $z=2$ and the dynamic scaling hypothesis,\nto then move forward. We confirm the Bray-Humayun theory for Porod's regime\ndescribing intradomain length scales of spatial correlators, and show that\ntheir nontrivial decay beyond that regime is captured in a free-from-parameter\nfashion by Gaussian theories. These paradigmatic theories, however, do not\nperform well for time-related Model A statistics. We reveal that the collapsed\nform of two-time correlators is best accounted for by the local scaling\ninvariance theory, along with the Fisher-Huse conjecture. We also suggest the\ntrue value for the local persistence exponent, in disfavour of Gaussian models,\nand extract a universal fractal dimension for the morphology of persistence\nclusters that is notably close to the golden ratio.

To address this, we\nturn to an alternate form of data that does not require task-specific\ndemonstrations -- play. Playing is a fundamental method children use to learn a\nset of skills and behaviors and visual representations in early learning.\nImportantly, play data is diverse, task-agnostic, and relatively cheap to\nobtain.

Since excellent angle and energy reconstruction are\nnecessary to detect this monoenergetic, directional neutrino flux, DUNE with\nits vast volume and reconstruction capabilities, is a promising candidate for a\nKDAR neutrino search. In this work, we evaluate the proposed KDAR neutrino\nsearch strategies by realistically modeling both neutrino-nucleus interactions\nand the response of DUNE. We find that, although reconstruction of the neutrino\nenergy and direction is difficult with current techniques in the relevant\nenergy range, the superb energy resolution, angular resolution, and particle\nidentification offered by DUNE can still permit great signal/background\ndiscrimination. Moreover, there are non-standard scenarios in which searches at\nDUNE for KDAR in the Sun can probe dark matter interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 19:02:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 00:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

This factor equals the sideband number associated with the\nhigh-order phase-matched sum-frequency process. The theoretical framework,\ni.e., the dressed-resonator method, to study the frequency conversion and comb\ngeneration is formulated by including the sum-frequency nonlinearity into the\ndefinition of the resonator spectrum. The Rabi splitting of the dressed\nfrequencies leads to the four distinct parametric down-conversion conditions\n(signal-idler-pump photon energy conservation laws). The parametric instability\ntongues associated with the generation of the sparse, i.e.,\nTuring-pattern-like, frequency combs with varying repetition rates are analysed\nin details. The sum-frequency matched sideband exhibits the optical Pockels\nnonlinearity and strongly modified dispersion, which limit the soliton\nbandwidth and also play a distinct role in the Turing comb generation.

Once\nthe transient had passed, mean values (and their associated statistics) were\nobtained by sampling the evolved time-series at intervals of the order of an\neddy-turnover time. This was repeated for a range of Taylor-Reynolds numbers\nfrom 10.6 to 335.2. With increasing Reynolds number, our results for energy\nspectra, transfer spectra and inertial flux supported the Kolmogorov-Obukhov\npicture of turbulent energy transfer. In particular, we observed the onset of\nscale-invariance of the inertial flux, accompanied by the onset of the -5/3\npower law in the energy spectrum for the corresponding inertial range of\nwavenumbers. Detailed comparisons showed that our results were in agreement\nwith those found in many other investigations. Flow visualization methods were\nused to study the internal intermittency. This phenomenon is seen in single\nrealisations but was found to average out with increasing number of\nrealisations under ensemble-averaging. Following a critical review of the\nliterature relating to the controversy about intermittency effects versus\nfinite-Reynolds number corrections, it was concluded that, for the case of\nstationary isotropic turbulence, internal intermittency cannot affect the\nKolmogorov-Obukhov picture, as this is constructed entirely in terms of\nensemble-averaged mean quantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 19:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

In this approach, the average $PSA$ scaling is controlled by an\nergodic $PSA$ GMM, and the non-ergodic effects are captured with non-ergodic\n$PSA$ factors, which are the adjustment that needs to be applied to an ergodic\n$PSA$ GMM to incorporate the non-ergodic effects. The non-ergodic $PSA$ factors\nare based on $EAS$ non-ergodic effects and are converted to $PSA$ through\nRandom Vibration Theory (RVT). The advantage of this approach is that it better\ncaptures the non-ergodic source, path, and site effects through the small\nmagnitude earthquakes. Due to the linear properties of Fourier Transform, the\n$EAS$ non-ergodic effects of the small events can be applied directly to the\nlarge magnitude events. This is not the case for $PSA$, as response spectrum is\ncontrolled by a range of frequencies, making $PSA$ non-ergodic effects depended\non the spectral shape which is magnitude dependent.

Our two-component\nmodel provides an excellent match to the observed radio flux density\ndistributions across a wide range of redshifts and quasar optical luminosities;\nthis suggests that the jet-launching mechanism operates in all quasars but with\ndifferent powering efficiency. The wide distribution of jet powers allows for a\nsmooth transition between the 'radio-quiet' and 'radio-loud' quasar regimes,\nwithout need for any explicit bimodality. The best-fit model parameters\nindicate that the star-formation rate of quasar host galaxies correlates\nstrongly with quasar luminosity and also increases with redshift at least out\nto z~2. For a model where star-formation rate scales as $SFR \\propto\nL_{bol}^\\alpha (1+z)^\\beta$, we find $\\alpha = 0.47 \\pm 0.01$ and $\\beta = 1.61\n\\pm 0.05$, in agreement with far-infrared studies.

This gap is problematic because diversity is not a monolithic\nconcept. Rather, different concepts of diversity are based on distinct\nrationales that should inform how we measure diversity in a given context.\nSimilarly, the lack of specificity about the precise mechanisms underpinning\ndiversity's potential benefits can result in uninformative generalities,\ninvalid experimental designs, and illicit interpretations of findings.

Although CNNs offer promising\nperspectives for 2D image compression, extending such models to omnidirectional\nimages is not straightforward. First, omnidirectional images have specific\nspatial and statistical properties that can not be fully captured by current\nCNN models. Second, basic mathematical operations composing a CNN architecture,\ne.g., translation and sampling, are not well-defined on the sphere. In this\npaper, we study the learning of representation models for omnidirectional\nimages and propose to use the properties of HEALPix uniform sampling of the\nsphere to redefine the mathematical tools used in deep learning models for\nomnidirectional images.

A significant number of binary stars are not in strict\nsynchronous rotation, including all eccentric systems. This leads to a tidally\ninduced and time-variable differential rotation structure. We present a method\nfor exploring the rotation structure of asynchronously rotating binaries. We\nsolve the equations of motion of a 3D grid of volume elements located above the\nrigidly rotating core in the presence of gravitational, centrifugal, Coriolis,\ngas pressure and viscous forces to obtain the angular velocity as a function of\nthe three spatial coordinates and time. We find that the induced rotation\nstructure and its temporal variability depend on the degree of departure from\nsynchronicity. In eccentric systems, the structure changes over the orbital\ncycle with maximum amplitudes occurring potentially at orbital phases other\nthan periastron passage. We discuss the possible role of the time-dependent\ntidal flows in enhancing the mixing efficiency and speculate that, in this\ncontext, slowly rotating asynchronous binaries could have more efficient mixing\nthan the analogous more rapidly rotating but tidally locked systems.

In these scenarios, the underlying graph\noften changes with time due to link failures or topology variations, creating a\nmismatch between the graphs on which GNNs were trained and the ones on which\nthey are tested. Online learning can be leveraged to retrain GNNs at testing\ntime to overcome this issue. However, most online algorithms are centralized\nand usually offer guarantees only on convex problems, which GNNs rarely lead\nto. This paper develops the Wide and Deep GNN (WD-GNN), a novel architecture\nthat can be updated with distributed online learning mechanisms. The WD-GNN\nconsists of two components: the wide part is a linear graph filter and the deep\npart is a nonlinear GNN. At training time, the joint wide and deep architecture\nlearns nonlinear representations from data. At testing time, the wide, linear\npart is retrained, while the deep, nonlinear one remains fixed. This often\nleads to a convex formulation. We further propose a distributed online learning\nalgorithm that can be implemented in a decentralized setting.

The direction of the drag current depends on the length of the\none-dimensional wire with respect to the position of the barrier in the drag\nwire. When we additionally form a potential barrier in the drive wire, the\ndirection of the drag current is determined by the relative position of the two\nbarriers.

The challenge is that unlike the situation in the univariate case, the\noptimal transports that correspond to geodesics in the space of distributions\nwith the 2-Wasserstein metric do not have an explicit representation for\nmultivariate distributions. We show that under some regularity assumptions the\nconditional Wasserstein barycenters constructed for a geodesic in the Euclidean\npredictor space form a corresponding geodesic in the Wasserstein distribution\nspace and demonstrate how the notion of conditional barycenters can be\nharnessed to interpolate as well as extrapolate multivariate distributions.

It has\nbeen hypothesized that VF is driven by three-dimensional (3D) rotating\nelectrical scroll waves, which can be characterized by filament-like electrical\nphase singularities (EPS). Recently, it was shown that rotating excitation\nwaves during VF are associated with rotating waves of mechanical deformation.\n3D mechanical scroll waves and mechanical filaments describing their rotational\ncore were observed in the ventricles by using high-resolution ultrasound. The\nfindings suggest that the spatiotemporal organization of cardiac fibrillation\nmay be assessed from waves of mechanical deformation. However, the complex\nrelationship between excitation and mechanical waves during VF is currently not\nunderstood. Here, we study the fundamental nature of mechanical phase\nsingularities (MPS), their spatiotemporal organization and relation with EPS.\nWe demonstrate the existence of two fundamental types of MPS: \"paired\nsingularities\", which are co-localized with EPS, and \"unpaired singularities\",\nwhich can form independently. We show that the unpaired singularities emerge\ndue to the anisotropy of the active force field, generated by fiber anisotropy\nin cardiac tissue, and the non-locality of elastic interactions, which jointly\ninduce strong spatiotemporal inhomogeneities in the strain fields. The\ninhomogeneities lead to the breakup of deformation waves and create MPS, even\nin the absence of EPS, which are typically associated with excitation wave\nbreak.

The tasks of texture transfer\nand semantic reasoning are carried out in two separate network blocks.\nSpecifically, the Texture Transfer Block (TTB) aims at extracting texture\nfeatures from the NIR image's Laplacian component and transferring them for\nsubsequent color fusion. The Semantic Reasoning Block (SRB) extracts semantic\nclues and maps the NIR pixel values to the RGB domain. Finally, a Fusion\nAttention Block (FAB) is proposed to adaptively fuse the features from the two\nbranches and generate an optimized colorization result.

However, with the worst-case\ndistribution being implausibly discrete, the resulting design suffers from\nover-pessimisim and can mask the true fault. This paper aims at developing a\nnew DRFD design scheme with reduced conservatism, by assuming unimodality of\nthe true distribution, a property commonly encountered in real-life practice.\nTo tackle the chance constraint on false alarms, we first attain a new\ngeneralized Gauss bound on the probability outside an ellipsoid, which is less\nconservative than known Chebyshev bounds. As a result, analytical solutions to\nDRFD design problems are obtained, which are less conservative than known ones\ndisregarding unimodality. We further encode bounded support information into\nambiguity sets, derive a tightened multivariate Gauss bound, and develop\napproximate reformulations of design problems as convex programs. Moreover, the\nderived generalized Gauss bounds are broadly applicable to versatile change\ndetection tasks for setting alarm thresholds. Results on a laborotary system\nshown that, the incorporation of unimodality information helps reducing\nconservatism of distributionally robust design and leads to a better tradeoff\nbetween robustness and sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 03:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

During the last decade, several\nstrategyproof budget-feasible procurement auctions have been proposed, aiming\nto maximize the value of the buyer, while eliciting each seller's true cost for\nproviding their service. These solutions predominantly take the form of\nrandomized sealed-bid auctions: they ask the sellers to report their private\ncosts and then use randomization to determine which subset of services will be\nprocured and how much each of the chosen providers will be paid, ensuring that\nthe total payment does not exceed budget. Our main result in this paper is a\nnovel method for designing budget-feasible auctions, leading to solutions that\noutperform the previously proposed auctions in multiple ways.\n  First, our solutions take the form of descending clock auctions, and thus\nsatisfy a list of properties, such as obvious strategyproofness, group\nstrategyproofness, transparency, and unconditional winner privacy; this makes\nthese auctions much more likely to be used in practice. Second, in contrast to\nprevious results that heavily depend on randomization, our auctions are\ndeterministic. As a result, we provide an affirmative answer to one of the main\nopen questions in this literature, asking whether a deterministic strategyproof\nauction can achieve a constant approximation when the buyer's valuation\nfunction is submodular over the set of services. In addition, we also provide\nthe first deterministic budget-feasible auction that matches the approximation\nbound of the best-known randomized auction for the class of subadditive\nvaluations. Finally, using our method, we improve the best-known approximation\nfactor for monotone submodular valuations, which has been the focus of most of\nthe prior work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 03:05:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 15:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

However, practical test class\ndistributions often violate this assumption (e.g., being either long-tailed or\neven inversely long-tailed), which may lead existing methods to fail in real\napplications. In this paper, we study a more practical yet challenging task,\ncalled test-agnostic long-tailed recognition, where the training class\ndistribution is long-tailed while the test class distribution is agnostic and\nnot necessarily uniform. In addition to the issue of class imbalance, this task\nposes another challenge: the class distribution shift between the training and\ntest data is unknown. To tackle this task, we propose a novel approach, called\nSelf-supervised Aggregation of Diverse Experts, which consists of two\nstrategies: (i) a new skill-diverse expert learning strategy that trains\nmultiple experts from a single and stationary long-tailed dataset to separately\nhandle different class distributions; (ii) a novel test-time expert aggregation\nstrategy that leverages self-supervision to aggregate the learned multiple\nexperts for handling unknown test class distributions.

Firstly, this thesis explores input features by making use of\nmultiple spectrograms (log-mel, Gamma, and CQT) for low-level feature\nextraction to tackle the issue of insufficiently discriminative or descriptive\ninput features. Next, a novel Encoder network architecture is introduced. The\nEncoder firstly transforms each low-level spectrogram into high-level\nintermediate features, or embeddings, and thus combines these high-level\nfeatures to form a very distinct composite feature.

To improve the robustness against\nocclusion, augmenting the training images with artificial occlusions has been\nproved as a useful approach. However, these artificial occlusions are commonly\ngenerated by adding a black rectangle or several object templates including\nsunglasses, scarfs and phones, which cannot well simulate the realistic\nocclusions. In this paper, based on the argument that the occlusion essentially\ndamages a group of neurons, we propose a novel and elegant occlusion-simulation\nmethod via dropping the activations of a group of neurons in some elaborately\nselected channel. Specifically, we first employ a spatial regularization to\nencourage each feature channel to respond to local and different face regions.\nIn this way, the activations affected by an occlusion in a local region are\nmore likely to be located in a single feature channel. Then, the locality-aware\nchannel-wise dropout (LCD) is designed to simulate the occlusion by dropping\nout the entire feature channel. Furthermore, by randomly dropping out several\nfeature channels, our method can well simulate the occlusion of larger area.\nThe proposed LCD can encourage its succeeding layers to minimize the\nintra-class feature variance caused by occlusions, thus leading to improved\nrobustness against occlusion. In addition, we design an auxiliary spatial\nattention module by learning a channel-wise attention vector to reweight the\nfeature channels, which improves the contributions of non-occluded regions.\nExtensive experiments on various benchmarks show that the proposed method\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods with a remarkable improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 05:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

For synchronous distributed\nsystems, the synthesis problem is well known to be undecidable. For\nasynchronous systems, the boundary between decidable and undecidable synthesis\nproblems is a long-standing open question. We study the problem in the setting\nof Petri games, a framework for distributed systems where asynchronous\nprocesses are equipped with causal memory. Petri games extend Petri nets with a\ndistinction between system places and environment places. The components of a\ndistributed system are the players of the game, represented as tokens that\nexchange information during each synchronization. Previous decidability results\nfor this model are limited to local winning conditions, i.e., conditions that\nonly refer to individual components. In this paper, we consider global winning\nconditions such as mutual exclusion, i.e., conditions that refer to the state\nof all components. We provide decidability and undecidability results for\nglobal winning conditions. First, we prove for winning conditions given as bad\nmarkings that it is decidable whether a winning strategy for the system players\nexists in Petri games with a bounded number of system players and one\nenvironment player. Second, we prove for winning conditions that refer to both\ngood and bad markings that it is undecidable whether a winning strategy for the\nsystem players exists in Petri games with at least two system players and one\nenvironment player. Our results thus show that, on the one hand, it is indeed\npossible to use global safety specifications like mutual exclusion in the\nsynthesis of distributed systems.

Many NLP\ntechniques, such as RNN and self-attention, have been adapted to learn medical\nrepresentations from hierarchical and time-stamped EHRs data, but fail when\nthey lack either general or task-specific data. Hence, some recent works train\nhealthcare representations by incorporating medical ontology, by\nself-supervised tasks like diagnosis prediction, but (1) the small-scale,\nmonotonous ontology is insufficient for robust learning, and (2) critical\ncontexts or dependencies underlying patient journeys are barely exploited to\nenhance ontology learning. To address the challenges, we propose a\nTransformer-based representation learning approach: Mutual Integration of\nPatient journey and medical Ontology (MIPO), which is a robust end-to-end\nframework. Specifically, the proposed method focuses on task-specific\nrepresentation learning by a sequential diagnoses predictive task, which is\nalso beneficial to the ontology-based disease typing task. To integrate\ninformation in the patient's visiting records, we further introduce a\ngraph-embedding module, which can mitigate the challenge of data insufficiency\nin healthcare. In this way, MIPO creates a mutual integration to benefit both\nhealthcare representation learning and medical ontology embedding. Such an\neffective integration is guaranteed by joint training over fused embeddings of\nthe two modules, targeting both task-specific prediction and ontology-based\ndisease typing tasks simultaneously. Extensive experiments conducted on two\nreal-world benchmark datasets have shown MIPO consistently achieves better\nperformance than state-of-the-art methods no matter whether the training data\nis sufficient or not.

We first design a head pose predictor by\nmodeling rigid 6D head movements with a motion-aware recurrent neural network\n(RNN). In this way, the predicted head poses act as the low-frequency holistic\nmovements of a talking head, thus allowing our latter network to focus on\ndetailed facial movement generation. To depict the entire image motions arising\nfrom audio, we exploit a keypoint based dense motion field representation.\nThen, we develop a motion field generator to produce the dense motion fields\nfrom input audio, head poses, and a reference image. As this keypoint based\nrepresentation models the motions of facial regions, head, and backgrounds\nintegrally, our method can better constrain the spatial and temporal\nconsistency of the generated videos. Finally, an image generation network is\nemployed to render photo-realistic talking-head videos from the estimated\nkeypoint based motion fields and the input reference image.

This requirement is more\nstringent for larger grains, with the enhancement factor increasing linearly\nwith the grain size, reaching ${\\sim} 2\\times 10^4$ for millimeter-sized\ngrains. Even if the required enhancement can be achieved, the resulting\ninferred magnetic field orientation in the simulation does not show a\npreference for the major axis, which is inconsistent with the observed pattern.\nWe thus conclude that the observed trends are best described by the model where\nthe polarization on the envelope scale is dominated by magnetically aligned\ngrains and that on the disk scale by scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 08:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

However, the learning of a\n(near-)optimal policy for each of these financial MDPs can be a very\ntime-consuming process, especially when nothing is known about the policy to\nbegin with. An alternative approach is to find a similar financial MDP for\nwhich we have already learned its policy, and then reuse such policy in the\nlearning of a new policy for a new financial MDP. Such a knowledge transfer\nbetween market scenarios raises several issues. On the one hand, how to measure\nthe similarity between financial MDPs.

Experiment results show that the proposed\nprotection method allows rightful users with the correct key to access the\nmodel to full capacity and deteriorate the performance for unauthorized users.\nHowever, protected models slightly drop the segmentation performance compared\nto non-protected models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 09:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

Pronounced nonlinearity,\nanisotropy of dispersion relations and phase degree of freedom of spin waves\nrequire advanced methodology for probing spin waves at room as well as at mK\ntemperatures. Yet, the use of the established optical techniques like Brillouin\nlight scattering (BLS) or magneto optical Kerr effect (MOKE) at ultra-low\ntemperatures is forbiddingly complicated. By contrast, microwave spectroscopy\ncan be used at all temperatures but is usually lacking spatial and wavenumber\nresolution.

The method is based on the phase-resolved\nanalysis of the spin-wave transmission between two antennas with variable\nspacing, in conjunction with theoretical data treatment. We validate the method\nfor the in-plane magnetized CoFeB and YIG thin films in $k\\perp B$ and\n$k\\parallel B$ geometries by deducing the full set of material and spin-wave\nparameters, including spin-wave dispersion, hybridization of the fundamental\nmode with the higher-order perpendicular standing spin-wave modes and surface\nspin pinning.

To this goal we present\neach item in the form of answers to specific questions.

The molecular composition of interstellar ice mantles is defined by\ngas-grain processes in molecular clouds, with the main components being $H_2O$,\n$CO$, and $CO_2$. $CH_3OH$ ice is detected towards the denser regions, where\nlarge amounts of $CO$ freeze out and get hydrogenated. Heating from nearby\nprotostars can further change the ice structure and composition. Despite the\nseveral observations of icy features towards molecular clouds and along the\nline of site of protostars, it is not yet clear if interstellar ices are mixed\nor if they have a layered structure. Aims. We aim to examine the effect of\nmixed and layered ice growth in ice mantle analogues, with focus on the\nposition and shape of methanol infrared bands, so future observations could\nshed light on the structure of interstellar ices in different environments.\nMethods. Mixed and layered ice samples were deposited on a cold substrate kept\nat T = 10 K using a closed-cycle cryostat placed in a vacuum chamber. The\nspectroscopic features were analysed by FTIR spectroscopy. Different\nproportions of the most abundant four molecules in ice mantles, namely $H_2O$,\n$CO$, $CO_2$, and $CH_3OH$, were investigated, with special attention on the\nanalysis of the $CH_3OH$ bands. Results. We measure changes in the position and\nshape of the CH and CO stretching bands of $CH_3OH$ depending on the mixed or\nlayered nature of the ice sample. Spectroscopic features of methanol are also\nfound to change due to heating. Conclusions. A layered ice structure best\nreproduces the $CH_3OH$ band position recently observed towards a pre-stellar\ncore and in star-forming regions. Based on our experimental results, we\nconclude that observations of $CH_3OH$ ices can provide information about the\nstructure of interstellar ices, and we expect JWST to put stringent constraints\non the layered or mixed nature of ices in different interstellar environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 09:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

The $k$-star caterpillar on $X$ is\nimaginary and if the imaginary structure is a path ($0$-star caterpillar), then\nit is the class of convex bipartite graphs.

We conclude that there may be good indicators in mid-infrared and\nfar-infrared which could differentiate maser and non-maser Seyfert 2 galaxies.\nUpcoming infrared facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, may be\nable to exploit these and other useful criteria and tracers for water megamaser\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 10:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

It could be done on\nvarious granularities, e.g., classes, methods, and statements. Most of the\nautomated fault localization (AFL) approaches are coarse-grained because it is\nchallenging to accurately locate fine-grained faulty software elements, e.g.,\nstatements. SBFL, based on dynamic execution of test cases only, is simple,\nintuitive, and generic (working on various granularities). However, its\naccuracy deserves significant improvement. To this end, in this paper, we\npropose a hybrid fine-grained AFL approach based on both dynamic spectrums and\nstatic statement types. The rationale of the approach is that some types of\nstatements are significantly more/less error-prone than others, and thus\nstatement types could be exploited for fault localization. On a crop of faulty\nprograms, we compute the error-proneness for each type of statements, and\nassign priorities to special statement types that are steadily more/less\nerror-prone than others. For a given faulty program under test, we first\nleverage traditional spectrum-based fault localization algorithm to identify\nall suspicious statements and to compute their suspicious scores. For each of\nthe resulting suspicious statements, we retrieve its statement type as well as\nthe special priority associated with the type. The final suspicious score is\nthe product of the SBFL suspicious score and the priority assigned to the\nstatement type. A significant advantage of the approach is that it is simple\nand intuitive, making it efficient and easy to interpret/implement. We evaluate\nthe proposed approach on widely used benchmark Defects4J. The evaluation\nresults suggest that the proposed approach outperforms widely used SBFL,\nreducing the absolute waste effort (AWE) by 9.3% on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 11:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

The core operation in a DNN is the dot product between quantized\ninputs and weights. Prior works exploit the weight/input repetition that arises\ndue to quantization to avoid redundant computations in Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs). However, in this paper we show that their effectiveness is\nseverely limited when applied to Fully-Connected (FC) layers, which are\ncommonly used in state-of-the-art DNNs, as it is the case of modern Recurrent\nNeural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer models.\n  To improve energy-efficiency of FC computation we present CREW, a hardware\naccelerator that implements Computation Reuse and an Efficient Weight Storage\nmechanism to exploit the large number of repeated weights in FC layers. CREW\nfirst performs the multiplications of the unique weights by their respective\ninputs and stores the results in an on-chip buffer. The storage requirements\nare modest due to the small number of unique weights and the relatively small\nsize of the input compared to convolutional layers. Next, CREW computes each\noutput by fetching and adding its required products. To this end, each weight\nis replaced offline by an index in the buffer of unique products. Indices are\ntypically smaller than the quantized weights, since the number of unique\nweights for each input tends to be much lower than the range of quantized\nweights, which reduces storage and memory bandwidth requirements.\n  Overall, CREW greatly reduces the number of multiplications and provides\nsignificant savings in model memory footprint and memory bandwidth usage. We\nevaluate CREW on a diverse set of modern DNNs. On average, CREW provides 2.61x\nspeedup and 2.42x energy savings over a TPU-like accelerator.

Up until now, this blazar had not been the subject of any detailed\nMWL observations. It has a rather hard photon index at GeV energies and was\nconsidered a candidate extreme high-synchrotronpeaked source. MAGIC\nobservations resulted in the first-time detection of the source in VHE with a\nstatistical significance of 7.6$\\sigma$. The average integral VHE flux of the\nsource is 6 $\\pm$ 1% of the Crab nebula flux above 400 GeV. X-ray coverage was\nprovided by Swift-XRT, XMMNewton, and NuSTAR. The long continuous X-ray\nobservations were separated by $\\sim$ 9 h, both showing clear hour scale\nflares. In the XMM-Newton data, both the rise and decay timescales are longer\nin the soft X-ray than in the hard X-ray band, indicating the presence of a\nparticle cooling regime. The X-ray variability timescales were used to\nconstrain the size of the emission region and the strength of the magnetic\nfield. The data allowed us to determine the synchrotron peak frequency and\nclassify the source as a flaring high, but not extreme, synchrotron peaked\nobject. Considering the constraints and variability patterns from the X-ray\ndata, we model the broad-band spectral energy distribution. We applied a simple\none-zone model, which could not reproduce the radio emission and the shape of\nthe optical emission, and a two-component leptonic model with two interacting\ncomponents, enabling us to reproduce the emission from radio to VHE band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 11:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

In this paper, we introduce the problem of meta\nalgorithm selection, which essentially asks for the best way to combine a given\nset of algorithm selectors. We present a general methodological framework for\nmeta algorithm selection as well as several concrete learning methods as\ninstantiations of this framework, essentially combining ideas of meta learning\nand ensemble learning.

In\nparticular, we study a fully analytical feedforward neural network trained on\nthe widely adopted Fashion-MNIST dataset, and study the dynamics associated\nwith the hyperparameters in back-propagation during the training process. We\nfind that for the basic algorithm of stochastic gradient descent with momentum,\nin the range around the commonly used hyperparameter values, clear scaling\nrelations are present with respect to the training time during the ordered\nphase in the phase diagram, and the model's optimal generalization power at the\nedge of chaos is similar across different training parameter combinations. In\nthe chaotic phase, the same scaling no longer exists. The scaling allows us to\nchoose the training parameters to achieve faster training without sacrificing\nperformance. In addition, we find that the commonly used model regularization\nmethod - weight decay - effectively pushes the model towards the ordered phase\nto achieve better performance. Leveraging on this fact and the scaling\nrelations in the other hyperparameters, we derived a principled guideline for\nhyperparameter determination, such that the model can achieve optimal\nperformance by saturating it at the edge of chaos.

However, for the present case\nof a WLM solution, we observe that this elastic instability is greatly\ninfluenced by the breakage and reformation mechanisms of the wormlike micelles.\nIn particular, we notice that the intensity of this instability (characterized\nby the fluctuating flow fields) increases as the Weissenberg number increases;\nhowever, beyond a critical value of it, this elastic instability and/or the\nflow field fluctuation is suppressed because of the breakage of long micelles.\nThis is in contrast to the polymer solutions for which the flow field gradually\ntransits to a more chaotic and turbulent-like state (or the so-called elastic\nturbulence state) as the Weissenberg number gradually increases.

Nonetheless, the practicality of such enclave-enhanced malware\nand its potential impact on all phases of the ransomware lifecyle remain\nunclear. Given the demonstrated capacity of ransomware authors to innovate in\norder to better extort their victims (e.g. through the adoption of untraceable\nvirtual currencies and anonymity networks), it is important to better\nunderstand the risks involved and identify potential mitigations.\n  As a basis for comprehensive security and performance analysis of\nenclave-enhanced ransomware, we present RansomClave, a family of ransomware\nthat securely manage their cryptographic keys using an enclave.

In recent papers [5, 6, 7, 8]\nseveral unknown facets of the Euler flows have been discovered, including\nuniversality properties of the stationary solutions to the Euler equations. The\nstudy of these universality features was suggested by Tao as a novel way to\naddress the problem of global existence for Euler and Navier-Stokes [28].\nUniversality of the Euler equations was proved in [7] for stationary solutions\nusing a contact mirror which reflects a Beltrami flow as a Reeb vector field.\nThis contact mirror permits the use of advanced geometric techniques in fluid\ndynamics. On the other hand, motivated by Tao's approach relating Turing\nmachines to Navier-Stokes equations, a Turing complete stationary Euler\nsolution on a Riemannian $3$-dimensional sphere was constructed in [8]. Since\nthe Turing completeness of a vector field can be characterized in terms of the\nhalting problem, which is known to be undecidable [30], a striking consequence\nof this fact is that a Turing complete Euler flow exhibits undecidable particle\npaths [8]. In this article, we give a panoramic overview of this fascinating\nsubject, and go one step further in investigating the undecidability of\ndifferent dynamical properties of Turing complete flows.

To significantly improve the communication efficiency of FL,\nover-the-air computation allows a large number of mobile devices to\nconcurrently upload their local models by exploiting the superposition property\nof wireless multi-access channels. Due to wireless channel fading, the model\naggregation error at the edge server is dominated by the weakest channel among\nall devices, causing severe straggler issues. In this paper, we propose a\nrelay-assisted cooperative FL scheme to effectively address the straggler\nissue. In particular, we deploy multiple half-duplex relays to cooperatively\nassist the devices in uploading the local model updates to the edge server. The\nnature of the over-the-air computation poses system objectives and constraints\nthat are distinct from those in traditional relay communication systems.\nMoreover, the strong coupling between the design variables renders the\noptimization of such a system challenging. To tackle the issue, we propose an\nalternating-optimization-based algorithm to optimize the transceiver and relay\noperation with low complexity. Then, we analyze the model aggregation error in\na single-relay case and show that our relay-assisted scheme achieves a smaller\nerror than the one without relays provided that the relay transmit power and\nthe relay channel gains are sufficiently large. The analysis provides critical\ninsights on relay deployment in the implementation of cooperative FL. Extensive\nnumerical results show that our design achieves faster convergence compared\nwith state-of-the-art schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 14:06:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 12:47:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 04:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

Gaining and\ndeveloping skills, both technical and soft skills, are the critical building\nblocks for a successful career. The traditional teaching process, which\nincludes delivering lectures and conducting exams, emphasizes the upliftment of\ntechnical knowledge rather than building self-esteem and enhancing skills\ndevelopment among students. Development of non-technical skills like\nself-esteem, life-long learning among students is vital for a successful\ncareer. This paper targets to achieve the objective of identifying ways to\nempower students with non-technical skills along with technical skills. The\napproach adopted in this research work is to transform the delivery of a\nfaculty-wide course from teaching to coaching. One salient difference between\nteaching and coaching is to move students motivation away from grades towards\nlife-long learning. Thus, university students maximize skills through coaching\nlike course structure, course delivery, course assessment, and student\ninvolvement. As a case study, the proposed approach was successfully tested and\nvalidated on a course taught in the Faculty of Computing and Information\nTechnology (FCIT) at King Abdulaziz University (KAU). The outcome of this case\nstudy reveals that there is substantial potential towards enhancement of\nself-responsibility.

The\nsystematic errors of the models must stay below statistical errors to prevent\nbiases in parameter estimation and to carry out meaningful tests of GR.\nComparisons of the models against numerical relativity (NR) waveforms provide\nan excellent measure of systematic errors. A complementary approach is to use\nbalance laws provided by Einstein's equations to measure faithfulness of a\ncandidate waveform against exact GR. Each balance law focuses on a physical\nobservable and measures the accuracy of the candidate waveform vis a vis that\nobservable. Therefore, this analysis can provide new physical insights into\nsources of errors. In this paper we focus on the angular momentum balance law,\nusing post-Newtonian theory to calculate the initial angular momentum,\nsurrogate fits to obtain the remnant spin and waveforms from models to\ncalculate the flux. The consistency check provided by the angular momentum\nbalance law brings out the marked improvement in the passage from\n\\texttt{IMRPhenomPv2} to \\texttt{IMRPhenomXPHM} and from \\texttt{SEOBNRv3} to\n\\texttt{SEOBNRv4PHM} and shows that the most recent versions agree quite well\nwith exact GR.

We factor out regularly reoccurring\ntraffic phenomena, such as rush hours, mainly induced by the daytime, by\nmodelling and systematically exploiting temporal traffic load outliers. We\npresent an algorithm that first constructs connected subgraphs of the road\nnetwork based on the traffic speed outliers.

Conventionally, the sensing and communication stages are\nexecuted sequentially, which results in excessive amount of dataset generation\nand uploading time. This paper proposes to accelerate edge intelligence via\nintegrated sensing and communication (ISAC). As such, the sensing and\ncommunication stages are merged so as to make the best use of the wireless\nsignals for the dual purpose of dataset generation and uploading. However, ISAC\nalso introduces additional interference between sensing and communication\nfunctionalities. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a\nclassification error minimization formulation to design the ISAC beamforming\nand time allocation. The globally optimal solution is derived via the rank-1\nguaranteed semidefinite relaxation, and performance analysis is performed to\nquantify the ISAC gain over that of conventional edge intelligence.

Another way to\namplify optical signals is to utilize the Kerr nonlinearity of optical fibers\nor waveguides via parametric processes. Such parametric amplifiers of\ntravelling continuous wave have been originally developed in the microwave\ndomain, and enable quantum-limited signal amplification with high peak gain,\nbroadband gain spectrum tailored via dispersion control, and ability to enable\nphase sensitive amplification.

The vacuum solutions\nof the theory are investigated and it is found that the theory perfectly admits\na de-Sitter-like evolution of the universe. The cosmological equations are\nderived and it is found that there are two correction terms arising as\nmodification of the gravity. Two specific toy models of the form $Q+\\eta\n\\left(\\textbf{T}^2\\right)^{n}$ and $f_{0}Q^{m} \\left(\\textbf{T}^2\\right)^{n}$\nare explored to gain further insights into the dynamics of the theory.

Blockchain, being a decentralized immutable ledger,\nhas the potential to promote the development of smart cities by guaranteeing\ntransparency, data security, interoperability, and privacy.

However, most of the\nstudies are focused on estimating energy consumption, not in exploring the\nfactors that determine it.\n  Goal: To explore the factors that determine maximum energy consumption of\nBitcoin miners. In particular, analyze the limits of energy consumption, and to\nwhich extent variations of the factors could produce its reduction.\n  Method: Estimate the overall profit of all Bitcoin miners during a certain\nperiod of time, and the costs (including energy) that they face during that\ntime, because of the mining activity. The underlying assumptions is that miners\nwill only consume energy to mine Bitcoin if they have the expectation of\nprofit, and at the same time they are competitive with respect of each other.\nTherefore, they will operate as a group in the point where profits balance\nexpenditures.\n  Results: We show a basic equation that determines energy consumption based on\nsome specific factors: minting, transaction fees, exchange rate, energy price,\nand amortization cost. We also define the Amortization Factor, which can be\ncomputed for mining devices based on their cost and energy consumption, helps\nto understand how the cost of equipment influences total energy consumption.\n  Conclusions: The factors driving energy consumption are identified, and from\nthem, some ways in which Bitcoin energy consumption could be reduced are\ndiscussed. Some of these ways do not reduce the most important properties of\nBitcoin, such as the chances of control of the aggregated hashpower, or the\nfundamentals of the proof of work mechanism.

Robust topology optimization (RTO) also incorporates\nthe effect of input uncertainties and produces a design with the best average\nperformance of the structure while reducing the response sensitivity to input\nuncertainties. It is computationally expensive to carry out RTO using finite\nelement and Monte Carlo sampling. In this work, we use neural network\nsurrogates to enable a faster solution approach via surrogate-based\noptimization and build a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to transform the the\nhigh dimensional design space into a low dimensional one. Furthermore, finite\nelement solvers will be replaced by a neural network surrogate. Also, to\nfurther facilitate the design exploration, we limit our search to a subspace,\nwhich consists of designs that are solutions to deterministic topology\noptimization problems under different realizations of input uncertainties.

We do so without using techniques\nfrom transcendental number theory. \\par One of the main difficulty in\nDiophantine equations is being unable to use tools from calculus to solve this\nequation as the domain of variable is $\\mathbb{N}$. We also provide an attempt\nto overcome that by providing reduction of Skolem problem to solving a one\nvariable equation (which involves polynomials, exponentials with real bases and\n$\\cos t \\theta$ function with $t$ ranging over reals and $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$)\nover reals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 05:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

Phase-change materials (PCMs), with significant\ncontrast of their optical properties between their amorphous and crystalline\nstates, have demonstrated promising potentials in reconfigurable nanophotonics.\nHerein, we leverage tunable all-dielectric reflective metasurfaces made of\nnewly emerged classes of low-loss optical PCMs, i.e., antimony trisulphide\n(Sb$_2$S$_3$) and antimony triselenide (Sb$_2$Se$_3$), with superb\ncharacteristics to realize switchable, high-saturation, high-efficiency and\nhigh-resolution dynamic meta-pixels.

We find that there has been a clear\nsign of recovery in some regards, as scientists' time spent on their work has\nalmost returned to pre-pandemic levels. However, the latest data also reveals a\nnew dimension in which the pandemic is affecting the scientific workforce: the\nrate of initiating new research projects. Except for the small fraction of\nscientists who directly engaged in COVID-related research, most scientists\nstarted significantly fewer new research projects in 2020. This decline is most\npronounced amongst the same demographic groups of scientists who reported the\nlargest initial disruptions: female scientists and those with young children.\nYet in sharp contrast to the earlier phase of the pandemic, when there were\nlarge disparities across scientific fields, this loss of new projects appears\nremarkably homogeneous across fields. Analyses of large-scale publication data\nreveal a global decline in the rate of new collaborations, especially in\nnon-COVID-related preprints, which is consistent with the reported decline in\nnew projects.
