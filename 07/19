We demonstrate that the Wolff algorithm suffers from\na much longer correlation time than in the pure Ising model, caused by isolated\n(groups of) spins which are infrequently visited by the algorithm. With a\nsimple argument we prove that these cause the correlation time $\\tau_w$ to be\nbounded from below by $L^{z_w}$ with a dynamical exponent $z_w=\\gamma /\n\\nu\\approx 1.75$ for a bond concentration $p < 1$. Furthermore, we numerically\nshow that this lower bound is actually taken for several values of $p$ in the\nrange $0.5 < p < 1$. Moreover, we show that the Swendsen-Wang algorithm does\nnot suffer from the same problem. Consequently, it has a much shorter\ncorrelation time, shorter than in the pure Ising model even. Numerically at $p\n= 0.6$, we find that its dynamical exponent is $z_{\\rm sw} = 0.09(4)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2021 20:53:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 15:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

GPUs are an expensive\nresource, and boosting utilization of GPUs without causing performance\ndegradation of individual workloads is an important and challenging problem.\nAlthough services like MPS support simultaneous execution of multiple\nco-operative kernels on a single device, they do not solve the above problem\nfor uncooperative kernels, MPS being oblivious to the resource needs of each\nkernel.\n  We propose a fully automated compiler-assisted scheduling framework. The\ncompiler constructs GPU tasks by identifying kernel launches and their related\nGPU operations (e.g. memory allocations). For each GPU task, a probe is\ninstrumented in the host-side code right before its launch point. At runtime,\nthe probe conveys the information about the task's resource requirements (e.g.\nmemory and compute cores) to a scheduler, such that the scheduler can place the\ntask on an appropriate device based on the task's resource requirements and\ndevices' load in a memory-safe, resource-aware manner.

The library provides an extensive suite\nof methods for estimating qubit coherence times due to a variety of commonly\nconsidered noise channels. While all functionality of $\\textbf{scqubits}$ can\nbe accessed programatically, the package also implements GUI-like widgets that,\nwith a few clicks can help users both create relevant Python objects, as well\nas explore their properties through various plots. When applicable, the library\nharnesses the computing power of multiple cores via multiprocessing.\n$\\textbf{scqubits}$ further exposes a direct interface to the Quantum Toolbox\nin Python (QuTiP) package, allowing the user to efficiently leverage QuTiP's\nproven capabilities for simulating time evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2021 22:37:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 21:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

A variety of laboratory ice spectra simulating different chemical\nenvironments, ice morphology as well as thermal and energetic processing are\ndemanded to provide an accurate interpretation of the infrared spectra of\nprotostars. To answer which combination of laboratory data best fit the\nobservations, an automated statistically-based computational approach becomes\nnecessary. Aims. To introduce a new approach, based on evolutionary algorithms,\nto search for molecules in ice mantles via spectral decomposition of infrared\nobservational data with laboratory ice spectra. Methods. A publicly available\nand open-source fitting tool, called ENIIGMA (dEcompositioN of Infrared Ice\nfeatures using Genetic Modelling Algorithms), is introduced. The tool has\ndedicated Python functions to carry out continuum determination of the\nprotostellar spectra, silicate extraction, spectral decomposition and\nstatistical analysis to calculate confidence intervals and quantify degeneracy.\nAs an assessment of the code, several tests were conducted with known ice\nsamples and constructed mixtures. A complete analysis of the Elias 29 spectrum\nwas performed as well. Results. The ENIIGMA fitting tool can identify the\ncorrect ice samples and their fractions in all checks with known samples tested\nin this paper. Concerning the Elias 29 spectrum, the broad spectral range\nbetween 2.5-20 $\\mu$m was successfully decomposed after continuum determination\nand silicate extraction.

In\n2005, Zhuang and Gao conjectured that $\\mathsf E(G)=\\mathsf d(G)+|G|$ for every\nfinite group, where $\\mathsf d(G)$ is the small Davenport constant. Very\nrecently, we confirmed this conjecture for the case when $G=\\langle x, y|\nx^p=y^m=1, x^{-1}yx=y^r\\rangle$ where $p$ is the smallest prime divisor of\n$|G|$ and $\\mbox{gcd}(p(r-1), m)=1$. In this paper, we study the associated\ninverse problems on $\\mathsf d(G)$ and $\\mathsf E(G)$.

Decreased tissue thickness, specifically in the stratum corneum (the\noutermost layer of the tissue), causes discomfort and inflammation, and is\nrelated to several severe diseases of the tissue. In order to maintain both\nstratum corneum thickness and overall tissue thickness it is necessary for the\nsystem to balance cell proliferation and cell loss. Cell proliferation in the\nepidermis occurs in the basal layer and causes constant upwards movement in the\ntissue. Cell loss occurs when dead cells at the top of the tissue are lost to\nthe environment through a process called desquamation. Desquamation is thought\nto occur through a gradual reduction in adhesion between cells, due to the\ncleaving of adhesion proteins by enzymes, in the stratum corneum.\n  In this paper we will investigate combining a (mass action) subcellular model\nof desquamation with a three dimensional (cell centre based) multicellular\nmodel of the interfollicular epidermis to better understand maintenance of\nepidermal thickness. These investigations show that hypothesised biological\nmodels for the degradation of cell-cell adhesion from the literature are able\nto provide a consistent rate of cell loss in the multicellular model. This loss\nbalances proliferation, and hence maintains a homeostatic tissue thickness.\nMoreover, we find that multiple proliferative cell populations in the basal\nlayer can be represented by a single proliferative cell population, simplifying\ninvestigations with this model.\n  The model is used to investigate a disorder (Netherton Syndrome) which\ndisrupts desquamation. The model shows how biochemical changes can cause\ndisruptions to the tissue, resulting in a reduced tissue thickness and\nconsequently diminishing the protective role of the tissue.

Therefore, probabilistic (weak)\nlabels produced by weak supervision tools are used to seed a process in which\ninfluential samples with weak labels are identified and cleaned by several\nhuman annotators to improve the model performance. To lower the overall cost\nand computational overhead of this process, we propose a solution called CHEF\n(CHEap and Fast label cleaning), which consists of the following three\ncomponents. First, to reduce the cost of human annotators, we use Infl, which\nprioritizes the most influential training samples for cleaning and provides\ncleaned labels to save the cost of one human annotator. Second, to accelerate\nthe sample selector phase and the model constructor phase, we use Increm-Infl\nto incrementally produce influential samples, and DeltaGrad-L to incrementally\nupdate the model. Third, we redesign the typical label cleaning pipeline so\nthat human annotators iteratively clean smaller batch of samples rather than\none big batch of samples. This yields better over all model performance and\nenables possible early termination when the expected model performance has been\nachieved.

Here, we extend the coupled-mode theory of one-dimensional\nnon-Hermitian resonator arrays to study the effects of the imaginary part of\nthe inter-cavity coupling, which is a second-order term and attributed to\nmaterial amplification, absorption, and radiation. By taking an appropriate\ngauge for the model, we clarify that the imaginary coupling components have a\nsymmetric form in the effective Hamiltonian and hence represent\nnon-Hermiticity. These additional factors can lift the gain- and loss-based EP\ndegeneracies. However, they are proportional to the sum of the imaginary\npermittivities for involved cavity pairs. Thus, when the amplification and\nabsorption of adjacent cavities are balanced, their contribution to the\nimaginary coupling is canceled, and the EP singularity can be restored.\nRadiation-induced imaginary couplings measure the change in net radiation loss\nby the interference between cavity modes. Their impact on the EP can also be\ncounteracted by small cavity resonance detuning even in loss-biased cases. We\nshow and analyze eligible simulation examples based on photonic crystal\nnanocavities, and highlight design of an ideal EP degeneracy that is protected\nby generalized PT symmetry and induced by radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 03:38:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2021 02:49:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 01:44:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

This notion enables one to measure the\nrobustness of compression algorithms in terms of errors and/or dynamic changes\noccurring in the input string. In this paper, we analyze the worst-case\nmultiplicative sensitivity of string compression algorithms, which is defined\nby $\\max_{T \\in \\Sigma^n}\\{C(T')/C(T) : ed(T, T') = 1\\}$, where $ed(T, T')$\ndenotes the edit distance between $T$ and $T'$. For the most common versions of\nthe Lempel-Ziv 77 compressors, we prove that the worst-case multiplicative\nsensitivity is upper bounded by a small constant, and give matching lower\nbounds. We generalize these results to the smallest bidirectional scheme $b$.\nIn addition, we show that the sensitivity of a grammar-based compressor called\nGCIS is also a small constant. Further, we extend the notion of the worst-case\nsensitivity to string repetitiveness measures such as the smallest string\nattractor size $\\gamma$ and the substring complexity $\\delta$, and show that\nthe worst-case sensitivity of $\\delta$ is also a small constant.

Since the topological class of a path and visible landmarks\nduring traveling the path are closely related, the proposed algorithm checks\ndistinctive topological classes to choose the class with abundant visual\ninformation.

Traditional congestion controls (CC) have no perception of these\ndemands. Consequently, literatures have explored the objective-specific\nalgorithms, which are based on either offline training or online learning, to\nadapt to certain application demands. However, once generated, such algorithms\nare tailored to a specific performance objective function. Newly emerged\nperformance demands in a changeable network environment require either\nexpensive retraining (in the case of offline training), or manually redesigning\na new objective function (in the case of online learning). To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel architecture, DeepCC. It generates a CC agent that\nis generically applicable to a wide range of application requirements and\nnetwork conditions. The key idea of DeepCC is to leverage both offline deep\nreinforcement learning and online fine-tuning. In the offline phase, instead of\ntraining towards a specific objective function, DeepCC trains its deep neural\nnetwork model using multi-objective optimization. With the trained model,\nDeepCC offers near Pareto optimal policies w.r.t different user-specified\ntrade-offs between throughput, delay, and loss rate without any redesigning or\nretraining. In addition, a quick online fine-tuning phase further helps DeepCC\nachieve the application-specific demands under dynamic network conditions. The\nsimulation and real-world experiments show that DeepCC outperforms\nstate-of-the-art schemes in a wide range of settings. DeepCC gains a higher\ntarget completion ratio of application requirements up to 67.4% than that of\nother schemes, even in an untrained environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 05:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

First of all, face.evoLVe is composed of key components that\ncover the full process of face analytics, including face alignment, data\nprocessing, various backbones, losses, and alternatives with bags of tricks for\nimproving performance. Later, face.evoLVe supports multi-GPU training on top of\ndifferent deep learning platforms, such as PyTorch and PaddlePaddle, which\nfacilitates researchers to work on both large-scale datasets with millions of\nimages and low-shot counterparts with limited well-annotated data. More\nimportantly, along with face.evoLVe, images before & after alignment in the\ncommon benchmark datasets are released with source codes and trained models\nprovided. All these efforts lower the technical burdens in reproducing the\nexisting methods for comparison, while users of our library could focus on\ndeveloping advanced approaches more efficiently. Last but not least,\nface.evoLVe is well designed and vibrantly evolving, so that new face\nrecognition approaches can be easily plugged into our framework. Note that we\nhave used face.evoLVe to participate in a number of face recognition\ncompetitions and secured the first place.

In the past few years, the popular encoder-decoder architectures\nbased on CNNs (e.g., U-Net) have been successfully applied in the task of\nmedical image segmentation. However, due to the locality of convolution\noperations, they demonstrate limitations in learning global context and\nlong-range spatial relations. Recently, several researchers try to introduce\ntransformers to both the encoder and decoder components with promising results,\nbut the efficiency requires further improvement due to the high computational\ncomplexity of transformers. In this paper, we propose LeViT-UNet, which\nintegrates a LeViT Transformer module into the U-Net architecture, for fast and\naccurate medical image segmentation. Specifically, we use LeViT as the encoder\nof the LeViT-UNet, which better trades off the accuracy and efficiency of the\nTransformer block. Moreover, multi-scale feature maps from transformer blocks\nand convolutional blocks of LeViT are passed into the decoder via\nskip-connection, which can effectively reuse the spatial information of the\nfeature maps. Our experiments indicate that the proposed LeViT-UNet achieves\nbetter performance comparing to various competing methods on several\nchallenging medical image segmentation benchmarks including Synapse and ACDC.\nCode and models will be publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/apple1986/LeViT_UNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 05:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

This innovative split learning method transfers CCTV\nfootage captured with a drone to a nearby server to run a deep neural network\nto detect a fire's presence in real-time without exposing the original data. We\ndevise a scenario where surveillance UAVs roam around the suburb, recording any\nunnatural behavior.

Due to the\nresource limitations of mobile UAVs, the UAV does not have the capacity to run\nan entire deep neural network on its own. This is where the split learning\nmethod comes in handy. The UAV runs the deep neural network only up to the\nfirst hidden layer and sends only the feature map to the cloud server, where\nthe rest of the deep neural network is processed. By ensuring that the learning\nprocess is divided between the UAV and the server, the privacy of raw data is\nsecured while the UAV does not overexert its minimal resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 05:58:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

As the\nUniverse has grown in metal abundance over cosmic time, this thermodynamic\nbehaviour has evolved from a primordial regime dominated by the competition\nbetween compressional heating and molecular hydrogen cooling to a modern regime\nwhere the dominant process in dense gas is protostellar radiation feedback,\ntransmitted to the gas by dust-gas collisions. In this paper we map out the\nprimordial-to-modern transition by constructing a model for the thermodynamics\nof collapsing, dusty gas clouds at a wide range of metallicities. We show the\ntransition from the primordial regime to the modern regime begins at\nmetallicity $Z\\sim 10^{-4} \\rm{Z_\\odot}$, passes through an intermediate stage\nwhere metal line cooling is dominant at $Z \\sim 10^{-3}\\,\\rm{Z_{\\odot}}$, and\nthen transitions to the modern dust- and feedback-dominated regime at $Z\\sim\n10^{-2} \\rm{Z_\\odot}$. In low pressure environments like the Milky Way, this\ntransition is accompanied by a dramatic change in the characteristic stellar\nmass, from $\\sim 50\\,\\rm{M_\\odot}$ at $Z \\sim 10^{-6}\\,\\rm{Z_{\\odot}}$ to $\\sim\n0.3\\,\\rm{M_\\odot}$ once radiation feedback begins to dominate, which marks the\nappearance of the modern bottom-heavy Milky Way IMF. In the high pressure\nenvironments typical of massive elliptical galaxies, the characteristic mass\nfor the modern, dust-dominated regime falls to $\\sim 0.1\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$, thus\nproviding an explanation for the more bottom-heavy IMF observed in these\ngalaxies.

To\nimprove both simultaneously is hindered by the physical limitation that good\nmetals with high electrical conductivity have large carrier densities that push\nthe plasma edge into the ultra-violet range. Transparent conductors are\ncompromises between electrical conductivity, requiring mobile electrons, and\noptical transparency based on immobile charges to avoid screening of visible\nlight. Technological solutions reflect this trade-off, achieving the desired\ntransparencies by reducing the conductor thickness or carrier density at the\nexpense of a lower conductance.

However, due to the\nconstraints of size, cost, and power consumption, it is usually considered\nunrealistic to use a large-scale antenna array at the user side. Inspired by\nthe emerging technique of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), we firstly\npropose the concept of user-side RIS (US-RIS) for facilitating the employment\nof a large-scale antenna array at the user side in a cost- and energy-efficient\nway. In contrast to the existing employments of RIS, which belong to the family\nof base-station-side RISs (BSS-RISs), the US-RIS concept by definition\nfacilitates the employment of RIS at the user side for the first time. This is\nachieved by conceiving a multi-layer structure to realize a compact\nform-factor. Furthermore, our theoretical results demonstrate that, in contrast\nto the existing single-layer structure, where only the phase of the signal\nreflected from RIS can be adjusted, the amplitude of the signal penetrating\nmulti-layer US-RIS can also be partially controlled, which brings about a new\ndegree of freedom (DoF) for beamformer design that can be beneficially\nexploited for performance enhancement. In addition, based on the proposed\nmulti-layer US-RIS, we formulate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximization\nproblem of US-RIS-aided communications. Due to the non-convexity of the problem\nintroduced by this multi-layer structure, we propose a multi-layer transmit\nbeamformer design relying on an iterative algorithm for finding the optimal\nsolution by alternately updating each variable.

As present,\ndata-driven causal effect estimation faces two main challenges, i.e., selection\nbias and the missing of counterfactual. To address these two issues, most of\nthe existing approaches tend to reduce the selection bias by learning a\nbalanced representation, and then to estimate the counterfactual through the\nrepresentation. However, they heavily rely on the finely hand-crafted metric\nfunctions when learning balanced representations, which generally doesn't work\nwell for the situations where the original distribution is complicated.

We propose a new change point procedure, called\n'groupInspect', that exploits the group sparsity structure to estimate a\nprojection direction so as to aggregate information across the component series\nto successfully estimate the change-point in the mean structure of the series.\nWe prove that the estimated projection direction is minimax optimal, up to\nlogarithmic factors, when all group sizes are of comparable order. Moreover,\nour theory provide strong guarantees on the rate of convergence of the\nchange-point location estimator. Numerical studies demonstrates the competitive\nperformance of groupInspect in a wide range of settings and a real data example\nconfirms the practical usefulness of our procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 09:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

In this problem, there is a parameter k\\geq 2, and items\nof rational sizes in [0,1] are to be packed into bins, such that no bin has\nmore than k items or total size larger than 1. The goal is to minimize the\nnumber of bins.\n  A recently introduced concept, called the price of clustering, deals with\ninputs that are presented in a way that they are split into clusters. Thus, an\nitem has two attributes which are its size and its cluster. The goal is to\nmeasure the relation between an optimal solution that cannot combine items of\ndifferent clusters into bins, and an optimal solution that can combine items of\ndifferent clusters arbitrarily. Usually the number of clusters may be large,\nwhile clusters are relatively small, though not trivially small. Such problems\nare related to greedy bin packing algorithms, and to batched bin packing, which\nis similar to the price of clustering, but there is a constant number of large\nclusters. We analyze the price of clustering for BPCC, including the parametric\ncase with bounded item sizes. We discuss several greedy algorithms for this\nproblem that were not studied in the past, and comment on batched bin packing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 09:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

While the diversity of\napproaches has led to a deeper understanding of the problem space, the lack of\na standardized way to specify MEP problems independently of solution approaches\nhas created difficulties in comparing performance of planners, identifying\npromising techniques, exploring new strategies like ensemble methods, and\nmaking it easy for new researchers to contribute to this research area.

To cope with\nthe nonlinearity and the degeneracy of the Richards equation the GRW flow\nsolver uses linearization techniques similar to the $L$-scheme developed in\nfinite element/volume approaches. Numerical schemes for reactive transport,\ncoupled with the flow solver via numerical solutions for saturation and water\nflux, are implemented in splitting procedures.

Yet, often, data from at least two different\ndomains is available which we can exploit to train the model in a way that it\ndisregards domain-specific information.

Quantum trajectories,\ninstead, model the outcome of ideal single experiments -- the ``clicks'' of a\nperfect detector due to, e.g., spontaneous emission. The correct description of\nquantum jumps, which are related to random events characterizing a sudden\nchange in the wave function of an open quantum system, is pivotal to the\ndefinition of quantum trajectories. In this article, we extend the formalism of\nquantum trajectories to open quantum systems with ultrastrong coupling (USC)\nbetween light and matter by properly defining jump operators in this regime. In\nsuch systems, exotic higher-order quantum-state- and energy-transfer can take\nplace without conserving the total number of excitations in the system. The\nemitted field of such USC systems bears signatures of these higher-order\nprocesses, and significantly differs from similar processes at lower coupling\nstrengths. Notably, the emission statistics must be taken at a single quantum\ntrajectory level, since the signatures of these processes are washed out by the\n``averaging'' of a master equation. We analyze the impact of the chosen\nunravelling (i.e., how one collects the output field of the system) for the\nquantum trajectories and show that these effects of the higher-order USC\nprocesses can be revealed in experiments by constructing histograms of detected\nquantum jumps. We illustrate these ideas by analyzing the excitation of two\natoms by a single photon~[Garziano et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.117, 043601 (2016)].\nFor example, quantum trajectories reveal that keeping track of the quantum\njumps from the atoms allow to reconstruct both the oscillations between one\nphoton and two atoms, as well as emerging Rabi oscillations between the two\natoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 11:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

The gauge invariant\nleading-order transition amplitudes have been expressed by using either the\nconventional Lorentz structures, or the helicity amplitudes, where it was\neffective. The renormalization couplings of the charmonium states have been\nstrictly fixed by the compositeness conditions that excludes the constituent\ndegrees of freedom from the space of physical states. We use the basic model\nparameters for the constituent c-quark mass $m_c=1.80$ GeV and the global\ninfrared cutoff $\\lambda=0.181$ GeV. We additionally introduce only one\nadjustable parameter $\\varrho>0$ common for the charmonium states\n$\\eta_c({}^1\\!S_0)$, $J/\\psi({}^3\\!S_1)$, $\\chi_{c0}({^{3}}\\!P_{0})$,\n$\\chi_{c1}({^{3}}\\!P_{1})$, $h_c({^{1}}\\!P_{1})$, and\n$\\chi_{c2}({^{3}}\\!P_{2})$ to describe the quark distribution inside the\nhadron. This parameter describes the ratio between the charmonium size and its\nphysical mass. The optimal value $\\varrho=0.485$ has been fixed by fitting the\nlatest data for the partial widths of the one-photon radiative decays of the\ntriplet $\\chi_{cJ}({^{3}}\\!P_{J}), J=\\{0,1,2\\}$. Then, we calculate\ncorresponding fractional widths for states $J/\\psi({}^3\\!S_1)$ and\n$h_c({^{1}}\\!P_{1})$. Estimated results are in good agreement with the latest\ndata.

To do so well, robots need not have primitives that make\nintuitive sense to humans. This becomes of paramount importance when robots are\ndamaged and no longer move as designed. Here we propose a goal function we call\n\"coverage\", that represents the usefulness of a library of locomotion\nprimitives in a manner agnostic to the particulars of the primitives\nthemselves. We demonstrate the ability to optimize coverage on both simulated\nand physical robots, and show that coverage can be rapidly recovered after\ninjury. This suggests that by optimizing for coverage, robots can sustain their\nability to navigate through the world even in the face of significant\nmechanical failures. The benefits of this approach are enhanced by\nsample-efficient, data-driven approaches to system identification that can\nrapidly inform the optimization of primitives. We found that the number of\ndegrees of freedom improved the rate of recovery of our simulated robots, a\nrare result in the fields of gait optimization and reinforcement learning.

The Res2Net approach designs a\nresidual-like connection between feature groups within one block, which\nincreases the possible receptive fields and improves the system's detection\ngeneralizability. However, such a residual-like connection is performed by a\ndirect addition between feature groups without channel-wise priority. We argue\nthat the information across channels may not contribute to spoofing cues\nequally, and the less relevant channels are expected to be suppressed before\nadding onto the next feature group, so that the system can generalize better to\nunseen attacks. This argument motivates the current work that presents a novel,\nchannel-wise gated Res2Net (CG-Res2Net), which modifies Res2Net to enable a\nchannel-wise gating mechanism in the connection between feature groups. This\ngating mechanism dynamically selects channel-wise features based on the input,\nto suppress the less relevant channels and enhance the detection\ngeneralizability.

To fix the issue\nof Inexact FedSplit, we propose two versions of Inexact PDMM, which are\nreferred to as gradient-based PDMM (GPDMM) and accelerated GPDMM (AGPDMM),\nrespectively.

These models are used in statistical physics\nto describe mixtures of one or multiple particle types subjected to hard-core\ninteractions. For each type, particles follow a Poisson point process with a\ntype specific activity parameter (fugacity). The Gibbs distribution is\ncharacterized by the mixture of these point processes conditioned that no two\nparticles are closer than a type-dependent distance threshold. A key part in\nbetter understanding the Gibbs distribution is its normalizing constant, called\npartition function.\n  We give sufficient conditions that the partition function of a discrete\nhard-core model on a geometric graph based on a point set $X \\subset\n\\mathbb{V}$ closely approximates those of such continuous models.

To determine\nits malignancy, it is graded by a pathologist into three grades according to\nWHO standards. This grade plays a decisive role in treatment, and yet may be\nsubject to inter-rater discordance. In this work, we present and compare three\napproaches towards fully automatic meningioma grading from histology whole\nslide images. All approaches are following a two-stage paradigm, where we first\nidentify a region of interest based on the detection of mitotic figures in the\nslide using a state-of-the-art object detection deep learning network. This\nregion of highest mitotic rate is considered characteristic for biological\ntumor behavior. In the second stage, we calculate a score corresponding to\ntumor malignancy based on information contained in this region using three\ndifferent settings. In a first approach, image patches are sampled from this\nregion and regression is based on morphological features encoded by a\nResNet-based network. We compare this to learning a logistic regression from\nthe determined mitotic count, an approach which is easily traceable and\nexplainable. Lastly, we combine both approaches in a single network. We trained\nthe pipeline on 951 slides from 341 patients and evaluated them on a separate\nset of 141 slides from 43 patients. All approaches yield a high correlation to\nthe WHO grade. The logistic regression and the combined approach had the best\nresults in our experiments, yielding correct predictions in 32 and 33 of all\ncases, respectively, with the image-based approach only predicting 25 cases\ncorrectly. Spearman's correlation was 0.716, 0.792 and 0.790 respectively. It\nmay seem counterintuitive at first that morphological features provided by\nimage patches do not improve model performance.

The key element of Prompt is\na particle-based object representation, in which each particle represents a\npoint in the object, the local geometric, physical, and other features of the\npoint, and also its relation with other particles. Like the model-based\nanalytic approaches to manipulation, the particle representation enables the\nrobot to reason about the object's geometry and dynamics in order to choose\nsuitable manipulation actions. Like the data-driven approaches, the particle\nrepresentation is learned online in real-time from visual sensor input,\nspecifically, multi-view RGB images. The particle representation thus connects\nvisual perception with robot control. Prompt combines the benefits of both\nmodel-based reasoning and data-driven learning. We show empirically that Prompt\nsuccessfully handles a variety of everyday objects, some of which are\ntransparent. It handles various manipulation tasks, including grasping,\npushing, etc,. Our experiments also show that Prompt outperforms a\nstate-of-the-art data-driven grasping method on the daily objects, even though\nit does not use any offline training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 13:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

In fact, real-life measurements show\nthat at least one-fourth of received transmissions are corrupted.

They\nare usually produced by ejecting a volume of fluid through a circular orifice\nor nozzle. When the volume and velocity of the ejected fluid are known, the\nvortex' circulation, impulse, and energy can be estimated by the slug flow\nmodel. Vortex rings also form in the wake of accelerating axisymmetric bodies.\nIn this configuration, the volume and velocity of the fluid that is injected\ninto the vortex is not known a priori. Here, we present two models to predict\nthe growth of the vortex behind disks or cones. The first model uses conformal\nmapping and assumes that all vorticity generated ends up in the vortex. The\nvortex circulation is determined by imposing the Kutta condition at the tip of\nthe disk. The position of the vortex is integrated from an approximation of its\nvelocity, given by Fraenkel. The model predicts well the maximum circulation of\nthe vortex, but does not predict the tail shedding observed experimentally. A\nsecond model is based on an axisymmetric version of the discrete vortex method.\nThe shear layer formed at the tip of the cone is discretised by point vortices,\nwhich roll-up into a coherent vortex ring. The model accurately captures the\ntemporal evolution of the circulation and the non-dimensional energy. The\ndetrainment of vorticity from the vortex, through the process of tail shedding,\nis qualitatively captured by the model but remains quantitatively sensitive to\nthe numerical parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 13:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

The electrical capacitance of these\nstructures is determined by phenomena that are not relevant in capacitors with\nlarger electrode separation. With the aim to analyze these phenomena, we use\nlinear response theory to develop a systematic description of capacitance for\ntwo coupled electron liquids, accounting for the wave nature of electrons, as\nwell as for the effect of both intra and interlayer Coulomb interactions. Our\ntheory leads to a general expression for the electrical capacitance in terms of\nboth intra and interlayer electronic polarizabilities. The intralayer\npolarizability is directly related to the conventional expression for the\nquantum capacitance, whereas the interlayer polarizability term accounts for\ninteraction-induced correlations between charges hosted by opposite capacitor\nplates.

We\ndiscuss the implications of the general expression for the capacitance, show\nthat it leads to established results when the effect of interlayer correlations\nis negligible, and that the intra and interlayer polarizabilities play a\ncomparable role for capacitors with very small electrode separation. Using two\ndifferent approaches, we calculate the capacitance in specific cases, and find\nthat the interlayer polarizability can be either positive or negative, so that\nthe cross quantum capacitance can either increase or decrease the total\ncapacitance.

The communication bottleneck between the data resource and\nthe server results in deteriorated learning performance as well as tremendous\nenergy consumption. To tackle this challenge, we explore a new paradigm called\nlearning-and-energy-efficient (LEE) EI, which simultaneously maximizes the\nlearning accuracies and energy efficiencies of multiple tasks via data\npartition and rate control. Mathematically, this results in a multi-objective\noptimization problem. Moreover, the continuous varying rates over the whole\ntransmission duration introduce infinite variables.

A representative\nsolution is to leverage reward shaping to provide intrinsic rewards for the\nagent to encourage exploration. However, most existing methods suffer from\nvanishing intrinsic rewards, which cannot provide sustainable exploration\nincentives. Moreover, they rely heavily on complex models and additional memory\nto record learning procedures, resulting in high computational complexity and\nlow robustness. To tackle this problem, entropy-based methods are proposed to\nevaluate the global exploration performance, encouraging the agent to visit the\nstate space more equitably. However, the sample complexity of estimating the\nstate visitation entropy is prohibitive when handling environments with\nhigh-dimensional observations. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric\nentitled Jain's fairness index (JFI) to replace the entropy regularizer, which\nsolves the exploration problem from a brand new perspective. In sharp contrast\nto the entropy regularizer, JFI is more computable and robust and can be easily\napplied generalized into arbitrary tasks.

A model\nextraction attack is an attack to violate intellectual property and privacy in\nwhich an adversary steals trained models in a cloud using only their\npredictions. In particular, a data-free model extraction attack has been\nproposed recently and is more critical. In this attack, an adversary uses a\ngenerative model instead of preparing input data.

By tuning nanoarray dimensions we achieve\nmacrospin/vortex bistability and demonstrate a four-state metamaterial\nspin-system 'Artificial Spin-Vortex Ice' (ASVI). ASVI can host Ising-like\nmacrospins with strong ice-like vertex interactions, and weakly-coupled\nvortices with low stray dipolar-field. Vortices and macrospins exhibit\nstarkly-differing spin-wave spectra with analogue-style mode-amplitude control\nand mode-frequency shifts of df = 3.8 GHz.\n  The enhanced bi-textural microstate space gives rise to emergent physical\nmemory phenomena, with ratchet-like vortex training and history-dependent\nnonlinear fading memory when driven through global field cycles.

There are some\nsituations, though, where it is preferable to condition on auxiliary features\ninstead of marginalizing over them. In this paper, we introduce neural\nconditional reweighting, which extends neural marginal reweighting to the\nconditional case. This approach is particularly relevant in high-energy physics\nexperiments for reweighting detector effects conditioned on particle-level\ntruth information. We leverage a custom loss function that not only allows us\nto achieve neural conditional reweighting through a single training procedure,\nbut also yields sensible interpolation even in the presence of phase space\nholes. As a specific example, we apply neural conditional reweighting to the\nenergy response of high-energy jets, which could be used to improve the\nmodeling of physics objects in parametrized fast simulation packages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 15:55:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 22:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Existing\nmethods are mostly based on two-stage frameworks, which include top-down and\nbottom-up methods. Two-stage methods either suffer from high computational\nredundancy for additional person detectors or they need to group keypoints\nheuristically after predicting all the instance-agnostic keypoints. The\nsingle-stage paradigm aims to simplify the multi-person pose estimation\npipeline and receives a lot of attention. However, recent single-stage methods\nhave the limitation of low performance due to the difficulty of regressing\nvarious full-body poses from a single feature vector.

New mechanisms able to encode, generate,\nevaluate, and deform aesthetic curves are expected to improve the throughput\nand the quality of industrial design. In recent years, the study of (log)\naesthetic curves have attracted the community's attention due to its ubiquity\nin natural phenomena such as bird eggs, butterfly wings, falcon flights, and\nmanufactured products such as Japanese swords and automobiles.\n  A (log) aesthetic curve renders a logarithmic curvature graph approximated by\na straight line, and polar aesthetic curves enable to mode user-defined\ndynamics of the polar tangential angle in the polar coordinate system. As such,\nthe curvature profile often becomes a by-product of the tangential angle.\n  In this paper, we extend the concept of polar aesthetic curves and establish\nthe analytical formulations to construct aesthetic curves with user-defined\ncriteria. In particular, we propose the closed-form analytic characterizations\nof polar log-aesthetic curves meeting user-defined criteria of curvature\nprofiles and dynamics of polar tangential angles.

The adversary can easily change the outputs of DNNs by adding small\nwell-designed perturbations to inputs. Adversarial example detection is a\nfundamental work for robust DNNs-based service. Adversarial examples show the\ndifference between humans and DNNs in image recognition. From a human-centric\nperspective, image features could be divided into dominant features that are\ncomprehensible to humans, and recessive features that are incomprehensible to\nhumans, yet are exploited by DNNs. In this paper, we reveal that imperceptible\nadversarial examples are the product of recessive features misleading neural\nnetworks, and an adversarial attack is essentially a kind of method to enrich\nthese recessive features in the image. The imperceptibility of the adversarial\nexamples indicates that the perturbations enrich recessive features, yet hardly\naffect dominant features. Therefore, adversarial examples are sensitive to\nfiltering off recessive features, while benign examples are immune to such\noperation. Inspired by this idea, we propose a label-only adversarial detection\napproach that is referred to as feature-filter. Feature-filter utilizes\ndiscrete cosine transform to approximately separate recessive features from\ndominant features, and gets a mutant image that is filtered off recessive\nfeatures. By only comparing DNN's prediction labels on the input and its\nmutant, feature-filter can real-time detect imperceptible adversarial examples\nat high accuracy and few false positives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 12:09:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 03:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

We\ninvestigate whether natural language exhibits any of the quantum mechanics'\ncontextual features. We show that meaning combinations in ambiguous phrases can\nbe modelled in the sheaf-theoretic framework for quantum contextuality, where\nthey can become possibilistically contextual. Using the framework of\nContextuality-by-Default (CbD), we explore the probabilistic variants of these\nand show that CbD-contextuality is also possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 13:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

In transformer, it only uses the top layer of\nencoder and decoder in the subsequent process, which makes it impossible to\ntake advantage of the useful information in other layers. To address this\nissue, we propose a residual tree aggregation of layers for Transformer(RTAL),\nwhich helps to fuse information across layers. Specifically, we try to fuse the\ninformation across layers by constructing a post-order binary tree. In\nadditional to the last node, we add the residual connection to the process of\ngenerating child nodes. Our model is based on the Neural Machine Translation\nmodel Transformer and we conduct our experiments on WMT14 English-to-German and\nWMT17 English-to-France translation tasks. Experimental results across language\npairs show that the proposed approach outperforms the strong baseline model\nsignificantly\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 09:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

So\nfar, this concept was mostly used to generate images for a single scenario. As\neach scenario requires a new model, this type of generation seems contradictory\nto the adaptability of cells in nature. To address this contradiction, we\nintroduce a concept using different initial environments as input while using a\nsingle Neural Cellular Automata to produce several outputs. Additionally, we\nintroduce GANCA, a novel algorithm that combines Neural Cellular Automata with\nGenerative Adversarial Networks, allowing for more generalization through\nadversarial training. The experiments show that a single model is capable of\nlearning several images when presented with different inputs, and that the\nadversarially trained model improves drastically on out-of-distribution data\ncompared to a supervised trained model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 06:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

The mortality rate of this disease is high\nin patients suffering from immuno-compromised disorders. The early diagnosis of\nthis disease can save lives and can avoid further complications. But the\ndiagnosis of TB is a very complex task. The standard diagnostic tests still\nrely on traditional procedures developed in the last century. These procedures\nare slow and expensive. So this paper presents an automatic approach for the\ndiagnosis of TB from posteroanterior chest x-rays. This is a two-step approach,\nwhere in the first step the lung regions are segmented from the chest x-rays\nusing the graph cut method, and then in the second step the transfer learning\nof VGG16 combined with Bi-directional LSTM is used for extracting high-level\ndiscriminative features from the segmented lung regions and then classification\nis performed using a fully connected layer. The proposed model is evaluated\nusing data from two publicly available databases namely Montgomery Country set\nand Schezien set. The proposed model achieved accuracy and sensitivity of\n97.76%, 97.01% and 96.42%, 94.11% on Schezien and Montgomery county datasets.\nThis model enhanced the diagnostic accuracy of TB by 0.7% and 11.68% on\nSchezien and Montgomery county datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 15:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-29"}

The contact angle (CA) of a water drop\nplaced on the surface was used to assess the wettability of the processed\nareas. Although the surfaces are initially hydrophilic upon laser treatment,\nafter a few days they develop a strong hydrophobic behavior. Marble surfaces\nhave been irradiated with different scan line separations to elucidate the\nrelative roles of multi-scale roughness (nano- and micro-texture) and chemical\nchanges at the surface. The time evolution of the contact angle has been then\nmonitored up to 11 months after treatment. A short and a long-term evolution,\nassociated to the combined effect of multi-scale roughness and the attachment\nof chemical species at the surface over the time, have been observed. XPS and\nATR measurements are consistent with the progressive hydroxylation of the laser\ntreated surfaces although the additional contribution of hydrocarbon adsorbates\nto the wettability evolution cannot be ruled-out. The robustness of the results\nhas been tested by CA measurements after cleaning in different conditions with\nvery positive results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 14:53:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}
