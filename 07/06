Promoting parsimony through\nsparsity in SINDy leads to interpretable models that generalize to unknown\ndata.

The resulting method, uncertainty quantification SINDy (UQ-SINDy),\nquantifies not only the uncertainty in the values of the SINDy coefficients due\nto observation errors and limited data, but also the probability of inclusion\nof each candidate function in the linear combination.

This phenomenon,\ndissipation dilution, is employed in mirror suspensions of gravitational wave\ninterferometers and at the nanoscale, where soft-clamping and strain\nengineering have allowed extremely high quality factors. However, these\ntechniques have so far only been applied in amorphous materials, specifically\nsilicon nitride. Crystalline materials exhibit significantly lower intrinsic\ndamping at cryogenic temperatures, due to the absence of two level systems in\nthe bulk, as exploited in Weber bars and silicon optomechanical cavities.\nApplying dissipation dilution engineering to strained crystalline materials\ncould therefore enable extremely low loss nanomechanical resonators, due to the\ncombination of reduced internal friction, high intrinsic strain, and high yield\nstrength. Pioneering work has not yet fully exploited this potential. Here, we\ndemonstrate that single crystal strained silicon, a material developed for high\nmobility transistors, can be used to realize mechanical resonators with\nultralow dissipation. We observe that high aspect ratio ($>10^5$) strained\nsilicon nanostrings support MHz mechanical modes with quality factors exceeding\n$10^{10}$ at 7 K, a tenfold improvement over values reported in silicon\nnitride.

This population has been recently characterized in an\nanalysis of the Romulus cosmological simulations, which correct for the\ndynamical forces on SMBHs without artificially pinning them to halo centers.\nHere we predict an array of electromagnetic signatures for these wanderers. The\npredicted wandering population of SMBHs from Romulus broadly reproduces the\nobserved spatial offsets of a recent sample of hyperluminous X-ray sources. We\npredict that the sources with the most extreme offsets are likely to arise from\nSMBHs within satellite galaxies.

The importance of feature cross search especially for the\nlinear model has been known for a while, with well-known textbook examples. In\nthis problem, the goal is to select a small subset of features, combine them to\nform a new feature (called the crossed feature) by considering their Cartesian\nproduct, and find feature crosses to learn an \\emph{accurate} model. In\nparticular, we study the problem of maximizing a normalized Area Under the\nCurve (AUC) of the linear model trained on the crossed feature column.\n  First, we show that it is not possible to provide an $n^{1/\\log\\log\nn}$-approximation algorithm for this problem unless the exponential time\nhypothesis fails. This result also rules out the possibility of solving this\nproblem in polynomial time unless $\\mathsf{P}=\\mathsf{NP}$. On the positive\nside, by assuming the \\naive\\ assumption, we show that there exists a simple\ngreedy $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm for this problem. This result is\nestablished by relating the AUC to the total variation of the commutator of two\nprobability measures and showing that the total variation of the commutator is\nmonotone and submodular. To show this, we relate the submodularity of this\nfunction to the positive semi-definiteness of a corresponding kernel matrix.\nThen, we use Bochner's theorem to prove the positive semi-definiteness by\nshowing that its inverse Fourier transform is non-negative everywhere. Our\ntechniques and structural results might be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 16:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

To this end we study the popular squeeze-and-excite (SE)\nblock which is a simple and lightweight channel attention mechanism. SE blocks\nand its numerous variants commonly use global average pooling (GAP) to create a\nsingle descriptor for each channel. Here, we empirically analyze the amount of\nspatial context needed for effective channel attention and find that limited\nlocalcontext on the order of seven rows or columns of the original image is\nsufficient to match the performance of global context. We propose tiled\nsqueeze-and-excite (TSE), which is a framework for building SE-like blocks that\nemploy several descriptors per channel, with each descriptor based on local\ncontext only. We further show that TSE is a drop-in replacement for the SE\nblock and can be used in existing SE networks without re-training. This implies\nthat local context descriptors are similar both to each other and to the global\ncontext descriptor. Finally, we show that TSE has important practical\nimplications for deployment of SE-networks to dataflow AI accelerators due to\ntheir reduced pipeline buffering requirements. For example, using TSE reduces\nthe amount of activation pipeline buffering in EfficientDetD2 by 90% compared\nto SE (from 50M to 4.77M) without loss of accuracy.

Most follow-up works attempt\nto replace the shifted-window operation with other kinds of cross-window\ncommunication paradigms, while treating self-attention as the de-facto standard\nfor window-based information aggregation. In this manuscript, we question\nwhether self-attention is the only choice for hierarchical Vision Transformer\nto attain strong performance, and the effects of different kinds of\ncross-window communication. To this end, we replace self-attention layers with\nembarrassingly simple linear mapping layers, and the resulting proof-of-concept\narchitecture termed as LinMapper can achieve very strong performance in\nImageNet-1k image recognition. Moreover, we find that LinMapper is able to\nbetter leverage the pre-trained representations from image recognition and\ndemonstrates excellent transfer learning properties on downstream dense\nprediction tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation. We also\nexperiment with other alternatives to self-attention for content aggregation\ninside each non-overlapped window under different cross-window communication\napproaches, which all give similar competitive results.

We constrain\nour dust model using Planck 353 GHz observations of the Milky Way. This model\nis then extrapolated to shorter wavelengths that cover the peak of interstellar\ndust emission and to observations of arbitrarily oriented nearby Milky Way like\ngalaxies.

Their\npresence is closely tied to symmetries of asymptotically flat spacetimes and\nfluxes of conserved charges conjugate to these symmetries. While the\nphenomenology of GW memory effects is well understood in general relativity\n(GR), it is less well understood in the many modifications to GR. We recently\ncomputed asymptotically flat solutions, symmetries, conserved quantities, and\nGW memory effects in one such modified theory: Brans-Dicke theory. In this\npaper, we apply our results from this earlier work to compute the GW memories\nfrom compact binaries in the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation. In addition to\ntaking the PN limit of these effects, we work in the approximation that the\nenergy and angular momentum losses through scalar radiation are small compared\nto the energy and angular momentum losses through (tensor) GWs. We focus on the\ntensor (as opposed to scalar) GW memory effect, which we compute through\nNewtonian order, and the small differences induced by scalar radiation at this\norder. Specifically, we compute the nonlinear parts of the tensor displacement\nand spin GW memory effects produced during the inspiral of quasicircular,\nnonprecessing binaries in Brans-Dicke theory. Because the energy radiated\nthrough the scalar dipole moment appears as a -1 PN order-effect, then in this\napproximation, the displacement memory has a logarithmic dependence on the PN\nparameter and the spin memory has a relative -1 PN-order correction; these\ncorrections are ultimately small because they are related to the total energy\nand angular momentum radiated in the scalar field, respectively. At Newtonian\norder, the scalar radiation also gives rise to a sky pattern of the memory\neffect around an isolated source that differs from that of the memory effect in\nGR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 18:19:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 19:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

We investigate the kinematic\nsignatures of two large-scale counter-rotating stellar disks in mock\nintegral-field spectroscopic data to address their detection limits as a\nfunction of the galaxy properties and instrumental setup. We built a set of\nmock data of two large-scale counter-rotating stellar disks as if they were\nobserved with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). We accounted for\ndifferent photometric, kinematic, and stellar population properties of the two\ncounter-rotating components as a function of galaxy inclination. We extracted\nthe stellar kinematics in the wavelength region of the calcium triplet\nabsorption lines by adopting a Gauss-Hermite (GH) parameterization of the\nline-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD). We confirm that the strongest\nsignature of the presence of two counter-rotating stellar disks is the\nsymmetric double peak in the velocity dispersion map, already known as the\n$2\\sigma$ feature. The size, shape, and slope of the 2$\\sigma$ peak strongly\ndepend on the velocity separation and relative light contribution of the two\ncounter-rotating stellar disks. When the $2\\sigma$ peak is difficult to detect\ndue to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the data, the large-scale structure in\nthe $h_3$ map can be used as a diagnostic for strong and weak counter-rotation.\nThe counter-rotating kinematic signatures become fainter at lower viewing\nangles as an effect of the smaller projected velocity separation between the\ntwo counter-rotating components.

In\n[Gurevich-Howe15] and [Gurevich-Howe17], the current authors introduced the\nnotion of rank of an irreducible representation of a finite classical group.\nOne of the motivations for studying rank was to clarify the nature of character\nratios for certain elements in these groups.

The first is the Fourier theoretic based notion\nof U-rank of a representation, which comes up when one looks at its\nrestrictions to certain abelian unipotent subgroups. The second is the more\nalgebraic based notion of tensor rank which comes up naturally when one\nattempts to equip the representation ring of the group with a grading that\nreflects the central role played by the few \"smallest\" possible representations\nof the group. In [Gurevich-Howe17] we conjectured that the two notions of rank\nmentioned just above agree on a suitable collection called \"low rank\"\nrepresentations.

In the first problem, we derive a\nstochastic control model to optimize banks' dividend and recapitalization\npolicies and calibrate that to a sample of U.S. banks in the situation where we\nmodel banks' true accounting asset values as partially observed variables due\nto the opaqueness in banks' assets. By the calibrated model, the noise in\nreported accounting asset values hides about one-third of the true asset return\nvolatility and raises the banks' market equity value by 7.8\\% because the noise\nhides the banks' solvency risk from banking regulators. Particularly, those\nbanks with a high level of loan loss provisions, nonperforming assets, and real\nestate loans, and with a low volatility of reported total assets have noisy\naccounting asset values. Because of the substantial shock on the true asset\nvalues, the banks' assets were more opaque during the recent financial crisis.\nIn the second problem, we present an optimal portfolio selection model with\nvoluntary retirement option in an economic situation, where an investor is\nfacing borrowing and short sale constraints, as well as the cointegration\nbetween the stock and labor markets. Our model reinterprets the\nnon-participation puzzle in stock investment and early retirement in market\nbooms. Investor's willingness to retire earlier becomes stronger as risk\naversion increases or as wages decline in the long term. Consistent with the\nempirical evidence, we find that retirement flexibility makes the optimal\nportfolio invest less in the stock market. We also find that our\nmodel-generated portfolio share rises in wealth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 19:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

A popular class of foreground\ncleaning method are unsupervised techniques related to Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA), which exploit the different shapes and amplitudes of each\ncomponent's contribution to the covariance of the data in order to segregate\nthe signals.

In almost all dueling\nbandit applications, the decision space often changes over time; eg, retail\nstore management, online shopping, restaurant recommendation, search engine\noptimization, etc. Surprisingly, this `sleeping aspect' of dueling bandits has\nnever been studied in the literature. Like dueling bandits, the goal is to\ncompete with the best arm by sequentially querying the preference feedback of\nitem pairs. The non-triviality however results due to the non-stationary item\nspaces that allow any arbitrary subsets items to go unavailable every round.\nThe goal is to find an optimal `no-regret' policy that can identify the best\navailable item at each round, as opposed to the standard `fixed best-arm regret\nobjective' of dueling bandits. We first derive an instance-specific lower bound\nfor DB-SPAA $\\Omega( \\sum_{i =1}^{K-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^K \\frac{\\log\nT}{\\Delta(i,j)})$, where $K$ is the number of items and $\\Delta(i,j)$ is the\ngap between items $i$ and $j$.

We apply two pre-trained transformer models,\nXLNet and Longformer, to this task in English and achieve strong results on\nSwitchboard Dialog Act and Meeting Recorder Dialog Act corpora with dialog act\nsegmentation error rates (DSER) of 8.4% and 14.2%. To understand the key\nfactors affecting dialog act recognition, we perform a comparative analysis of\nmodels trained under different conditions. We find that the inclusion of a\nbroader conversational context helps disambiguate many dialog act classes,\nespecially those infrequent in the training data. The presence of punctuation\nin the transcripts has a massive effect on the models' performance, and a\ndetailed analysis reveals specific segmentation patterns observed in its\nabsence. Finally, we find that the label set specificity does not affect dialog\nact segmentation performance. These findings have significant practical\nimplications for spoken language understanding applications that depend heavily\non a good-quality segmentation being available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 21:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

The expansive and detailed\nGIGANTES suite, spanning thousands of cosmological models, opens up the study\nof voids, answering compelling questions: Do voids carry unique cosmological\ninformation?

Benchmarking in this domain heavily relies on\nfaithful representation of the sparsity of subnetworks, which has been\ntraditionally computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct\nsparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize unpruned parameters\nthat detached from input or output layers of underlying subnetworks,\npotentially underestimating actual effective sparsity: the fraction of\ninactivated connections. While this effect might be negligible for moderately\npruned networks (up to 10-100 compression rates), we find that it plays an\nincreasing role for thinner subnetworks, greatly distorting comparison between\ndifferent pruning algorithms. For example, we show that effective compression\nof a randomly pruned LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than its\ndirect counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed when using SynFlow\nfor pruning [Tanaka et al., 2020]. In this work, we adopt the lens of effective\nsparsity to reevaluate several recent pruning algorithms on common benchmark\narchitectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19, ResNet-18) and discover that their\nabsolute and relative performance changes dramatically in this new and more\nappropriate framework. To aim for effective, rather than direct, sparsity, we\ndevelop a low-cost extension to most pruning algorithms. Further, equipped with\neffective sparsity as a reference frame, we partially reconfirm that random\npruning with appropriate sparsity allocation across layers performs as well or\nbetter than more sophisticated algorithms for pruning at initialization [Su et\nal., 2020]. In response to this observation, using a simple analogy of pressure\ndistribution in coupled cylinders from physics, we design novel layerwise\nsparsity quotas that outperform all existing baselines in the context of random\npruning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 22:36:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 01:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

In addition to the burden of excessively involving surgical\nstaff, this may lead to reduced image stability, increased task completion time\nand sometimes errors due to the monotony of the task. Robotic endoscope\nholders, controlled by a set of basic instructions, have been proposed as an\nalternative, but their unnatural handling may increase the cognitive load of\nthe (solo) surgeon, which hinders their clinical acceptance. More seamless\nintegration in the surgical workflow would be achieved if robotic endoscope\nholders collaborated with the operating surgeon via semantically rich\ninstructions that closely resemble instructions that would otherwise be issued\nto a human camera assistant, such as \"focus on my right-hand instrument\". As a\nproof of concept, this paper presents a novel system that paves the way towards\na synergistic interaction between surgeons and robotic endoscope holders. The\nproposed platform allows the surgeon to perform a bimanual coordination and\nnavigation task, while a robotic arm autonomously performs the endoscope\npositioning tasks.

The model substitutes the\nlaw-of-the-wall velocity profile for a smooth surface into the wall-normal\nintegrated momentum balance, leading to a Lagrangian relaxation towards\nequilibrium (LaRTE) transport equation for the friction velocity vector\n$\\mathbf{u}_\\tau(x,z,t)$. This partial differential equation includes a\nrelaxation timescale governing the rate at which the wall stress can respond to\nimposed fluctuations due to the inertia of the fluid layer from the wall to the\nwall-model height. A-priori tests based on channel flow direct numerical\nsimulation (DNS) data show that the identified relaxation timescale ensures\nself-consistency with assumed quasi-equilibrium conditions. The new approach\nenables us to formally distinguish quasi-equilibrium from additional,\nnon-equilibrium contributions to the wall stress. A particular model for\nnon-equilibrium contributions is derived, motivated by laminar Stokes layer\ndynamics in the viscous sublayer when applying fast varying pressure gradients.\nThe new wall modeling approach is first tested in standard equilibrium channel\nflow in order to document various properties of the approach. The model is then\napplied in LES of channel flow with a suddenly applied spanwise pressure\ngradient (SSPG). The resulting mean wall stress evolution is compared to DNS\nwith good agreement. At the onset of the SSPG, the laminar Stokes layer\ndevelops rapidly while the LaRTE portion of the stress has a delayed response\ndue to its inherent relaxation dynamics. Results also highlight open challenges\nsuch as modeling the response of near-wall turbulence occurring above the\nviscous sublayer and at timescales faster than quasi-equilibrium conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 00:40:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2021 03:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

These effects can be analyzed in simulations\nof the gate protocol, but those are computationally costly and often hide the\nphysics at play. Here, we show how to efficiently extract gate parameters by\ndirectly solving a Floquet eigenproblem using exact numerics and a perturbative\nanalytical approach. As an example application of this toolkit, we study the\nspace of parametric gates generated between two fixed-frequency transmon qubits\nconnected by a parametrically driven coupler. Our analytical treatment, based\non time-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory, yields closed-form\nexpressions for gate frequencies and spurious interactions, and is valid for\nstrong drives. From these calculations, we identify optimal regimes of\noperation for different types of gates including $i$SWAP, controlled-Z, and\nCNOT. These analytical results are supplemented by numerical Floquet\ncomputations from which we directly extract drive-dependent gate parameters.\nThis approach has a considerable computational advantage over full simulations\nof time evolutions. More generally, our combined analytical and numerical\nstrategy allows us to characterize two-qubit gates involving parametrically\ndriven interactions, and can be applied to gate optimization and cross-talk\nmitigation such as the cancellation of unwanted ZZ interactions in multi-qubit\narchitectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 02:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

The\nproposed domain is general in its application and captures the ordering\nrelations as a first-class feature in the abstract interpretation theory. In\nparticular, the domain represents a set of sequences of modifications of a\nglobal variable in concurrent programs as a partially ordered set. Under this\napproximation, older sequenced-before stores of a global variable are forgotten\nand only the latest stores per variable are preserved. We establish the\nsoundness of our proposed abstractions and implement them in a prototype\nabstract interpreter called PRIORI. The evaluations of PRIORI on existing and\nchallenging RA benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed technique is not only\ncompetitive in refutation, but also in verification.

Large-scale\ndatasets tend to contain mislabeled samples that can be memorized by DNNs,\nimpeding the performance. With appropriate handling, this degradation can be\nalleviated. There are two problems to consider: how to distinguish clean\nsamples and how to deal with noisy samples. In this paper, we present Ensemble\nNoise-robust K-fold Cross-Validation Selection (E-NKCVS) to effectively select\nclean samples from noisy data, solving the first problem. For the second\nproblem, we create a new pseudo label for any sample determined to have an\nuncertain or likely corrupt label. E-NKCVS obtains multiple predicted labels\nfor each sample and the entropy of these labels is used to tune the weight\ngiven to the pseudo label and the given label.

We evaluate our approach on various image and text classification\ntasks where the labels have been manually corrupted with different noise\nratios. Additionally, two large real-world noisy datasets are also used,\nClothing-1M and WebVision. E-NKCVS is empirically shown to be highly tolerant\nto considerable proportions of label noise and has a consistent improvement\nover state-of-the-art methods.

The\nstate-of-the-art treats these interactions as disturbances that the robot\nshould reject or avoid. At best, these robots respond safely while the human\ninteracts; but after the human lets go, these robots simply return to their\noriginal behavior. We recognize that physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is\noften intentional -- the human intervenes on purpose because the robot is not\ndoing the task correctly. In this paper, we argue that when pHRI is intentional\nit is also informative: the robot can leverage interactions to learn how it\nshould complete the rest of its current task even after the person lets go. We\nformalize pHRI as a dynamical system, where the human has in mind an objective\nfunction they want the robot to optimize, but the robot does not get direct\naccess to the parameters of this objective -- they are internal to the human.\nWithin our proposed framework human interactions become observations about the\ntrue objective. We introduce approximations to learn from and respond to pHRI\nin real-time. We recognize that not all human corrections are perfect: often\nusers interact with the robot noisily, and so we improve the efficiency of\nrobot learning from pHRI by reducing unintended learning. Finally, we conduct\nsimulations and user studies on a robotic manipulator to compare our proposed\napproach to the state-of-the-art. Our results indicate that learning from pHRI\nleads to better task performance and improved human satisfaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 02:25:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

To\nsolve these issues, in this paper we propose a NIDS called PCC-LSM-NIDS that is\ncomposed of a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) based feature selection\nalgorithm and a Least Square Method (LSM) based privacy-preserving algorithm to\nachieve low-cost intrusion detection while providing privacy preservation for\nsensitive data. The proposed PCC-LSM-NIDS is tested on the benchmark intrusion\ndatabase UNSW-NB15, using five popular classifiers. The experimental results\nshow that the proposed PCC-LSM-NIDS offers advantages in terms of less\ncomputational time, while offering an appropriate degree of privacy protection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 02:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

The\nmotivating intuition is human language in which communication occurs through\ndiscrete symbols. Even though individuals have different understandings of what\na \"cat\" is based on their specific experiences, the shared discrete token makes\nit possible for communication among individuals to be unimpeded by individual\ndifferences in internal representation.

In this study, we propose a novel heterogeneity-aware\nfederated learning method, SplitAVG, to overcome the performance drops from\ndata heterogeneity in federated learning. Unlike previous federated methods\nthat require complex heuristic training or hyper parameter tuning, our SplitAVG\nleverages the simple network split and feature map concatenation strategies to\nencourage the federated model training an unbiased estimator of the target data\ndistribution. We compare SplitAVG with seven state-of-the-art federated\nlearning methods, using centrally hosted training data as the baseline on a\nsuite of both synthetic and real-world federated datasets. We find that the\nperformance of models trained using all the comparison federated learning\nmethods degraded significantly with the increasing degrees of data\nheterogeneity. In contrast, SplitAVG method achieves comparable results to the\nbaseline method under all heterogeneous settings, that it achieves 96.2% of the\naccuracy and 110.4% of the mean absolute error obtained by the baseline in a\ndiabetic retinopathy binary classification dataset and a bone age prediction\ndataset, respectively, on highly heterogeneous data partitions.

Contrary to conventional machine learning aiming to learn inherent\nprediction rules to predict labels for new query data, meta learning aims to\nlearn the learning methodology for machine learning from observed tasks, so as\nto generalize to new query tasks by leveraging the meta-learned learning\nmethodology. In this study, we interpret such learning methodology as learning\nan explicit hyper-parameter prediction function shared by all training tasks.\nSpecifically, this function is represented as a parameterized function called\nmeta-learner, mapping from a training/test task to its suitable hyper-parameter\nsetting, extracted from a pre-specified function set called meta learning\nmachine. Such setting guarantees that the meta-learned learning methodology is\nable to flexibly fit diverse query tasks, instead of only obtaining fixed\nhyper-parameters by many current meta learning methods, with less adaptability\nto query task's variations. Such understanding of meta learning also makes it\neasily succeed from traditional learning theory for analyzing its\ngeneralization bounds with general losses/tasks/models. The theory naturally\nleads to some feasible controlling strategies for ameliorating the quality of\nthe extracted meta-learner, verified to be able to finely ameliorate its\ngeneralization capability in some typical meta learning applications, including\nfew-shot regression, few-shot classification and domain generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 04:05:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 May 2023 09:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

Most existing\nmethods tackle this challenge by aligning spatial features of body parts\naccording to external semantic cues or feature similarities but this alignment\napproach is complicated and sensitive to noises. We design DRL-Net, a\ndisentangled representation learning network that handles occluded re-ID\nwithout requiring strict person image alignment or any additional supervision.\nLeveraging transformer architectures, DRL-Net achieves alignment-free re-ID via\nglobal reasoning of local features of occluded person images. It measures image\nsimilarity by automatically disentangling the representation of undefined\nsemantic components, e.g., human body parts or obstacles, under the guidance of\nsemantic preference object queries in the transformer. In addition, we design a\ndecorrelation constraint in the transformer decoder and impose it over object\nqueries for better focus on different semantic components. To better eliminate\ninterference from occlusions, we design a contrast feature learning technique\n(CFL) for better separation of occlusion features and discriminative ID\nfeatures. Extensive experiments over occluded and holistic re-ID benchmarks\n(Occluded-DukeMTMC, Market1501 and DukeMTMC) show that the DRL-Net achieves\nsuperior re-ID performance consistently and outperforms the state-of-the-art by\nlarge margins for Occluded-DukeMTMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 04:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Discrete-time quantum walks on finite connected graphs however, can\nhave infinite hitting times. This phenomenon is related to graph symmetry, as\npreviously characterized by the group of direction-preserving graph\nautomorphisms that trivially affect the coin Hilbert space. If a graph is\nsymmetric enough (in a particular sense) then the associated quantum walk\nunitary will contain eigenvectors that do not overlap a set of target vertices,\nfor any coin flip operator. These eigenvectors span the Infinite Hitting Time\n(IHT) subspace. Quantum states in the IHT subspace never reach the target\nvertices, leading to infinite hitting times. However, this is not the whole\nstory: the graph of the 3D cube does not satisfy this symmetry constraint, yet\nquantum walks on this graph with certain symmetric coins can exhibit infinite\nhitting times. We study the effect of coin symmetry by analyzing the group of\ncoin-permutation symmetries (CPS): graph automorphisms that act nontrivially on\nthe coin Hilbert space but leave the coin operator invariant. Unitaries using\nhighly symmetric coins with large CPS groups, such as the permutation-invariant\nGrover coin, are associated with higher probabilities of never arriving, as a\nresult of their larger IHT subspaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 04:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

It is commonly observed\nthat user's attention to visual features does not always reflect the real\npreference. Although a user may click and view an item in light of a visual\nsatisfaction of their expectations, a real purchase does not always occur due\nto the unsatisfaction of other essential features (e.g., brand, material,\nprice). We refer to the reason for such a visually related interaction\ndeviating from the real preference as a visual bias. Existing visually-aware\nmodels make use of the visual features as a separate collaborative signal\nsimilarly to other features to directly predict the user's preference without\nconsidering a potential bias, which gives rise to a visually biased\nrecommendation. In this paper, we derive a causal graph to identify and analyze\nthe visual bias of these existing methods. In this causal graph, the visual\nfeature of an item acts as a mediator, which could introduce a spurious\nrelationship between the user and the item. To eliminate this spurious\nrelationship that misleads the prediction of the user's real preference, an\nintervention and a counterfactual inference are developed over the mediator.\nParticularly, the Total Indirect Effect is applied for a debiased prediction\nduring the testing phase of the model. This causal inference framework is model\nagnostic such that it can be integrated into the existing methods.

Cross entropy (CE) loss, which is widely\nused for image recognition, is learned so that the probability value of true\nclass is closer to one by back propagation. However, for imbalanced datasets,\nthe learning is insufficient for the classes with a small number of samples.\nTherefore, we propose a novel classification method using the MSE loss that can\nbe learned the relationships of all classes no matter which image is input.\nUnlike CE loss, MSE loss is possible to equalize the number of back propagation\nfor all classes and to learn the feature space considering the relationships\nbetween classes as metric learning. Furthermore, instead of the usual one-hot\nteacher label, we use a novel teacher label that takes the number of class\nsamples into account. This induces the outlying label which depends on the\nnumber of samples in each class, and the class with a small number of samples\nhas outlying margin in a feature space. It is possible to create the feature\nspace for separating high-difficulty classes and low-difficulty classes.

Our survey results\nshowed that (1) despite the lower priority of documentation in Agile practices,\n98% of the respondents considered documented information moderately to\nextremely important when estimating effort, (2) 73% of them reported that they\nwould re-estimate a task when the documented information was changed, and (3)\nfunctional requirements, user stories, definition of done, UI wireframes,\nacceptance criteria, and task dependencies were ranked as the most useful types\nof documented information for effort estimation. Nevertheless, many respondents\nreported that these useful types of documented information were occasionally\nchanging or missing. Based on our study results, we provide recommendations for\nagile practitioners on how effort estimation can be improved by focusing on\njust-enough documentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 06:40:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

In this paper, we present a\nnovel approach to deduce two key types of utility for VPR: the utility of\nvisual cues `specific' to an environment, and to a particular place. We employ\ncontrastive learning principles to estimate both the environment- and\nplace-specific utility of Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD)\nclusters in an unsupervised manner, which is then used to guide local feature\nmatching through keypoint selection. By combining these two utility measures,\nour approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging\nbenchmark datasets, while simultaneously reducing the required storage and\ncompute time. We provide further analysis demonstrating that unsupervised\ncluster selection results in semantically meaningful results, that finer\ngrained categorization often has higher utility for VPR than high level\nsemantic categorization (e.g. building, road), and characterise how these two\nutility measures vary across different places and environments.

A classification of clinical catching trials might give\ninsight into the existence of pathological alterations in the relation of arm\nand ball movements. Accurate, but also early decisions are required to classify\na catching attempt before the catcher's first ball contact. To obtain\nclinically valuable results, a significant decision confidence of at least 75%\nis required. Hence, three competing objectives have to be optimized at the same\ntime: accuracy, earliness and decision-making confidence. Here we propose a\ncoupled classification and prediction approach for early time series\nclassification: a predictive, generative recurrent neural network (RNN)\nforecasts the next data points of ball trajectories based on already available\nobservations; a discriminative RNN continuously generates classification\nguesses based on the available data points and the unrolled sequence\npredictions. We compare our approach, which we refer to as predictive\nsequential classification (PSC), to state-of-the-art sequence learners,\nincluding various RNN and temporal convolutional network (TCN) architectures.\nOn this hard real-world task we can consistently demonstrate the superiority of\nPSC over all other models in terms of accuracy and confidence with respect to\nearliness of recognition. Specifically, PSC is able to confidently classify the\nsuccess of catching trials as early as 123 milliseconds before the first ball\ncontact.

Multi-fidelity\nmetamodels have been successfully applied to reduce the computational cost of\nthe SBDO process. In this context, the paper presents the performance\nassessment of an adaptive multi-fidelity metamodel based on a Gaussian process\nregression (MF-GPR) for noisy data. The MF-GPR is developed to: (i) manage an\narbitrary number of fidelity levels, (ii) deal with objective function\nevaluations affected by noise, and (iii) improve its fitting accuracy by\nadaptive sampling. Multi-fidelity is achieved by bridging a low-fidelity\nmetamodel with metamodels of the error between successive fidelity levels. The\nMF-GPR handles the numerical noise through regression. The adaptive sampling\nmethod is based on the maximum prediction uncertainty and includes rules to\nautomatically select the fidelity to sample. The MF-GPR performance are\nassessed on a set of five analytical benchmark problems affected by noisy\nobjective function evaluations. Since the noise introduces randomness in the\nevaluation of the objective function, a statistical analysis approach is\nadopted to assess the performance and the robustness of the MF-GPR.

Eigenfunctions of such problems exhibit several\nstandard features independent of the form of the underlying equations. As\ndiscussed in Bender \\emph{et al}\n[\\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1751-8113/47/23/235204}{J.~Phys.~A 47, 235204\n(2014)}], separatrices of nonlinear differential equations share some of these\nfeatures. In this sense, they can be considered eigenfunctions of nonlinear\ndifferential equations, and the quantized initial conditions that give rise to\nthe separatrices can be interpreted as eigenvalues. We introduce a first-order\nnonlinear eigenvalue problem involving a general class of functions and obtain\nthe large-eigenvalue limit by reducing it to a random walk problem on a\nhalf-line. The introduced general class of functions covers many special\nfunctions such as the Bessel and Airy functions, which are themselves solutions\nof second-order differential equations. For instance, in a special case\ninvolving the Bessel functions of the first kind, i.e., for $y'(x)=J_\\nu(xy)$,\nwe show that the eigenvalues asymptotically grow as $2^{41/42} n^{1/4}$. We\nalso introduce and discuss nonlinear eigenvalue problems involving the\nreciprocal gamma and the Riemann zeta functions, which are not solutions to\nsimple differential equations. With the reciprocal gamma function, i.e., for\n$y'(x)=1/\\Gamma(-xy)$, we show that the $n$th eigenvalue grows factorially fast\nas $\\sqrt{(1-2n)/\\Gamma(r_{2n-1})}$, where $r_k$ is the $k$th root of the\ndigamma function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 08:41:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 09:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

In recent years, several network architectures have been proposed to\nautomate this process and alleviate the burden of manual annotation. Although\nthe performance of these models has achieved promising results, there is still\nroom for improvement before these models can be used safely and effectively in\nclinical practice. One of the major challenges in prostate MR image\nsegmentation is the presence of class imbalance in the image labels where the\nbackground pixels dominate over the prostate. In the present work we propose a\nDL-based pipeline for cropping the region around the prostate from MRI images\nto produce a more balanced distribution of the foreground pixels (prostate) and\nthe background pixels and improve segmentation accuracy. The effect of\nDL-cropping for improving the segmentation performance compared to standard\ncenter-cropping is assessed using five popular DL networks for prostate\nsegmentation, namely U-net, U-net+, Res Unet++, Bridge U-net and Dense U-net.\nThe proposed smart-cropping outperformed the standard center cropping in terms\nof segmentation accuracy for all the evaluated prostate segmentation networks.\nIn terms of Dice score, the highest improvement was achieved for the U-net+ and\nResU-net++ architectures corresponding to 8.9% and 8%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 08:42:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 07:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

However, rare attention has been paid to GCN-based clustering on\nimbalanced data. Although imbalance problem has been extensively studied, the\nimpact of imbalanced data on GCN- based linkage prediction task is quite\ndifferent, which would cause problems in two aspects: imbalanced linkage labels\nand biased graph representations. The former is similar to that in classic\nimage classification task, but the latter is a particular problem in GCN-based\nclustering via linkage prediction. Significantly biased graph representations\nin training can cause catastrophic over-fitting of a GCN model. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a linkage-based doubly imbalanced graph learning\nframework for face clustering.

Our primary contribution is threefold.\nFirst, we consider mechanisms which perform a sequence of pairwise comparisons\nbetween candidates.

Our analysis for this mechanism\nleverages a powerful technical lemma recently developed by Kempe\n\\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/000120a}. We also provide a matching lower bound on its\ndistortion. In contrast, we prove that any mechanism which performs fewer than\n$m-1$ pairwise comparisons is destined to have unbounded distortion. Moreover,\nwe study the power of deterministic mechanisms under incomplete rankings. Most\nnotably, when every agent provides her $k$-top preferences we show an upper\nbound of $6 m/k + 1$ on the distortion, for any $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$.\nThus, we substantially improve over the previous bound of $12 m/k$ recently\nestablished by Kempe \\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/000120a,DBLP:conf/aaai/000120b}, and\nwe come closer to matching the best-known lower bound.

Recent advances on monocular\n3D object detection mainly rely on the ``pseudo-LiDAR'' generation, which\nperforms monocular depth estimation and lifts the 2D pixels to pseudo 3D\npoints. However, depth estimation from monocular images, due to its poor\naccuracy, leads to inevitable position shift of pseudo-LiDAR points within the\nobject. Therefore, the predicted bounding boxes may suffer from inaccurate\nlocation and deformed shape. In this paper, we present a novel neighbor-voting\nmethod that incorporates neighbor predictions to ameliorate object detection\nfrom severely deformed pseudo-LiDAR point clouds. Specifically, each feature\npoint around the object forms their own predictions, and then the ``consensus''\nis achieved through voting. In this way, we can effectively combine the\nneighbors' predictions with local prediction and achieve more accurate 3D\ndetection. To further enlarge the difference between the foreground region of\ninterest (ROI) pseudo-LiDAR points and the background points, we also encode\nthe ROI prediction scores of 2D foreground pixels into the corresponding\npseudo-LiDAR points. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark to\nvalidate the merits of our proposed method.

To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture,\ntermed as IEGAN, which removes the encoder of each network and introduces an\nencoder that is independent of other networks. Compared with previous models,\nit embodies three advantages of our model: Firstly, it is more directly and\ncomprehensively to grasp image information since the encoder no longer receives\nloss from generator and discriminator. Secondly, the independent encoder allows\neach network to focus more on its own goal which makes the translated image\nmore realistic. Thirdly, the reduction in the number of encoders performs more\nunified image representation. However, when the independent encoder applies two\ndown-sampling blocks, it's hard to extract semantic information. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose deep and shallow information space containing\ncharacteristic and semantic information, which can guide the model to translate\nhigh-quality images under the task with significant shape or texture change. We\ncompare IEGAN with other previous models, and conduct researches on semantic\ninformation consistency and component ablation at the same time.

We\nreconcile these approaches by showing that contrastive SSL methods (including\nInfoNCE) which maximize the mutual information (MI) implicitly learn a\nprobabilistic model of the inputs (specifically, a variational autoencoder;\nVAE). In particular, when we learn the optimal prior, the VAE objective (the\nELBO) becomes equal to the MI (up to a constant). In turn, for a deterministic\nencoder the ELBO is equal to the log Bayesian model evidence. This establishes\na profound connection between Bayesian inference and information theory.\nHowever, practical InfoNCE methods do not use the MI as an objective: the MI is\ninvariant to arbitrary invertible transformations, so using an MI objective can\nlead to highly entangled representations (Tschannen et al., 2019). Instead, the\nactual InfoNCE objective is a simplified lower bound on the MI which is loose\neven in the infinite sample limit. Thus, an objective that works (i.e. the\nactual InfoNCE objective) appears to be motivated as a loose bound on an\nobjective that does not work (i.e. the true MI which gives arbitrarily\nentangled representations). We give an alternative motivation for the actual\nInfoNCE objective. In particular, we show that in the infinite sample limit,\nand for a particular choice of prior, the actual InfoNCE objective is equal to\nthe log Bayesian model evidence (up to a constant). Thus, we argue that our VAE\nperspective gives a better motivation for InfoNCE than MI, as the actual\nInfoNCE objective is only loosely bounded by the MI, but is equal to the log\nBayesian model evidence (up to a constant).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 09:24:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 14:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

Many recent studies have made some efforts\non domain generalization (DG), whereas there are still some noteworthy\nlimitations.

In this paper, we study a novel\nclass of hyperproperties where the individual computation paths are chosen by\nthe strategic choices of a coalition of agents in a multi-agent system. We\nintroduce HyperATL*, an extension of computation tree logic with path variables\nand strategy quantifiers. HyperATL* can express strategic hyperproperties, such\nas that the scheduler in a concurrent system has a strategy to avoid\ninformation leakage. HyperATL* is particularly useful to specify asynchronous\nhyperproperties, i.e., hyperproperties where the speed of the execution on the\ndifferent computation paths depends on the choices of the scheduler. Unlike\nother recent logics for the specification of asynchronous hyperproperties, our\nlogic is the first to admit decidable model checking for the full logic. We\npresent a model checking algorithm for HyperATL* based on alternating word\nautomata and show that our algorithm is asymptotically optimal by providing a\nmatching lower bound.

As well known, several measurements of 7-Li\nabundances in stellar atmospheres point out a disagreement between predictions\nand observations in different stellar evolutionary phases, rising doubts about\nthe capability of present stellar models to precisely reproduce stellar\nenvelope characteristics. Light elements are burned at relatively low\ntemperatures (from 2 to 5 MK) and thus in the evolutionary stages of a star\nthey are gradually destroyed at different depths of stellar interior, in\ndependence on the stellar mass. Their surface abundances are strongly\ninfluenced by the nuclear cross sections, by the extension of the convective\nenvelope and by the temperature at its bottom, which depend on the\ncharacteristics of the star (mass and chemical composition) as well as on the\nenergy transport in the convective stellar envelope. In recent years, a great\neffort has been made to improve the precision of light element burning cross\nsections. However, theoretical predictions surface light element abundance are\nchallenging because they are also influenced by the uncertainties in the input\nphysics adopted in the calculations as well as the efficiency of several\nstandard and non-standard physical processes active in young stars (i.e.\ndiffusion, radiative levitation, magnetic fields, rotation). Moreover, it is\nstill not completely clear how much the previous protostellar evolution affects\nthe characteristics of a stellar model and thus the light element depletion.\nThis paper presents the state-of-the-art of theoretical predictions for\nprotostars and PMS stars, discussing the role of several input physics on the\nstellar evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 10:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Differential\nprivate (DP) training algorithms provide theoretical guarantees for training\nmachine learning models by injecting statistical noise to prevent privacy\nleaks.

A major drawback of MOS tests is that they only offer a general\nmeasure of overall quality-i.e., the naturalness of an utterance-and so cannot\ntell us where exactly synthesis errors occur. This can make evaluation of the\nappropriateness of prosodic variation within utterances inconclusive. To\naddress this, we propose a novel evaluation method based on the Rapid Prosody\nTranscription paradigm. This allows listeners to mark the locations of errors\nin an utterance in real-time, providing a probabilistic representation of the\nperceptual errors that occur in the synthetic signal. We conduct experiments\nthat confirm that the fine-grained evaluation can be mapped to system rankings\nof standard MOS tests, but the error marking gives a much more comprehensive\nassessment of synthesized prosody. In particular, for standard audiobook test\nset samples, we see that error marks consistently cluster around words at major\nprosodic boundaries indicated by punctuation. However, for question-answer\nbased stimuli, where we control information structure, we see differences\nemerge in the ability of neural TTS systems to generate context-appropriate\nprosodic prominence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 10:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

In\nthis paper, we revisit this approach to hand gesture recognition and suggest\nseveral improvements. We observe that raw depth images possess low contrast in\nthe hand regions of interest (ROI). They do not highlight important fine\ndetails, such as finger orientation, overlap between the finger and palm, or\noverlap between multiple fingers. We thus propose quantizing the depth values\ninto several discrete regions, to create a higher contrast between several key\nparts of the hand. In addition, we suggest several ways to tackle the high\nvariance problem in existing multimodal fusion CRNN architectures. We evaluate\nour method on two benchmarks: the DHG-14/28 dataset and the SHREC'17 track\ndataset.

This inverse problem requires a numerical\nforward model that is both accurate and fast, as typical inverse procedures\nrequire many evaluations. The Weakly-enforced Slip Method (WSM) was developed\nto meet these needs, but it was not before applied in an inverse problem\nsetting. Consequently, it was unknown what effect particular properties of the\nWSM, notably its inherent continuity, have on the inversion process.

A marked\nincrease in the occupation of neutrons in the pf-orbit is noted in Ne and Mg\nisotopes from N=19 onwards.

The so-called Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm (1988) uses polynomial\nadditions and shifts by a monomial.

Empowered by accurate neural network potentials, the\nprogram can navigate the configuration space faster than DFT by more than\n10$^{2}$-fold. In blind tests on 60 ternary compositions diversely selected\nfrom the experimental database, SPINNER successfully identifies experimental\n(or theoretically more stable) phases for ~80% of materials within 5000\ngenerations, entailing up to half a million structure evaluations for each\ncomposition. When benchmarked against previous data mining or DFT-based\nevolutionary predictions, SPINNER identifies more stable phases in the majority\nof cases. By developing a reliable and fast structure-prediction framework,\nthis work opens the door to large-scale, unbounded computational exploration of\nundiscovered inorganic crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 13:09:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 12:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Whilst OCS was initially invented by\nFahrbach, Huang, Tao, and Zadimoghaddam to solve the edge-weighted online\nbipartite matching problem, it is an interesting technique on its own due to\nits capability of introducing a powerful algorithmic tool, namely negative\ncorrelation, to online algorithms. As such, Fahrbach et al. posed two\ntantalizing open questions in their paper, one of which was the following: Can\nwe obtain n-way OCS for n>2, in which the algorithm can be given n>2 elements\nto choose from at each timestep?\n  In this paper, we affirmatively answer this open question by presenting a\nthree-way OCS. Our algorithm uses two-way OCS as its building block and is\nsimple to describe; however, as it internally runs two instances of two-way\nOCS, one of which is fed with the output of the other, the final output\nprobability distribution becomes highly elusive. We tackle this difficulty by\napproximating the output distribution of OCS by a flat, less correlated\nfunction and using it as a safe \"surrogate\" of the real distribution.

Considering the rapid growth of available\nquantum resources that are not fully fault-tolerant, it is crucial to develop\npractical hardware-friendly quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques to\nsuppress unwanted errors. Here, we propose a novel generalized quantum subspace\nexpansion method which can handle stochastic, coherent, and algorithmic errors\nin quantum computers. By fully exploiting the substantially extended subspace,\nwe can efficiently mitigate the noise present in the spectra of a given\nHamiltonian, without relying on any information of noise. The performance of\nour method is discussed under two highly practical setups: the quantum\nsubspaces are mainly spanned by powers of the noisy state $\\rho^m$ and a set of\nerror-boosted states, respectively. We numerically demonstrate in both\nsituations that we can suppress errors by orders of magnitude, and show that\nout protocol inherits the advantages of previous error-agnostic QEM techniques\nas well as overcoming their drawbacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 13:34:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 11:36:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 02:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

One of the main features of GLLVMs is their capacity to handle a\nvariety of responses types, such as (overdispersed) counts, binomial responses,\n(semi-)continuous, and proportions data. On the other hand, the introduction of\nunderlying latent variables presents some major computational challenges, as\nthe resulting marginal likelihood function involves an intractable integral for\nnon-normally distributed responses. This has spurred research into\napproximation methods to overcome this integral, with a recent and particularly\ncomputationally scalable one being that of variational approximations (VA).\nHowever, research into the use of VA of GLLVMs and related models has been\nhampered by the fact that closed-form approximations have only been obtained\nfor certain pairs of response distributions and link functions.\n  In this article, we propose an extended variational approximations (EVA)\napproach which widens the set of VA-applicable GLLVMs drastically.

Recently proposed HS\npansharpening methods have obtained remarkable results using deep convolutional\nnetworks (ConvNets), which typically consist of three steps: (1) up-sampling\nthe LR-HSI, (2) predicting the residual image via a ConvNet, and (3) obtaining\nthe final fused HSI by adding the outputs from first and second steps. Recent\nmethods have leveraged Deep Image Prior (DIP) to up-sample the LR-HSI due to\nits excellent ability to preserve both spatial and spectral information,\nwithout learning from large data sets. However, we observed that the quality of\nup-sampled HSIs can be further improved by introducing an additional\nspatial-domain constraint to the conventional spectral-domain energy function.\nWe define our spatial-domain constraint as the $L_1$ distance between the\npredicted PAN image and the actual PAN image. To estimate the PAN image of the\nup-sampled HSI, we also propose a learnable spectral response function (SRF).\nMoreover, we noticed that the residual image between the up-sampled HSI and the\nreference HSI mainly consists of edge information and very fine structures. In\norder to accurately estimate fine information, we propose a novel over-complete\nnetwork, called HyperKite, which focuses on learning high-level features by\nconstraining the receptive from increasing in the deep layers.

Quantifying global\nmigration is, however, challenging because of poor recording, privacy issues\nand residence status. This is particularly critical for some classes of\nmigrants involved in stigmatised, unregulated or illegal activities. Escorting\nservices or high-end prostitution are well-paid activities that attract workers\nall around the world. In this paper, we study international migration patterns\nof sex-workers by using network methods. Using an extensive international\nonline advertisement directory of escorting services and information about\nindividual escorts, we reconstruct a migrant flow network where nodes represent\neither origin or destination countries. The links represent the direct routes\nbetween two countries. The migration network of sex-workers shows different\nstructural patterns than the migration of the general population. The network\ncontains a strong core where mutual migration is often observed between a group\nof high-income European countries, yet Europe is split into different network\ncommunities with specific ties to non-European countries.

The GDP per capita is a good indicator of country\nattractiveness for incoming workers and service rates but is unrelated to the\nprobability of emigration.

Only sex-workers coming\nfrom 77% of the countries have financial gains with migration and average gains\ndecrease with the GDPc of the country of origin.

To overcome this problem, two different\nclasses of models have been introduced in econometrics and statistical physics.\nEconometric approaches interpret the traditional GM as the expected value of a\nprobability distribution that can be chosen arbitrarily and tested against\nalternative distributions.

The resulting equations obey conservation\nlaws for volume and momentum where characteristic potentials for gravitation\nand surface tension are identified analogously to conservative forces.

Results: We found that the system has a massive white dwarf M_WD =\n1.00(2) M_sun a mass ratio of q = 0.16, and a relatively hot secondary with an\neffective temperature T_2 = 4100(50) K. The system inclination is i =\n78.8{\\deg}. The accretion disk spreads out to the tidal limitation radius and\nhas an extended hot spot or line region. The hot spot or line is hotter than\nthe remaining outer part of the disk in quiescence or in intermediate state,\nbut does not stand out completely from the disk flux in (super)outbursts.\nConclusions: We claim that this object represents a link between two distinct\nclasses of SU UMa-type and SW Sex-type cataclysmic variables. The accretion\nflow structure in the disk corresponds to the SW Sex systems, but the physical\nconditions inside the disk fit the behaviour of SU UMa-type objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 15:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

New source and detector hardware can improve\nkey rates significantly, however it can require expensive cooling. We show that\nTwin Field Quantum Key Distribution (TF QKD) has an advantageous topology\nallowing the localisation of cooled detectors. This setup for a quantum network\nallows a fully connected network solution, i.e. one where every connection has\nnon zero key rates, in a box with sides of length up to 110km with just 4\ncooled nodes, while Decoy state BB84 is only capable of up to 80km with 40\ncooled nodes, and 50km if no nodes are cooled. The average key rate in the\nnetwork of the localised, cooled TF QKD is more than 30 times greater than the\nuncooled Decoy BB84 solution and 0.9 those of cooled Decoy BB84. To reduce the\ncost of the network further, switches can be used in the network. These\nswitches have losses ranging between 1 to 2dB. Adding these losses to the model\nshows further the advantages of TF-QKD in a network. Decoy BB84 is only able to\ngenerate fully connected solutions up to 20km if all nodes are cooled for a 40\nnode network for 1dB losses. In comparison, using TF QKD,70km networks are\npossible with just 4 cooling locations for the same losses. The simulation\nshows the significant benefits in using TF QKD in a switched network, and\nsuggests that further work in this direction is necessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 15:10:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 17:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

To overcome\nthese limitations, we present VidLanKD, a video-language knowledge distillation\nmethod for improving language understanding. We train a multi-modal teacher\nmodel on a video-text dataset, and then transfer its knowledge to a student\nlanguage model with a text dataset. To avoid approximation error, we propose to\nuse different knowledge distillation objectives. In addition, the use of a\nlarge-scale video-text dataset helps learn diverse and richer vocabularies. In\nour experiments, VidLanKD achieves consistent improvements over text-only\nlanguage models and vokenization models, on several downstream language\nunderstanding tasks including GLUE, SQuAD, and SWAG. We also demonstrate the\nimproved world knowledge, physical reasoning, and temporal reasoning\ncapabilities of our model by evaluating on the GLUE-diagnostics, PIQA, and\nTRACIE datasets. Lastly, we present comprehensive ablation studies as well as\nvisualizations of the learned text-to-video grounding results of our teacher\nand student language models.

The\nsignature for direct Higgs production is a small rise in cross sections for\nparticular final states, consistent with Higgs decays, over the expectations\nfor their occurrence due to SM background processes involving $Z^*,\\gamma^*$,\nor t-channel exchanges. Performing such a measurement is remarkably challenging\nfor four main reasons.

In this paper, a simple but\neffective Bayesian machine learning advanced forecast ensemble (BAMCAFE) method\nis developed, which combines an available imperfect physics-informed model with\ndata assimilation (DA) to facilitate the ML ensemble forecast. In the BAMCAFE\nframework, a Bayesian ensemble DA is applied to create the training data of the\nML model, which reduces the intrinsic error in the imperfect physics-informed\nmodel simulations and provides the training data of the unobserved variables.\nThen a generalized DA is employed for the initialization of the ML ensemble\nforecast. In addition to forecasting the optimal point-wise value, the BAMCAFE\nalso provides an effective approach of quantifying the forecast uncertainty\nutilizing a non-Gaussian probability density function that characterizes the\nintermittency and extreme events.

However, predicting\nenvironmentally assisted fractures is a highly cross-disciplinary endeavour\nthat requires resolving the multiple material-environment interactions taking\nplace. In this manuscript, an overview is given of recent breakthroughs in the\nmodelling of environmentally assisted cracking. The focus is on the\nopportunities created by two recent developments: phase field and multi-physics\nmodelling. The possibilities enabled by the confluence of phase field methods\nand electro-chemo-mechanics modelling are discussed in the context of three\nenvironmental assisted cracking phenomena of particular engineering interest:\nhydrogen embrittlement, localised corrosion and corrosion fatigue. Mechanical\nprocesses such as deformation and fracture can be coupled with chemical\nphenomena like local reactions, ionic transport and hydrogen uptake and\ndiffusion. Moreover, these can be combined with the prediction of an evolving\ninterface, such as a growing pit or a crack, as dictated by a phase field\nvariable that evolves based on thermodynamics and local kinetics. Suitable for\nboth microstructural and continuum length scales, this new generation of\nsimulation-based, multi-physics phase field models can open new modelling\nhorizons and enable Virtual Testing in harmful environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 13:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

We test our method on nine different\nmodels against four attacks in RobustBench, consistently improving over\nstate-of-the-art performance.

In principle, many transportation networks lack a\nunified framework, which will coordinate the traffic in such a manner, in order\nto suppress congestion and at the same time improve the travel time of the\nusers situated in it. The rapid advancements in information, communication, and\ncomputation technologies have given rise to more elaborate modeling frameworks,\naiming to act as the coordination unit necessary to counter the issue of\ncongestion in real-time conditions. Such actions might have an adverse effect\non the efficiency of the network, prospectively leading to greater waiting time\nintervals for each individual driver. We propose a macroscopic model equipped\nwith an underlying reservation feature, known as Route Reservation Architecture\n(RRA). Vehicles enter the network (mainstream-wise or from the on-ramps) as\nlong as this inflow does not incur a density that exceeds the network's\ncritical density. Those vehicles prospectively exceeding the critical density\nare stored as queues at the origin of the motorway stretch and within the\non-ramps. Once there is sufficient space, for those vehicles to be accommodated\nby the respective cell of the network, they are discharged from their queueing\ninstance at their respective origin, moving towards their assigned path freely.\nIn previous works, this architecture has been only applied in microscopic\nsimulations in the context of urban networks without the influence of source\nterms (on-ramps). When the critical density of the stretch is reached, the\nreservations are activated, instigating a waiting interval to the vehicles\nstored at queues, allowing vehicles only to enter the network at a later time\ninstant, such that the critical density is not crossed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 20:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}
