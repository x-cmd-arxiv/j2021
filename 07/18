Herein, we\nreveal that hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) during degradation, which is usually\nattributed to the thermal effect, unexpectedly exhibits a strong\nhigh-temperature tunnelling effect. This gives a possible answer to the above\nquestion. High-precision first-principles calculations show that, in various\npossible HAT pathways, lower energy barrier and stronger tunnelling effect make\nthe HAT reaction related to the active end of the polymer occur more easily.

In this paper we reexamine\nthis issue, drawing on recent surveys for RSGs and WRs in the Magellanic\nClouds, M31, and M33. The RSG surveys have used Gaia astrometry to eliminate\nforeground contamination, and have separated RSGs from asymptotic giant branch\nstars using near-infrared colors.

This is in part due to the increasing number of important\ntasks such as meta-learning, clustering, and anomaly detection that are defined\non set inputs. These networks must take an arbitrary number of input samples\nand produce the output invariant to the input set permutation. Several\nalgorithms have been recently developed to address this urgent need. Our paper\nanalyzes these algorithms using both synthetic and real-world datasets, and\nshows that they are not effective in dealing with common data variations such\nas image translation or viewpoint change. To address this limitation, we\npropose a permutation-invariant cascaded attentional set operator (PICASO). The\ngist of PICASO is a cascade of multihead attention blocks with dynamic\ntemplates. The proposed operator is a stand-alone module that can be adapted\nand extended to serve different machine learning tasks.

PICASO increases the SmallNORB image classification accuracy\nwith novel viewpoints by about 10% points.

Fairness issues have attracted\nincreasing attention since machine learning software is increasingly used for\nhigh-stakes and high-risk decisions. Amongst all the existing fairness notions,\nthis work specifically targets \"equalized odds\" given its advantage in always\nallowing perfect classifiers. Equalized odds requires that members of every\ndemographic group do not receive disparate mistreatment. Prior works either\noptimize for an equalized odds related metric during the learning process like\na black-box, or manipulate the training data following some intuition. This\nwork studies the root cause of the violation of equalized odds and how to\ntackle it. We found that equalizing the class distribution in each demographic\ngroup with sample weights is a necessary condition for achieving equalized odds\nwithout modifying the normal training process. In addition, an important\npartial condition for equalized odds (zero average odds difference) can be\nguaranteed when the class distributions are weighted to be not only equal but\nalso balanced (1:1). Based on these analyses, we proposed FairBalance, a\npre-processing algorithm which balances the class distribution in each\ndemographic group by assigning calculated weights to the training data. On\neight real-world datasets, our empirical results show that, at low\ncomputational overhead, the proposed pre-processing algorithm FairBalance can\nsignificantly improve equalized odds without much, if any damage to the\nutility. FairBalance also outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in\nterms of equalized odds.

On large\nscales our model follows a Planck-based template. On small scales, our model\nproduces spectra that behave like power-laws up to $\\ell \\sim 4000$ or smaller\nscales by considering even smaller filaments, limited only by computing power.\nWe can produce any number of Monte Carlo realizations of small-scale Galactic\ndust. Our model will allow tests of how the small-scale non-Gaussianity affect\nCMB weak lensing, and the consequences for the measurement of primordial\ngravitational waves or relativistic light relic species. Our model also can\ngenerate frequency decorrelation on the Modified Black Body (MBB) spectrum of\ndust, and is freely adjustable to different levels of decorrelation. This can\nbe used to test the performance of component separation methods and the impact\nof frequency spectra residuals on primordial $B$-mode surveys. The filament\ndensity we paint in the sky is also able to reproduce the general level of\nnon-Gaussianities measured by Minkowski functionals in the Planck 353 GHz\nchannel map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 21:53:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 17:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

Results in previous work have\nshown that, if we can encourage a proper portion of mainline vehicles to bypass\nrather than to stay steadfast, the social traffic conditions can be improved.\nIn this work, we consider employing a proportion of altruistic vehicles among\nthe selfish mainline vehicles to improve the efficiency of the on-ramps. The\naltruistic vehicles are individual optimizers, making decisions whether to stay\nsteadfast or bypass to minimize their own altruistic cost, which is a weighted\nsum of the travel delay and their negative impact on other vehicles. We first\nconsider the ideal case that altruistic costs can be perfectly measured by\naltruistic vehicles.

To balance the effectiveness and efficiency, the\nquestion retrieval system is typically implemented as multi-stage rankers: The\nfirst-stage ranker aims to recall potentially relevant questions from a large\nrepository, and the latter stages attempt to re-rank the retrieved results.\nMost existing works on question retrieval mainly focused on the re-ranking\nstages, leaving the first-stage ranker to some traditional term-based methods.\nHowever, term-based methods often suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem,\nespecially on short texts, which may block the re-rankers from relevant\nquestions at the very beginning. An alternative is to employ embedding-based\nmethods for the first-stage ranker, which compress texts into dense vectors to\nenhance the semantic matching. However, these methods often lose the\ndiscriminative power as term-based methods, thus introduce noise during\nretrieval and hurt the recall performance. In this work, we aim to tackle the\ndilemma of the first-stage ranker, and propose a discriminative semantic\nranker, namely DenseTrans, for high-recall retrieval. Specifically, DenseTrans\nis a densely connected Transformer, which learns semantic embeddings for texts\nbased on Transformer layers. Meanwhile, DenseTrans promotes low-level features\nthrough dense connections to keep the discriminative power of the learned\nrepresentations. DenseTrans is inspired by DenseNet in computer vision (CV),\nbut poses a new way to use the dense connectivity which is totally different\nfrom its original design purpose. Experimental results over two question\nretrieval benchmark datasets show that our model can obtain significant gain on\nrecall against strong term-based methods as well as state-of-the-art\nembedding-based methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2021 02:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

Moreover, the\ntheories are usually too abstract for understanding each concrete humor\nsnippet. To fill in the gap, we develop DeHumor, a visual analytical system for\nanalyzing humorous behaviors in public speaking. To intuitively reveal the\nbuilding blocks of each concrete example, DeHumor decomposes each humorous\nvideo into multimodal features and provides inline annotations of them on the\nvideo script. In particular, to better capture the build-ups, we introduce\ncontent repetition as a complement to features introduced in theories of\ncomputational humor and visualize them in a context linking graph. To help\nusers locate the punchlines that have the desired features to learn, we\nsummarize the content (with keywords) and humor feature statistics on an\naugmented time matrix. With case studies on stand-up comedy shows and TED\ntalks, we show that DeHumor is able to highlight various building blocks of\nhumor examples. In addition, expert interviews with communication coaches and\nhumor researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of DeHumor for multimodal humor\nanalysis of speech content and vocal delivery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2021 04:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

However, they often\ngeneralize poorly compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its\naccelerated schemes such as SGD with momentum (SGDM). In this paper, we propose\na new adaptive method called DecGD, which simultaneously achieves good\ngeneralization like SGDM and obtain rapid convergence like Adam-type methods.\nIn particular, DecGD decomposes the current gradient into the product of two\nterms including a surrogate gradient and a loss based vector. Our method\nadjusts the learning rates adaptively according to the current loss based\nvector instead of the squared gradients used in Adam-type methods. The\nintuition for adaptive learning rates of DecGD is that a good optimizer, in\ngeneral cases, needs to decrease the learning rates as the loss decreases,\nwhich is similar to the learning rates decay scheduling technique. Therefore,\nDecGD gets a rapid convergence in the early phases of training and controls the\neffective learning rates according to the loss based vectors which help lead to\na better generalization. Convergence analysis is discussed in both convex and\nnon-convex situations. Finally, empirical results on widely-used tasks and\nmodels demonstrate that DecGD shows better generalization performance than SGDM\nand rapid convergence like Adam-type methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2021 06:37:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

The task is challenging due to the sparse and discrete\nnature of graph spaces. Several approaches have been proposed in the\nliterature, most of which require to transform the graphs into sequences that\nencode their structure and labels and to learn the distribution of such\nsequences through an auto-regressive generative model. Among this family of\napproaches, we focus on the GraphGen model. The preprocessing phase of GraphGen\ntransforms graphs into unique edge sequences called Depth-First Search (DFS)\ncodes, such that two isomorphic graphs are assigned the same DFS code. Each\nelement of a DFS code is associated with a graph edge: specifically, it is a\nquintuple comprising one node identifier for each of the two endpoints, their\nnode labels, and the edge label. GraphGen learns to generate such sequences\nauto-regressively and models the probability of each component of the quintuple\nindependently. While effective, the independence assumption made by the model\nis too loose to capture the complex label dependencies of real-world graphs\nprecisely. By introducing a novel graph preprocessing approach, we are able to\nprocess the labeling information of both nodes and edges jointly. The\ncorresponding model, which we term GraphGen-Redux, improves upon the generative\nperformances of GraphGen in a wide range of datasets of chemical and social\ngraphs. In addition, it uses approximately 78% fewer parameters than the\nvanilla variant and requires 50% fewer epochs of training on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2021 09:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

To correct the deformation at\nunseen positions on the trajectory for building 3D volumes, an interpolation is\nperformed based on the stiffness values computed at the sampling positions.\nWith the stiffness and recorded force, the tissue displacement could be\ncorrected.

The breathing spectrum is obtained for different\nnumbers of majority particles, several values of the majority-component\ninteraction strengths and trap ratios. It is further compared to the breathing\nspectrum of a particle-balanced few-body Bose-Bose mixture. In particular, for\nequal post-quench traps the employed protocol allows to couple states of\ndifferent center-of-mass parity in contrast to species-symmetric trap quenches.\nAmong the participating eigenstates we identify one having odd center-of-mass\nparity and even global parity.

However, despite these\npromising improvements, it remains challenging to convey immersive and engaging\nVR games as players are usually limited to experience the virtual world by\nvision and hearing only. One prominent example of such open challenges is the\ndisparity between the real surroundings and the virtual environment. As virtual\nobstacles usually do not have a physical counterpart, players might walk\nthrough walls enclosing the level. Thus, past research mainly focussed on\nmultisensory collision feedback to deter players from ignoring obstacles.\nHowever, the underlying causative reasons for such unwanted behavior have\nmostly remained unclear.\n  Our work investigates how task types and wall appearances influence the\nplayers' incentives to walk through virtual walls.

Meanwhile, the acquisition process of multiple\nsignals is much complex, which can affect the subject's sleep. Therefore, the\nuse of single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) for automatic sleep staging\nhas become a popular research topic. In the literature, a large number of sleep\nstaging methods based on single-channel EEG have been proposed with promising\nresults and achieve the preliminary automation of sleep staging.

For example, tasks where the distance of the data from\nthe decision boundary is bounded away from zero. The basic and simple idea is\nto consider partial concepts: these are functions that can be undefined on\ncertain parts of the space. When learning a partial concept, we assume that the\nsource distribution is supported only on points where the partial concept is\ndefined.\n  This way, one can naturally express assumptions on the data such as lying on\na lower dimensional surface or margin conditions. In contrast, it is not at all\nclear that such assumptions can be expressed by the traditional PAC theory. In\nfact we exhibit easy-to-learn partial concept classes which provably cannot be\ncaptured by the traditional PAC theory. This also resolves a question posed by\nAttias, Kontorovich, and Mansour 2019.\n  We characterize PAC learnability of partial concept classes and reveal an\nalgorithmic landscape which is fundamentally different than the classical one.\nFor example, in the classical PAC model, learning boils down to Empirical Risk\nMinimization (ERM). In stark contrast, we show that the ERM principle fails in\nexplaining learnability of partial concept classes. In fact, we demonstrate\nclasses that are incredibly easy to learn, but such that any algorithm that\nlearns them must use an hypothesis space with unbounded VC dimension. We also\nfind that the sample compression conjecture fails in this setting.\n  Thus, this theory features problems that cannot be represented nor solved in\nthe traditional way. We view this as evidence that it might provide insights on\nthe nature of learnability in realistic scenarios which the classical theory\nfails to explain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2021 13:29:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 19:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

In this paper,\nwe study the dynamics driven by the non-normal matrix (Hamiltonian) realized as\na continuous quantum trajectory of the Lindblad master equation in open quantum\nsystems and point out that the dynamics can reveal the nature of unconventional\npseudospectrum of the non-normal Hamiltonian.

In particular, it is shown that, when the AORG is combined\nwith a Multi-Model Adaptive Estimator (MMAE), the AR sequence can be determined\nsuch that the tracking properties are guaranteed and constraints are satisfied\nat all times, while the detection performance is optimized, i.e., faults can be\ndetected with a high probability of correctness. In addition a reconfiguration\nscheme is presented that ensures system viability despite the presence of\nfaults based on recoverable sets. Simulations on a Boeing 747-100 aircraft\nmodel are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the AORG scheme in\nenforcing constraints and tracking the desired roll and side-slip angles. The\neffectiveness of the presented fault-tolerant control scheme in maintaining the\nairplane viability in the presence of damaged vertical stabilizer is also\ndemonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2021 14:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

The key advantage of this\napproach is that elliptic curve groups can be of any size in the Hasse-Weil\ninterval $[q+1 \\pm 2\\sqrt{q}]$ and thus can have subgroups of large, smooth\norder, which an FFT-like divide and conquer algorithm can exploit. Compare this\nwith multiplicative subgroups over whose order must divide $q-1$.\n  For polynomials represented by their evaluation over subsets of $L$, we show\nthat multiplication, division, degree-computation, interpolation, evaluation\nand Reed-Solomon encoding (also known as low-degree extension) with fixed\nevaluation points can all be computed with arithmetic circuits of size similar\nto what is achievable with the classical FFTs when the field size is special.\nFor several problems, this yields the asymptotically smallest known arithmetic\ncircuits even in the standard monomial representation of polynomials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2021 15:27:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 12:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

We rigorously\ndemonstrate that hyperuniformity is preserved as long as certain conditions\nassociated with the displacement fields are met.

However, recent studies reveal that an orbital current, given by the\nflow of electrons with a finite orbital angular momentum, can be electrically\ngenerated and transported in wide classes of materials despite the effect of\norbital quenching in the ground state. Orbital currents also play a fundamental\nrole in the mechanisms of other transport phenomena such as spin Hall effect\nand valley Hall effect.

Its appropriateness is highly debated in both fields,\nparticularly with regards to whether it is useful for the advancement of\nscience and technology. Considerably less attention, however, has been devoted\nto how the Computational Metaphor is used outside of the lab, and particularly\nhow it may shape society's interactions with AI. As such, recently publicized\nconcerns over AI's role in perpetuating racism, genderism, and ableism suggest\nthat the term \"artificial intelligence\" is misplaced, and that a new lexicon is\nneeded to describe these computational systems. Thus, there is an essential\nquestion about the Computational Metaphor that is rarely asked by\nneuroscientists: whom does it help and whom does it harm? This essay invites\nthe neuroscience community to consider the social implications of the field's\nmost controversial metaphor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2021 12:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

Under review","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.IR cs.AI cs.LG","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  So far, most research on recommender systems focused on maintaining long-term\nuser engagement and satisfaction, by promoting relevant and personalized\ncontent. However, it is still very challenging to evaluate the quality and the\nreliability of this content. In this paper, we propose FEBR (Expert-Based\nRecommendation Framework), an apprenticeship learning framework to assess the\nquality of the recommended content on online platforms. The framework exploits\nthe demonstrated trajectories of an expert (assumed to be reliable) in a\nrecommendation evaluation environment, to recover an unknown utility function.\nThis function is used to learn an optimal policy describing the expert's\nbehavior, which is then used in the framework to provide high-quality and\npersonalized recommendations. We evaluate the performance of our solution\nthrough a user interest simulation environment (using RecSim). We simulate\ninteractions under the aforementioned expert policy for videos recommendation,\nand compare its efficiency with standard recommendation methods. The results\nshow that our approach provides a significant gain in terms of content quality,\nevaluated by experts and watched by users, while maintaining almost the same\nwatch time as the baseline approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 18:21:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 00:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}
