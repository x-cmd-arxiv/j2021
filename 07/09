Classical machine learning and deep learning method\nhave developed well in the field of network traffic classification. However,\nthere are still two major challenges. One is how to protect the privacy of\nusers' traffic data, and the other is that it is difficult to obtain labeled\ndata in reality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using federated\nsemi-supervised learning for network traffic classification. In our approach,\nthe federated servers and several clients work together to train a global\nclassification model. Among them, unlabeled data is used on the client, and\nlabeled data is used on the server. Moreover, we use two traffic subflow\nsampling methods: simple sampling and incremental sampling for data\npreprocessing. The experimental results in the QUIC dataset show that the\naccuracy of our federated semi-supervised approach can reach 91.08% and 97.81%\nwhen using the simple sampling method and incremental sampling method\nrespectively. The experimental results also show that the accuracy gap between\nour method and the centralized training method is minimal, and it can\neffectively protect users' privacy and does not require a large amount of\nlabeled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 16:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

While many existing approaches\nfocus on the integration scheme to incorporate entity side information -- by\ncombining the recommendation loss function with an extra side information-aware\nloss -- in this paper, we propose instead a novel pre-training scheme for\nleveraging the side information. In particular, we first pre-train a\nrepresentation model using the side information of the entities, and then\nfine-tune it using an existing general representation-based recommendation\nmodel. Specifically, we propose two pre-training models, named GCN-P and COM-P,\nby considering the entities and their relations constructed from side\ninformation as two different types of graphs respectively, to pre-train entity\nembeddings. For the GCN-P model, two single-relational graphs are constructed\nfrom all the users' and items' side information respectively, to pre-train\nentity representations by using the Graph Convolutional Networks. For the COM-P\nmodel, two multi-relational graphs are constructed to pre-train the entity\nrepresentations by using the Composition-based Graph Convolutional Networks. An\nextensive evaluation of our pre-training models fine-tuned under four general\nrepresentation-based recommender models, i.e. MF, NCF, NGCF and LightGCN, shows\nthat effectively pre-training embeddings with both the user's and item's side\ninformation can significantly improve these original models in terms of both\neffectiveness and stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 16:07:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 15:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-12"}

This result generalizes Zalka's\nresult for $\\ell=1$. We also present several numerical results in which our\nlower bounds based on the trace distance outperform recently obtained lower\nbounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 16:20:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 13:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

Meta learning studies how learning systems can increase in\nefficiency through experience and could thus evolve as an important concept to\novercome data sparsity. However, the core capability of meta learning-based\napproaches is the identification of similar previous tasks given a new task - a\nchallenge largely unexplored in the biomedical imaging domain. In this paper,\nwe address the problem of quantifying task similarity with a concept that we\nrefer to as task fingerprinting. The concept involves converting a given task,\nrepresented by imaging data and corresponding labels, to a fixed-length vector\nrepresentation. In fingerprint space, different tasks can be directly compared\nirrespective of their data set sizes, types of labels or specific resolutions.\nAn initial feasibility study in the field of surgical data science (SDS) with\n26 classification tasks from various medical and non-medical domains suggests\nthat task fingerprinting could be leveraged for both (1) selecting appropriate\ndata sets for pretraining and (2) selecting appropriate architectures for a new\ntask.

In\nthis colloidal metallic phase, the small particles roam the crystal maintaining\nthe integrity of the lattice of large particles, as electrons do in metals. A\nsimilar transition also occurs in superionic crystals, termed sublattice\nmelting.

If we can meta-train on\noffline data, then we can reuse the same static dataset, labeled once with\nrewards for different tasks, to meta-train policies that adapt to a variety of\nnew tasks at meta-test time. Although this capability would make meta-RL a\npractical tool for real-world use, offline meta-RL presents additional\nchallenges beyond online meta-RL or standard offline RL settings. Meta-RL\nlearns an exploration strategy that collects data for adapting, and also\nmeta-trains a policy that quickly adapts to data from a new task. Since this\npolicy was meta-trained on a fixed, offline dataset, it might behave\nunpredictably when adapting to data collected by the learned exploration\nstrategy, which differs systematically from the offline data and thus induces\ndistributional shift. We propose a hybrid offline meta-RL algorithm, which uses\noffline data with rewards to meta-train an adaptive policy, and then collects\nadditional unsupervised online data, without any reward labels to bridge this\ndistribution shift. By not requiring reward labels for online collection, this\ndata can be much cheaper to collect. We compare our method to prior work on\noffline meta-RL on simulated robot locomotion and manipulation tasks and find\nthat using additional unsupervised online data collection leads to a dramatic\nimprovement in the adaptive capabilities of the meta-trained policies, matching\nthe performance of fully online meta-RL on a range of challenging domains that\nrequire generalization to new tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 17:01:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 21:42:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 06:12:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 00:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

It is\nnot clear, however, whether his model remains valid in the presence of\nrotation, even though this was its original purpose. Furthermore, new\ninstabilities arise in rotating fluids, such as the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke\n(GSF) instability. Which instability dominates when more than one can be\nexcited, and how they influence each other, were open questions that this paper\nanswers. To do so, we use direct numerical simulations of diffusive stratified\nshear flows in a rotating triply-periodic Cartesian domain located at the\nequator of a star. We find that either the GSF instability or the shear\ninstability tends to take over the other in controlling the system, suggesting\nthat stellar evolution models only need to have a mixing prescription for each\nindividual instability, together with a criterion to determine which one\ndominates. However, we also find that it is not always easy to predict which\ninstability \"wins\" for given input parameters, because the diffusive shear\ninstability is subcritical, and only takes place if there is a finite-amplitude\nturbulence ``primer'' to seed it. Interestingly, we find that the GSF\ninstability can in some cases play the role of this primer, thereby providing a\npathway to excite the subcritical shear instability. This can also drive\nrelaxation oscillations, that may be observable. We conclude by proposing a new\nmodel for mixing in the equatorial regions of stellar radiative zones due to\ndifferential rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 17:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

This approach\nestimates the annual operational loss distribution, and a bank must set aside\ncapital, called regulatory capital, equal to the 0.999 quantile of this\nestimated distribution.

Additionally, the Sinh-arcSinh\ndistribution is another flexible candidate family for modeling loss severities\nthat can be easily estimated using the maximum likelihood approach.

Whenever a global\ntype can be projected on to each role, the composition of the projections is\ndeadlock free and has exactly the behaviours specified by the global type. The\nkey to the usability of MSTs is the projection operation: a more expressive\nprojection allows more systems to be type-checked but requires a more difficult\nsoundness argument. In this paper, we generalise the standard projection\noperation in MSTs. This allows us to model and type-check many design patterns\nin distributed systems, such as load balancing, that are rejected by the\nstandard projection. The key to the new projection is an analysis that tracks\ncausality between messages. Our soundness proof uses novel graph-theoretic\ntechniques from the theory of message-sequence charts. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of the new projection operation by showing many global types for\ncommon patterns that can be projected under our projection but not under the\nstandard projection operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 17:24:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 16:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 19:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

To solve this problem, which is\nchallenging because of the strong artifacts produced by the implant, we use a\npair of co-trained deep networks that generate dense deformation fields (DDFs)\nin opposite directions.

A growing body of research directs this goal towards augmenting the\ncreative writing abilities of human authors.

In particular, we examine a task referred to as sentence\ninfilling, which involves transforming a list of words into a complete\nsentence. We emphasize \"storiability\" as a desirable feature of the resulting\nsentences, where \"storiable\" sentences are those that suggest a story a reader\nwould be curious to hear about. Both humans and an automated system (based on a\nneural language model) performed this sentence infilling task. In one setting,\npeople wrote sentences on their own; in a different setting, people observed\nthe sentences produced by the model while writing their own sentences. Readers\nthen assigned storiability preferences to the resulting sentences in a\nsubsequent evaluation.

This\nwork proposes a novel deep boosted hybrid learning-based malware classification\nframework and named as Deep boosted Feature Space-based Malware classification\n(DFS-MC). In the proposed framework, the discrimination power is enhanced by\nfusing the feature spaces of the best performing customized CNN architectures\nmodels and its discrimination by an SVM for classification. The discrimination\ncapacity of the proposed classification framework is assessed by comparing it\nagainst the standard customized CNNs. The customized CNN models are implemented\nin two ways: softmax classifier and deep hybrid learning-based malware\nclassification. In the hybrid learning, Deep features are extracted from\ncustomized CNN architectures and fed into the conventional machine learning\nclassifier to improve the classification performance. We also introduced the\nconcept of transfer learning in a customized CNN architecture based malware\nclassification framework through fine-tuning. The performance of the proposed\nmalware classification approaches are validated on the MalImg malware dataset\nusing the hold-out cross-validation technique.

This separated training scheme results in potentially sub-optimal\nperformance and prevents 3D tasks from being used to benefit 2D tasks that are\noften useful on their own. To provide a more integrated approach, we propose a\nnovel Multi-Modality Task Cascade network (MTC-RCNN) that leverages 3D box\nproposals to improve 2D segmentation predictions, which are then used to\nfurther refine the 3D boxes. We show that including a 2D network between two\nstages of 3D modules significantly improves both 2D and 3D task performance.\nMoreover, to prevent the 3D module from over-relying on the overfitted 2D\npredictions, we propose a dual-head 2D segmentation training and inference\nscheme, allowing the 2nd 3D module to learn to interpret imperfect 2D\nsegmentation predictions.

In contrast, TGHop is\nsmall in its model size, mathematically transparent, efficient in training and\ninference, and able to generate high quality texture.

In this paper, we present a novel expansion scheme of the cross\nsection for minimum bias events that exploits an ergodic hypothesis for\nparticles in the events and events in an ensemble of data. We identify power\ncounting rules and symmetries of minimum bias from which the form of the\nsquared matrix element can be expanded in symmetric polynomials of the phase\nspace coordinates. This expansion is entirely defined in terms of observable\nquantities, in contrast to models of heavy ion collisions that rely on\nunmeasurable quantities like the number of nucleons participating in the\ncollision, or tunes of parton shower parameters to describe the underlying\nevent in proton collisions. The expansion parameter that we identify from our\npower counting is the number of detected particles $N$ and as $N\\to\\infty$ the\nvariance of the squared matrix element about its mean, constant value on phase\nspace vanishes.

Recently, significant progress has been made analytically by\nmodeling non-integrable systems as stochastic systems, lacking a Hamiltonian\npicture, while honest Hamiltonian dynamics are frequently limited to small\nsystem sizes due to computational constraints. In this paper, we address this\nby investigating the role of conservation laws (including energy conservation)\nin the thermalization process from an information-theoretic perspective. For\ngeneral non-integrable models, we use the equilibrium approximation to show\nthat the maximal amount of information is scrambled (as measured by the\ntripartite mutual information of the time-evolution operator) at late times\neven when a system conserves energy. In contrast, we explicate how when a\nsystem has additional symmetries that lead to degeneracies in the spectrum, the\namount of information scrambled must decrease. This general theory is\nexemplified in case studies of holographic conformal field theories (CFTs) and\nthe Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Due to the large Virasoro symmetry in 1+1D\nCFTs, we argue that, in a sense, these holographic theories are not maximally\nchaotic, which is explicitly seen by the non-saturation of the second R\\'enyi\ntripartite mutual information. The roles of particle-hole and U(1) symmetries\nin the SYK model are milder due to the degeneracies being only two-fold, which\nwe confirm explicitly at both large- and small-$N$. We reinterpret the operator\nentanglement in terms the growth of local operators, connecting our results\nwith the information scrambling described by out-of-time-ordered correlators,\nidentifying the mechanism for suppressed scrambling from the Heisenberg\nperspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 19:32:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

For example, these very tadpole\npotentials lead to weak-string-coupling cosmologies that appear to provide\nclues on the onset of the inflation from an initial fast roll. The transition,\nif accessible to us, would offer a natural explanation for the lack of power\nmanifested by the CMB at large angular scales. In addition, the same tadpole\npotentials can drive spontaneous compactifications to lower-dimensional\nMinkowski spaces at corresponding length scales.

In the\nsecond level, the network is described in terms of the individual positions of\nits agents. The aim of the multi-agent network is to attain a spatial\ndistribution that resembles that of a reference coverage density function\n(high-level problem) by means of local (microscopic) interactions of its agents\n(low-level problem).

The volume fraction of the inclusions can be any number between\nzero and one. We find such inclusions with any finite number of components and\ncomponents that are multiply connected. These special inclusions enjoy many\nuseful properties with respect to homogenization and energy minimization. For\nexample, we use them to give new results on a) the effective properties of\ntwo-phase composites and b) optimal bounds and optimal microstructures for\ntwo-phase composites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 20:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-12"}

On the\nmodern Earth, this spectral reflectance is characterized by an increase in\nreflectance between the red and near-infrared wavelengths, a \"red edge\". On\nplanets orbiting different stellar types, red edge analogs may occur at other\ncolors than red. Thus, knowing the wavelengths at which photosynthetic\norganisms preferentially absorb and reflect photons is necessary to detect red\nedge analogs on other planets. Using a numerical model that predicts the\nabsorbance spectrum of extant photosynthetic pigments on Earth from\nMarosv\\\"olgyi and van Gorkom (2010), we calculate the absorbance spectrum for\npigments on an Earth-like planet around F through late M type stars that are\nadapted for maximal energy production. In this model, cellular energy\nproduction is maximized when pigments are tuned to absorb at the wavelength\nthat maximizes energy input from incident photons while minimizing thermal\nemission and costs to build the photosynthetic apparatus. We find that peak\nphoton absorption for photosynthetic organisms around F type stars tends to be\nin the blue while for G, K, and early M type stars, red or just beyond is\npreferred. Around the coolest M type stars, these organisms may preferentially\nabsorb in the near-infrared, possibly past one micron. These predictions are\nconsistent with previous, qualitative estimates of pigment absorptance. Our\npredicted pigment absorbance spectra depend on both the stellar type and\nplanetary atmospheric composition, especially atmospheric water vapor\nconcentrations, which alter the availability of surface photons and thus the\npredicted pigment absorption. By constraining the absorbance spectra of alien,\nphotosynthetic organisms, future observations may be better equipped to detect\nred edge analogs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 21:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-12"}

Moreover, the analytical expression of these objective functions may\nbe unknown. These functions are known as black-boxes, for example, estimating\nthe generalization error of a machine learning algorithm and computing its\nprediction time in terms of its hyper-parameters. Multi-objective Bayesian\noptimization (MOBO) is a set of methods that has been successfully applied for\nthe simultaneous optimization of black-boxes. Concretely, BO methods rely on a\nprobabilistic model of the objective functions, typically a Gaussian process.\nThis model generates a predictive distribution of the objectives. However, MOBO\nmethods have problems when the number of objectives in a multi-objective\noptimization problem are 3 or more, which is the many objective setting. In\nparticular, the BO process is more costly as more objectives are considered,\ncomputing the quality of the solution via the hyper-volume is also more costly\nand, most importantly, we have to evaluate every objective function, wasting\nexpensive computational, economic or other resources. However, as more\nobjectives are involved in the optimization problem, it is highly probable that\nsome of them are redundant and not add information about the problem solution.\nA measure that represents how similar are GP predictive distributions is\nproposed. We also propose a many objective Bayesian optimization algorithm that\nuses this metric to determine whether two objectives are redundant.

In this paper we focus on two data types:\nGPS and accelerometer data from smartphones. We used smartphone data from 225\ncollege student participants and applied four circadian rhythm characterization\nmethods. We found significant and interesting discrepancies in the rhythmic\npatterns discovered among sensors, which suggests circadian rhythms discovered\nfrom different personal tracking sensors have different levels of sensitivity\nto device usage and aspects of daily behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 22:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-12"}

In\naddition to confirming previous results from the literature, e.g., that overall\nhost star metallicity distributions differ between hot and warm planetary\nsystems of all types, we report on a new finding that when comparing the median\nmetallicities of hot versus warm systems, the difference for multiple\nSuper-Earths is considerably larger when compared to that difference in single\nSuper-Earths. The metallicity CDFs of hot single Super-Earths versus warm\nsingle Super-Earths indicate different parent stellar populations, while for\nSub-Neptunes this is not the case. The transition radius between Sub-Neptunes\nand Sub-Saturns was examined by comparing the APOGEE metallicity distribution\nfor the Milky Way thin disk in the solar neighborhood with metallicity\ndistributions of host stars segregated based upon the largest known planet in\ntheir system.

A natural approach to solve this\nproblem is to learn a domain model from observations. However, model learning\napproaches frequently do not provide safety guarantees: the learned model may\nassume actions are applicable when they are not, and may incorrectly capture\nactions' effects. This may result in generating plans that will fail when\nexecuted. In some domains such failures are not acceptable, due to the cost of\nfailure or inability to replan online after failure. In such settings, all\nlearning must be done offline, based on some observations collected, e.g., by\nsome other agents or a human. Through this learning, the task is to generate a\nplan that is guaranteed to be successful. This is called the model-free\nplanning problem. Prior work proposed an algorithm for solving the model-free\nplanning problem in classical planning. However, they were limited to learning\ngrounded domains, and thus they could not scale. We generalize this prior work\nand propose the first safe model-free planning algorithm for lifted domains.

In the context of\nmachine learning and load balancing, several studies have focused on maximizing\nthe overall network throughput or the resource block utilization (RBU). In this\npaper, we propose a novel Clipped Double Q-Learning (CDQL)-based load balancing\napproach considering resource block utilization, latency and the Channel\nQuality Indicator (CQI). We compare our proposal with a traditional handover\nalgorithm and a resource block utilization based handover mechanism. Simulation\nresults reveal that our scheme is able to improve throughput, latency, jitter\nand packet loss ratio in comparison to the baseline algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 04:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

The simplicity of the\nmodel allows us to inquire about several relevant microscopic quantities.

We argue\nthat for many such applications, we should also require that the MPC protocol\nis publicly auditable, meaning that anyone can check the given computation is\ncarried out correctly -- even if the server nodes carrying out the computation\nare all corrupt. In a nutshell, the way to make an MPC protocol auditable is to\ncombine an underlying MPC protocol with verifiable computing proof (in\nparticular, a SNARK). Building a general-purpose MPCaaS from existing\nconstructions would require us to perform a costly \"trusted setup\" every time\nwe wish to run a new or modified application. To address this, we provide the\nfirst efficient construction for auditable MPC that has a one-time universal\nsetup. Despite improving the trusted setup, we match the state-of-the-art in\nasymptotic performance: the server nodes incur a linear computation overhead\nand constant round communication overhead compared to the underlying MPC, and\nthe audit size and verification are logarithmic in the application circuit\nsize. We also provide an implementation and benchmarks that support our\nasymptotic analysis in example applications. Furthermore, compared with\nexisting auditable MPC protocols, besides offering a universal setup our\nconstruction also has a 3x smaller proof, 3x faster verification time and\ncomparable prover time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 06:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-12"}

To reduce the\nchannel training overhead, we advocate a novel protocol for the uplink\ncommunication in the IRS-assisted massive MIMO systems. Under this protocol,\nthe IRS reflection coefficients are optimized based on the channel covariance\nmatrices, which are generally fixed for many coherence blocks, to boost the\nlong-term performance. Then, given the IRS reflecting coefficients, the BS\nbeamforming vectors are designed in each coherence block based on the effective\nchannel of each user, which is the superposition of its direct and reflected\nuser-IRS-BS channels, to improve the instantaneous performance. Since merely\nthe user effective channels are estimated in each coherence block, the training\noverhead of this protocol is the same as that in the legacy wireless systems\nwithout IRSs. Moreover, in the asymptotic regime that the numbers of IRS\nelements and BS antennas both go to infinity with a fixed ratio, we manage to\nfirst characterize the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimators of the user\neffective channels and then quantify the closed-form user achievable rates as\nfunctions of channel covariance matrices with channel training overhead and\nestimation error taken into account. Interestingly, it is shown that the\nproperties of channel hardening and favorable propagation still hold for the\nuser effective channels, and satisfactory user rates are thus achievable even\nif simple BS beamforming solutions, e.g., maximal-ratio combining, are\nemployed.

Nevertheless, existing works usually regard it as\na pure generation problem and employ cutting-edge deep generative techniques to\naddress it. The generative networks can fill the main missing parts with\nrealistic contents but usually distort the local structures or introduce\nobvious artifacts. In this paper, for the first time, we formulate image\ninpainting as a mix of two problems, predictive filtering and deep generation.\nPredictive filtering is good at preserving local structures and removing\nartifacts but falls short to complete the large missing regions. The deep\ngenerative network can fill the numerous missing pixels based on the\nunderstanding of the whole scene but hardly restores the details identical to\nthe original ones. To make use of their respective advantages, we propose the\njoint predictive filtering and generative network (JPGNet) that contains three\nbranches: predictive filtering & uncertainty network (PFUNet), deep generative\nnetwork, and uncertainty-aware fusion network (UAFNet). The PFUNet can\nadaptively predict pixel-wise kernels for filtering-based inpainting according\nto the input image and output an uncertainty map. This map indicates the pixels\nshould be processed by filtering or generative networks, which is further fed\nto the UAFNet for a smart combination between filtering and generative results.\nNote that, our method as a novel inpainting framework can benefit any existing\ngeneration-based methods.

By\na theorem of Mann, Praeger and Seress, it is known that every extremely\nprimitive group is either almost simple or affine, and all the almost simple\nexamples have subsequently been determined. Similarly, Mann et al. have\nclassified all of the affine extremely primitive groups up to a finite, but\nundetermined, collection of groups. Moreover, if one assumes Wall's conjecture\non the number of maximal subgroups of an almost simple group, then there is an\nexplicit list of candidates, each of which has been eliminated in a recent\npaper by Burness and Thomas.

A typical type of thresholding algorithms for\nsolving such a problem adopts the traditional full steepest descent direction\nor Newton-like direction as a search direction to generate an iterate on which\na certain thresholding is performed. Traditional hard thresholding discards a\nlarge part of a vector when the vector is dense. Thus a large part of important\ninformation contained in a dense vector has been lost in such a thresholding\nprocess. Recent study [Zhao, SIAM J Optim, 30(1), pp. 31-55, 2020] shows that\nthe hard thresholding should be applied to a compressible vector instead of a\ndense vector to avoid a big loss of information. On the other hand, the optimal\n$k$-thresholding as a novel thresholding technique may overcome the intrinsic\ndrawback of hard thresholding, and performs thresholding and objective function\nminimization simultaneously. This motivates us to propose the so-called partial\ngradient optimal thresholding method in this paper, which is an integration of\nthe partial gradient and the optimal $k$-thresholding technique. The solution\nerror bound and convergence for the proposed algorithms have been established\nin this paper under suitable conditions.

In practice, it is\nimplemented through prior negotiated Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between\nthe parties involved. However, it is recognised that these agreements are\ndifficult to negotiate, monitor and enforce. For future 6G networks, resource\nand infrastructure sharing is expected to play an even greater role. It will be\na crucial technique for reducing overall infrastructure costs and increasing\noperational efficiencies for operators. More efficient SLA mechanisms are thus\ncrucial to the success of future networks. In this work, we present \"BEAT\", an\nautomated, transparent and accountable end-to-end architecture for network\nsharing based on blockchain and smart contracts. This work focuses on a\nparticular type of blockchain, Permissioned Distributed Ledger (PDL), due to\nits permissioned nature allowing for industry-compliant SLAs with stringent\ngovernance.

It is said that breaking of ensemble equivalence (BEE) occurs\nwhen the specific relative entropy of the two ensembles does not vanish as the\nsize of the graph tends to infinity. The latter means that it matters for the\nscaling properties of the graph whether the constraint is met for every single\nrealisation of the graph or only holds as an ensemble average. In the\nliterature, it was found that BEE is the rule rather than the exception for two\nclasses: sparse random graphs when the number of constraints is of the order of\nthe number of vertices and dense random graphs when there are two or more\nconstraints that are frustrated. In the present paper we establish BEE for a\nthird class: dense random graphs with a single constraint, namely, on the\ndensity of a given finite simple graph. We show that BEE occurs only in a\ncertain range of choices for the density and the number of edges of the simple\ngraph, which we refer to as the BEE-phase. We show that, in part of the\nBEE-phase, there is a gap between the scaling limits of the averages of the\nmaximal eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the random graph under the two\nensembles, a property that is referred to as spectral signature of BEE.

An interesting aspect of the dust\nemission is the inferred FIR colours which could inform us about the dust\ncontent of galaxies, and how it varies with the physical conditions within\ngalaxies. However, the inherent complexity of dust grains as well as the\nvariety of physical properties depending on dust, hinder our ability to utilise\ntheir maximum potential. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to explore\nnew hidden correlations with many relevant physical properties such as the dust\nluminosity, dust temperature, dust mass, bolometric luminosity, star-formation\nrate (SFR), stellar mass, specific SFR, dust-to-stellar mass ratio, the\nfraction of absorbed stellar luminosity by dust (f_abs), and metallicity. We\nfind that 95% of the variance in our sample can be described by two principal\ncomponents (PCs). The first component controls the wavelength of the peak of\nthe SED, while the second characterises the width. The physical quantities that\ncorrelate better with the coefficients of the first two PCs, and thus control\nthe shape of the FIR SED are: the dust temperature, the dust luminosity, the\nSFR, and f_abs. Finally, we find a weak tendency for low-metallicity galaxies\nto have warmer and broader SEDs, while on the other hand high-metallicity\ngalaxies have FIR SEDs that are colder and narrower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 12:28:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

While catastrophic forgetting labels the\nproblem, the theoretical reasons for interference between tasks remain unclear.\nHere, we attempt to narrow this gap between theory and practice by studying\ncontinual learning in the teacher-student setup. We extend previous analytical\nwork on two-layer networks in the teacher-student setup to multiple teachers.\nUsing each teacher to represent a different task, we investigate how the\nrelationship between teachers affects the amount of forgetting and transfer\nexhibited by the student when the task switches. In line with recent work, we\nfind that when tasks depend on similar features, intermediate task similarity\nleads to greatest forgetting. However, feature similarity is only one way in\nwhich tasks may be related. The teacher-student approach allows us to\ndisentangle task similarity at the level of readouts (hidden-to-output weights)\nand features (input-to-hidden weights).

Direct numerical solution of the radiation transport\nequation (RTE) in mesoscale simulations is not viable due to its computational\ncost, so for practical applications reduced models are usually employed. To\nthis end, four approximations for solving the RTE are considered in this work,\nranging from a simple local thermodynamical behaviour consideration, to a more\ncomplex spectral absorption dependent on the arc geometry. Their performance is\ninitially tested on a one-dimensional cylindrical arc, before implementing them\nin a multi-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics code.

However, the approaches accounting for the arc geometry require\nrepeated solution of the computationally intensive Helmholtz equations, making\nthem prohibitive for multi-dimensional simulations.

Considering the most general control strategy on the\nprobe (adaptive measurements, arbitrary control on the probe's state and\nHamiltonian), we provide bounds on the achievable measurement precision in a\nfinite amount of time, and show that in many scenarios these fundamental limits\ncan be saturated with a relatively simple experiment.

In this paper we derive the equations of motion for the\ndynamics of a deformable porous media which includes the effects of friction\nforces, stresses, and heat exchanges between the media, by using the new\nmethodology of variational approach to thermodynamics. This theory extends the\nrecently developed variational derivation of the mechanics of deformable porous\nmedia to include thermodynamic processes and can easily include\nincompressibility constraints. The model for the combined fluid-matrix system,\nwritten in the spatial frame, is developed by introducing mechanical and\nadditional variables describing the thermal energy part of the system, writing\nthe action principle for the system, and using a nonlinear, nonholonomic\nconstraint on the system deduced from the second law of thermodynamics.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Starting from the global\noptimum of the compliance minimization problem, we employ analytical tools to\ninvestigate how intermediate density penalization affects the convexity of the\nproblem, the potential penalization-like effects of various filtering\ntechniques, how continuation methods can be used to approach the global\noptimum, and how the initial guess has some weight in determining the final\noptimum.

Recently, numerous data-driven deep learning models have been\nproposed for automatic sleep staging. They mainly train the model on a large\npublic labeled sleep dataset and test it on a smaller one with subjects of\ninterest. However, they usually assume that the train and test data are drawn\nfrom the same distribution, which may not hold in real-world scenarios.\nUnsupervised domain adaption (UDA) has been recently developed to handle this\ndomain shift problem. However, previous UDA methods applied for sleep staging\nhave two main limitations. First, they rely on a totally shared model for the\ndomain alignment, which may lose the domain-specific information during feature\nextraction. Second, they only align the source and target distributions\nglobally without considering the class information in the target domain, which\nhinders the classification performance of the model while testing. In this\nwork, we propose a novel adversarial learning framework called ADAST to tackle\nthe domain shift problem in the unlabeled target domain. First, we develop an\nunshared attention mechanism to preserve the domain-specific features in both\ndomains. Second, we design an iterative self-training strategy to improve the\nclassification performance on the target domain via target domain pseudo\nlabels. We also propose dual distinct classifiers to increase the robustness\nand quality of the pseudo labels.

Importantly, periodicities exist and follow seasonal,\n1 year short-term, 5-6 year (Juglar), and a single 24-year medium-term\n(Kuznets) period (when considering the total number of MD Applications).\nEconomic crises (e.g., COVID-19) do not seem to affect the evolution of the\nperiodicities. Conclusions: This work concludes that (1) PMA and PMN data may\nbe viewed as a proxy measure of the MD industry; (2) periodicities exists in\nthe data with time lengths associated with seasonal/1-year, Juglar and Kuznets\naffects; (4) these metrics do not seem affected by specific crises (such as\nCOVID-19) (similarly with other econometrics used in periodicity assessments);\n(5) PMNs and PMAs evolve inversely and suggest a structural industrial\ntransformation; (6) Total MDs are predicted to continue their decline into the\nmid-2020s prior to recovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 15:00:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 09:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

As such, function-based design tools\ncan benefit from automatic function classification to increase data fidelity\nand provide function representation models that enable function-based\nintelligent design agents. Function-based design data is commonly stored in\nmanually generated design repositories. These design repositories are a\ncollection of expert knowledge and interpretations of function in product\ndesign bounded by function-flow and component taxonomies. In this work, we\nrepresent a structured taxonomy-based design repository as assembly-flow\ngraphs, then leverage a graph neural network (GNN) model to perform automatic\nfunction classification. We support automated function classification by\nlearning from repository data to establish the ground truth of component\nfunction assignment. Experimental results show that our GNN model achieves a\nmicro-average F${_1}$-score of 0.832 for tier 1 (broad), 0.756 for tier 2, and\n0.783 for tier 3 (specific) functions. Given the imbalance of data features,\nthe results are encouraging. Our efforts in this paper can be a starting point\nfor more sophisticated applications in knowledge-based CAD systems and\nDesign-for-X consideration in function-based design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 16:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

Such a result allows to generalize the use of complex numbers in\nclassical algebra. Having now two finitely generated differential modules $L$\nand $M$ over the non-commutative ring ring $D=K[d_1,... ,d_n]=K[d]$ of\ndifferential operators with coefficients in $K$, we may similarly look for a\ndifferential module $N$ containing both $L$ and $M$ in order to define $L\\cap\nM$ and $L+M$.

The Smart Band aims to eliminate the need\nfor a physical trigger by the person who finds himself in dangerous situations\nlike kidnapping, front-facing some wild animal, heart attack, etc., and rather\nsenses the heartbeat. The Smart Band is designed as a personalized wearable\ndevice, wherein the user heart beat rate is collected and trained using machine\nlearning algorithm, which triggers the alert system automatically when the\nevent is identified. Hence the accuracy of assessing emergency situation will\nbe high and false rate will be reduced. As soon as the event is detected, the\nband relays GPS coordinates to first responders and emergency contacts, which\nwill be sent via the Network Carrier (SIM card module) directly from the band,\nnot relying on a mobile phone, which is usually out of reach during such\nemergency situations. In essence, the Smart Band consists of a GPS tracker, a\nheartbeat sensor, a Network module, and a Bluetooth module, all existing\ntechnologies which have been mass produced to an extent that the end product\ncan be made affordable, and in huge quantities as well.
