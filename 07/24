A\ntrust assumption specifies the failures that a system, such as a blockchain\nnetwork, can tolerate and determines the conditions under which it operates\ncorrectly. In systems subject to Byzantine faults, the trust assumption is\nusually specified through sets of processes that may fail together. Trust has\ntraditionally been symmetric, such that all processes in the system adhere to\nthe same, global assumption about potential faults. Recently, asymmetric trust\nmodels have also been considered, especially in the context of blockchains,\nwhere every participant is free to choose who to trust.\n  In both cases, it is an open question how to compose trust assumptions.\nConsider two or more systems, run by different and possibly disjoint sets of\nparticipants, with different assumptions about faults: how can they work\ntogether? This work answers this question for the first time and offers\ncomposition rules for symmetric and for asymmetric quorum systems. These rules\nare static and do not require interaction or agreement on the new trust\nassumption among the participants. Moreover, they ensure that if the original\nsystems allow for running a particular protocol (guaranteeing consistency and\navailability), then so will the joint system. At the same time, the composed\nsystem tolerates as many faults as possible, subject to the underlying\nconsistency and availability properties.\n  Reaching consensus with asymmetric trust in the model of personal Byzantine\nquorum systems (Losa et al., DISC 2019) was shown to be impossible, if the\ntrust assumptions of the processes diverge from each other. With asymmetric\nquorum systems, and by applying our composition rule, we show how consensus is\nactually possible, even with the combination of disjoint sets of processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 16:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-26"}

It has been shown that the utility functions of many real-world\napplications are adaptive submodular. However, most of existing studies on\nadaptive submodular optimization focus on the average-case. Unfortunately, a\npolicy that has a good average-case performance may have very poor performance\nunder the worst-case realization. In this study, we propose to study two\nvariants of adaptive submodular optimization problems, namely, worst-case\nadaptive submodular maximization and robust submodular maximization. The first\nproblem aims to find a policy that maximizes the worst-case utility and the\nlatter one aims to find a policy, if any, that achieves both near optimal\naverage-case utility and worst-case utility simultaneously. We introduce a new\nclass of stochastic functions, called \\emph{worst-case submodular function}.\nFor the worst-case adaptive submodular maximization problem subject to a\n$p$-system constraint, we develop an adaptive worst-case greedy policy that\nachieves a $\\frac{1}{p+1}$ approximation ratio against the optimal worst-case\nutility if the utility function is worst-case submodular. For the robust\nadaptive submodular maximization problem subject to cardinality constraints\n(resp. partition matroid constraints), if the utility function is both\nworst-case submodular and adaptive submodular, we develop a hybrid adaptive\npolicy that achieves an approximation close to $1-e^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ (resp.\n$1/3$) under both worst- and average-case settings simultaneously.

Results for games show that joint Shapley\nvalues present different insights from existing interaction indices, which\nassess the effect of a feature within a set of features. The joint Shapley\nvalues provide intuitive results in ML attribution problems. With binary\nfeatures, we present a presence-adjusted global value that is more consistent\nwith local intuitions than the usual approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 17:22:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 11:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

Methods: In this\nprospective case-control study, 18 eyes of 11 patients with early SFD and 32\neyes of 32 controls without ocular pathology underwent multimodal imaging\nincluding spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT)followed by\ndeep-learning-based layer segmentation. OCT-angiography (OCT-A) was performed\nto quantify choriocapillaris flow signal deficits (FDs). Differences in\nchoriocapillaris flow area percentage between SFD patients and controls were\ndetermined and a structure-function correlation with outer retinal layer\nthicknesses were analyzed based on mixed model analysis. Results: SFD patients\nexhibited a significantly greater choriocapillaris FDs area percentage than\ncontrols (estimate [95% CI] 32.05% [24.31-39.80] vs. 23.36% [20.64-26.09],\nP<0.001), even when adjusting for age. Choroidal thickness was a structural OCT\nsurrogate of the choriocapillaris FD area percentage (-0.82% per 100\nmicrometer, P=0.017), whereas retinal-pigment-epithelium-drusen-complex\nthickness was not informative regarding choriocapillaris FDs (P=0.932).

Conclusions: Patients with early SFD exhibit pronounced\nabnormalities of choriocapillaris flow signal on OCT-A, which are not limited\nto areas of sub-RPE deposits seen in OCT imaging. Thus, analysis of the\nchoriocapillaris flow may enable clinical trials at earlier disease stages in\nSFD and possibly in mimicking diseases with an impaired Bruchs membrane\nincluding age-related macular degeneration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 17:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-26"}

Here, we address these relations by\nstudying solute diffusion through three-dimensional porous films produced by\nsimple deposition models with controlled thickness and porosity. We simulate\ngrowing films with competitive aggregation rules that incorporate lateral\naggregation (relative rate proportional to $p$), which leads to pore formation,\nand surface relaxation ($1-p$) that favors compaction. By connecting a solute\nsource at the basis and a drain at the top outer surface of the films, we\nextract the effective diffusion coefficients from steady-state simulations. We\nfind that for a given film thickness, the larger the $p$, the larger the\neffective porosity and diffusivity, but the smaller the tortuosity. Keeping\nconstant growth conditions (i.e., same $p$), the increase of thickness always\nleads to an increase of effective porosity, but a nontrivial behavior in the\ndiffusivity occurs: for $p\\leq 0.7$, the diffusion coefficient is larger in\nthicker films; this is accompanied by a decrease of the tortuosity with the\nthickness, thus indicating that growth continuously improves pore structure for\ndiffusion. Microscopically, such a result is associated with narrower\ndistributions of local solute currents at higher points of films. Particularly\nfor $p\\geq 0.9$, in which film porosity is $\\sim 0.65-0.7$, the tortuosity is\nbetween $1.3$ and $2$, increases with the thickness, and has maximal changes\nnear $25\\%$. Pairs of values of porosity and tortuosity that we obtain here,\nfor the thickest films, agree with those experimentally measured in some porous\nelectrodes. Noteworthy, the increase of film thickness is generally favorable\nfor diffusion in their pores, and exceptions have small losses in tortuosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 17:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-26"}

The controversy between\ndominance of close- or remote-collision contributions to Coulomb correction is\ndiscussed. For scattering centres represented by a Coulomb potential with a\ngeneric (not necessarily spherically symmetric) creening function, the Coulomb\ncorrection is proven to be screening-independent, by virtue of the eikonal\nphase cancellation in regions distant from the Coulomb singularity. Treating\nthe atom %more self-consistently, as an assembly of pointlike electrons and the\nnucleus, and summing the scattering probability over all the final atom states,\nit is shown that besides the Coulomb correction due to close encounters of the\nincident charged particle with atomic nuclei, there are similar corrections due\nto close encounters with atomic electrons (an analog of Bloch correction).

At present there are not so many studies about the emission of this\nmolecular species at small spatial scales towards massive young stellar\nobjects. Thus, we present a high-angular resolution CN study towards a sample\nof massive protostars, with the aim of unveiling the spatial distribution at\nthe small scale of the emission of this radical in relation to the star-forming\nprocesses. The interstellar CN has a strong emission line at the rest frequency\n226874.764 MHz, thus, we search for observing projects in the ALMA database\nregarding high-mass star-forming regions observed at Band 6. A sample of ten\nhigh-mass star-forming regions were selected in base on that they present a\nclear emission of CN at the mentioned frequency. We found that the CN traces\nboth molecular condensations and diffuse and extended gas surrounding them. In\ngeneral, the molecular condensations traced by the maximums of the CN emission\ndo not spatially coincide with the peaks of the continuum emission at 1.3 mm,\nwhich trace the molecular cores where the massive stars born. Based on the\npresence or lack of near-IR emission associated with such cores, we suggest\nthat our sample is composed by sources at different stages of evolution. The CN\nis present at both, suggesting that this radical may be ubiquitous along the\ndifferent star formation stages, and hence it may be involved in different\nchemical reactions occurring along the time in the formation of the stars.\nAdditionally, other complex molecules were detected towards the continuum peaks\nof some of the analyzed cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 19:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Conventional vehicles use fuels such as gasoline, emit harmful gases,\nand have adverse effects on the environment. Electric vehicles (EVs) provide an\nalternative solution that decreases the dependency on traditional fuels such as\ngasoline and reduces hazardous gas emissions. EVs can drive longer distances by\nemploying dynamic wireless power transfer systems (DWPT) without increasing\ntheir battery size or having stopovers. Additionally, developing a decision\nsystem that avoids an excessive load on the power grid is essential. These\ndecision systems are particularly beneficial for autonomous driving for\npersonal and public transportation. This study briefly reviews the available\nliterature in dynamic wireless power transfer systems and proposes a novel\nsystem-level mathematical decision model to find the optimal profile for\nwireless charging infrastructures. We analyze the role of renewable energy\nintegration on DWPT systems and identify the framework, benefits, and\nchallenges in implementing DWPT for EVs. The mathematical model is\nmixed-integer, multi-period, and linear, minimizing the total system cost while\nsatisfying the systems requirements. The proposed model and the case study\nanalysis in this research determine the near-optimal plan for DWPT\ninfrastructure allocations and pave the road toward a more detailed power grid\nand renewable energy integration. Our result indicates that renewable energies\ncan significantly decrease the DWPT total system cost, infrastructure\nrequirements and increase the EVs' reliability.

We aimed to incorporate a full\nlymphatic system into the XCAT phantom and to generate realistic simulated\nimages via guidance from lymphoma patient studies.\n  Methods: A template lymphatic system was extended based on known anatomy was\nused to define 276 lymph nodes and corresponding vessels using non-uniform\nrational basis spline (NURBS) surfaces. Lymph node properties were modified\nusing the Rhinoceros 3D viewing software. The XCAT general parameter script was\nused to input organ concentrations and generate binary files with uptake and\nattenuation information.\n  Results: Lymph nodes can be scaled, stretched, and translated within the\nintuitive Rhinoceros interface, to allow for realistic simulation of different\nlymph node pathologies.

Existing weakly-supervised\ntechniques only consider within-sentence video segment correlations in training\nwithout considering cross-sentence paragraph context. This can mislead due to\nambiguous expressions of individual sentences with visually indiscriminate\nvideo moment proposals in isolation. Experiments on two publicly available\nactivity localisation datasets show the advantages of our approach over the\nstate-of-the-art weakly supervised methods, especially so when the video\nactivity descriptions become more complex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 20:04:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 18:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

Grounded Theory (GT) is a technique\nfor developing theory inductively e iteratively from qualitative data based on\ntheoretical sampling, coding, constant comparison, memoing, and saturation, as\nmain characteristics. Large or controversial GT studies may involve multiple\nresearchers in collaborative coding, which requires a kind of rigor and\nconsensus that an individual coder does not. Although many qualitative\nresearchers reject quantitative measures in favor of other qualitative\ncriteria, many others are committed to measuring consensus through Inter-Rater\nReliability (IRR) and/or Inter-Rater Agreement (IRA) techniques to develop a\nshared understanding of the phenomenon being studied. However, there are no\nspecific guidelines about how and when to apply IRR/IRA during the iterative\nprocess of GT, so researchers have been using ad hoc methods for years. This\npaper presents a process for systematically applying IRR/IRA in GT studies that\nmeets the iterative nature of this qualitative research method, which is\nsupported by a previous systematic literature review on applying IRR/RA in GT\nstudies in software engineering. This process allows researchers to\nincrementally generate a theory while ensuring consensus on the constructs that\nsupport it and, thus, improving the rigor of qualitative research.

The product partition model (PPM) is\na widely used approach for the detection of multiple change points. The\ntraditional PPM assumes that change points split the set of time points in\nrandom clusters that define a partition of the time axis. It is then typically\nassumed that sampling model parameter values within each of these blocks are\nidentical. Because changes in different parameters of the observational model\nmay occur at different times, the PPM thus fails to identify the parameters\nthat experienced those changes. A similar problem may occur when detecting\nchanges in multivariate time series. To solve this important limitation, we\nintroduce a multipartition model to detect multiple change points occurring in\nseveral parameters at possibly different times.

No spacecraft\nhas ever reached even a half of that distance; and to do so within a reasonable\nmission lifetime (e.g., less than 25 years) and affordable cost requires a new\ntype of mission design, using solar sails and microsats ($<100$~kg). The payoff\nis high -- using the SGL is the only practical way we can ever get a\nhigh-resolution, multi-pixel image of an Earth-like exoplanet, one that we\nidentify as potentially habitable. This paper describes a novel mission design\nstarting with a rideshare launch from the Earth, spiraling in toward the Sun,\nand then flying around it to achieve solar system exit speeds of over $20$\nAU/year. A new sailcraft design is used to make possible high area to mass\nratio for the sailcraft. The mission design enables other fast solar system\nmissions, starting with a proposed very low cost technology demonstration\nmission (TDM) to prove the functionality and operation of the microsat-solar\nsail design and then, building on the TDM, missions to explore distant regions\nof the solar system, and those to study Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) and the\nrecently discovered interstellar objects (ISOs) are also possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 22:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

This paper develops a computationally efficient framework for (fast)\ninverse design of LREM, by integrating a new type of machine learning models\ncalled invertible neural networks or INN. An INN can be trained to predict the\nbandgap bounds as a function of the unit cell design, and interestingly at the\nsame time it learns to predict the unit cell design given a bandgap, when\nexecuted in reverse.

Case studies show favorable performance of this\napproach, in terms of the bandgap characteristics and minimized mass, when\ncompared to the median scenario over ten randomly initialized optimizations for\nthe same specified bandgaps.

On smooth nonconvex problems, a few acceleration\ntechniques have been applied to improve the convergence rate of SGMs. However,\nlittle exploration has been made on applying a certain acceleration technique\nto a stochastic subgradient method (SsGM) for nonsmooth nonconvex problems. In\naddition, few efforts have been made to analyze an (accelerated) SsGM with\ndelayed derivatives. The information delay naturally happens in a distributed\nsystem, where computing workers do not coordinate with each other.\n  In this paper, we propose an inertial proximal SsGM for solving nonsmooth\nnonconvex stochastic optimization problems. The proposed method can have\nguaranteed convergence even with delayed derivative information in a\ndistributed environment. Convergence rate results are established to three\nclasses of nonconvex problems: weakly-convex nonsmooth problems with a convex\nregularizer, composite nonconvex problems with a nonsmooth convex regularizer,\nand smooth nonconvex problems. For each problem class, the convergence rate is\n$O(1/K^{\\frac{1}{2}})$ in the expected value of the gradient norm square, for\n$K$ iterations. In a distributed environment, the convergence rate of the\nproposed method will be slowed down by the information delay. Nevertheless, the\nslow-down effect will decay with the number of iterations for the latter two\nproblem classes. We test the proposed method on three applications. The\nnumerical results clearly demonstrate the advantages of using the\ninertial-based acceleration.

In PCM, data is stored in the crystalline or amorphous state of the phase\nchange material. The typical electrically-controlled PCM (EPCM), however,\nsuffers from longer write latency and higher write energy compared to DRAM and\nlimited multi-level cell (MLC) capacities. These challenges limit the\nperformance of data-intensive applications running on computing systems with\nEPCMs.\n  Recently, researchers demonstrated optically-controlled PCM (OPCM) cells,\nwith support for 5 bits/cell in contrast to 2 bits/cell in EPCM. These OPCM\ncells can be accessed directly with optical signals that are multiplexed in\nhigh-bandwidth-density silicon-photonic links. The higher MLC capacity in OPCM\nand the direct cell access using optical signals enable an increased read/write\nthroughput and lower energy per access than EPCM. However, due to the direct\ncell access using optical signals, OPCM systems cannot be designed using\nconventional memory architecture.

First, we define a robust correlation measure only\nusing two random indicators, and introduce a screener using that correlation.\nSecond, we propose a robust partial correlation-based screening approach when\nan exposure variable is available. To remove the confounding effect of the\nexposure on both response and each covariate, we use a nonparametric regression\nwith some specified loss function.

Training a convolutional neural network (CNN)\nfor this task requires annotating a large dataset, and hence, it involves the\ntime-consuming manual matching of people across cameras. To reduce the need for\nlabeled data, we focus on a semi-supervised approach that requires only a\nsubset of the training data to be labeled. We conduct a comprehensive survey in\nthe area of person re-identification with limited labels. Existing works in\nthis realm are limited in the sense that they utilize features from multiple\nCNNs and require the number of identities in the unlabeled data to be known. To\novercome these limitations, we propose to employ part-based features from a\nsingle CNN without requiring the knowledge of the label space (i.e., the number\nof identities). This makes our approach more suitable for practical scenarios,\nand it significantly reduces the need for computational resources. We also\npropose a PartMixUp loss that improves the discriminative ability of learned\npart-based features for pseudo-labeling in semi-supervised settings. Our method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art results on three large-scale person re-id\ndatasets and achieves the same level of performance as fully supervised methods\nwith only one-third of labeled identities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 09:28:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

In this context, we have thoroughly investigated the temperature\nresponse of thermal conductivity of ZrCo1-xIrxSb (x = 0, 0.1 and 0.25). For\nZrCoSb, \\k{appa}L is found to be ~15.13 W/m-K at 300 K, which is drastically\nreduced to ~4.37 W/m-K in ZrCo0.9Ir0.1Sb. This observed reduction is ascribed\nto softening of acoustic phonon modes and point defect scattering, on\nsubstitution of heavier mass. However, no further reduction in \\k{appa}L is\nobserved in ZrCo0.75Ir0.25Sb, because of identical scattering parameter. This\nhas been elucidated based on the Klemens Callaway model. Also, in the parent\nalloy, phonon-phonon scattering mechanism plays a significant role in heat\nconduction process, whereas in Ir substituted alloys, point defect scattering\n(below 500 K) and phonon-phonon scattering (above 750 K) are the dominant\nscattering mechanisms. The minimum \\k{appa}L is found to be ~1.73 W/m-K (at 950\nK) in ZrCo0.9Ir0.1Sb, which is the lowest reported value till now, for n-type\nZr based HHA.

Until now, there have being\ndeveloped several techniques for imaging of a single object through scattering\nmedium by using neural networks, however how to reconstruct images of more than\none object simultaneously seems hard to realize. In this paper, we demonstrate\nan approach by using generative adversarial network (GAN) to reconstruct images\nof two adjacent objects through scattering media. We construct an imaging\nsystem for imaging of two adjacent objects behind the scattering media. In\ngeneral, as the light field of two adjacent object images pass through the\nscattering slab, a speckle pattern is obtained. The designed adversarial\nnetwork, which is called as YGAN, is employed to reconstruct the images\nsimultaneously. It is shown that based on the trained YGAN, we can reconstruct\nimages of two adjacent objects from one speckle pattern with high fidelity. In\naddition, we study the influence of the object image types, and the distance\nbetween the two adjacent objects on the fidelity of the reconstructed images.\nMoreover even if another scattering medium is inserted between the two objects,\nwe can also reconstruct the images of two objects from a speckle with high\nquality.

Recent researches focus on the symbolic execution and formal\nanalysis of smart contracts for vulnerability detection, yet to achieve a\nprecise and scalable solution. Although several methods have been proposed to\ndetect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, there is still a lack of effort that\nconsiders combining expert-defined security patterns with deep neural networks.\nIn this paper, we explore using graph neural networks and expert knowledge for\nsmart contract vulnerability detection.

A ZCAP is a pair of 2-D arrays, whose 2-D autocorrelation\nsum gives zero value at all time shifts in a zone around the $(0,0)$ time\nshift, except the $(0,0)$ time shift. The first approach investigated in this\npaper uses a one-dimensional (1-D) Z-complementary pair (ZCP), which is an\nextension of the 1-D Golay complementary pair (GCP) where the autocorrelations\nof constituent sequences are complementary within a zero correlation zone\n(ZCZ). The second approach involves directly generalized Boolean functions\n(which are important components with many applications, particularly in\n(symmetric) cryptography).

To tackle the non-convexity of the\nformulated problem, an efficient algorithm is proposed by capitalizing on\nalternating minimization and manifold optimization (MO), which yields a locally\noptimal solution. To further reduce the computational complexity of the\nestimation algorithm, we propose a compressive sensing- (CS-) based channel\nestimation approach. In particular, a three-stage estimation protocol is put\nforward where the subproblem in each stage can be solved via low-complexity CS\nmethods.

For this purpose, a novel two-stage WF layout optimization\nmodel is developed in this paper. Cooperative WF control of both turbine yaw\nand axis-induction are considered in the WF layout design. However, the\nintegration of WF control makes the layout optimization much more complicated\nand results in a large-scale nonconvex problem, hindering the application of\ncurrent layout optimization methods. To increase the computational efficiency,\nwe leverage the hierarchy and decomposability of the joint optimization problem\nand design a decomposition-based hybrid method (DBHM). Instead of manipulating\nall the variables simultaneously, the joint optimization problem is decomposed\ninto several subproblems and their coordination. Case studies are carried out\non different WFs. It is shown that WF layouts with higher energy yields can be\nobtained by the proposed joint optimization compared to traditional separate\nlayout optimization. Moreover, the computational advantages of the proposed\nDBHM on the considered joint layout optimization problem are also demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 14:27:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 03:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

Existing\napproaches to this problem tend to employ microscopic models of motion\nprediction that reason about the individual behavior of other agents. While\nsuch models may achieve high tracking accuracy in trajectory prediction\nbenchmarks, they often lack an understanding of the group structures unfolding\nin crowded scenes. Inspired by the Gestalt theory from psychology, we build a\nModel Predictive Control framework (G-MPC) that leverages group-based\nprediction for robot motion planning. We conduct an extensive simulation study\ninvolving a series of challenging navigation tasks in scenes extracted from two\nreal-world pedestrian datasets.

Yet, a finite periodic structure may\nexhibit resonance frequencies within these band gaps. This is caused by\nboundary effects introduced by the truncation of the nominal infinite medium.\nPrevious studies of discrete systems determined existence conditions for\nband-gap resonances, although the focus has been limited to periodic chains\nwith free-free boundaries. In this paper, we present closed-form existence\nconditions for band-gap resonances in discrete diatomic chains with general\nboundary conditions (free-free, free-fixed, fixed-free, or fixed-fixed), odd or\neven chain parity (contrasting or identical masses at the ends), and the\npossibility of attaching a unique component (mass and/or spring) at one or both\nends. The derived conditions are consistent with those theoretically presented\nor experimentally observed in prior studies of structures that can be modeled\nas linear discrete diatomic chains with free-free boundary conditions. An\nintriguing case is a free-free chain with even parity and an arbitrary\nadditional mass at one end of the chain. Introducing such an arbitrary mass\nunderscores a transition among a set of distinct existence conditions depending\non the type of the chain boundaries and parity. The proposed analysis is\napplicable to linear periodic chains in the form of lumped-parameter models as\nwell as continuous granular media models examined in the low-frequency regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 04:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

Until now, however, these artificial\nintelligence techniques have fallen short of discovering the full differential\nequation of an experimental physical system. Here we show that a dynamical\nneural network, trained on a minimal amount of data, can predict the behavior\nof spintronic devices with high accuracy and an extremely efficient simulation\ntime, compared to the micromagnetic simulations that are usually employed to\nmodel them. For this purpose, we re-frame the formalism of Neural Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (ODEs) to the constraints of spintronics: few measured\noutputs, multiple inputs and internal parameters. We demonstrate with\nSpin-Neural ODEs an acceleration factor over 200 compared to micromagnetic\nsimulations for a complex problem -- the simulation of a reservoir computer\nmade of magnetic skyrmions (20 minutes compared to three days). In a second\nrealization, we show that we can predict the noisy response of experimental\nspintronic nano-oscillators to varying inputs after training Spin-Neural ODEs\non five milliseconds of their measured response to different excitations.\nSpin-Neural ODE is a disruptive tool for developing spintronic applications in\ncomplement to micromagnetic simulations, which are time-consuming and cannot\nfit experiments when noise or imperfections are present. Spin-Neural ODE can\nalso be generalized to other electronic devices involving dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 16:35:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

However, full-fidelity simulation techniques such as\nFinite Element Analysis can be prohibitively computationally expensive when\nthey are used to explore the massive input parameter space of heterogeneous\nmaterials. Therefore, there has been significant recent interest in machine\nlearning-based models that, once trained, can predict mechanical behavior at a\nfraction of the computational cost. Over the past several years, research in\nthis area has been focused mainly on predicting single Quantities of Interest\n(QoIs). However, there has recently been an increased interest in a more\nchallenging problem: predicting full-field QoI (e.g., displacement/strain\nfields, damage fields) for mechanical problems. Due to the added complexity of\nfull-field information, network architectures that perform well on single QoI\nproblems may perform poorly in the full-field QoI problem setting. The work\npresented in this paper is twofold. First, we made a significant extension to\nthe Mechanical MNIST dataset designed to enable the investigation of full field\nQoI prediction. Specifically, we added Finite Element simulation results of\nquasi-static brittle fracture in a heterogeneous material captured with the\nphase-field method. Second, we established strong baseline performance for\npredicting full-field QoI with MultiRes-WNet architecture. In addition to\npresenting the results in this paper, we have released our model implementation\nand the Mechanical MNIST Crack Path dataset under open-source licenses. We\nanticipate that future researchers will directly use our model architecture on\nrelated datasets and potentially design models that exceed the baseline\nperformance for predicting full-field QoI established in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 00:43:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 05:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}
