Most of the\ntraditional techniques from functional data analysis are plagued by the curse\nof dimensionality and quickly become intractable as the dimension of the domain\nincreases. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning continuous\nrepresentations from a sample of multidimensional functional data that is\nimmune to several manifestations of the curse. These representations are\nconstructed using a set of separable basis functions that are defined to be\noptimally adapted to the data. We show that the resulting estimation problem\ncan be solved efficiently by the tensor decomposition of a carefully defined\nreduction transformation of the observed data. Roughness-based regularization\nis incorporated using a class of differential operator-based penalties.\nRelevant theoretical properties are also established. The advantages of our\nmethod over competing methods are demonstrated in a simulation study. We\nconclude with a real data application in neuroimaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 16:02:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2021 16:30:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 16:17:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Several types of myosin motor proteins, characterized by\ndifferent kinetic parameters, have been involved in this reorganization of\nactin filaments. Given the limitations in studying the interactions of actin\nwith myosin in vivo, we propose stochastic agent-based model simulations and\ndevelop a set of data analysis measures to assess how myosin motor proteins\nmediate various actin organizations. In particular, we identify individual\nmotor parameters, such as motor binding rate and step size, that generate actin\nnetworks with different levels of contractility and different patterns of\nmyosin motor localization. In simulations where two motor populations with\ndistinct kinetic parameters interact with the same actin network, we find that\nmotors may act in a complementary way, by tuning the actin network\norganization, or in an antagonistic way, where one motor emerges as dominant.\nThis modeling and data analysis framework also uncovers parameter regimes where\nspatial segregation between motor populations is achieved. By allowing for\nchanges in kinetic rates during the actin-myosin dynamic simulations, our work\nsuggests that certain actin-myosin organizations may require additional\nregulation beyond mediation by motor proteins in order to reconfigure the\ncytoskeleton network on experimentally-observed timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 16:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

To\novercome the existing network traffic data shortage in attack analysis, recent\nworks propose Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic flow-based\nnetwork traffic generation. Data privacy is appearing more and more as a strong\nrequirement when processing such network data, which suggests to find solutions\nwhere synthetic data can fully replace real data. Because of the\nill-convergence of the GAN training, none of the existing solutions can\ngenerate high-quality fully synthetic data that can totally substitute real\ndata in the training of IDS ML components. Therefore, they mix real with\nsynthetic data, which acts only as data augmentation components, leading to\nprivacy breaches as real data is used. In sharp contrast, in this work we\npropose a novel deterministic way to measure the quality of the synthetic data\nproduced by a GAN both with respect to the real data and to its performance\nwhen used for ML tasks. As a byproduct, we present a heuristic that uses these\nmetrics for selecting the best performing generator during GAN training,\nleading to a stopping criterion. An additional heuristic is proposed to select\nthe best performing GANs when different types of synthetic data are to be used\nin the same ML task. We demonstrate the adequacy of our proposal by generating\nsynthetic cryptomining attack traffic and normal traffic flow-based data using\nan enhanced version of a Wasserstein GAN. We show that the generated synthetic\nnetwork traffic can completely replace real data when training a ML-based\ncryptomining detector, obtaining similar performance and avoiding privacy\nviolations, since real data is not used in the training of the ML-based\ndetector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 17:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Moreover, our VAE\napproach avoids the pitfalls of IP parametrization with the empirical Cole-Cole\nand Debye decomposition models, simple power-law models, or other sophisticated\nmechanistic models. We demonstrate four applications of VAEs to model and\nprocess IP data: (1) representative synthetic data generation, (2) unsupervised\nBayesian denoising and data uncertainty estimation, (3) quantitative evaluation\nof the signal-to-noise ratio, and (4) automated outlier detection.

This gives birth to a fully interpretable CNN\ncalled DCT2net. To deal with remaining artifacts induced by DCT2net, an\noriginal hybrid solution between DCT and DCT2net is proposed combining the best\nthat these two methods can offer; DCT2net is selected to process non-stationary\nimage patches while DCT is optimal for piecewise smooth patches.

While\nradialization is detected in a variety of different setups, it is most\nefficient in the cases of high satellite mass, not very steep host density\nprofiles, and high initial eccentricity.

We first prove a no-go\ntheorem that $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological order cannot survive on any fractal\nembedded in 2D. For fractal lattice models embedded in 3D or higher spatial\ndimensions, $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological order survives if the boundaries of the\ninterior holes condense only loop or membrane excitations. Moreover, for a\nclass of models containing only loop or membrane excitations, and are hence\nself-correcting on an $n$-dimensional manifold, we prove that topological order\nsurvives on a large class of fractal geometries independent of the type of hole\nboundaries.

Tunable parameters of the absorber are\nexplained, and simulations using the absorber with a 3-ps laser are shown to\naccurately reproduce those of a causally separated boundary while requiring\nonly 20% the number of particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 18:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

To\ntrain both ML systems, we enhance the QD simulation by incorporating synthetic\nnoise typical of QD experiments. We confirm that the inclusion of synthetic\nnoise in the training of the state classifier significantly improves the\nperformance, resulting in an accuracy of 95.0(9) % when tested on experimental\ndata. We then validate the functionality of the data quality control module by\nshowing that the state classifier performance deteriorates with decreasing data\nquality, as expected. Our results establish a robust and flexible ML framework\nfor autonomous tuning of noisy QD devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 19:02:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2022 14:36:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 15:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

The analysis of this problem and its discretisation is complicated\nby the nonlinear rheology commonly used for modelling ice, the enforcement of a\nfriction boundary condition given by a power law, and the presence of rigid\nmodes in the velocity space, which render the variational inequality\nsemicoercive.

In the face of their\nviolation, two types of causal models that modify some of these assumptions\nhave been proposed: (i) those that are parametrically conservative and\nstructurally radical, such as models where the parameters are conditional\nprobability distributions (termed 'classical causal models') but where one\nposits inter-lab causal influences or superdeterminism, and (ii) those that are\nparametrically radical and structurally conservative, such as models where the\nlabs are taken to be connected only by a common cause but where conditional\nprobabilities are replaced by conditional density operators (these are termed\n'quantum causal models'). We here seek to adjudicate between these alternatives\nbased on their predictive power. The data from a Bell experiment is divided\ninto a training set and a test set, and for each causal model, the parameters\nthat yield the best fit for the training set are estimated and then used to\nmake predictions about the test set. Our main result is that the structurally\nradical classical causal models are disfavoured relative to the structurally\nconservative quantum causal model. Their lower predictive power seems to be due\nto the fact that, unlike the quantum causal model, they are prone to a certain\ntype of overfitting wherein statistical fluctuations away from the\nno-signalling condition are mistaken for real features. Our technique shows\nthat it is possible to witness quantumness even in a Bell experiment that does\nnot close the locality loophole. It also overturns the notion that it is\nimpossible to experimentally test the plausibility of superdeterminist models\nof Bell inequality violations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 19:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

We focus on the crossover from the strong-coupling,\nnon-Fermi-liquid regime to the weak-coupling, Fermi-liquid ground state, a\ncrossover driven by the instability of the quantum critical point to\nhybridization asymmetry or detuning of the level in the dot. We show that the\ncrossover properties are given by tunneling through an effective single barrier\ndescribed by the boundary sine-Gordon model.

The effects of spin-scattering and the\nspin-orbit interaction caused by e-h exchange is also clarified, and the DT\nlineshape at the exciton and trion resonance are studied as a function of e-h\nexchange strength. In particular, as the exciton lineshape is determined by the\ninterplay of linear exciton susceptibility and the bound-state two-exciton\nresonance in the T-matrix, the lineshape at the trion is similarly determined\nby the interplay of the linear trion susceptibility and the bound-state\nexciton-trion resonance in the T-matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 21:58:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 19:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

Motivated by the swimming of brine\nshrimp, a mesoscale organism that operates at intermediate Reynolds numbers, we\ncomputationally studied a simple nonreciprocal 2D model that performs\nmetachronal swimming. Our swimmer is composed of two pairs of paddles beating\nwith a phase difference that are symmetrically attached to the sides of a flat\nbody. We numerically solved the Navier-Stokes equations and used the immersed\nboundary method to model the interactions between the fluid and swimmer. To\ninvestigate the effect of inertia and geometry, we performed simulations\nvarying the paddle spacing and the Reynolds numbers in the range $Re = 0.05 -\n100$. In all cases, we observed back-and-forth motion during the cycle and a\nfinite cycle-averaged swim speed at steady state. Interestingly, we found that\nthe swim speed of the swimmer has nonmonotonic dependence on $Re$, with a\nmaximum around $Re\\approx1$, a flat minimum between $Re=20-30$ and an eventual\nincrease for $Re>35$. To get more insight into the mechanism behind this\nrelationship, we first decomposed the swim stroke of the swimmer and each\npaddle into power and recovery strokes and characterized the forward and\nbackward motion. Unlike for reciprocal swimmers, here, for parts of the cycle\nthere is competition between the two strokes of the paddles - the balance of\nwhich leads to net motion. We then studied the cycle-averaged, as well as,\npower-stroke-averaged and recovery-stroke-averaged fluid flows, and related\ndifferences in the fluid field to the nonmonotonic behavior of the swim speed.\nOur results suggest the existence of distinct motility mechanisms that develop\nas inertia increases within the intermediate-Re range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 22:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

A key aspect of the RL-GRIT approach is that\nrather than explicitly inferring a grammar that describes the format, the\nneural network learns to perform various parsing actions (such as merging two\ntokens) over a corpus of sentences, with the goal of maximizing the estimated\nfrequency of the resulting parse structures. This can allow the learning\nprocess to more easily explore different action choices, since a given choice\nmay change the optimality of the parse (as expressed by the total reward), but\nwill not result in the failure to parse a sentence. However, this also presents\na limitation: because the trained neural network can successfully parse any\nsentence, it cannot be directly used to identify sentences that deviate from\nthe format of the training sentences, i.e., that are anomalous. In this paper,\nwe address this limitation by presenting procedures for extracting production\nrules from the neural network, and for using these rules to determine whether a\ngiven sentence is nominal or anomalous. When a sentence is anomalous, an\nattempt is made to identify the location of the anomaly.

Consequently, only a minority of publications in the computer\nvision community tackle supervised learning on datasets that are orders of\nmagnitude larger than Imagenet. In this paper, we survey computer vision\nresearch domains that study the effects of such large datasets on model\nperformance across different vision tasks. We summarize the community's current\nunderstanding of those effects, and highlight some open questions related to\ntraining with massive datasets.

The\ndeficiencies of the learned model may prevent the policy from being fully\noptimized. Although some uncertainty analysis-based remedies have been proposed\nto alleviate this issue, model bias still poses a great challenge for MBRL. In\nthis work, we propose to leverage the prior knowledge of underlying physics of\nthe environment, where the governing laws are (partially) known. In particular,\nwe developed a physics-informed MBRL framework, where governing equations and\nphysical constraints are utilized to inform the model learning and policy\nsearch. By incorporating the prior information of the environment, the quality\nof the learned model can be notably improved, while the required interactions\nwith the environment are significantly reduced, leading to better sample\nefficiency and learning performance. The effectiveness and merit have been\ndemonstrated over a handful of classic control problems, where the environments\nare governed by canonical ordinary/partial differential equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 02:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

Manifold\nmodels are closely related to semi-local similarity, a well-known property of\nnatural images, referring to that for most natural-image patches, several\nsimilar patches can be found in its spatial neighborhood. Many approaches to\nsingle image interpolation use manifold models to exploit semi-local similarity\nby two mutually exclusive parts: i) searching each target patch's similar\npatches and ii) operating on the searched similar patches, the target patch and\nthe measured input pixels to estimate the target patch. Unfortunately, aliasing\nin the input image makes it challenging for both parts. A very few works\nexplicitly deal with those challenges and only ad-hoc solutions are proposed.\n  To overcome the challenge in the first part, we propose a carefully-designed\nadaptive technique to remove aliasing in severely aliased regions, which cannot\nbe removed from traditional techniques.

Although exploration is indispensable for long success of a\nrecommender system, the exploration has been considered as the risk to decrease\nuser satisfaction. The reason for the risk is that items chosen for exploration\nfrequently mismatch with the user's interests. To mitigate this risk,\nrecommender systems have mixed items chosen for exploration into a\nrecommendation list, disguising the items as recommendations to elicit feedback\non the items to discover the user's additional tastes. This mix-in approach has\nbeen widely used in many recommenders, but there is rare research, evaluating\nthe effectiveness of the mix-in approach or proposing a new approach for\neliciting user feedback without deceiving users. In this work, we aim to\npropose a new approach for feedback elicitation without any deception and\ncompare our approach to the conventional mix-in approach for evaluation.

Appropriate use\nof the pretreatment covariates can further improve the estimation efficiency.\nHowever, missingness in covariates is common in experiments and raises an\nimportant question: should we adjust for covariates subject to missingness, and\nif so, how? The unadjusted difference in means is always unbiased. The\ncomplete-covariate analysis adjusts for all completely observed covariates and\nimproves the efficiency of the difference in means if at least one completely\nobserved covariate is predictive of the outcome. Then what is the additional\ngain of adjusting for covariates subject to missingness? A key insight is that\nthe missingness indicators act as fully observed pretreatment covariates as\nlong as missingness is not affected by the treatment, and can thus be used in\ncovariate adjustment to bring additional estimation efficiency. This motivates\nadding the missingness indicators to the regression adjustment, yielding the\nmissingness-indicator method as a well-known but not so popular strategy in the\nliterature of missing data. We recommend it due to its many advantages. We also\npropose modifications to the missingness-indicator method based on asymptotic\nand finite-sample considerations. To reconcile the conflicting recommendations\nin the missing data literature, we analyze and compare various strategies for\nanalyzing randomized experiments with missing covariates under the design-based\nframework.

As a general trend, the\nbehavior of a classic synchronous generator is to be emulated for a class of\nconventional grid components like, e.g., renewable generators or/and power\nelectronic units. Most of the times production of these units is of interest,\nas it is the case for the new AGC scheme of Spain which, from this point of\nview, looks like a VPP. However, dynamic aspects are of high importance,\nespecially for increasing the actual rate of penetration of Renewable Energy\nSources (RES). Indeed, to go above the actual rate of RES penetration, one\nshould deal with full participation of RES to grid services. For that, we\npropose here a new concept called Dynamic VPP (DVPP) which fully integrates the\ndynamic aspects at all levels: locally (for each RES generator), globally (for\ngrid ancillary services and interaction with other neighbor elements of the\ngrid) and economically (for internal optimal dispatch and participation to\nelectricity markets). A DVPP is a set of RES along with a set of control and\noperation procedures. This means methodologies for: choosing the participating\nRES, optimal and continuous operation as a whole (especially in case of loss of\nnatural resources - e.g., wind, sun - on a part of the DVPP), regulation (in\nthe dynamic sense) to ensure local objectives for each generator, participation\nto ancillary services of the DVPP as a unit and to diminish negative effects of\ninteraction with neighbor dynamics elements of the power system, integration in\nboth actual power systems scenarios (with mixed classic and power electronics\nbased generation) and future ones with high degree of RES penetration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 05:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

The reasons are two-fold: (1) Input\nembeddings of each layer are equal-scale, so no cross-scale feature can be\nextracted; (2) to lower the computational cost, some vision transformers merge\nadjacent embeddings inside the self-attention module, thus sacrificing\nsmall-scale (fine-grained) features of the embeddings and also disabling the\ncross-scale interactions. To this end, we propose Cross-scale Embedding Layer\n(CEL) and Long Short Distance Attention (LSDA). On the one hand, CEL blends\neach embedding with multiple patches of different scales, providing the\nself-attention module itself with cross-scale features. On the other hand, LSDA\nsplits the self-attention module into a short-distance one and a long-distance\ncounterpart, which not only reduces the computational burden but also keeps\nboth small-scale and large-scale features in the embeddings. Through the above\ntwo designs, we achieve cross-scale attention. Besides, we put forward a\ndynamic position bias for vision transformers to make the popular relative\nposition bias apply to variable-sized images. Hinging on the cross-scale\nattention module, we construct a versatile vision architecture, dubbed\nCrossFormer, which accommodates variable-sized inputs.

The proposed method\nintroduces latent variables and adds Lasso sparsity constraints to the\nestimated loadings to facilitate the interpretation of the relationship between\noutcomes and covariates. The framework of the generalized linear model makes it\napplicable to various types of outcomes. Interpretation of subgroups is made by\nvisualizing treatment effects and latent variables. This allows us to identify\nsubgroups with characteristics that make the test therapy more effective for\nmultiple outcomes. Simulation and real data examples demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 06:36:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 05:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

In this paper, we investigate the effect of the\nclassical driving field on the generation entanglement between two qubits\ninteracting with a bosonic environment. We discuss the effect of the classical\nfield on the generation of entanglement between two (different) qubits and the\nconditions under which it has a constructive role in protecting the\ninitial-state entanglement from decay induced by its environment. In\nparticular, in the case of similar qubits, we locate a stationary sub-space of\nthe system Hilbert space, characterized by states non depending on the\nenvironment properties as well as on the classical driving-field.

Minimum\noutput variance (MOV) is used as a benchmark for CPA of PID, but it is\ndifficult to be found due to the associated non-convex optimization problem.\nFor the optimal tuning, many different objective functions have been proposed,\nbut few consider the stochastic disturbance rejection. In this paper, a\nmulti-objective function simultaneously considering integral of absolute error\n(IAE) and MOV is proposed to optimize PID for better disturbance rejection. The\nnon-convex problem and multi-objective problem are solved by\nteaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO). This stochastic optimization\nalgorithm can guarantee a tighter lower bound for MOV due to the excellent\ncapability of local optima avoidance and needs less calculation time due to the\nlow complexity. Furthermore, CPA and the tuning method are extended to the PI/P\ncascade case. The results of several numerical examples of CPA problems show\nthat TLBO can generate better MOV than existing methods within one second on\nmost examples. The simulation results of the tuning method applied to two\ntemperature control systems reveal that the weight of the multi-objective\nfunction can compromise other performance criteria such as overshoot and\nsettling time to improve the disturbance rejection.

Currently, most of the\ntop-performing TIR trackers are still employing representations learned by the\nmodel trained on the RGB data. However, this representation does not take into\naccount the information in the TIR modality itself, limiting the performance of\nTIR tracking. To solve this problem, we propose to distill representations of\nthe TIR modality from the RGB modality with Cross-Modal Distillation (CMD) on a\nlarge amount of unlabeled paired RGB-TIR data. We take advantage of the\ntwo-branch architecture of the baseline tracker, i.e. DiMP, for cross-modal\ndistillation working on two components of the tracker. Specifically, we use one\nbranch as a teacher module to distill the representation learned by the model\ninto the other branch. Benefiting from the powerful model in the RGB modality,\nthe cross-modal distillation can learn the TIR-specific representation for\npromoting TIR tracking. The proposed approach can be incorporated into\ndifferent baseline trackers conveniently as a generic and independent\ncomponent. Furthermore, the semantic coherence of paired RGB and TIR images is\nutilized as a supervised signal in the distillation loss for cross-modal\nknowledge transfer. In practice, three different approaches are explored to\ngenerate paired RGB-TIR patches with the same semantics for training in an\nunsupervised way. It is easy to extend to an even larger scale of unlabeled\ntraining data. Extensive experiments on the LSOTB-TIR dataset and PTB-TIR\ndataset demonstrate that our proposed cross-modal distillation method\neffectively learns TIR-specific target representations transferred from the RGB\nmodality. Our tracker outperforms the baseline tracker by achieving absolute\ngains of 2.3% Success, 2.7% Precision, and 2.5% Normalized Precision\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 09:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

Robust loss\nfunctions that satisfy the symmetric condition were tailored to remedy this\nproblem, which however encounter the underfitting effect. In this paper, we\ntheoretically prove that \\textbf{any loss can be made robust to noisy labels}\nby restricting the network output to the set of permutations over a fixed\nvector. When the fixed vector is one-hot, we only need to constrain the output\nto be one-hot, which however produces zero gradients almost everywhere and thus\nmakes gradient-based optimization difficult.

However, the DCR\nhas been criticized since differences between rating categories on this ordinal\nscale might not be perceptually equidistant, and observers may have different\nunderstandings of the categories. Pair comparisons (PC) of distorted images,\nfollowed by Thurstonian reconstruction of scale values, overcome these\nproblems. In addition, PC is more sensitive than DCR, and it can provide scale\nvalues in fractional, just noticeable difference (JND) units that express a\nprecise perceptional interpretation. Still, the comparison of images of nearly\nthe same quality can be difficult. We introduce boosting techniques embedded in\nmore general triplet comparisons (TC) that increase the sensitivity even more.\nBoosting amplifies the artefacts of distorted images, enlarges their visual\nrepresentation by zooming, increases the visibility of the distortions by a\nflickering effect, or combines some of the above.

Experimental evidences of subcritical and supercritical bifurcations of\nviscoelastic pipe flows have been reported, but these nonlinear phenomena have\nnot been examined theoretically. In this work, we study the weakly nonlinear\nstability of this flow by performing a multiple-scale expansion of the\ndisturbance around linear critical conditions. The perturbed parameter is\nReynolds number with the others being unperturbed. A third-order\nGinzburg-Landau equation is derived with its coefficient indicating the\nbifurcation type of the flow. After exploring a large parameter space, we found\nthat polymer concentration plays an important role: at high polymer\nconcentrations (or small solvent-to-solution viscosity ratio\n$\\beta\\lessapprox0.785$), the nonlinearity stabilises the flow, indicating that\nthe flow will bifurcate supercritically, while at low polymer concentrations\n($\\beta\\gtrapprox 0.785$), the flow bifurcation is subcritical.

First of all, we present an analytical description of nonlinear ultrafast\ndynamics of localized surface plasmon resonances when the second harmonic\nplasmon mode interacts with long-lived dark mode or quantum emitter. Later, the\ncoupled plasmonic system is realized in two different ways to control the\nlifetime of second harmonic mode by coupling, i) driven mode to dark mode (or\nlong lifetime quantum emitter) ii)itself to dark mode (or long lifetime quantum\nemitter). The driven-dissipative dynamics are solved through a numerical\ntechnique governing the spatial and temporal changes in the second harmonic\nplasmonic response supported by AuNP. Finally, the lifetime enhancement of\nnonlinear plasmon mode is manifested by performing FDTD simulations for a\nnonlinear plasmonic system of Au nanoparticles coupled with a long lifetime\nquantum emitter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 14:39:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 07:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

Along with the disk-assisted migration/evolution\nprocess, ambient gas materials inevitably accrete onto the compact objects. The\ndescription of this process is subject to significant theoretical uncertainties\nin previous studies. It was commonly assumed that either an Eddington accretion\nrate or a Bondi accretion rate (or any rate in between) takes place, although\nthese two rates can differ from each other by several orders of magnitude. As a\nresult, the mass and spin evolution of compact objects within AGN disks are\nessentially unknown. In this work, we construct a relativistic supercritical\ninflow-outflow model for black hole (BH) accretion. We show that the radiation\nefficiency of the supercritical accretion of a stellar-mass BH (sBH) is\ngenerally too low to explain the proposed electromagnetic counterpart of\nGW190521. Applying this model to sBHs embedded in AGN disks, we find that,\nalthough the gas inflow rates at Bondi radii of these sBHs are in general\nhighly super-Eddington, a large fraction of inflowing gas eventually escapes as\noutflows so that only a small fraction accretes onto the sBH, resulting in\nmildly super-Eddington BH absorption in most cases. We also implement this\ninflow-outflow model to study the evolution of neutron stars (NS) and white\ndwarfs (WD) in AGN disks, taking into account corrections from star sizes and\nstar magnetic fields. It turns out to be difficult for WDs to grow to the\nChandrasekhar limit via accretion because WDs are spun up more efficiently to\nreach the shedding limit before the Chandrasekhar limit.

An\naccident anticipation model aims to predict accidents promptly and accurately\nbefore they occur. Existing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models of accident\nanticipation lack a human-interpretable explanation of their decision-making.\nAlthough these models perform well, they remain a black-box to the ADS users,\nthus difficult to get their trust. To this end, this paper presents a Gated\nRecurrent Unit (GRU) network that learns spatio-temporal relational features\nfor the early anticipation of traffic accidents from dashcam video data. A\npost-hoc attention mechanism named Grad-CAM is integrated into the network to\ngenerate saliency maps as the visual explanation of the accident anticipation\ndecision.

The impact of this interdependence on the tendency to adopt less\nor more restrictive measures is hard to evaluate, more so if diversity in\neconomic exposures to citizens' mobility are considered. Here, we address this\nproblem by developing an analytical and computational game-theoretical model\nencompassing the conflicts arising from the need to control the economic\neffects of global risks, such as in the COVID-19 pandemic. The model includes\nthe individual costs derived from severe restrictions imposed by governments,\nincluding the resulting economic interdependence among all the parties involved\nin the game. By using tourism-based data, the model is enriched with actual\nheterogeneous income losses, such that every player has a different economic\ncost when applying restrictions. We show that economic interdependence enhances\ncooperation because of the decline in the expected payoffs by free-riding\nparties (i.e., those neglecting the application of mobility restrictions).\nFurthermore, we show (analytically and through numerical simulations) that\nthese cross-exposures can transform the nature of the cooperation dilemma each\nregion or country faces, modifying the position of the fixed points and the\nsize of the basins of attraction that characterize this class of games.\nFinally, our results suggest that heterogeneity among regions may be used to\nleverage the impact of intervention policies by ensuring an agreement among the\nmost relevant initial set of cooperators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 17:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

Laterally, we divide the unbounded strip into\nthree regions: a region containing the defect and two semi-waveguide regions,\nseparated by two vertical line segments. In both semi-waveguides, we prove the\nwell-posedness of an associated scattering problem so as to well define a\nNeumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD) operator on the associated vertical segment.

It is proposed to match the number of\nproperties in each node and the measurability of a hypercomplex number\nsystem(HNS) with the same number of basic elements. Each HNS corresponds to the\nKelly table, which corresponds to the law of multiplication of these CSF. The\nproperties of the CSF allow you to build an isomorphic transition from a filled\nKelly table to a less filled one, which simplifies the calculation.\n  To model the problem using hypercomplex number systems, we offer a\nspecialized software package of hypercomplex computations based on the system\nof computer algebra Maple. All this made it easy to model a complex system with\nseveral effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 14:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

DR, an eye\nillness caused by diabetes, can lead to blindness if it is not identified and\ntreated in its early stages. Unfortunately, diagnosis of DR requires medically\ntrained professionals, but Bangladesh has limited specialists in comparison to\nits population. Moreover, the screening process is often expensive, prohibiting\nmany from receiving timely and proper diagnosis. To address the problem, we\nintroduce a deep learning algorithm which screens for different stages of DR.\nWe use a state-of-the-art CNN architecture to diagnose patients based on\nretinal fundus imagery. This paper is an experimental evaluation of the\nalgorithm we developed for DR diagnosis and screening specifically for\nBangladeshi patients. We perform this validation study using separate pools of\nretinal image data of real patients from a hospital and field studies in\nBangladesh. Our results show that the algorithm is effective at screening\nBangladeshi eyes even when trained on a public dataset which is out of domain,\nand can accurately determine the stage of DR as well, achieving an overall\naccuracy of 92.27\\% and 93.02\\% on two validation sets of Bangladeshi eyes.

When developing modern deep learning algorithms,\nrather than relying on subjective (human-based) image quality assessment (IQA),\ntask amenability potentially provides an objective measure of task-specific\nimage quality. To predict task amenability, an IQA agent is trained using\nreinforcement learning (RL) with a simultaneously optimised task predictor,\nsuch as a classification or segmentation neural network. In this work, we\ndevelop transfer learning or adaptation strategies to increase the adaptability\nof both the IQA agent and the task predictor so that they are less dependent on\nhigh-quality, expert-labelled training data. The proposed transfer learning\nstrategy re-formulates the original RL problem for task amenability in a\nmeta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework. The resulting algorithm\nfacilitates efficient adaptation of the agent to different definitions of image\nquality, each with its own Markov decision process environment including\ndifferent images, labels and an adaptable task predictor. Our work demonstrates\nthat the IQA agents pre-trained on non-expert task labels can be adapted to\npredict task amenability as defined by expert task labels, using only a small\nset of expert labels. Using 6644 clinical ultrasound images from 249 prostate\ncancer patients, our results for image classification and segmentation tasks\nshow that the proposed IQA method can be adapted using data with as few as\nrespective 19.7% and 29.6% expert-reviewed consensus labels and still achieve\ncomparable IQA and task performance, which would otherwise require a training\ndataset with 100% expert labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 11:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

High pressure heads resulting in circumferential\nand (or) axial stresses larger than the material yield stress could cause pipe\nfailure. Of equal concern is the local boiling or cavitation effect in regions\nof fluid pressure dropping below its vapor pressure, which in turn develop air\nbubbles that get transported through the pipeline, bursting later at remote\nlocations. We initially developed a simple probabilistic model based on Method\nof Characteristics (MOC) to simulate burst leakage in pipelines, and compared\nwith a pure deterministic hydraulic model. We had not considered cavitation\neffects for simplicity. The results indicated that the simple probabilistic\nmodel was only marginally different in its prediction of the transients on\ncomparison with the latter. In order to determine the position and amount of\nleakage in the distribution system, the detection method based on simulating\nhydraulic transients was further evaluated using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).\nWe found that this non-linear filtering approach on the fluid transient model\nconsiderably reduced the number of input parameters required, and it was able\nto predict leakage rate and burst positions even in a highly noisy environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 15:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}
