Focussing on the recently discovered\ndual AGN system LBQS 0302-0019 at z=3.29, we seek to identify further group\nmembers in its environment and to understand their formation history through\ndeep high-angular-resolution imaging. We present deep Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) Wide-field Camera 3 near-infrared imaging of LBQS 0302-0019. In\ncombination with ground-based VLT/HAWK-I imaging, we infer accurate sizes,\ncolours, ages, and stellar masses of companion galaxies. We clearly detect four\ncompanion objects close to LBQS 0302-0019 that also have faint signatures in\nthe ground-based images. We constrain light-weighted ages and masses for the\ntwo most prominent companions, Jil1 and Jil2, to $t_\\star=252_{-109}^{+222}$Myr\nwith $\\log(M_\\star/[\\mathrm{M}_\\odot])= 11.2_{-0.1}^{+0.3}$ and\n$t_{\\star}=19_{-14}^{+74}$Myr with $\\log(M_\\star/[\\mathrm{M}_\\odot])=\n9.4_{-0.4}^{+0.9}$, respectively. The HST data also show that the obscured AGN,\npreviously identified by strong nebular HeII emission, is associated with the\nyoung massive companion Jil2. Because very massive stars of the starburst\ncannot be solely responsible for the HeII emission, we strengthen our initial\nconclusion that Jil2 has been hosting an AGN. If the young starburst of Jil2\nhad been accompanied by sustained black hole growth, Jil2 may have contributed\nHeII-ionising flux to create the large HeII Ly$\\alpha$ proximity zone around\nLBQS 0302-0019. Hence, the duration of the current luminous AGN episode of LBQS\n0302-0019 may have been overestimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 16:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

Here we employ\nquantum Heisenberg F or AF chains of $N=4$ sites, whose localized spins\ninteract with conduction electrons via $sd$ exchange interaction, to perform\nsuch comparison by starting from unentangled pure (at zero temperature) or\nmixed (at finite temperature) quantum state of localized spins as the initial\ncondition. This reveals that quantum-classical dynamics can faithfully\nreproduce fully quantum dynamics in the F metallic case, but only when spin\n$S$, Heisenberg exchange between localized spins and $sd$ exchange are\nsufficiently small. Increasing any of these three parameters can lead to\nsubstantial deviations, which are explained by the dynamical buildup of\nentanglement between localized spins and/or between them and electrons. In the\nAF metallic case, substantial deviations appear even at early times, despite\nstarting from unentangled N\\'{e}el state, which therefore poses a challenge on\nhow to rigorously justify wide usage of the LL equation in phenomenological\nmodeling of antiferromagnetic spintronics experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 16:03:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 17:46:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 18:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

Empirical evidence suggests that haptic feedback\ncan lead to improved dexterity. Unfortunately, haptic feedback can also\nintroduce dynamics between the leader and follower of the telerobot that affect\nboth stability and device performance. While concerted research effort has\nfocused on masking these device dynamics or bypassing them altogether, it is\nnot well understood how human operators incorporate these dynamics into their\ncontrol scheme.

Many current micro-assembly methods\nare serial in nature, resulting in unfeasibly low throughput. Additionally, the\nneed for increasingly smaller tools to pick and place individual microparts\nmakes these methods cost prohibitive. Alternatively, parallel self-assembly or\ndirected-assembly techniques can be employed by utilizing forces dominant at\nthe micro and nano scales such as electro-kinetic, thermal, and capillary\nforces. However, these forces are governed by complex equations and often act\non microparts simultaneously and competitively, making modeling and simulation\ndifficult. The research in this paper presents a novel phenomenological\napproach to directed micro-assembly through the use of artificial intelligence\nto correlate micro-particle movement via dielectrophoretic and electro-osmotic\nforces in response to varying frequency of an applied non-uniform electric\nfield.

In this\nwork, we construct an effective point-particle action for a generic spinning\nbody that can couple both conformally and disformally to a real scalar field,\nand we show that requiring the existence of a self-consistent solution\nautomatically implies that if a scalar couples to the mass of a body, then it\nmust also couple to its spin.

Focusing\non quasicircular nonprecessing binaries for simplicity, we systematically\ncompute all key quantities, including the conservative potential, the orbital\nbinding energy, the radiated power, and the gravitational-wave phase. We show\nthat depending on how strongly each member of the binary couples to the scalar,\nthe spin-orbit effects that are due to a conformal coupling first enter into\nthe phase at either 0.5PN or 1.5PN order, while those that arise from a\ndisformal coupling start at either 3.5PN or 4.5PN order.

Variational quantum circuits are\na promising approach for constructing QML and quantum simulation. However,\nfinding the best variational circuit and its optimal parameters is challenging\ndue to the large design space and parameter training cost.

(2017). We find that the bolometric AGN luminosities\nderived from the infrared data increase, but the X-ray to bolometric luminosity\nratios decrease, with merger stage. The X-ray weak AGNs in late mergers\nubiquitously show massive outflows at sub-pc to kpc scales. Among them, the\nmost luminous AGNs ($L_{\\rm bol,AGN} \\sim 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$) have\nrelatively small column densities of $\\lesssim$10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and almost\nsuper-Eddington ratios ($\\lambda_{\\rm Edd} \\sim$ 1.0). Their torus covering\nfactors ($C_{\\rm T}^{\\rm (22)} \\sim 0.6$) are larger than those of Swift/BAT\nselected AGNs with similarly high Eddington ratios. These results suggest a\nscenario that, in the final stage of mergers, multiphase strong outflows are\nproduced due to chaotic quasi-spherical inflows and the AGN becomes extremely\nX-ray weak and deeply buried due to obscuration by inflowing and/or outflowing\nmaterial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Recently, many works have suggested a possible increase\nin the fraction of major mergers in the early Universe, reviving the debate on\nwhich processes (e.g., cold accretion, star formation, mergers) most contribute\nto the mass build-up of galaxies through cosmic time. To estimate the\nimportance of major mergers in this context, we make use of the new data\ncollected by the ALMA Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times\n(ALPINE), which observed the [CII] 158 $\\mu$m emission line from a sample of 75\nmain-sequence star-forming galaxies at 4.4 < z < 5.9. We used, for the first\ntime, the morpho-kinematic information provided by the [CII] emission to obtain\nthe fraction of major mergers ($f_{MM}$) at z~5. By adopting different\nprescriptions for the merger timescales ($T_{MM}$), we converted this fraction\ninto the merger rate per galaxy ($R_{MM}$) and per volume ($\\Gamma_{MM}$). We\nthen combined our results with those at lower redshifts from the literature,\ncomputing the cosmic evolution of the merger fraction. This is described by a\nrapid increase from z~0 to higher redshifts, a peak at z~3, and a slow decrease\ntowards earlier epochs. Depending on the timescale prescription used, this\nfraction translates into a merger rate ranging between ~0.1 and ~4.0 Gyr$^{-1}$\nat z~5. Finally, we compare the specific star formation and star-formation rate\ndensity with the analogous quantities from major mergers. Our new ALPINE data\nreveal the presence of a significant merging activity in the early Universe.\nHowever, whether this population of mergers can provide a relevant contribution\nto the galaxy mass assembly at these redshifts and through the cosmic epochs is\nstrongly dependent on the assumption of the merger timescale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-24"}

The key property used in many Local SGD analysis on smooth\nfunction is gradient Lipschitzness, so that the gradient on local models will\nnot drift far away from that on averaged model. However, this decent property\ndoes not hold in networks with non-smooth ReLU activation function. We show\nthat, even though ReLU network does not admit gradient Lipschitzness property,\nthe difference between gradients on local models and average model will not\nchange too much, under the dynamics of Local SGD. We validate our theoretical\nresults via extensive experiments. This work is the first to show the\nconvergence of Local SGD on non-smooth functions, and will shed lights on the\noptimization theory of federated training of deep neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 18:06:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 18:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

In this\nwork, we aim to analyze and provide the certified robustness for ensemble ML\nmodels, together with the sufficient and necessary conditions of robustness for\ndifferent ensemble protocols. Although ensemble models are shown more robust\nthan a single model empirically; surprisingly, we find that in terms of the\ncertified robustness the standard ensemble models only achieve marginal\nimprovement compared to a single model. Thus, to explore the conditions that\nguarantee to provide certifiably robust ensemble ML models, we first prove that\ndiversified gradient and large confidence margin are sufficient and necessary\nconditions for certifiably robust ensemble models under the model-smoothness\nassumption. We then provide the bounded model-smoothness analysis based on the\nproposed Ensemble-before-Smoothing strategy.

For spatio-temporal data, DMD provides low-rank and\ninterpretable models in the form of dominant modal structures along with their\nexponential/oscillatory behavior in time. The majority of DMD algorithms,\nhowever, are prone to bias errors from noisy measurements of the dynamics,\nleading to poor model fits and unstable forecasting capabilities. The optimized\nDMD algorithm minimizes the model bias with a variable projection optimization,\nthus leading to stabilized forecasting capabilities. Here, the optimized DMD\nalgorithm is improved by using statistical bagging methods whereby a single set\nof snapshots is used to produce an ensemble of optimized DMD models.

However, current approaches are limited due to inadequate shape\npriors and the insufficiency of the derived image observations for a reliable\nalignment with the 3D model. The goal of this paper is to show how 3D object\nreconstruction can profit from a more sophisticated shape prior and from a\ncombined incorporation of different observation types inferred from the images.\nWe introduce a subcategory-aware deformable vehicle model that makes use of a\nprediction of the vehicle type for a more appropriate regularisation of the\nvehicle shape. A multi-branch CNN is presented to derive predictions of the\nvehicle type and orientation. This information is also introduced as prior\ninformation for model fitting. Furthermore, the CNN extracts vehicle keypoints\nand wireframes, which are well-suited for model-to-image association and model\nfitting. The task of pose estimation and reconstruction is addressed by a\nversatile probabilistic model. Extensive experiments are conducted using two\nchallenging real-world data sets on both of which the benefit of the developed\nshape prior can be shown.

A session type specifies a channel's protocol as sequences of\nexchanges. It is most relevant to investigate session-based concurrency by\nidentifying the essential notions that enable program specification and\nverification. Following that perspective, prior work identified minimal session\ntypes (MSTs), a sub-class of session types without the sequentiality construct\n(;), which specifies the structure of communication actions. This notion led to\nestablish a minimality result: every process typable with standard session\ntypes can be compiled down to a process typable using MSTs, which mimics\nsequentiality in types via additional synchronizations. Such a minimality\nresult is significant because it justifies session types in terms of\nthemselves, without resorting to external notions; it was proven for a\nhigher-order session $\\pi$-calculus, where values are abstractions (functions\nfrom names to processes). This paper studies MSTs and their associated\nminimality result but now for the session $\\pi$-calculus, the (first-order)\nlanguage in which values are names and for which session types have been more\nwidely studied.

The\ntheory behind achieving interference in QPM with conventional light sources\nsuch as white light and lasers is very well developed. Recently, the use of\ndynamic speckle illumination (DSI) in QPM has attracted attention due to its\nadvantages over conventional light sources such as high spatial phase\nsensitivity, single shot, scalable field of view (FOV) and resolution. However,\nthe understanding behind obtaining interference fringes in QPM with DSI has not\nbeen convincingly covered previously. This imposes a constraint on obtaining\ninterference fringes in QPM using DSI and limits its widespread penetration in\nthe field of biomedical imaging. The present article provides the basic\nunderstanding of DSI through both simulation and experiments that is essential\nto build interference optical microscopy systems such as QPM, digital\nholographic microscopy and optical coherence tomography. Using the developed\ntheory of DSI we demonstrate its capabilities of using non-identical objective\nlenses in both arms of the interference microscopy without degrading the\ninterference fringe contrast and providing the flexibility to use user-defined\nmicroscope objective lens. It is also demonstrated that the interference\nfringes are not washed out over a large range of optical path difference (OPD)\nbetween the object and the reference arm providing competitive edge over low\ntemporal coherence light sources. The theory and explanation developed here\nwould enable wider penetration of DSI based QPM for applications in biology and\nmaterial sciences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 22:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-26"}

With the increasing\nindustrial demand for Ni and the depleting accessible Ni primary ores,\nsustainable technologies are required for the recovery of this metal from\nalternative resources. In this study, adsorption using chitosan was\ninvestigated as a sustainable technique to recover Ni from sulfate (SO42-) and\ncalcium (Ca) rich secondary resources. The effects of pH, contact time, and the\npresence of SO42- and Ca on Ni adsorption were investigated in batch\nexperiments. Chemical speciation modeling was performed to analyze how the\npredominant Ni species present under different conditions may affect the\nefficiency of the adsorption process. The comparison of the maximum Ni\nadsorption capacities of chitosan in the absence (1.00 mmol/g) and presence\n(1.49 mmol/g) of 500 mM SO42- and 10 mM Ca indicated the positive effect of\nthese ions on Ni adsorption. The predominance of the neutrally charged (NiSO4)0\nspecies in Ni/SO42- system has contributed to the enhanced Ni adsorption on\nchitosan as verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis.\nHowever, kinetic studies confirmed that the Ni adsorption rate decreased by 4.5\ntimes when SO42- was present. The subsequent continuous Ni adsorption from a\nreal SO42-rich leachate in a column setup revealed that chitosan is selective\nfor Ni over Ca and Cr with selectivity quotients of 9.6 (K Ni/Ca) and 3.0 (K\nNi/Cr). Overall, this study indicated that Ni complexation with SO42- enhances\nthe Ni adsorption capacity of chitosan, but slows down the adsorption process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 22:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-26"}

Since $p\n* n$ is unknown at test-time, and we only need the score (i.e., the gradient of\nthe log-probability function) to perform gradient ascent, we propose a neural\nnetwork architecture to estimate the score of $p * n$ given only noisy point\nclouds as input.

Experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods under\na variety of noise models, and shows the potential to be applied in other tasks\nsuch as point cloud upsampling.

To alleviate the current\nlimitations and improve the quality of the synthesized images, we propose a\npose transfer network with augmented Disentangled Feature Consistency (DFC-Net)\nto facilitate human pose transfer. Given a pair of images containing the source\nand target person, DFC-Net extracts pose and static information from the source\nand target respectively, then synthesizes an image of the target person with\nthe desired pose from the source. Moreover, DFC-Net leverages disentangled\nfeature consistency losses in the adversarial training to strengthen the\ntransfer coherence and integrates a keypoint amplifier to enhance the pose\nfeature extraction. With the help of the disentangled feature consistency\nlosses, we further propose a novel data augmentation scheme that introduces\nunpaired support data with the augmented consistency constraints to improve the\ngenerality and robustness of DFC-Net.

To this end, we propose a New Reptile initialization based\nPhysics-Informed Neural Network (NRPINN). The original Reptile algorithm is a\nmeta-learning initialization method based on labeled data. PINNs can be trained\nwith less labeled data or even without any labeled data by adding partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) as a penalty term into the loss function.\nInspired by this idea, we propose the new Reptile initialization to sample more\ntasks from the parameterized PDEs and adapt the penalty term of the loss. The\nnew Reptile initialization can acquire initialization parameters from related\ntasks by supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. Then, PINNs\nwith initialization parameters can efficiently solve PDEs. Besides, the new\nReptile initialization can also be used for the variants of PINNs. Finally, we\ndemonstrate and verify the NRPINN considering both forward problems, including\nsolving Poisson, Burgers, and Schr\\\"odinger equations, as well as inverse\nproblems, where unknown parameters in the PDEs are estimated.

It\ngeneralizes the original Bloch model to non-exponential decays, which are,\ne.g., observed for semi-solid spin pools. The combination of rotations with\nnon-exponential decays is facilitated by describing the latter as Green's\nfunctions, comprised in an integro-differential equation.\n  Results: Our model describes the data of an inversion-recovery\nmagnetization-transfer experiment with varying durations of the inversion pulse\nsubstantially better than established models. We made this observation for all\nmeasured data, but in particular for pulse durations small than 300$\\mu$s.\nFurthermore, we provide a linear approximation of the generalized Bloch model\nthat reduces the simulation time by approximately a factor 15,000, enabling\nsimulation of the spin dynamics caused by a rectangular RF-pulse in roughly\n2$\\mu$s.\n  Conclusion: The proposed theory unifies the original Bloch model, Henkelman's\nsteady-state theory for magnetization transfer, and the commonly assumed\nrotation induced by hard pulses (i.e., strong and infinitesimally short\napplications of RF fields) and describes experimental data better than previous\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 02:25:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 22:23:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 21:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

However, given the need for generalization over\ncomplex state/action spaces, the incorporation of function approximators (e.g.,\ndeep neural networks) requires model selection to reduce overfitting and\nimprove policy performance at deployment. Yet a standard validation pipeline\nfor model selection requires running a learned policy in the actual\nenvironment, which is often infeasible in a healthcare setting. In this work,\nwe investigate a model selection pipeline for offline RL that relies on\noff-policy evaluation (OPE) as a proxy for validation performance. We present\nan in-depth analysis of popular OPE methods, highlighting the additional\nhyperparameters and computational requirements (fitting/inference of auxiliary\nmodels) when used to rank a set of candidate policies. We compare the utility\nof different OPE methods as part of the model selection pipeline in the context\nof learning to treat patients with sepsis. Among all the OPE methods we\nconsidered, fitted Q evaluation (FQE) consistently leads to the best validation\nranking, but at a high computational cost. To balance this trade-off between\naccuracy of ranking and computational efficiency, we propose a simple two-stage\napproach to accelerate model selection by avoiding potentially unnecessary\ncomputation.

By taking the\nservice statuses of IoT nodes, the UAV's position, and the merged pheromone as\ninput, the proposed algorithm can continuously and adaptively learn how to\nadjust the UAV's movement strategy.

Exploiting\nthe recently-proposed unpaired image-to-image translation between cell nuclei\nimages and randomly synthetic masks, existing approaches, e.g., CycleGAN, have\nachieved encouraging results. However, these methods usually take a two-stage\npipeline and fail to learn end-to-end in cell nuclei images. More seriously,\nthey could lead to the lossy transformation problem, i.e., the content\ninconsistency between the original images and the corresponding segmentation\noutput. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end\nunsupervised framework called Aligned Disentangling Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (AD-GAN). Distinctively, AD-GAN introduces representation\ndisentanglement to separate content representation (the underling spatial\nstructure) from style representation (the rendering of the structure). With\nthis framework, spatial structure can be preserved explicitly, enabling a\nsignificant reduction of macro-level lossy transformation. We also propose a\nnovel training algorithm able to align the disentangled content in the latent\nspace to reduce micro-level lossy transformation. Evaluations on real-world 2D\nand 3D datasets show that AD-GAN substantially outperforms the other comparison\nmethods and the professional software both quantitatively and qualitatively.\nSpecifically, the proposed AD-GAN leads to significant improvement over the\ncurrent best unsupervised methods by an average 17.8% relatively (w.r.t. the\nmetric DICE) on four cell nuclei datasets. As an unsupervised method, AD-GAN\neven performs competitive with the best supervised models, taking a further\nleap towards end-to-end unsupervised nuclei segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 04:08:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 07:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-11"}

Notably, it\nis stack-order dependent, and particularly extensive when Ir sits atop CoB.\nIntermixing induced variations in magnetic properties are ascribed to the\nformation of magnetic dead layer arising from CoIr alloying in the metallic\nstacks. It also produces systematic variations in saturation magnetization, by\nas much as 30%, across stacks. Crucially, the resulting crossover CoB thickness\nfor the transition from perpendicular to in-plane magnetic anisotropy differs\nby more than 2x across the stacks. Finally, with thermal annealing treatment\nover moderate temperatures of 150-300 degree Celsius, the magnetic anisotropy\nincreases monotonically across all stacks, coupled with discernibly larger Hc\nfor the metallic stacks.

The simulation model\nrelates the alloy's electrical resistivity to the relative proportions of the\nthree main structural phases namely Martensite, Austenite and R-phase,\nexperimentally known to exist in NiTi alloy lattice structure. The relative\nproportions of the phases depend on temperature and applied stress. Temperature\nvaries due to the self-heating of the filament by the Joule effect when a\ncurrent pulse passes and also due to convective/radiative interchange with the\nambient. The temperature variation with time causes structural phase\ntransitions, which result in abrupt changes in the sample resistivity as the\nproportions of each lattice phase vary.

A first focus lies on the derivation of a\nconsistent constitutive law on basis of a Voigt-type spatial homogenization\nprocedure across the relevant phases, powder, melt and solid. The proposed\nconstitutive law accounts for the irreversibility of phase change and\nconsistently represents thermally induced residual stresses. In particular, the\nincorporation of a reference strain term, formulated in rate form, allows to\nconsistently enforce a stress-free configuration for newly solidifying material\nat melt temperature. Application to elementary test cases demonstrates the\nvalidity of the proposed constitutive law and allows for a comparison with\nanalytical and reference solutions. Moreover, these elementary solidification\nscenarios give detailed insights and foster understanding of basic mechanisms\nof residual stress generation in melting and solidification problems with\nlocalized, moving heat sources.

As compared to collocation-type coupling schemes, e.g.,\nbased on hanging nodes, these mortar methods enforce the coupling conditions\nbetween non-matching meshes in an $L^2$-optimal manner. The combination of the\nproposed constitutive law and mortar mesh tying approach is validated on\nrealistic three-dimensional examples, representing a first step towards\npart-scale predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 08:17:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 08:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Knockout reactions with proton targets provide an invaluable tool\nto access the properties of two-neutron halo nuclei. Recently, experimental\nresults for the average opening angle as a function of the intrinsic neutron\nmomentum in 11Li have shown a localization of dineutron correlations on the\nnucleus surface.\n  Purpose. Study the model dependence and the effect of distortion and\nabsorption on the opening angle distributions to assess the reliability of this\nobservable to extract properties of Borromean two-neutron halo nuclei.\n  Method. A quasifree sudden model is used to describe the knockout process,\nwhere absorption effects are modeled by the eikonal S-matrix between the proton\ntarget and the core of the Borromean nucleus. Final states in momentum space\nare built within a three-body model for the projectile, which enables the\ndescription of momenta and opening angle distributions.\n  Results. A strong dependence on absorption effects is found for the opening\nangle at large intrinsic momenta, while the region of lower momenta is mostly\ninsensitive to them. Reasonable agreement with the available data is obtained\nfor 11Li at low momenta with weights for s and p waves different from those\npreviously reported, showing a model dependence in their extraction. For 19B,\ntest calculations show marked sensitivity to small p-wave components.\n  Conclusions. The opening angle for (p,pn) knockout reactions on Borromean\nnuclei at small intrinsic momenta is a reliable observable mostly sensitive to\nthe structure of the Borromean nucleus. For larger momenta, the reaction\nmechanism leads to a larger distortion of the distribution. In the case of\nnuclei with small components of opposite parity to the dominant ones, this\nobservable can be used to explore them. The relation between dineutron in\ncoordinate space and opening angle in momentum space is found to be\nmodel-dependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 08:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

The critical difference between\nnetwork alignment and exact graph matching is that the network alignment\nconsiders node mapping in non-isomorphic graphs with error tolerance.\nResearchers usually utilize AC (accuracy) to measure the performance of network\nalignments which comparing each output element with the benchmark directly.\nHowever, this metric neglects that some nodes are naturally indistinguishable\neven in single graphs (e.g., nodes have the same neighbors) and no need to\ndistinguish across graphs. Such neglect leads to the underestimation of models.\nWe propose an unbiased metric for network alignment that takes\nindistinguishable nodes into consideration to address this problem. Our\ndetailed experiments with different scales on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed metric correctly reflects the deviation\nof result mapping from benchmark mapping as standard metric AC does. Comparing\nwith the AC, the proposed metric effectively blocks the effect of\nindistinguishable nodes and retains stability under increasing\nindistinguishable nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 08:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-26"}

In this work, we propose\nclass-incremental domain adaptation (CIDA) with a multi-layer transformer-based\nmodel to tackle the new classes and domain shift in the target domain to\ngenerate surgical reports during robotic surgery. To adapt incremental classes\nand extract domain invariant features, a class-incremental (CI) learning method\nwith supervised contrastive (SupCon) loss is incorporated with a feature\nextractor. To generate caption from the extracted feature, curriculum by\none-dimensional gaussian smoothing (CBS) is integrated with a multi-layer\ntransformer-based caption prediction model.

Herein, we investigate the functional degradation of\nnanocrystalline NiTi tubes via in-depth analysis and find out that it is\nbeneficial to elastocaloric cooling performance. The results show that the\nfunctional degradation accompanies with progressive accumulation of residual\nstrain and significant reduction in both hysteresis loop area (D) and forward\ntransformation stress. The accumulation of residual strain arises from\nphase-transition-induced dislocations and dislocation-pinned residual\nmartensite. The former separates the original austenite grains to much smaller\nnanodomains (equivalent to grain size effect) and contributes to the strain\nhardening during phase transition, leading to the significant reduction of D.\nThe latter induces compressive residual stress in the austenite phase and thus\ngives rise to the evolutive reduction of forward transformation stress.\nConsequently, the material coefficient of performance (COPmater) was\nself-enhanced for 40~104 %. The beneficial effect is mainly because of the\ncyclically-decreased D. The study might provide a processing route to tailor\nCOPmater and stabilize the mechanical response of NiTi by cyclic compression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 09:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-26"}

Hence, soft magneto-active (SMA) plates buckle when\nsubject to critical uniform magnetic field normal to their wide surface. Here,\nwe provide a systematic analysis of the wrinkling of SMA plates subject to an\nin-plane mechanical load and a transverse magnetic field?. We consider two\nloading modes: plane-strain loading and uni-axial loading, and two models of\nmagneto-sensitive plates: the neo-Hookean ideal magneto-elastic model and the\nneo-Hookean magnetization saturation Langevin model. Our analysis relies on the\ntheory of nonlinear magneto-elasticity and the associated linearized theory for\nsuperimposed perturbations. We derive the Stroh formulation of the governing\nequations of wrinkling, and combine it with the surface impedance method to\nobtain explicitly the bifurcation equations identifying the onset of symmetric\nand antisymmetric wrinkles. We also obtain analytical expressions of\ninstability in the thin- and thick-plate limits. For thin plates, we make the\nlink with classical Euler buckling solutions. We also perform an exhaustive\nnumerical analysis to elucidate the effects of loading mode, load amplitude,\nand saturation magnetization on the nonlinear static response and bifurcation\ndiagrams. We find that antisymmetric wrinkling modes always occur before\nsymmetric modes. Increasing the pre-compression or heightening the magnetic\nfield has a destabilizing effect for SMA plates, while the saturation\nmagnetization enhances their stability.

This paper proposes a simple one-dimensional soft phononic crystal\ncylinder made of dielectric elastomer to show how large deformation and\nelectric field can be used jointly to tune the longitudinal waves propagating\nin the PC. A series of soft electrodes are placed periodically along the\ndielectric elastomer cylinder, and hence the material can be regarded as\nuniform in the undeformed state. This is also the case for the uniformly\npre-stretched state induced by a static axial force only. The effective\nperiodicity of the structure is then achieved through two loading paths, i.e.\nby maintaining the longitudinal stretch and applying an electric voltage over\nany two neighbouring electrodes, or by holding the axial force and applying the\nvoltage. All physical field variables for both configurations can be determined\nexactly based on the nonlinear theory of electroelasticity. An infinitesimal\nwave motion is further superimposed on the pre-deformed configurations and the\ncorresponding dispersion equations are derived analytically by invoking the\nlinearized theory for incremental motions. Numerical examples are finally\nconsidered to show the tunability of wave propagation behavior in the soft PC\ncylinder. The outstanding performance regarding the band gap (BG) property of\nthe proposed soft dielectric PC is clearly demonstrated by comparing with the\nconventional design adopting the hard piezoelectric material.

The equations governing small-amplitude\nvibrations under inhomogeneous biasing fields can be linearized and solved in\nspherical coordinates using the state-space formalism, which establishes two\nseparate transfer relations correlating the state vectors at the inner surface\nwith those at the outer surface of the SEA balloon. By imposing the mechanical\nand electric boundary conditions, two separate analytical frequency equations\nare derived, which characterize two independent classes of vibration for\ntorsional and spheroidal modes, respectively. Numerical examples are finally\nconducted to validate the theoretical derivation as well as to investigate the\neffects of both radial electric voltage and internal pressure on the resonant\nfrequency of the SEA balloon. The reported analytical solution is truly and\nfully three-dimensional, covering from the purely radial breathing mode to\ntorsional mode to any general spheroidal mode, and hence provides a more\naccurate prediction of the vibration characteristics of tunable resonant\ndevices that incorporate the SEA spherical balloon as the tuning element.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 10:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-26"}

We consider both torsional\nwaves and longitudinal waves propagating in the FG cylinder made of\nincompressible isotropic elastomer, which is characterized by the Mooney-Rivlin\nstrain energy function but with the material parameters varying with the radial\ncoordinate in an affine way. The pressure difference generates an inhomogeneous\ndeformation field in the FG cylinder, which dramatically complicates the\nsuperimposed wave problem described by the small-on-large theory.

However, most of the\nprevious work can only handle either regular data distribution or irregular\ndata in the low dimensional space case. To better understand the challenges\narising from irregular data distribution, in this paper we provide the first\nstudy on the problem of DP-SCO with heavy-tailed data in the high dimensional\nspace. In the first part we focus on the problem over some polytope constraint\n(such as the $\\ell_1$-norm ball). We show that if the loss function is smooth\nand its gradient has bounded second order moment, it is possible to get a (high\nprobability) error bound (excess population risk) of $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{\\log\nd}{(n\\epsilon)^\\frac{1}{3}})$ in the $\\epsilon$-DP model, where $n$ is the\nsample size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the underlying space. Next, for\nLASSO, if the data distribution that has bounded fourth-order moments, we\nimprove the bound to $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{\\log d}{(n\\epsilon)^\\frac{2}{5}})$ in the\n$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP model. In the second part of the paper, we study sparse\nlearning with heavy-tailed data. We first revisit the sparse linear model and\npropose a truncated DP-IHT method whose output could achieve an error of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{s^{*2}\\log d}{n\\epsilon})$, where $s^*$ is the sparsity of the\nunderlying parameter. Then we study a more general problem over the sparsity\n({\\em i.e.,} $\\ell_0$-norm) constraint, and show that it is possible to achieve\nan error of $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{s^{*\\frac{3}{2}}\\log d}{n\\epsilon})$, which is\nalso near optimal up to a factor of $\\tilde{O}{(\\sqrt{s^*})}$, if the loss\nfunction is smooth and strongly convex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 11:03:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 15:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

A reason for such high performance is the\nset of optimizations introduced in the protocol. One of these optimizations is\nread-only requests, a particular type of client request which avoids running\nthe three-step agreement protocol and allows replicas to respond directly, thus\nreducing the latency of reads from five to two communication steps. Given\nPBFT's broad influence, its design and optimizations influenced many BFT\nprotocols and systems that followed, e.g., BFT-SMaRt. We show, for the first\ntime, that the read-only request optimization introduced in PBFT more than 20\nyears ago can violate its liveness.

Such systems\nconsist of large-scale interconnected systems, also called modules. To recover\nfull networks dynamics the two crucial steps are topology detection, where one\nhas to infer from data which connections are active, and modules estimation.\nSince a small percentage of connections are effective in many real systems, the\nproblem finds also fundamental connections with group-sparse estimation. In\nparticular, in the linear setting modules correspond to unknown impulse\nresponses expected to have null norm but in a small fraction of samples. This\npaper introduces a new Bayesian approach for linear dynamic networks\nidentification where impulse responses are described through the combination of\ntwo particular prior distributions. The first one is a block version of the\nhorseshoe prior, a model possessing important global-local shrinkage features.\nThe second one is the stable spline prior, that encodes information on\nsmooth-exponential decay of the modules. The resulting model is called stable\nspline horseshoe (SSH) prior. It implements aggressive shrinkage of small\nimpulse responses while larger impulse responses are conveniently subject to\nstable spline regularization. Inference is performed by a Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo scheme, tailored to the dynamic context and able to efficiently return\nthe posterior of the modules in sampled form. We include numerical studies that\nshow how the new approach can accurately reconstruct sparse networks dynamics\nalso when thousands of unknown impulse response coefficients must be inferred\nfrom data sets of relatively small size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 12:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-26"}

However, differences in this\ncharacteristic between large CNNs and their compact counterparts have rarely\nbeen investigated. In compact CNNs, due to the limited number of parameters,\nabundant features are unlikely to be obtained, and feature diversity becomes an\nessential characteristic. Diverse features present in the activation maps\nderived from a data point during model inference may indicate the presence of a\nset of unique descriptors necessary to distinguish between objects of different\nclasses. In contrast, data points with low feature diversity may not provide a\nsufficient amount of unique descriptors to make a valid prediction; we refer to\nthem as random predictions. Random predictions can negatively impact the\noptimization process and harm the final performance. This paper proposes\naddressing the problem raised by random predictions by reshaping the standard\ncross-entropy to make it biased toward data points with a limited number of\nunique descriptive features. Our novel Bias Loss focuses the training on a set\nof valuable data points and prevents the vast number of samples with poor\nlearning features from misleading the optimization process.

In this paper\nwe present an algorithm to estimate the parameters of the low mass merging\ncompact binary systems such as localization, chirp mass, redshift, mass ratios\nand total mass of the source which are crucial in order to estimate the\ncapability of the ET to study various compact binary populations. For the\ncompact binary population distributed uniformly in comoving volume we find that\nwith single ET, $\\approx 1\\%$ of binaries can be localized within 800 square\ndegrees. The values of chirp mass and total mass can be constrained within\n$\\lesssim 5\\%$ error, while $z$ and $D_L$ can be estimated with an error of\n$\\lesssim 15\\%$ for effective SNR $\\gtrsim 50$ using single ET.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 12:59:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 23:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 01:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

However, experimental evidence of its electrical\nproperties is still lacking. Here, we characterized the electronic properties\nof mechanically exfoliated flakes of few-layer (FL) antimonene of different\nthicknesses (~ 2-40 nm) through photoemission electron microscopy, kelvin probe\nforce microscopy and transport measurements, which allows us to estimate a\nsheet resistance of ~ 1200 $\\Omega$sq$^{-1}$ and a mobility of ~ 150\ncm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ in ambient conditions, independent of the flake\nthickness. Alternatively, our theoretical calculations indicate that\ntopologically protected surface states (TPSS) should play a key role in the\nelectronic properties of FL antimonene, which supports our experimental\nfindings. We anticipate our work will trigger further experimental studies on\nTPSS in FL antimonene thanks to its simple structure and significant stability\nin ambient environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 13:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

We use multivariate generalised linear mixed\nmodels (MGLMM) for studying association patterns of those simultaneously\nobserved responses via the covariance structure of random components.\nRemarkably, those MGLMMs can be used to represent patterns of association\nbetween quantities of different statistical nature.

Principal features of the emerging\nseismicity (e.g. intermittent dynamics and broad time and/or energy scales)\nhave been replicated by simple experimental setups, which involve a slowly\ndriven slider on top of granular matter, for example. Yet, these set-ups are\noften physically limited and might not allow one to determine the underlying\nnature of specific features and, hence, the universality and generality of the\nexperimental observations.

We show that quantum information preserved\nby the four qubit state is more dependent on the coherence than the\nentanglement using time-dependent entanglement witness, purity, and Shannon\nentropy. We find these two quantum phenomena directly interrelated and highly\nvulnerable in environments with ORU noise, resulting in the pure exponential\ndecay of a considerable amount. The current Markovian dynamical map, as well as\nsuppression of the fluctuating character of the environments are observed to be\nentirely attributable to the Gaussian nature of the noise. Furthermore, the\nincreasing number of environments are witnessed to accelerate the amount of\ndecay.

In this regard, we address the dynamics of entanglement and\ncoherence for three non-interacting qubits initially prepared as maximally\nentangled GHZ-like state coupled with independent classical environments. Two\ndifferent Gaussian noises in pure and mixed noisy situations, namely, pure\npower-law noise, pure fractional Gaussian noise, power-law noise maximized and\nfractional Gaussian noise maximized cases are assumed to characterize the\nenvironments. With the help of time-dependent entanglement witnesses, purity,\nand decoherence measures, within the full range of parameters, we show that the\ncurrent mixed noise cases are more detrimental than pure ones where\nentanglement and coherence are found short-lived. The power-law noise phase, in\nparticular, appears to be more flexible and exploitable for long-term\npreservation effects. In contrast, we find that in both pure and mixed noise\ncases, where entanglement and coherence degrade at a relatively high rate,\nthere is no ultimate solution for avoiding the detrimental dephasing effects of\nfractional Gaussian noise. The three-qubit state becomes disentangled and\ndecoherent within independent classical environments driven by both pure and\nmixed Gaussian noises, either in long or short interaction time.

Our\nweakly supervised method with only 10\\% and 1\\% of labels can produce\ncompatible results with the fully supervised counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 14:34:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 09:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

We argue that a tool that can identify human values from software\ndevelopment artefacts and present them to varying software development roles\ncan (partially) address this gap.

Aims:\nThis study aims to (1) investigate the possibility of using a human values\ndashboard to help address human values during software development, (2)\nidentify possible benefits of using a human values dashboard, and (3) elicit\npractitioners' needs from a human values dashboard. Method: We conducted an\nexploratory study by interviewing 15 software practitioners. A dashboard\nprototype was developed to support the interview process.

Case studies on a 20Hz dataset, the 50Hz LIFTED\ndataset, and the 60Hz BLUED dataset show that the proposed method can robustly\noutperform other state-of-art event detection methods. This paper also shows\nthat the extracted load signatures can improve NILM accuracy and help develop\nother applications such as load reconstruction to generate realistic load data\nfor NILM research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 15:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-26"}

It is shown that the\nproposed BC-rule preserves linear convergence of the unquantized algorithms,\nand a trade-off between convergence rate and communication cost under ANQ-based\nquantization is characterized. Numerical results validate our theoretical\nfindings and show that distributed algorithms equipped with the proposed ANQ\nhave more favorable communication cost than algorithms using state-of-the-art\nquantization rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 15:31:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 22:55:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 02:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

Such decompositions are very popular for modeling large\ncovariance matrices as they admit a latent factor based representation that\nallows easy inference. The same is however not true for precision matrices due\nto the lack of computationally convenient representations which restricts\ninference to low-to-moderate dimensional problems. We address this remarkable\ngap in the literature by building on a latent variable representation for such\ndecomposition for precision matrices. The construction leads to an efficient\nGibbs sampler that scales very well to high-dimensional problems far beyond the\nlimits of the current state-of-the-art. The ability to efficiently explore the\nfull posterior space also allows the model uncertainty to be easily assessed.\nThe decomposition crucially additionally allows us to adapt sparsity inducing\npriors to shrink the insignificant entries of the precision matrix toward zero,\nmaking the approach adaptable to high-dimensional small-sample-size sparse\nsettings. Exact zeros in the matrix encoding the underlying conditional\nindependence graph are then determined via a novel posterior false discovery\nrate control procedure.

Machine learning (ML)\nprovides powerful means to classify wireless signals, e.g., for PHY-layer\nauthentication. As an adversarial machine learning attack, the MIA infers\nwhether a signal of interest has been used in the training data of a target\nclassifier. This private information incorporates waveform, channel, and device\ncharacteristics, and if leaked, can be exploited by an adversary to identify\nvulnerabilities of the underlying ML model (e.g., to infiltrate the PHY-layer\nauthentication). One challenge for the over-the-air MIA is that the received\nsignals and consequently the RF fingerprints at the adversary and the intended\nreceiver differ due to the discrepancy in channel conditions. Therefore, the\nadversary first builds a surrogate classifier by observing the spectrum and\nthen launches the black-box MIA on this classifier. The MIA results show that\nthe adversary can reliably infer signals (and potentially the radio and channel\ninformation) used to build the target classifier. Therefore, a proactive\ndefense is developed against the MIA by building a shadow MIA model and fooling\nthe adversary. This defense can successfully reduce the MIA accuracy and\nprevent information leakage from the wireless signal classifier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 17:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

To date, it is\nwidely accepted that performance will degrade over time due to changes in care\nprocesses and patient populations. However, the extent to which this occurs is\npoorly understood, in part because few researchers report prospective\nvalidation performance. In this study, we compare the 2020-2021 ('20-'21)\nprospective performance of a patient risk stratification model for predicting\nhealthcare-associated infections to a 2019-2020 ('19-'20) retrospective\nvalidation of the same model. We define the difference in retrospective and\nprospective performance as the performance gap. We estimate how i) \"temporal\nshift\", i.e., changes in clinical workflows and patient populations, and ii)\n\"infrastructure shift\", i.e., changes in access, extraction and transformation\nof data, both contribute to the performance gap. Applied prospectively to\n26,864 hospital encounters during a twelve-month period from July 2020 to June\n2021, the model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic\ncurve (AUROC) of 0.767 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.737, 0.801) and a Brier\nscore of 0.189 (95% CI: 0.186, 0.191). Prospective performance decreased\nslightly compared to '19-'20 retrospective performance, in which the model\nachieved an AUROC of 0.778 (95% CI: 0.744, 0.815) and a Brier score of 0.163\n(95% CI: 0.161, 0.165). The resulting performance gap was primarily due to\ninfrastructure shift and not temporal shift. So long as we continue to develop\nand validate models using data stored in large research data warehouses, we\nmust consider differences in how and when data are accessed, measure how these\ndifferences may affect prospective performance, and work to mitigate those\ndifferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 14:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

To address this lack, tactile sensors have been\ndesigned and developed, but they often offer an insufficient spatial and\ntemporal resolution. This paper focuses on overcoming these issues by designing\na smart embedded system, called SmartHand, enabling the acquisition and\nreal-time processing of high-resolution tactile information from a hand-shaped\nmulti-sensor array for prosthetic and robotic applications.

The manual tuning only targets a limited subset of observational\ndata and parameters. Bayesian calibration can estimate climate model parameters\nand their uncertainty using a larger fraction of the available data and\nautomatically exploring the parameter space more broadly. In Bayesian learning,\nit is natural to exploit the seasonal cycle, which has large amplitude,\ncompared with anthropogenic climate change, in many climate statistics. In this\nstudy, we develop methods for the calibration and uncertainty quantification\n(UQ) of model parameters exploiting the seasonal cycle, and we demonstrate a\nproof-of-concept with an idealized general circulation model (GCM). Uncertainty\nquantification is performed using the calibrate-emulate-sample approach, which\ncombines stochastic optimization and machine learning emulation to speed up\nBayesian learning. The methods are demonstrated in a perfect-model setting\nthrough the calibration and UQ of a convective parameterization in an idealized\nGCM with a seasonal cycle. Calibration and UQ based on seasonally averaged\nclimate statistics, compared to annually averaged, reduces the calibration\nerror by up to an order of magnitude and narrows the spread of posterior\ndistributions by factors between two and five, depending on the variables used\nfor UQ. The reduction in the size of the parameter posterior distributions\nleads to a reduction in the uncertainty of climate model predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 20:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

Here, we present a millimeter-sized optical voltage sensor based\non piezoelectric aluminum nitride (AlN) thin film for continuous measurements\nof AC voltages <350kVrms (via capacitive division) that avoids the drawbacks of\nexisting voltage-sensing transformers. This sensor operated with 110uW incident\noptical power from a low-cost LED achieved a resolution of 170mVrms in a 5kHz\nbandwidth, a measurement inaccuracy of 0.04% due to sensor nonlinearity, and a\ngain deviation of +/-0.2% over the temperature range of ~20-60C. The sensor has\na breakdown voltage of 100V, and its lifetime can meet or exceed that of\ninstrument transformers when operated at voltages <42Vrms. We believe that our\nsensor has the potential to reduce the cost of grid monitoring, providing a\npath towards more distributed sensing and control of the grid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 15:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

Here we design an artificial neural\nnetwork of coupled phase oscillators and, by the technique of reservoir\ncomputing in machine learning, train it for predicting chaos. It is found that\nwhen the machine is properly trained, oscillators in the reservoir are\nsynchronized into clusters whose sizes follow a power-law distribution. This\nfeature, however, is absent when the machine is poorly trained. Additionally,\nit is found that despite the synchronization degree of the original network,\nonce properly trained, the reservoir network is always developed to the same\ncritical state, exemplifying the \"attractor\" nature of this state in machine\nlearning. The generality of the results is verified in different reservoir\nmodels and by different target systems, and it is found that the scaling\nexponent of the distribution is independent on the reservoir details and the\nbifurcation parameter of the target system, but is modified when the dynamics\nof the target system is changed to a different type. The findings shed lights\non the nature of machine learning, and are helpful to the design of\nhigh-performance machine in physical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 03:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

The most typical tool is angiography\nfor diagnosing CAD. The challenges of CAD diagnosis using angiography are\ncostly and have side effects. One of the alternative solutions is the use of\nmachine learning-based patterns for CAD diagnosis. Hence, this paper provides a\nnew hybrid machine learning model called Genetic Support Vector Machine and\nAnalysis of Variance (GSVMA). The ANOVA is known as the kernel function for\nSVM. The proposed model is performed based on the Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset. A\ngenetic optimization algorithm is used to select crucial features. In addition,\nSVM with Anova, Linear SVM, and LibSVM with radial basis function methods were\napplied to classify the dataset. As a result, the GSVMA hybrid method performs\nbetter than other methods. This proposed method has the highest accuracy of\n89.45% through a 10-fold cross-validation technique with 35 selected features\non the Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset. Therefore, the genetic optimization algorithm\nis very effective for improving accuracy. The computer-aided GSVMA method can\nbe helped clinicians with CAD diagnosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 06:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

They manage this by presuming\ncontradictory premises: that a specific linear combination of four angles\ninvolved in their proposed parallel experiments on two pairs of electrons\nequals both $\\pi$ and $0$ at the same time. Ignoring this while presuming the\ncontradictory implications of these two conditions, they introduce the\ncontradiction themselves. The notation they use in their \"derivation\" is not\nsufficiently ornate to represent the entanglement in the double electron spin\npair problem they design, confounding their error. The situation they propose\nactually motivates only an understanding of the full array of symmetries\ninvolved in their problem. In tandem with the error now recognized in the\nsupposed defiance of Bell's inequality by quantum probabilities, my\nreassessment of their work should motivate a reevaluation of the current\nconsensus outlook regarding the principle of local realism and the proposition\nof hidden variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 22:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}
