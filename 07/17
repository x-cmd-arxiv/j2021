Hence, every time that a certain\nconstrual of reality encounters a problem, there is a choice between a\nmodification to the mathematical formalism of the physical theory and a change\nin the model of reasoning. A case in point is negative construal of quantum\nsuperposition causing the problem of definite outcomes. To be sure, according\nto the said construal, it is not the case that a system being in a\nsuperposition of states is exclusively in one of the states constituting the\nsuperposition, which in turn implies that macroscopically differing outcomes of\nobservation may appear all at once. The usual approach to the problem of\ndefinite outcomes is to modify the quantum mathematical formalism by adding to\nit some extra postulates (for instance, the postulate of wave function\ncollapse).

At resonance locations among these four frequencies, we\nfind that attitude instabilities are possible. Using two independent numerical\ncodes, we recover many of the resonances predicted by the analytic model and\nindeed show attitude instability. With one code, we use fast Lyapunov\nindicators to show that the secondary's attitude can evolve chaotically near\nthe resonance locations.

Currently, over 70% of species are threatened, endangered or\nextinct. To characterize the genetic response to these recent selective\npressures, we collected population genetic data for one successful bivalve\nspecies, Megalonaias nervosa. We identify megabase sized regions that are\nnearly monomorphic across the population, a signal of strong, recent selection\nreshaping genetic diversity. These signatures of selection encompass a total of\n73Mb, greater response to selection than is commonly seen in population genetic\nmodels. We observe 102 duplicate genes with high dN/dS on terminal branches\namong regions with sweeps, suggesting that gene duplication is a causative\nmechanism of recent adaptation in M. nervosa.

The resulting graph is referred to as causal graph. Our\nfirst contribution is then extending VAR models to matrix-variate models to\nserve the purpose of graph learning. Secondly, we propose two online procedures\nrespectively in low and high dimensions, which can update quickly the estimates\nof coefficients when new samples arrive. In particular in high dimensional\nregime, a novel Lasso-type is introduced and we develop its homotopy algorithms\nfor the online learning. We also provide an adaptive tuning procedure for the\nregularization parameter. Lastly, we consider that, the application of AR\nmodels onto data usually requires detrending the raw data, however, this step\nis forbidden in online context. Therefore, we augment the proposed AR models by\nincorporating trend as extra parameter, and then adapt the online algorithms to\nthe augmented data models, which allow us to simultaneously learn the graph and\ntrend from streaming samples. In this work, we consider primarily the periodic\ntrend. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real data are performed,\nwhose results support the effectiveness of the proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 17:21:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 14:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

The proposed method, EGGMiMoSA, relies on the asymptotic description of\nmixed modes, defines initial guesses for the parameters, and uses a\nLevenberg-Marquardt technique to adjust the mixed-modes pattern efficiently. We\nfollow the evolution of the mixed-modes parameters along a grid of models from\nthe subgiant phase to the RGB bump and extend past works.

The evolution of the period\nspacing $\\Delta\\pi_1$, pressure offset $\\epsilon_p$, gravity offset\n$\\epsilon_g$, and coupling factor $q$ as a function of $\\Delta\\nu$ is little\naffected by the chemical composition and it follows two different regimes\ndepending on the evolutionary stage. On the subgiant branch, the models display\na moderate core-envelope density contrast. The evolution of $\\Delta \\pi_1$,\n$\\epsilon_p$, $\\epsilon_g$, and $q$ thus significantly changes with the mass.\nAlso, we demonstrate that, at fixed Z/X and with proper measurements of\n$\\Delta\\pi_1$ and $\\Delta\\nu$, we may unambiguously constrain the mass, radius\nand age of a subgiant star. Conversely, on the red-giant branch, the\ncore-envelope density contrast becomes very large. Consequently, the evolution\nof $\\epsilon_p$, $\\epsilon_g$ and $q$ as a function of $\\Delta\\nu$ becomes\nindependent of the mass. This is also true for $\\Delta \\pi_1$ in stars with\nmasses $\\lesssim 1.8M_\\odot$ because of core electron degeneracy. This\ndegeneracy is lifted for higher masses, again allowing for a precise\nmeasurement of the age. Overall, our computations qualitatively agree with past\nobserved and theoretical studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 17:28:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

One of the models proposed to explain these flares is synchrotron\nemission of non-thermal particles accelerated by magnetic reconnection events\nin the accretion flow. We use the results from PIC simulations of magnetic\nreconnection to post-process 3D two-temperature GRMHD simulations of a\nmagnetically arrested disc (MAD). We identify current sheets, retrieve their\nproperties, estimate their potential to accelerate non-thermal particles and\ncompute the expected non-thermal synchrotron emission. We find that the flux\neruptions of MADs can provide suitable conditions for accelerating non-thermal\nparticles to energies $\\gamma_e \\lesssim 10^6$ and producing simultaneous X-ray\nand near-infrared flares. For a suitable choice of current-sheet parameters and\na simpified synchrotron cooling prescription, the model can simultaneously\nreproduce the quiescent and flaring X-ray luminosities as well as the X-ray\nspectral shape. While the near-infrared flares are mainly due to an increase in\nthe temperature near the black hole during the MAD flux eruptions, the X-ray\nemission comes from narrow current sheets bordering highly magnetized,\nlow-density regions near the black hole and equatorial current sheets where the\nflux on the black hole reconnects. As a result, not all infrared flares are\naccompanied by X-ray ones. The non-thermal flaring emission can extend to very\nhard ($\\lesssim 100$ keV) X-ray energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 18:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 21:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

However, most medium are constituted by both\ndiffuse and specular regions and the assumption of a homogeneous medium does\nnot hold good in all cases. Eventhough, there are some adaptive beamforming\napproaches proposed in literature, they are mostly for receive beamforming.\nThis study is aimed at investigating the relevance of transmission schemes in\ncharacterizing the diffuse and specular reflections, particularly at high frame\nrates. The transmit wavefront interaction behavior on the tissue interfaces for\ntwo high frame-rate transmission modalities, i.e. conventional synthetic\ntransmit aperture imaging and multi-angle plane-wave imaging, are analyzed for\nmultiple in-vitro and in-vivo radio-frequency datasets. Two novel visualization\nperspectives are proposed called contour isolines and directivity variance to\nunderstand the wave interaction with different tissue interfaces by considering\nthe scalar and vector aspects of the reflected intensities respectively. We\nalso rationalize the relevance of choosing the appropriate receive beamforming\nscheme according to the transmission modality through a comparison of delay and\nsum, filtered delay multiply and sum, minimum variance distortionless response,\nand specular beamforming algorithms. It is found that a synergistic blend of\ntransmit and receive beamforming schemes adaptive to the tissue is inevitable\nto avoid any misdiagnosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 18:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

Unfortunately,\ncommonly-used calibration weights -- which make the weighted mean $X$ in the\nsample equal that of the population -- only ensure correct adjustment when the\nportion of the outcome and the response process left unexplained by linear\nfunctions of $X$ are independent. To alleviate this functional form dependency,\nwe describe kernel balancing for population weighting (kpop).

A common model for mining games considers\nan infinite time horizon, with players optimizing asymptotic average\nobjectives. Implicitly, this assumes that the asymptotic behaviors are realized\nat human-scale times, otherwise invalidating current models. We study the\nmining game utilizing Markov Decision Processes. Our approach allows us to\ndescribe the asymptotic behavior of the game in terms of the stationary\ndistribution of the induced Markov chain. We focus on a model with two players\nunder immediate release, assuming two different objectives: the (asymptotic)\naverage reward per turn and the (asymptotic) percentage of obtained blocks.\n  Using tools from Markov chain analysis, we show the existence of a strategy\nachieving slow mixing times, exponential in the policy parameters. This result\nemphasizes the imperative need to understand convergence rates in mining games,\nvalidating the standard models. Towards this end, we provide upper bounds for\nthe mixing time of certain meaningful classes of strategies. This result yields\ncriteria for establishing that long-term averaged functions are coherent as\npayoff functions. Moreover, by studying hitting times, we provide a criterion\nto validate the common simplification of considering finite states models. For\nboth considered objectives functions, we provide explicit formulae depending on\nthe stationary distribution of the underlying Markov chain. In particular, this\nshows that both mentioned objectives are not equivalent. Finally, we perform a\nmarket share case study in a particular regime of the game. More precisely, we\nshow that an strategic player with a sufficiently large processing power can\nimpose negative revenue on honest players.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 18:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

Memory access patterns have been demonstrated to leak\ncritical information such as security keys and a program's spatial and temporal\ninformation. This information leak poses an even more significant privacy\nchallenge in machine learning models with embedding tables. Embedding tables\nare routinely used to learn categorical features from training data. Even\nknowing the locations of the embedding table entries accessed, not the data\nwithin the embedding table, will compromise categorical input data to the\nmodel. Embedding entries are privacy-sensitive since they disclose valuable\nproperties about the user. Oblivious RAM (ORAM), and its enhanced variants such\nas PathORAM have emerged as viable solutions to hide leakage from memory access\nstreams.\n  In this work, we present LAORAM, an ORAM framework explicitly designed to\nprotect user privacy during embedding table training.

Intraventricular vector flow mapping (iVFM) is a method to\nrecover the blood velocity vectors from the Doppler scalar fields in an\nechocardiographic three-chamber view. We improved our iVFM numerical scheme by\nimposing physical constraints. The iVFM consisted in minimizing regularized\nDoppler residuals subject to the condition that two fluid-dynamics constraints\nwere satisfied, namely planar mass conservation, and free-slip boundary\nconditions. The optimization problem was solved by using the Lagrange\nmultiplier method. A finite-difference discretization of the optimization\nproblem, written in the polar coordinate system centered on the cardiac\nultrasound probe, led to a sparse linear system. The single regularization\nparameter was determined automatically for non-supervision considerations. The\nphysics-constrained method was validated using realistic intracardiac flow data\nfrom a patient-specific CFD model. The numerical evaluations showed that the\niVFM-derived velocity vectors were in very good agreement with the CFD-based\noriginal velocities, with relative errors ranged between 0.3 and 12%. We\ncalculated two macroscopic measures of flow in the cardiac region of interest,\nthe mean vorticity and mean stream function, and observed an excellent\nconcordance between physics-constrained iVFM and CFD.

Our recommendations of ethical requirements for autonomous cars\ncan be used for other types of intelligent autonomous robots, with the caveat\nfor social robots that require more research regarding interactions with the\nusers. We emphasize that existing ethical frameworks need to be applied in a\ncontext-sensitive way, by assessments in interdisciplinary, multi-competent\nteams through multi-criteria analysis. Furthermore, we argue for the need of a\ncontinuous development of ethical principles, guidelines, and regulations,\ninformed by the progress of technologies and involving relevant stakeholders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 21:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

In particular, we want\nto shed light on the contribution of the disk to these changes, especially\nthose related to the long cycle, occurring on timescales of hundreds of days.\nWe studied I-band OGLE photometric times series spanning 18.5 years,\nconstructing disk models by analyzing the orbital light curve at 52 consecutive\nepochs. An optimized simplex algorithm was used to solve the inverse problem by\nadjusting the light curve with the best stellar-orbital-disk parameters for the\nsystem. We applied principal components analysis to the parameters to evaluate\ntheir dependence and variability. We constructed a description of the mass\ntransfer rate in terms of disk parameters. We find that the light variability\ncan be understood in terms of a variable mass transfer rate and variable\naccretion disk. The system brightness at orbital phase 0.25 follows the long\ncycle and is correlated with the mass transfer rate and the disk thickness. The\nlong-cycle brightness variations can be understood in terms of differential\noccultation of the hotter star by a disk of variable thickness. Our model fits\nthe overall light curve during 18.5 years well, including epochs of reversal of\nmain and secondary eclipse depths. The disk radius cyclically change around the\ntidal radius, decoupled from changes in the mass transfer rate or system\nbrightness, suggesting that viscous delay might explain the non-immediate\nresponse. Although the disk is large and fills a large fraction of the hot star\nRoche lobe, Lindblad resonance are far beyond the disk, excluding viscous\ndissipation as a major source of photometric variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 23:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Instead of using the conventional axis-angle parameterization, dual\nquaternions allow designing the visual servoing task in a more compact manner\nand provide robustness to manipulator singularities. Given an object point\ncloud, LoCoMo generates a ranked list of grasp and pre-grasp poses, which are\nused as desired poses for visual servoing. Whenever the object moves (tracked\nby visual marker tracking), the desired pose updates automatically. For this,\ncapitalising on the dual quaternion spatial distance error, we propose a\ndynamic grasp re-ranking metric to select the best feasible grasp for the\nmoving object.

However, to introduce the notion\nof the octonionic para-linearity we encounter an insurmountable obstacle. That\nis, the axiom $$\\left\\langle pu ,u\\right\\rangle=p\\left\\langle u\n,u\\right\\rangle$$ for any octonion $p$ and element $u\\in H$ introduced by\nGoldstine and Horwitz in 1964 can not be interpreted as a property to be obeyed\nby the octonionic para-linear maps. In this article, we solve this critical\nproblem by showing that this axiom is in fact non-independent from others. This\nenables us to initiate the study of octonionic para-linear maps. We can thus\nestablish the octonionic Riesz representation theorem which, up to isomorphism,\nidentifies two octonionic Hilbert spaces with one being the dual of the other.\nThe dual space consists of continuous left \\almost linear functionals and it\nbecomes a right $\\O$-module under the multiplication defined in terms of the\nsecond associators which measures the failure of $\\O$-linearity.

Our\nTDIR analysis uses Bayesian methods designed to ultimately be included in the\nLISA data model as part of a \"Global Fit\" analysis pipeline. Including TDIR as\npart of the Global Fit produces GW inferences which are marginalized over\nuncertainty in the spacecraft separations and allows for independent estimation\nof the spacecraft orbits. We demonstrate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\ninferences of the six time-independent delays required in the rigidly rotating\napproximation of the spacecraft configuration (TDI 1.5) using simulated data.\nThe MCMC uses fractional delay interpolation (FDI) to digitally delay the raw\nphase meter data, and we study the sensitivity of the analysis to the filter\nlength. Varying levels of complexity in the noise covariance matrix are also\nexamined. Delay estimations are found to result in LFN suppression well below\nthe level of secondary noises and constraints on the armlengths to\n$\\mathcal{O}(30)\\ {\\rm cm}$ over the ${\\sim}2.5\\ {\\rm Gm}$ baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 03:45:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 16:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

One desirable\nproperty of deep learning applications with societal impact is fairness (i.e.,\nnon-discrimination). Unfortunately, discrimination might be intrinsically\nembedded into the models due to the discrimination in the training data. As a\ncountermeasure, fairness testing systemically identifies discriminatory\nsamples, which can be used to retrain the model and improve the model's\nfairness. Existing fairness testing approaches however have two major\nlimitations. Firstly, they only work well on traditional machine learning\nmodels and have poor performance (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency) on deep\nlearning models. Secondly, they only work on simple structured (e.g., tabular)\ndata and are not applicable for domains such as text. In this work, we bridge\nthe gap by proposing a scalable and effective approach for systematically\nsearching for discriminatory samples while extending existing fairness testing\napproaches to address a more challenging domain, i.e., text classification.\nCompared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach only employs lightweight\nprocedures like gradient computation and clustering, which is significantly\nmore scalable and effective. Experimental results show that on average, our\napproach explores the search space much more effectively (9.62 and 2.38 times\nmore than the state-of-the-art methods respectively on tabular and text\ndatasets) and generates much more discriminatory samples (24.95 and 2.68 times)\nwithin a same reasonable time.

Most ML approaches focus on\ngeneralization performance on unseen data that are similar to the training data\n(In-Distribution, or IND). However, real world applications and deployments of\nML rarely enjoy the comfort of encountering examples that are always IND. In\nsuch situations, most ML models commonly display erratic behavior on\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) examples, such as assigning high confidence to wrong\npredictions, or vice-versa. Implications of such unusual model behavior are\nfurther exacerbated in the healthcare setting, where patient health can\npotentially be put at risk. It is crucial to study the behavior and robustness\nproperties of models under distributional shift, understand common failure\nmodes, and take mitigation steps before the model is deployed. Having a\nbenchmark that shines light upon these aspects of a model is a first and\nnecessary step in addressing the issue. Recent work and interest in increasing\nmodel robustness in OOD settings have focused more on image modality, while the\nElectronic Health Record (EHR) modality is still largely under-explored. We aim\nto bridge this gap by releasing BEDS-Bench, a benchmark for quantifying the\nbehavior of ML models over EHR data under OOD settings. We use two open access,\nde-identified EHR datasets to construct several OOD data settings to run tests\non, and measure relevant metrics that characterize crucial aspects of a model's\nOOD behavior. We evaluate several learning algorithms under BEDS-Bench and find\nthat all of them show poor generalization performance under distributional\nshift in general. Our results highlight the need and the potential to improve\nrobustness of EHR models under distributional shift, and BEDS-Bench provides\none way to measure progress towards that goal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 05:53:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

The recently developed\nvision transformer (ViT) has achieved promising results on computer vision\ntasks. Compared with CNNs, Image sequentialization is a brand new manner.\nHowever, ViT is limited in its receptive field size and thus lacks local\nattention like CNNs due to the fixed size of its patches, and is unable to\ngenerate multi-scale features to learn discriminative region attention. To\nfacilitate the learning of discriminative region attention without box/part\nannotations, we use the strength of the attention weights to measure the\nimportance of the patch tokens corresponding to the raw images. We propose the\nrecurrent attention multi-scale transformer (RAMS-Trans), which uses the\ntransformer's self-attention to recursively learn discriminative region\nattention in a multi-scale manner. Specifically, at the core of our approach\nlies the dynamic patch proposal module (DPPM) guided region amplification to\ncomplete the integration of multi-scale image patches. The DPPM starts with the\nfull-size image patches and iteratively scales up the region attention to\ngenerate new patches from global to local by the intensity of the attention\nweights generated at each scale as an indicator. Our approach requires only the\nattention weights that come with ViT itself and can be easily trained\nend-to-end. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMS-Trans performs better\nthan concurrent works, in addition to efficient CNN models, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 06:22:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

Further goal is to demonstrate the method's\nfunctionality based on synthetic data serving as reference. For this purpose, a\nfinite element model of the human eye is constructed to synthetically generate\ndisplacement full-fields from different datasets with keratoconus-like\ndegradations. Then, a new approach based on the equilibrium gap method (EGM)\ncombined with a mechanical morphing approach is proposed and used to identify\nthe material parameters from virtual test data sets. In a further step, random\nabsolute noise is added to the virtual test data to investigate the sensitivity\nof the new approach to noise. As a result, the proposed method shows a relevant\naccuracy in identifying material parameters based on displacement full fields.\nAt the same time, the method turns out to work almost in real-time (order of a\nfew minutes on a regular work station) and is thus much faster than inverse\nproblems solved by typical forward approaches. On the other hand, the method\nshows a noticeable sensitivity to rather small noise amplitudes. However,\nanalysis show that the accuracy is sufficient for the identification of\ndiseased tissue properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 09:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

In this work, we identify a critical\nside-effect of pre-training for NMT, which is due to the discrepancy between\nthe training objectives of LM-based pre-training and NMT. Since the LM\nobjective learns to reconstruct a few source tokens and copy most of them, the\npre-training initialization would affect the copying behaviors of NMT models.\nWe provide a quantitative analysis of copying behaviors by introducing a metric\ncalled copying ratio, which empirically shows that pre-training based NMT\nmodels have a larger copying ratio than the standard one. In response to this\nproblem, we propose a simple and effective method named copying penalty to\ncontrol the copying behaviors in decoding.

The transfer location is\ndetermined by the model and can be located at any candidate node in the network\nrather than a static facility defined in advance.

The key\nunderlying idea is that constraints are expressed in terms of velocities\ninstead of positions, which has the algorithmic consequence that optimizations\nover feasible sets at each iteration are replaced with optimizations over\nlocal, sparse convex approximations. In particular, this means that at each\niteration only constraints that are violated are taken into account. The result\nis a simplified suite of algorithms and an expanded range of possible\napplications in machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 11:45:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 13:35:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2022 10:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

Current part-level feature learning\nmethods typically detect vehicle parts via uniform division, outside tools, or\nattention modeling. However, such part features often require expensive\nadditional annotations and cause sub-optimal performance in case of unreliable\npart mask predictions. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised\nPart-Attention Network (PANet) and Part-Mentored Network (PMNet) for Vehicle\nRe-ID. Firstly, PANet localizes vehicle parts via part-relevant channel\nrecalibration and cluster-based mask generation without vehicle part\nsupervisory information. Secondly, PMNet leverages teacher-student guided\nlearning to distill vehicle part-specific features from PANet and performs\nmulti-scale global-part feature extraction. During inference, PMNet can\nadaptively extract discriminative part features without part localization by\nPANet, preventing unstable part mask predictions. We address this Re-ID issue\nas a multi-task problem and adopt Homoscedastic Uncertainty to learn the\noptimal weighing of ID losses. Experiments are conducted on two public\nbenchmarks, showing that our approach outperforms recent methods, which require\nno extra annotations by an average increase of 3.0% in CMC@5 on VehicleID and\nover 1.4% in mAP on VeRi776.

The effect of testing processes on epidemic dynamics depends\non factors underlying implementation, particularly testing intensity and on\nwhom testing is focused. Here, we use a simple model to explore how the\nindividual-level effects of testing might directly impact population-level\nspread. Our model development was motivated by the COVID-19 epidemic, but has\ngeneric epidemiological and testing structures. To the classic SIR framework we\nhave added a per capita testing intensity, and compartment-specific testing\nweights, which can be adjusted to reflect different testing emphases --\nsurveillance, diagnosis, or control. We derive an analytic expression for the\nrelative reduction in the basic reproductive number due to testing,\ntest-reporting and related isolation behaviours. Intensive testing and fast\ntest reporting are expected to be beneficial at the community level because\nthey can provide a rapid assessment of the situation, identify hot spots, and\nmay enable rapid contact-tracing. Direct effects of fast testing at the\nindividual level are less clear, and may depend on how individuals' behaviour\nis affected by testing information. Our simple model shows that under some\ncircumstances both increased testing intensity and faster test reporting can\nreduce the effectiveness of control, and allows us to explore the conditions\nunder which this occurs.

To evaluate the merits of our approach,\nwe performed experiments with variants of VGG and ResNet, on both CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100, and VGG16 on Tiny-ImageNet.The SNN models generated through the\nproposed technique yield SOTA compression ratios of up to 33.4x with no\nsignificant drops in accuracy compared to baseline unpruned counterparts.\nCompared to existing SNN pruning methods, we achieve up to 8.3x higher\ncompression with improved accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 18:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread over 214 countries and\nareas in the world, and has significantly affected every aspect of our daily\nlives. At the time of writing this article, the numbers of infected cases and\ndeaths still increase significantly and have no sign of a well-controlled\nsituation, e.g., as of 13 July 2020, from a total number of around 13.1 million\npositive cases, 571, 527 deaths were reported in the world. Motivated by recent\nadvances and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data in\nvarious areas, this paper aims at emphasizing their importance in responding to\nthe COVID-19 outbreak and preventing the severe effects of the COVID-19\npandemic. We firstly present an overview of AI and big data, then identify the\napplications aimed at fighting against COVID-19, next highlight challenges and\nissues associated with state-of-the-art solutions, and finally come up with\nrecommendations for the communications to effectively control the COVID-19\nsituation. It is expected that this paper provides researchers and communities\nwith new insights into the ways AI and big data improve the COVID-19 situation,\nand drives further studies in stopping the COVID-19 outbreak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 13:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

It is\na condition in which an author loses the ability to produce new work or\nexperiences a creative slowdown. The problem is more difficult in the context\nof poetry than prose, as in the latter case authors need not be very concise\nwhile expressing their ideas, also the various aspects such as rhyme, poetic\nmeters are not relevant for prose. One of the most effective ways to overcome\nthis writing block for poets can be, to have a prompt system, which would help\ntheir imagination and open their minds for new ideas. A prompt system can\npossibly generate one liner, two liner or full ghazals. The purpose of this\nwork is to give an ode to the Urdu, Hindi poets, and helping them start their\nnext line of poetry, a couplet or a complete ghazal considering various factors\nlike rhymes, refrain, and meters. The result will help aspiring poets to get\nnew ideas and help them overcome writer's block by auto-generating pieces of\npoetry using Deep Learning techniques. A concern with creative works like this,\nespecially in the literary context, is to ensure that the output is not\nplagiarized. This work also addresses the concern and makes sure that the\nresulting odes are not exact match with input data using parameters like\ntemperature and manual plagiarism check against input corpus. To the best of\nour knowledge, although the automatic text generation problem has been studied\nquite extensively in the literature, the specific problem of Urdu, Hindi poetry\ngeneration has not been explored much. Apart from developing system to\nauto-generate Urdu, Hindi poetry, another key contribution of our work is to\ncreate a cleaned and preprocessed corpus of Urdu, Hindi poetry (derived from\nauthentic resources) and making it freely available for researchers in the\narea.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 16:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}
