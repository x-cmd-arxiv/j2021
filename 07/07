Instead of treating unstructured\nattributes as unobservables in economic models, quantifying them can be\nimportant to answer interesting economic questions. To propose an analytical\nframework for this type of products, this paper considers one of the simplest\ndesign products -- fonts -- and investigates merger and product differentiation\nusing an original dataset from the world's largest online marketplace for\nfonts. We quantify font shapes by constructing embeddings from a deep\nconvolutional neural network. Each embedding maps a font's shape onto a\nlow-dimensional vector. In the resulting product space, designers are assumed\nto engage in Hotelling-type spatial competition. From the image embeddings, we\nconstruct two alternative measures that capture the degree of design\ndifferentiation. We then study the causal effects of a merger on the merging\nfirm's creative decisions using the constructed measures in a synthetic control\nmethod.

We fit their UV SDSS spectra and analyse their CIV properties\n(e.g., equivalent width, EW; line peak velocity, $\\upsilon_{\\rm peak}$) as a\nfunction of the X-ray photon index and 2-10 keV flux. We confirm the trends of\nCIV $\\upsilon_{\\rm peak}$ and EW with UV luminosity at 2500 angstrom for both\nX-ray weak and X-ray normal quasars, as well as the correlation between X-ray\nweakness and CIV EW.

We\nfind a correlation between the hard X-ray flux and the integrated CIV flux for\nX-ray normal quasars, whilst X-ray weak quasars deviate from the main trend by\nmore than 0.5 dex. We argue that X-ray weakness might be interpreted in a\nstarved X-ray corona picture associated with an ongoing disc-wind phase.

Yet, at the largest UV luminosities\n(>10$^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$), there will still be an ample reservoir of ionising\nphotons that can explain the excess CIV emission observed in the X-ray weak\nquasars with respect to normal sources of similar X-ray luminosities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

Toward\nincreasingly lower redshifts, WISE AGN host galaxies have systematically lower\nspecific SFRs, relative to those of normal star forming galaxies, likely due to\ndecreased cold gas fractions and the time delay between global star formation\nand AGN triggering. Finally, WISE AGN obscuration is not strongly correlated\nwith AGN bolometric luminosity but shows a significant negative correlation\nwith Eddington ratio.

There are at least two modes\nof inference used to justify two-sample tests. One is usual superpopulation\ninference assuming that units are independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.) samples from some superpopulation; the other is finite population\ninference that relies on the random assignments of units into different groups.\nWhen randomization is actually implemented, the latter has the advantage of\navoiding distributional assumptions on the outcomes. In this paper, we focus on\nfinite population inference for censored outcomes, which has been less explored\nin the literature. Moreover, we allow the censoring time to depend on treatment\nassignment, under which exact permutation inference is unachievable. We find\nthat, surprisingly, the usual logrank test can also be justified by\nrandomization. Specifically, under a Bernoulli randomized experiment with\nnon-informative i.i.d. censoring, the logrank test is asymptotically valid for\ntesting Fisher's null hypothesis of no treatment effect on any unit. The\nasymptotic validity of the logrank test does not require any distributional\nassumption on the potential event times. We further extend the theory to the\nstratified logrank test, which is useful for randomized block designs and when\ncensoring mechanisms vary across strata. In sum, the developed theory for the\nlogrank test from finite population inference supplements its classical theory\nfrom usual superpopulation inference, and helps provide a broader justification\nfor the logrank test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 19:29:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 17:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

Open questions are how to differentiate chaotic signals from\nstochastic ones, and how to quantify nonlinear and/or high-order temporal\ncorrelations. Here we propose a new technique to reliably address both\nproblems. Our approach follows two steps: first, we train an artificial neural\nnetwork (ANN) with flicker (colored) noise to predict the value of the\nparameter, $\\alpha$, that determines the strength of the correlation of the\nnoise. To predict $\\alpha$ the ANN input features are a set of probabilities\nthat are extracted from the time series by using symbolic ordinal analysis.\nThen, we input to the trained ANN the probabilities extracted from the time\nseries of interest, and analyze the ANN output. We find that the $\\alpha$ value\nreturned by the ANN is informative of the temporal correlations present in the\ntime series. To distinguish between stochastic and chaotic signals, we exploit\nthe fact that the difference between the permutation entropy (PE) of a given\ntime series and the PE of flicker noise with the same $\\alpha$ parameter is\nsmall when the time series is stochastic, but it is large when the time series\nis chaotic. We validate our technique by analysing synthetic and empirical time\nseries whose nature is well established. We also demonstrate the robustness of\nour approach with respect to the length of the time series and to the level of\nnoise. We expect that our algorithm, which is freely available, will be very\nuseful to the community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 19:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

They\nare often used to filter out expensive accesses to a remote set S for negative\nqueries (that is, a query x not in S). Filters have one-sided errors: on a\nnegative query, a filter may say \"present\" with a tunable false-positve\nprobability of epsilon. Correctness is traded for space: filters only use log\n(1/\\epsilon) + O(1) bits per element.\n  The false-positive guarantees of most filters, however, hold only for a\nsingle query. In particular, if x is a false positive of a filter, a subsequent\nquery to x is a false positive with probability 1, not epsilon. With this in\nmind, recent work has introduced the notion of an adaptive filter. A filter is\nadaptive if each query has false positive epsilon, regardless of what queries\nwere made in the past. This requires \"fixing\" false positives as they occur.\n  Adaptive filters not only provide strong false positive guarantees in\nadversarial environments but also improve performance on query practical\nworkloads by eliminating repeated false positives.\n  Existing work on adaptive filters falls into two categories. First, there are\npractical filters based on cuckoo filters that attempt to fix false positives\nheuristically, without meeting the adaptivity guarantee. Meanwhile, the broom\nfilter is a very complex adaptive filter that meets the optimal theoretical\nbounds.\n  In this paper, we bridge this gap by designing a practical, provably adaptive\nfilter: the telescoping adaptive filter. We provide theoretical false-positive\nand space guarantees of our filter, along with empirical results where we\ncompare its false positive performance against state-of-the-art filters. We\nalso test the throughput of our filters, showing that they achieve comparable\nperformance to similar non-adaptive filters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 19:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

These arms are dexterous and high-dimensional; however, the\ninterfaces people must use to control their robots are low-dimensional.\nConsider teleoperating a 7-DoF robot arm with a 2-DoF joystick. The robot is\nhelping you eat dinner, and currently you want to cut a piece of tofu. Today's\nrobots assume a pre-defined mapping between joystick inputs and robot actions:\nin one mode the joystick controls the robot's motion in the x-y plane, in\nanother mode the joystick controls the robot's z-yaw motion, and so on. But\nthis mapping misses out on the task you are trying to perform! Ideally, one\njoystick axis should control how the robot stabs the tofu and the other axis\nshould control different cutting motions. Our insight is that we can achieve\nintuitive, user-friendly control of assistive robots by embedding the robot's\nhigh-dimensional actions into low-dimensional and human-controllable latent\nactions. We divide this process into three parts. First, we explore models for\nlearning latent actions from offline task demonstrations, and formalize the\nproperties that latent actions should satisfy. Next, we combine learned latent\nactions with autonomous robot assistance to help the user reach and maintain\ntheir high-level goals. Finally, we learn a personalized alignment model\nbetween joystick inputs and latent actions.

In a fault-tolerant packing, any job is replicated\ninto f+1 servers, for some integer f > 1, so that the failure of up to f\nservers does not interrupt service. We build over a practical model introduced\nby Li and Tang [SPAA 2017] in which each job of load $x$ has a primary replica\nof load $x$ and $f$ standby replicas, each of load $x/\\eta$, where $\\eta >1$ is\na parameter of the problem. Upon failure of up to $f$ servers, any primary\nreplica in a failed bin should be replaced by one of its standby replicas so\nthat the extra load of the new primary replica does not cause an overflow in\nits bin. We study a general setting in which bins might fail while the input is\nstill being revealed. Our main contribution is an algorithm, named\nHarmonic-Stretch, which maintains fault-tolerant packings under this general\nsetting. We prove that Harmonic-Stretch has an asymptotic competitive ratio of\nat most 1.75. This is an improvement over the best existing asymptotic\ncompetitive ratio 2 of an algorithm by Li and Tang [TPDS 2020], which works\nunder a model in which bins fail only after all items are packed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 22:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

To address this, we propose an\nimage complexity-guided network compression technique for biomedical image\nsegmentation. Given any resource constraints, our framework utilizes data\ncomplexity and network architecture to quickly estimate a compressed model\nwhich does not require network training.

Thus, one may choose a\nsolution that meets both the network size and segmentation accuracy\nrequirements. Finally, the mapping is used to determine the convolutional\nlayer-wise multiplicative factor for generating a compressed network.

We first examine whether an $m = 1$\nperturbation (lopsidedness) in the halo potential could be a mechanism creating\nsuch kinematical asymmetry. To do so, we fit a theoretical rotational velocity\nassociated with an $m = 1$ perturbation in the halo potential model to the\nobserved data via a $\\chi-$squared minimization method.

To this end, most animals use the sub-second excitable and\nmultistable dynamics of a neuromuscular system. Here, studying an animal\nwithout neurons or muscles, we report analogous excitable and multistable\ndynamics embedded in the physics of a 'walking' cilium. We define a 'walking\ncilium' as a phenomena where the locomotive force is generated through contact\nwith a substrate which is periodically reset by steps in the direction of\nmotion. We begin by showing that cilia can walk without specialized gait\ncontrol and identify the characteristic scales of spatio-temporal height\nfluctuations of the tissue. With the addition of surface interaction, we\nconstruct a low-order dynamical model of this single-cilium sub-unit. In\naddition to studying the dynamics of a single cilium in isolation, we\nsubsequently examine collections of these walking cilia. En route to an\nemergent model for ciliary walking, we demonstrate the limits of substrate\nmediated synchronization between cilia. In the desynchronized limit, our model\nshows evidence of localized multi-stability mediated by the crosstalk between\nlocomotive forcing and height. The out-of-equilibrium mechanics -- which govern\nthis emergent excitable bistability -- directly control the locomotive forcing\nof a walking cilia. This direct coupling bypasses the role of the synaptic\njunctions between neurons and muscles.

We first carry out a series of pilot experiments to show\ndisentangling such conjunctions can lead to persistent performance improvement.\nThen, based on these findings, we propose Disentangled Dense Object Detector\n(DDOD), in which simple and effective disentanglement mechanisms are designed\nand integrated into the current state-of-the-art dense object detectors.\nExtensive experiments on MS COCO benchmark show that our approach can lead to\n2.0 mAP, 2.4 mAP and 2.2 mAP absolute improvements on RetinaNet, FCOS, and ATSS\nbaselines with negligible extra overhead. Notably, our best model reaches 55.0\nmAP on the COCO test-dev set and 93.5 AP on the hard subset of WIDER FACE,\nachieving new state-of-the-art performance on these two competitive benchmarks.\nCode is available at https://github.com/zehuichen123/DDOD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 00:52:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 11:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

E-PixelHop consists\nof the following steps. First, to decouple the color channels for a color\nimage, we apply principle component analysis and project RGB three color\nchannels onto two principle subspaces which are processed separately for\nclassification. Second, to address the importance of multi-scale features, we\nconduct pixel-level classification at each hop with various receptive fields.\nThird, to further improve pixel-level classification accuracy, we develop a\nsupervised label smoothing (SLS) scheme to ensure prediction consistency.\nForth, pixel-level decisions from each hop and from each color subspace are\nfused together for image-level decision. Fifth, to resolve confusing classes\nfor further performance boosting, we formulate E-PixelHop as a two-stage\npipeline. In the first stage, multi-class classification is performed to get a\nsoft decision for each class, where the top 2 classes with the highest\nprobabilities are called confusing classes. Then,we conduct a binary\nclassification in the second stage. The main contributions lie in Steps 1, 3\nand 5.We use the classification of the CIFAR-10 dataset as an example to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the above-mentioned key components of\nE-PixelHop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 01:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

First, we use epipolar-plane images to\nestimate sub-pixel disparity at a sparse set of pixels. To find sparse points\nefficiently, we propose an entropy-based refinement approach to a line estimate\nfrom a limited set of oriented filter banks. Next, to estimate the diffusion\ndirection away from sparse points, we optimize constraints at these points via\nour bidirectional diffusion method. This resolves the ambiguity of which\nsurface the edge belongs to and reliably separates depth from texture edges,\nallowing us to diffuse the sparse set in a depth-edge and occlusion-aware\nmanner to obtain accurate dense depth maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 01:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

These supervised methods require a large amount of\nannotated data to train deep neural networks to ensure the generalization\nability on the unseen test set. In this paper, we introduce a\nmeta-learning-based method for few-shot 3D shape segmentation where only a few\nlabeled samples are provided for the unseen classes. To achieve this, we treat\nthe shape segmentation as a point labeling problem in the metric space.\nSpecifically, we first design a meta-metric learner to transform input shapes\ninto embedding space and our model learns to learn a proper metric space for\neach object class based on point embeddings. Then, for each class, we design a\nmetric learner to extract part-specific prototype representations from a few\nsupport shapes and our model performs per-point segmentation over the query\nshapes by matching each point to its nearest prototype in the learned metric\nspace. A metric-based loss function is used to dynamically modify distances\nbetween point embeddings thus maximizes in-part similarity while minimizing\ninter-part similarity. A dual segmentation branch is adopted to make full use\nof the support information and implicitly encourages consistency between the\nsupport and query prototypes. We demonstrate the superior performance of our\nproposed on the ShapeNet part dataset under the few-shot scenario, compared\nwith well-established baseline and state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 01:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

Owing to their excellent locally\ncontextual modeling ability, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been\nproven to be a powerful feature extractor in HS image classification. However,\nCNNs fail to mine and represent the sequence attributes of spectral signatures\nwell due to the limitations of their inherent network backbone. To solve this\nissue, we rethink HS image classification from a sequential perspective with\ntransformers, and propose a novel backbone network called \\ul{SpectralFormer}.\nBeyond band-wise representations in classic transformers, SpectralFormer is\ncapable of learning spectrally local sequence information from neighboring\nbands of HS images, yielding group-wise spectral embeddings.

Such is the case of circadian and infradian\nseizure patterns observed in epilepsy. In this paper we explore a new\nimplantable stimulator that implements chronotherapy as a feedforward input to\nsupplement both open-loop and closed-loop methods. This integrated algorithm\nallows for stimulation to be adjusted to the ultradian, circadian and infradian\npatterns observed in patients through slowly-varying temporal adjustments of\nstimulation and algorithm sub-components, while also enabling adaption of\nstimulation based on immediate physiological needs such as a breakthrough\nseizure or change of posture. Embedded physiological sensors in the stimulator\ncan be used to refine the baseline stimulation circadian pattern as a \"digital\nzeitgeber\". This approach is tested on a canine with severe drug-resistant\nidiopathic generalized epilepsy exhibiting a diurnal pattern correlated with\nsleep-wake cycles. Prior to implantation, the canine's cluster seizures evolved\nto status epilepticus (SE) and required emergency pharmacological intervention.\nThe cranially-mounted system was fully-implanted bilaterally into the\ncentromedian nucleus of the thalamus. Using time-based modulation,\nthalamocortical rhythm-specific tuning of frequency parameters as well as\nfast-adaptive modes based on activity, the canine experienced no further SE\nevents post-implant as of the time of writing (seven months). Importantly, no\nsignificant cluster seizures have been observed either, allowing the reduction\nof rescue medication. The use of chronotherapy as a feedforward signal to\naugment adaptive neurostimulators could prove a useful method in conditions\nwhere sensitivity to temporal patterns are characteristics of the disease\nstate, providing a novel mechanism for tailoring a more patient-specific\ntherapy approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 03:18:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 02:48:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 00:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

Among the rich literature on this topic, agent-based and\ndomain-specific simulations can capture complex dynamics and subgroup\ninteraction, but optimizing over such simulations can be computationally and\nalgorithmically challenging. Bayesian approaches, such as Gaussian processes\n(GPs), can be used to learn a computationally tractable approximation to the\nunderlying dynamics but typically neglect the detailed information about\nsubgroups in the complicated system. We attempt to find the best of both worlds\nby proposing the idea of decomposed feedback, which captures group-based\nheterogeneity and dynamics.

In this paper, we propose a novel task named Semi-supervised\nSource Hypothesis Transfer (SSHT), which performs domain adaptation based on\nsource trained model, to generalize well in target domain with a few\nsupervisions. In SSHT, we are facing two challenges: (1) The insufficient\nlabeled target data may result in target features near the decision boundary,\nwith the increased risk of mis-classification; (2) The data are usually\nimbalanced in source domain, so the model trained with these data is biased.\nThe biased model is prone to categorize samples of minority categories into\nmajority ones, resulting in low prediction diversity.

However, in Galactic\nchemical evolution models, neutron-star mergers alone cannot reproduce the\nobserved element abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor stars, which\nindicates the existence of other sites of r-process nucleosynthesis. These\nsites may be investigated by studying the element abundance patterns of\nchemically primitive stars in the halo of the Milky Way, because these objects\nretain the nucleosynthetic signatures of the earliest generation of stars. Here\nwe report the element abundance pattern of the extremely metal-poor star SMSS\nJ200322.54-114203.3. We observe a large enhancement in r-process elements, with\nvery low overall metallicity. The element abundance pattern is well matched by\nthe yields of a single 25-solar-mass magnetorotational hypernova. Such a\nhypernova could produce not only the r-process elements, but also light\nelements during stellar evolution, and iron-peak elements during explosive\nnuclear burning. Hypernovae are often associated with long-duration gamma-ray\nbursts in the nearby Universe. This connection indicates that similar\nexplosions of fast-spinning strongly magnetized stars occurred during the\nearliest epochs of star formation in our Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 04:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Most of the previous papers about cost-sharing connection games\naddressed this cost-sharing function.

The AMI equation for external flows shares this key property\nwith the so-called FIK relation for internal flows [Fukagata et al. 2002, Phys.\nFluids, \\textbf{14}, L73-L76]. Without a geometrically imposed boundary layer\nthickness, the length scale in the Reynolds number for the AMI equation may be\nchosen freely. After a brief demonstration using Falkner-Skan boundary layers,\nthe AMI equation is applied as a diagnostic tool on four transitional and\nturbulent boundary layer DNS datasets. Regions of negative wall-normal velocity\nare shown to play a key role in limiting the peak skin friction during the late\nstages of transition, and the relative strengths of terms in the AMI equation\nbecome independent of the transition mechanism a very short distance into the\nfully-turbulent regime. The AMI equation establishes an intuitive, extensible\nframework for interpreting the impact of turbulence and flow control strategies\non boundary layer skin friction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 07:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

Such a quadrupole is due to the magnetic\nflux tubes in the stellar convection zone, unevenly distributed in longitude\nand persisting for many stellar rotations as observed in young late-type stars.\nThe rotation period of the host star evolves from its shortest value on the\nzero-age main sequence to longer periods due to the loss of angular momentum\nthrough a magnetized wind. If the stellar rotation period comes close to twice\nthe orbital period of the planet, the quadrupole leads to a spin-orbit\nresonance that excites oscillations of the star-planet separation. As a\nconsequence, a strong tidal dissipation is produced inside the planet. We\nillustrate the operation of the mechanism by modeling the evolution of the\nstellar rotation and of the innermost planetary orbit in the cases of CoRoT-7,\nKepler-78, and K2-141 whose present orbital periods range between 0.28 and 0.85\ndays. If the spin-orbit resonance occurs, the maximum power dissipated inside\nthe planets ranges between $10^{18}$ and $10^{19}$ W, while the total\ndissipated energy is of the order of $10^{30}-10^{32}$ J over a time interval\nas short as $(1-4.5) \\times 10^{4}$ yr. Such a huge heating over a so short\ntime interval produces a complete melting of the planetary interiors and may\nshut off their hydromagnetic dynamos. These may initiate a successive phase of\nintense internal heating owing to unipolar magnetic star-planet interactions\nand affect the composition and the escape of their atmospheres, producing\neffects that could be observable during the entire lifetime of the planets\n[abridged abstract].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 07:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

However, its\nadversarial susceptibility in image caption generation is under-explored. We\nstudy adversarial examples for vision and language models, which typically\nadopt an encoder-decoder framework consisting of two major components: a\nConvolutional Neural Network (i.e., CNN) for image feature extraction and a\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) for caption generation. In particular, we\ninvestigate attacks on the visual encoder's hidden layer that is fed to the\nsubsequent recurrent network. The existing methods either attack the\nclassification layer of the visual encoder or they back-propagate the gradients\nfrom the language model. In contrast, we propose a GAN-based algorithm for\ncrafting adversarial examples for neural image captioning that mimics the\ninternal representation of the CNN such that the resulting deep features of the\ninput image enable a controlled incorrect caption generation through the\nrecurrent network. Our contribution provides new insights for understanding\nadversarial attacks on vision systems with language component. The proposed\nmethod employs two strategies for a comprehensive evaluation.

The resulting architecture provides\nspatial representations of both noiseless and noisy data as Gaussian mixtures\nwith closed form expressions for variance which provides an estimator of local\nerror.

This has the potential to improve traffic efficiency. CAVs face\nadditional challenges in their driving, however, when they interact with\nhuman-driven vehicles (HDVs) in mixed-traffic environments due to the\nuncertainty in human's driving behavior e.g. larger reaction times, perception\nerrors, etc. While a lot of research has investigated the impact of CAVs on\ntraffic safety and efficiency at different penetration rates, all have assumed\neither perfect communication or very simple scenarios with imperfect\ncommunication.

The link scheduling problem is closely related to the independent sets\nof the periodic hypergraph induced by the network model.

In this paper, a sequence of directed graphs of\na finite size called scheduling graphs are derived to provide an explicit\ncharacterization of the rate region of link scheduling. A collision-free\nschedule is equivalent to a path in a scheduling graph, and the rate region is\nequal to the convex hull of all the rate vectors associated with the cycles of\na scheduling graph.

Nevertheless, for the\nmajority of channels, finding a closed-form capacity expression remains an open\nchallenge. This is because it requires to carry out two formidable tasks a) the\ncomputation of the mutual information between the channel input and output, and\nb) its maximization with respect to the signal distribution at the channel\ninput. In this paper, we address both tasks. Inspired by implicit generative\nmodels, we propose a novel cooperative framework to automatically learn the\nchannel capacity, for any type of memory-less channel. In particular, we\nfirstly develop a new methodology to estimate the mutual information directly\nfrom a discriminator typically deployed to train adversarial networks, referred\nto as discriminative mutual information estimator (DIME). Secondly, we include\nthe discriminator in a cooperative channel capacity learning framework,\nreferred to as CORTICAL, where a discriminator learns to distinguish between\ndependent and independent channel input-output samples while a generator learns\nto produce the optimal channel input distribution for which the discriminator\nexhibits the best performance. Lastly, we prove that a particular choice of the\ncooperative value function solves the channel capacity estimation problem.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed method offers high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 09:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

From the perspective\nof chemical kinetics, autocatalysts show a regime of super-linear growth. Given\na chemical reaction network, however, it is not at all straightforward to\nidentify species that are autocatalytic in the sense that there is a\nsub-network that takes $X$ as input and produces more than one copy of $X$ as\noutput. The difficulty arises from the need to distinguish autocatalysis e.g.\nfrom the superposition of a cycle that consumes and produces equal amounts of\n$X$ and a pathway that produces $X$. To deal with this issue, a number of\ncompeting notions, such as exclusive autocatalysis and autocatalytic cycles,\nhave been introduced. A closer inspection of concepts and their usage by\ndifferent authors shows, however, that subtle differences in the definitions\noften makes conceptually matching ideas difficult to bring together formally.\nIn this contribution we make some of the available approaches comparable by\ntranslating them into a common formal framework that uses integer hyperflows as\na basis to study autocatalysis in large chemical reaction networks.

Videoconferencing portrays valuable non-verbal\ncommunication and face expression cues, but usually requires a front-facing\ncamera. Using a frontal camera in a hands-free setting when a person is on the\nmove is impractical. Even holding a mobile phone camera in the front of the\nface while sitting for a long duration is not convenient. To overcome these\nissues, we propose a low-cost wearable egocentric camera setup that can be\nintegrated into smart glasses. Our goal is to mimic a classical video call, and\ntherefore, we transform the egocentric perspective of this camera into a front\nfacing video. To this end, we employ a conditional generative adversarial\nneural network that learns a transition from the highly distorted egocentric\nviews to frontal views common in videoconferencing. Our approach learns to\ntransfer expression details directly from the egocentric view without using a\ncomplex intermediate parametric expressions model, as it is used by related\nface reenactment methods. We successfully handle subtle expressions, not easily\ncaptured by parametric blendshape-based solutions, e.g., tongue movement, eye\nmovements, eye blinking, strong expressions and depth varying movements. To get\ncontrol over the rigid head movements in the target view, we condition the\ngenerator on synthetic renderings of a moving neutral face. This allows us to\nsynthesis results at different head poses. Our technique produces temporally\nsmooth video-realistic renderings in real-time using a video-to-video\ntranslation network in conjunction with a temporal discriminator. We\ndemonstrate the improved capabilities of our technique by comparing against\nrelated state-of-the art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 09:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

In this scenario, the\nelectromagnetic field generated by the axion-photon coupling can be assumed to\nbe driven by equivalent electrical charge and current densities. These\ndensities have been inserted in the general BI-RME 3D equations, which express\nthe RF electromagnetic field existing within a cavity as an integral involving\nthe Dyadic Green functions of the cavity (under Coulomb gauge) as well as such\ndensities. This method is able to take into account any arbitrary spatial and\ntemporal variation of both magnitude and phase of the axion field. Next, we\nhave obtained a simple network driven by the axion current source, which\nrepresents the coupling between the axion field and the resonant modes of the\ncavity. With this approach, it is possible to calculate the extracted and\ndissipated RF power as a function of frequency along a broad band and without\nCauchy-Lorentz approximations, obtaining the spectrum of the electromagnetic\nfield generated in the cavity, and dealing with modes relatively close to the\naxion resonant mode. Moreover, with this technique we have a complete knowledge\nof the signal extracted from the cavity, not only in magnitude but also in\nphase. This can be an interesting issue for future analysis where the axion\nphase is an important parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 10:49:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:57:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 15:40:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 17:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

It is very challenging\nto classify a large and heterogeneous collection of data, which require\nimproved information processing methods to organize text. To classify large\nsize of corpus, one common approach is to use hierarchical text classification,\nwhich aims to classify textual data in a hierarchical structure. Several\napproaches have been proposed to tackle classification of text but most of the\nresearch has been done on English language. This paper proposes a deep learning\nmodel for hierarchical text classification of news in Urdu language -\nconsisting of 51,325 sentences from 8 online news websites belonging to the\nfollowing genres: Sports; Technology; and Entertainment. The objectives of this\npaper are twofold: (1) to develop a large human-annotated dataset of news in\nUrdu language for hierarchical text classification; and (2) to classify Urdu\nnews hierarchically using our proposed model based on LSTM mechanism named as\nHierarchical Multi-layer LSTMs (HMLSTM). Our model consists of two modules:\nText Representing Layer, for obtaining text representation in which we use\nWord2vec embedding to transform the words to vector and Urdu Hierarchical LSTM\nLayer (UHLSTML) an end-to-end fully connected deep LSTMs network to perform\nautomatic feature learning, we train one LSTM layer for each level of the class\nhierarchy. We have performed extensive experiments on our self created dataset\nnamed as Urdu News Dataset for Hierarchical Text Classification (UNDHTC). The\nresult shows that our proposed method is very effective for hierarchical text\nclassification and it outperforms baseline methods significantly and also\nachieved good results as compare to deep neural model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 11:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

It is natural to derive\ngenerative models and hallucinate training samples for unseen classes based on\nthe knowledge learned from the seen samples. However, most of these models\nsuffer from the `generation shifts', where the synthesized samples may drift\nfrom the real distribution of unseen data. In this paper, we conduct an\nin-depth analysis on this issue and propose a novel Generation Shifts\nMitigating Flow (GSMFlow) framework, which is comprised of multiple conditional\naffine coupling layers for learning unseen data synthesis efficiently and\neffectively. In particular, we identify three potential problems that trigger\nthe generation shifts, i.e., semantic inconsistency, variance decay, and\nstructural permutation and address them respectively. First, to reinforce the\ncorrelations between the generated samples and the respective attributes, we\nexplicitly embed the semantic information into the transformations in each of\nthe coupling layers. Second, to recover the intrinsic variance of the\nsynthesized unseen features, we introduce a visual perturbation strategy to\ndiversify the intra-class variance of generated data and hereby help adjust the\ndecision boundary of the classifier. Third, to avoid structural permutation in\nthe semantic space, we propose a relative positioning strategy to manipulate\nthe attribute embeddings, guiding which to fully preserve the inter-class\ngeometric structure.

Our results show that high-frequency attenuation that\ncommences during periods of optical pulsating aurora typically continues for\n2-4 hr after the camera stops imaging at dawn.We then use the radar data to\ndetermine EEP occurrence rates as a function of magnetic local time (MLT) using\na database of 555 events detected in 2011. EEP occurrence rates are highest in\nthe early morning sector and lowest at around 15:00-18:00 MLT. The postmidnight\nand morning sector occurrence rates exhibit significant seasonal variations,\nreaching approximately 50% in the winter and 15% in the summer, whereas no\nseasonal variations were observed in other MLT sectors. The mean event lifetime\ndetermined from the radar data was 2.25 hr, and 10% of events had lifetimes\nexceeding 5 hr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 12:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

These equations can be understood as defining a change of variables\nin the functional integral for the noise, with which the physical degrees of\nfreedom are in equilibrium. The absolute value of the Jacobian of this change\nof variables therefore repackages the fluctuations. This provides a new way of\nrelating the number and properties of scalar fields with the consistent and\ncomplete description of their fluctuations and is another way of understanding\nthe relevance of supersymmetry, which, in this way, determines the minimal\nnumber of real scalar fields (e.g. two in two dimensions, four in three\ndimensions and eight in four dimensions), in order for the system to be\nconsistently closed. The classical action of the scalar fields, obtained in\nthis way, contains a surface term and a remainder, in addition to the canonical\nkinetic and potential terms. The surface term describes possible flux\ncontributions in the presence of boundaries, while the remainder describes\nadditional interactions, that can't be absorbed in a redefinition of the\ncanonical terms. It is, however, through its combination with the surface term\nthat the noise fields can be recovered, in all cases. However their identities\ncan be subject to anomalies. What is of particular, practical, interest is the\nidentification of the noise fields, as functions of the scalars, whose\ncorrelation functions are Gaussian. This implies new identities, between the\nscalars, that can be probed in real, or computer, experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 13:11:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

Most existing methods pursue the spatial accuracy\nthrough learning the high-resolution (HR) representation from input images.

In this paper, we propose\na design paradigm for cost-effective network with LR representation for\nefficient pose estimation, named FasterPose. Whereas the LR design largely\nshrinks the model complexity, yet how to effectively train the network with\nrespect to the spatial accuracy is a concomitant challenge. We study the\ntraining behavior of FasterPose, and formulate a novel regressive cross-entropy\n(RCE) loss function for accelerating the convergence and promoting the\naccuracy. The RCE loss generalizes the ordinary cross-entropy loss from the\nbinary supervision to a continuous range, thus the training of pose estimation\nnetwork is able to benefit from the sigmoid function.

In general, it first estimates a GP model\nbased on a few observations from the true response and then employs this model\nto guide the search, aiming to quickly locate the global optimum. Despite its\nsuccessful applications, it has several limitations that may hinder its broader\nusage. First, building an accurate GP model can be difficult and\ncomputationally expensive, especially when the response function is multi-modal\nor varies significantly over the design space. Second, even with an appropriate\nmodel, the search process can be trapped in suboptimal regions before moving to\nthe global optimum due to the excessive effort spent around the current best\nsolution. In this work, we adopt the Additive Global and Local GP (AGLGP) model\nin the optimization framework. The model is rooted in the inducing-points-based\nGP sparse approximations and is combined with independent local models in\ndifferent regions. With these properties, the AGLGP model is suitable for\nmulti-modal responses with relatively large data sizes.

Next, a local model in\nthe selected region is fit to guide detailed search within this region. The\nalgorithm then switches back to the global step when a good local solution is\nfound. The global and local natures of CGLO enable it to enjoy the benefits of\nboth global and local search to efficiently locate the global optimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 13:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

Then, we propose a GNN model which takes\nadvantage of the message passing scheme by propagating messages based on degree\nstatistics and brain region connectivities. Extensive experiments on two\nreal-world disease datasets (HIV and Bipolar) demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 13:49:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 17:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

One key issue in this field is to effectively manipulate these states\nand control topological phase transitions. Here, by systematic angle-dependent\ntransport measurements, we reveal a magnetization-tuned topological quantum\nphase transition from Chern insulator to magnetic insulator with gapped Dirac\nsurface states in MnBi2Te4 devices. Specifically, as the magnetic field is\ntilted away from the out-of-plane direction by around 40-60 degrees, the Hall\nresistance deviates from the quantization value and a colossal, anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance is detected. The theoretical analyses based on modified\nLandauer-Buttiker formalism show that the field-tilt-driven switching from\nferromagnetic state to canted antiferromagnetic state induces a topological\nquantum phase transition from Chern insulator to magnetic insulator with gapped\nDirac surface states in MnBi2Te4 devices.

Studies showed that knowledge distillation (KD), especially the\nmean-teacher framework which is more robust to perturbations, can help mitigate\nthe over-fitting effect. However, directly transferring KD from computer vision\nto medical image classification yields inferior performance as medical images\nsuffer from higher intra-class variance and class imbalance. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel Categorical Relation-preserving Contrastive\nKnowledge Distillation (CRCKD) algorithm, which takes the commonly used\nmean-teacher model as the supervisor. Specifically, we propose a novel\nClass-guided Contrastive Distillation (CCD) module to pull closer positive\nimage pairs from the same class in the teacher and student models, while\npushing apart negative image pairs from different classes. With this\nregularization, the feature distribution of the student model shows higher\nintra-class similarity and inter-class variance. Besides, we propose a\nCategorical Relation Preserving (CRP) loss to distill the teacher's relational\nknowledge in a robust and class-balanced manner. With the contribution of the\nCCD and CRP, our CRCKD algorithm can distill the relational knowledge more\ncomprehensively. Extensive experiments on the HAM10000 and APTOS datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed CRCKD method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 13:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

We introduce a\ntheoretical framework in which biases and variability emerge from a trade-off\nbetween Bayesian inference and a cognitive cost of carrying out probabilistic\ncomputations. We consider two forms of the cost: a precision cost and an\nunpredictability cost; these penalize beliefs that are less entropic and less\ndeterministic, respectively. We apply our framework to the case of a Bernoulli\nvariable: the bias of a coin is inferred from a sequence of coin flips.\nTheoretical predictions are qualitatively different depending on the form of\nthe cost. A precision cost induces overestimation of small probabilities on\naverage and a limited memory of past observations, and, consequently, a\nfluctuating bias. An unpredictability cost induces underestimation of small\nprobabilities and a fixed bias that remains appreciable even for nearly\nunbiased observations. The case of a fair (equiprobable) coin, however, is\nsingular, with non-trivial and slow fluctuations of the inferred bias.

In specific to\nPb-16Li eutectic, a candidate breeder material, such coatings are being\nactively investigated for their criticality in addressing various\nfunctionalities. For such applications, a candidate coating must be\ndemonstrated for its compatibility with corrosive media, high operational\ntemperatures and integrity of electrical-insulation over long durations without\nsubstantial degradation. At present, no relevant in-situ insulation resistance\n(IR) data is available for performance assessment of coated substrates within\nPbLi environment. To address this shortfall, an experimental study was\nperformed at IPR towards application of high-purity alumina coatings on SS-316L\nsubstrates and further rigorous validation in static PbLi environment. The\nadopted coating process required a low-temperature heat treatment (< 430C) and\ncould yield average coating thicknesses in the range of 100-500 micron. Coated\nsamples were validated for their electrical insulation integrity in static PbLi\nover two test campaigns for continuous durations of over 700 h and 1360 h,\nincluding thermal cycling, at operational temperature between 300C-400C.\nEstimated volumetric electrical-resistivity remained of the order of 109-1011\nohm-cm without significant degradation. In-situ estimations of thermal derating\nfactors establish excellent electrical-insulation characteristics after long\nterm exposure to liquid PbLi.

To this end, we first study three\nspecial cases of the dynamic IRS beamforming,namely user-adaptive IRS\nbeamforming, UL-adaptive IRS beamforming, and static IRS beamforming,by\ncharacterizing their optimal performance relationships and proposing\ncorresponding algorithms. Interestingly, it is rigorously proved that the\nlatter two cases achieve the same throughput, thus helping halve the number of\nIRS phase shifts to be optimized and signalling overhead practically required\nfor UL-adaptive IRS beamforming. Then, we propose a general optimization\nframework for dynamic IRS beamforming, which is applicable for any given number\nof IRS phase-shift vectors available.

Our\ngoal is to develop an agent that tracks the best expert over episodes. We\nintroduce the Empirical Divergence-based UCB (ED-UCB) algorithm in this setting\nwhere the agent does not have any knowledge of the expert policies or changes\nin context distributions.

We\nhave analyzed the optical spectra with homogeneous atmospheric models to derive\nsurface parameters of the binary members from a direct wavelength space\ndecomposition and independently measured the atmospheric properties of the cool\ncompanion. The two independent methods reached consistent results, which,\namended with constraints from spectral energy distributions provided a subdwarf\nmass.

The He abundance of the hot subdwarf is the lowest among the\nknown heavy-metal sdOB stars. The presence of fluorine implies that SB 744 was\nonce a hierarchical triple system and the inner binary has merged in the near\npast. As an alternative scenario, single-star evolution through late core\nhelium flash and atmospheric mixing can also produce the observed fluorine\nabundances. The atmospheric metal over-abundances currently observed are\nperhaps the results of a combination of mixing processes during formation and\nradiative support.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 15:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

This dialogue\npolicy recurrently generates explicit system actions as a both word-level and\nhigh-level policy. As a result, DORA is clearly optimized during both SL and RL\nsteps by using an explicit system action policy that considers an efficient\ncontext instead of the entire dialogue history.

Both are lineage markers (inherited from just one\nparent), which presents different interpretation challenges compared with\nstandard autosomal DNA profiles (inherited from both parents), for which\nrecombination increases profile diversity and weakens the effects of\nrelatedness. We review approaches to the evaluation of lineage marker profiles\nfor forensic identification, focussing on the key roles of profile mutation\nrate and relatedness. Higher mutation rates imply fewer individuals matching\nthe profile of an alleged contributor, but they will be more closely related.\nThis makes it challenging to evaluate the possibility that one of these\nmatching individuals could be the true source, because relatedness may make\nthem more plausible alternative contributors than less-related individuals, and\nthey may not be well mixed in the population. These issues reduce the\nusefulness of profile databases drawn from a broad population: the larger the\npopulation, the lower the profile relative frequency because of lower\nrelatedness with the alleged contributor. Many evaluation methods do not\nadequately take account of relatedness, but its effects have become more\npronounced with the latest generation of high-mutation-rate Y profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 15:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

Recently,\nnon-autoregressive TTS (NAR-TTS) models have been shown to be more efficient\nwith the parallel decoding process. However, these NAR-TTS models rely on\nphoneme-level durations to generate a hard alignment between the text and the\nspectrogram. Obtaining duration labels, either through forced alignment or\nknowledge distillation, is cumbersome. Furthermore, hard alignment based on\nphoneme expansion can degrade the naturalness of the synthesized speech. In\ncontrast, the proposed model of VAENAR-TTS is an end-to-end approach that does\nnot require phoneme-level durations. The VAENAR-TTS model does not contain\nrecurrent structures and is completely non-autoregressive in both the training\nand inference phases. Based on the VAE architecture, the alignment information\nis encoded in the latent variable, and attention-based soft alignment between\nthe text and the latent variable is used in the decoder to reconstruct the\nspectrogram.

The dissipationless Hall current requires time-reversal symmetry\nbreaking. For over a century it has either been ascribed to externally applied\nmagnetic field and referred to as the ordinary Hall effect, or ascribed to\nspontaneous non-zero total internal magnetization (ferromagnetism) and referred\nto as the anomalous Hall effect.

Recent advances in experiments have shown that this theoretical\npicture is too idealized to capture experimental observations.

As the\norigin of coherent control comes from the spin part of the wavefunction it is\nsufficient to use radio frequency coupling to achieve the superposition state.\nOur results show that interferences can be used as a resource for the coherent\ncontrol of photo-chemical reactions. The approach is general and can be\nemployed to study a wide spectra of chemical reactions in the ultracold regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 23:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

We\ninvestigate whether machine learning models can predict subsequent serum\nlactate changes.\n  Methods. We investigated serum lactate change prediction using the MIMIC-III\nand eICU-CRD datasets in internal as well as external validation of the eICU\ncohort on the MIMIC-III cohort. Three subgroups were defined based on the\ninitial lactate levels: i) normal group (<2 mmol/L), ii) mild group (2-4\nmmol/L), and iii) severe group (>4 mmol/L).

These are\nmatrix solutions of the polyadic braid equations (which differ from the\ngeneralized Yang-Baxter equations). Such gates support a special kind of\nmulti-qubit entanglement which can speed up key distribution and accelerate the\nexecution of algorithms. Ternary braiding gates acting on three qubit states\nare studied in detail. We also consider exotic non-invertible gates which can\nbe related to qubit loss, and define partial identities (which can be\northogonal), partial unitarity, and partially bounded operators (which can be\nnon-invertible). We define two classes of matrices, the star and circle types,\nand find that the magic matrices (connected with the Cartan decomposition)\nbelong to the star class. The general algebraic structure of the classes\nintroduced here is described in terms of semigroups, ternary and 5-ary groups\nand modules. The higher braid group and its representation by higher braid\noperators are given. Finally, we show that for each multi-qubit state there\nexist higher braiding gates which are not entangling, and the concrete\nconditions to be non-entangling are given for the binary and ternary gates\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 13:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

A model trained with normal data generates a larger restoration\nerror for abnormal data. Whether or not abnormal data is determined by\nobserving the restoration error. It takes a lot of cost and time to obtain\nabnormal data in the industrial field. Therefore the model trains only normal\ndata and detects abnormal data in the inference phase. However, the restoration\narea for the input data of AE is limited in the latent space. To solve this\nproblem, we propose Multiple-hypothesis Autoencoder(MH-AE) model composed of\nseveral decoders. MH-AE model increases the restoration area through contention\nbetween decoders. The proposed method shows that the anomaly detection\nperformance is improved compared to the traditional AE for various input\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 05:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

In the attempt\nto tackle this problem, we presented in this paper a simplified framework that\ncan support to detect the typical air routes between airports based on ADS-B\ndata.

Finally, in order to illustrate the\npotential applications of our proposed framework, an experiment was performed\nusing ADS-B traffic flight data of three different pairs of airports.

Smart card data enables the\nestimation of passenger delays throughout the network and aid in monitoring\nservice performance. Notwithstanding, in order to prioritize measures for\nimproving service reliability and hence reducing passenger delays, it is\nparamount to identify the system components - stations and track segments -\nwhere most passenger delay occurs. To this end, we propose a novel method for\nestimating network passenger delay from individual trajectories. We decompose\nthe delay along a passenger trajectory into its corresponding track segment\ndelay, initial waiting time and transfer delay. We distinguish between two\ndifferent types of passenger delay in relation to the public transit network:\naverage passenger delay and total passenger delay. We employ temporal\nclustering on these two quantities to reveal daily and seasonal regularity in\ndelay patterns of the transit network. The estimation and clustering methods\nare demonstrated on one year of data from Washington metro network. The data\nconsists of schedule information and smart card data which includes\npassenger-train assignment of the metro network for the months of August 2017\nto August 2018.
