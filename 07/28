First, DNNs are known to be too complex that they can\neasily overfit the training data. Second, the selection of the input regressors\nfor system identification is nontrivial. Third, uncertainty quantification of\nthe model parameters and predictions are necessary. The proposed Bayesian\napproach offers a principled way to alleviate the above challenges by marginal\nlikelihood/model evidence approximation and structured group sparsity-inducing\npriors construction. The identification algorithm is derived as an iterative\nregularised optimisation procedure that can be solved as efficiently as\ntraining typical DNNs. Remarkably, an efficient and recursive Hessian\ncalculation method for each layer of DNNs is developed, turning the intractable\ntraining/optimisation process into a tractable one. Furthermore, a practical\ncalculation approach based on the Monte-Carlo integration method is derived to\nquantify the uncertainty of the parameters and predictions. The effectiveness\nof the proposed Bayesian approach is demonstrated on several linear and\nnonlinear system identification benchmarks by achieving good and competitive\nsimulation accuracy.

Adaptive stress testing (AST) is a\nmethod that uses reinforcement learning to find the most likely failure of a\nsystem. AST with a deep reinforcement learning solver has been shown to be\neffective in finding failures across a range of different systems. This\napproach generally involves running many simulations, which can be very\nexpensive when using a high-fidelity simulator.

This high data rate over short transmission distances may\nbe achieved via abundant bandwidth in the terahertz (THz) band. However, THz\nwaves suffer from severe signal attenuation, which may be compensated by the\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology with programmable\nreflecting elements. Meanwhile, the low VR interaction latency may be achieved\nwith the mobile edge computing (MEC) network architecture due to its high\ncomputation capability. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper, we\npropose a MEC-enabled and RIS-assisted THz VR network in an indoor scenario, by\ntaking into account the uplink viewpoint prediction and position transmission,\nMEC rendering, and downlink transmission. We propose two methods, which are\nreferred to as centralized online Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and distributed\nFederated Averaging (FedAvg), to predict the viewpoints of VR users.

In this paper, we define this problem as\ntrajectory-driven traffic bottleneck identification: Given a road network R, a\ntrajectory database T , find a representative set of seed edges of size K of\ntraffic bottlenecks that influence the highest number of road segments not in\nthe seed set.

Most\npapers on sum graphs consider combinatorial questions like the minimum number\nof isolated vertices that need to be added to a given graph to make it a sum\ngraph. In this paper, we initiate the study of sum graphs from the viewpoint of\ncomputational complexity. Notice that every $n$-vertex sum graph can be\nrepresented by a sorted list of $n$ positive integers where edge queries can be\nanswered in $O(\\log n)$ time. Therefore, limiting the size of the vertex labels\nalso upper-bounds the space complexity of storing the graph in the database.\n  We show that every $n$-vertex, $m$-edge, $d$-degenerate graph can be made a\nsum graph by adding at most $m$ isolated vertices to it, such that the size of\neach vertex label is at most $O(n^2d)$. This enables us to store the graph\nusing $O(m\\log n)$ bits of memory. For sparse graphs (graphs with $O(n)$\nedges), this matches the trivial lower bound of $\\Omega(n\\log n)$. Since planar\ngraphs and forests have constant degeneracy, our result implies an upper bound\nof $O(n^2)$ on their label size. The previously best known upper bound on the\nlabel size of general graphs with the minimum number of isolated vertices was\n$O(4^n)$, due to Kratochv\\'il, Miller & Nguyen.

Traditional\nintrusive projection-based model reduction approaches utilize symplectic\nGalerkin projection to construct Hamiltonian ROMs by projecting Hamilton's\nequations of the full model onto a symplectic subspace. This symplectic\nprojection requires complete knowledge about the full model operators and full\naccess to manipulate the computer code. In contrast, the proposed Hamiltonian\noperator inference approach embeds the physics into the operator inference\nframework to develop a data-driven model reduction method that preserves the\nunderlying symplectic structure. Our method exploits knowledge of the\nHamiltonian functional to define and parametrize a Hamiltonian ROM form which\ncan then be learned from data projected via symplectic projectors. The proposed\nmethod is gray-box in that it utilizes knowledge of the Hamiltonian structure\nat the partial differential equation level, as well as knowledge of spatially\nlocal components in the system. However, it does not require access to computer\ncode, only data to learn the models.

This fluxoid-induced\nstabilization mechanism has analoges in symmetric S-QD-S Josephson junctions at\nphase $\\pi$, and can naturally lead to patterns of near-zero modes weakly\ndispersing with parameters in all but the zero-th lobe of the LP spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 12:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

In this\nwork, we investigate the survival and growth of cold gas in such a turbulent,\nmulti-phase medium using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. Similar\nto previous work simulating coherent flow (winds), we find that cold gas\nsurvives if the cooling time of the mixed gas is shorter than the\nKelvin-Helmholtz time of the cold gas clump (with some weak additional Mach\nnumber dependence). However, there are important differences. Near the survival\nthreshold, the long-term evolution is highly stochastic, and subject to the\nexistence of sufficiently large clumps. In a turbulent flow, the cold gas\ncontinuously fragments, enhancing its surface area. This leads to exponential\nmass growth, with a growth time given by the geometric mean of the cooling and\nthe mixing time. The fragmentation process leads to a large number of small\ndroplets which follow a scale-free $\\mathrm{d} N/\\mathrm{d} m \\propto m^{-2}$\nmass distribution, and dominate the area covering fraction. Thus, whilst\nsurvival depends on the presence of large `clouds', these in turn produce a\n`fog' of smaller droplets tightly coupled to the hot phase which are probed by\nabsorption line spectroscopy. We show with the aid of Monte-Carlo simulations\nthat the simulated mass distribution emerges naturally due to the proportional\nmass growth and the coagulation of droplets.

In this setting, the standard\nevaluation protocol is to use existing action recognition datasets(e.g. UCF101)\nand randomly split the classes into seen and unseen. However, most recent work\nbuilds on representations pre-trained on the Kinetics dataset, where classes\nlargely overlap with classes in the zero-shot evaluation datasets. As a result,\nclasses which are supposed to be unseen, are present during supervised\npre-training, invalidating the condition of the zero-shot setting. A similar\nconcern was previously noted several years ago for image based zero-shot\nrecognition but has not been considered by the zero-shot action recognition\ncommunity. In this paper, we propose a new split for true zero-shot action\nrecognition with no overlap between unseen test classes and training or\npre-training classes.

In our extensive analysis, we find that our\nTruZesplits are significantly harder than comparable random splits as nothing\nis leaking from pre-training, i.e. unseen performance is consistently lower,up\nto 8.9% for zero-shot action recognition.

The target set contains the relevant item and a set of negative\nitems that are sampled from the full item set. Two well-known strategies to\nsample negative items are uniform random sampling and sampling by popularity to\nbetter approximate the item frequency distribution in the dataset. Most\nrecently published papers on sequential item recommendation rely on sampling by\npopularity to compare the evaluated models. However, recent work has already\nshown that an evaluation with uniform random sampling may not be consistent\nwith the full ranking, that is, the model ranking obtained by evaluating a\nmetric using the full item set as target set, which raises the question whether\nthe ranking obtained by sampling by popularity is equal to the full ranking. In\nthis work, we re-evaluate current state-of-the-art sequential recommender\nmodels from the point of view, whether these sampling strategies have an impact\non the final ranking of the models. We therefore train four recently proposed\nsequential recommendation models on five widely known datasets. For each\ndataset and model, we employ three evaluation strategies.

Then we evaluate all models on a target set sampled by the\ntwo different sampling strategies, uniform random sampling and sampling by\npopularity with the commonly used target set size of 100, compute the model\nranking for each strategy and compare them with each other. Additionally, we\nvary the size of the sampled target set. Overall, we find that both sampling\nstrategies can produce inconsistent rankings compared with the full ranking of\nthe models.

PLIC reconstructs interfaces from a scalar\nfield that represents the volume fraction of each phase in each computational\ncell. Given the volume fraction and interface normal, the location of a linear\ninterface is uniquely defined. For a cubic computational cell (3D), the\nposition of the planar interface is determined by intersecting the cube with a\nplane, such that the volume of the resulting truncated polyhedron cell is equal\nto the volume fraction.

In an attempt to expedite this process, an active area\nof research involves automating cell classification through use of deep\nlearning-based techniques. In practice, a large amount of data is required to\naccurately train these deep learning models. However, due to the sparse human\ncell datasets currently available, the performance of these models is typically\nlow. This study investigates the feasibility of using few-shot learning-based\ntechniques to mitigate the data requirements for accurate training. The study\nis comprised of three parts: First, current state-of-the-art few-shot learning\ntechniques are evaluated on human cell classification. The selected techniques\nare trained on a non-medical dataset and then tested on two out-of-domain,\nhuman cell datasets. The results indicate that, overall, the test accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art techniques decreased by at least 30% when transitioning from a\nnon-medical dataset to a medical dataset. Second, this study evaluates the\npotential benefits, if any, to varying the backbone architecture and training\nschemes in current state-of-the-art few-shot learning techniques when used in\nhuman cell classification. Even with these variations, the overall test\naccuracy decreased from 88.66% on non-medical datasets to 44.13% at best on the\nmedical datasets. Third, this study presents future directions for using\nfew-shot learning in human cell classification. In general, few-shot learning\nin its current state performs poorly on human cell classification.

SpyTag spontaneously reacts with SpyCatcher to form an\nisopeptide bond, with which the target enzyme forms a close ring structure.

The simulations showed that the interface\nbetween SpyTag/SpyCatcher and lichenase is different from that found by\ngeometric matching method and highlighted key mutations that affect the\nintensity of interactions at the interface and might have effect on the thermal\nresilience of the enzyme. Our calculations provided new insights into the\nrational designs in the SpyRing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 01:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

To begin, we study the color correction problem\nfrom the standpoint of the camera's image signal processor (ISP). A camera's\nISP is hardware that applies a series of in-camera image processing and color\nmanipulation steps, many of which are nonlinear in nature, to render the\ninitial sensor image to its final photo-finished representation saved in the\n8-bit standard RGB (sRGB) color space. As white balance (WB) is one of the\nmajor procedures applied by the ISP for color correction, this thesis presents\ntwo different methods for ISP white balancing. Afterward, we discuss another\nscenario of correcting and editing image colors, where we present a set of\nmethods to correct and edit WB settings for images that have been improperly\nwhite-balanced by the ISP. Then, we explore another factor that has a\nsignificant impact on the quality of camera-rendered colors, in which we\noutline two different methods to correct exposure errors in camera-rendered\nimages. Lastly, we discuss post-capture auto color editing and manipulation. In\nparticular, we propose auto image recoloring methods to generate different\nrealistic versions of the same camera-rendered image with new colors. Through\nextensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our methods provide superior\nsolutions compared to existing alternatives targeting color correction, color\nenhancement, and color editing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 01:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-29"}

Since the\ngeneralizability of deep neural networks is difficult to control, existing\nmodels such as autoencoder do not work well. In this work, we interpret the\nreconstruction of an image as a divide-and-assemble procedure. Surprisingly, by\nvarying the granularity of division on feature maps, we are able to modulate\nthe reconstruction capability of the model for both normal and abnormal\nsamples. That is, finer granularity leads to better reconstruction, while\ncoarser granularity leads to poorer reconstruction. With proper granularity,\nthe gap between the reconstruction error of normal and abnormal samples can be\nmaximized. The divide-and-assemble framework is implemented by embedding a\nnovel multi-scale block-wise memory module into an autoencoder network.\nBesides, we introduce adversarial learning and explore the semantic latent\nrepresentation of the discriminator, which improves the detection of subtle\nanomaly.

For\nthat, we consider the diffraction of electromagnetic (EM) waves by an extended,\nweakly aspherical, gravitating object. We account for the static gravitational\nfield of such a lens by representing its exterior potential in the most generic\nform, expressed via an infinite set of symmetric trace free (STF) tensor\nmultipole mass moments. This yields the most general form of the gravitational\nphase shift, which allows for a comprehensive description of the optical\nproperties of a generic gravitational lens. We found that at each order of the\nSTF moments, the gravitational phase shift is characterized by only two\nparameters: a magnitude and a rotation angle that characterize the\ncorresponding caustics, which form in the point spread function (PSF) of the\nlens. Both of these parameters are uniquely expressed in terms of the\ntransverse-trace free (TT) projections of the multipole moments on the lens\nplane.

In this paper, we design a new grid keypoint learning framework,\naiming at a robust and explainable intermediate keypoint representation for\nlong-term efficient video prediction. We have two major technical\ncontributions. First, we detect keypoints by jumping among candidate locations\nin our raised grid space and formulate a condensation loss to encourage\nmeaningful keypoints with strong representative capability. Second, we\nintroduce a 2D binary map to represent the detected grid keypoints and then\nsuggest propagating keypoint locations with stochasticity by selecting entries\nin the discrete grid space, thus preserving the spatial structure of keypoints\nin the longterm horizon for better future frame generation. Extensive\nexperiments verify that our method outperforms the state-ofthe-art stochastic\nvideo prediction methods while saves more than 98% of computing resources. We\nalso demonstrate our method on a robotic-assisted surgery dataset with\npromising results.

The vast majority\nof existing AUC-optimization-based machine learning methods only focus on\nbinary-class cases, while leaving the multiclass cases unconsidered. In this\npaper, we start an early trial to consider the problem of learning multiclass\nscoring functions via optimizing multiclass AUC metrics. Our foundation is\nbased on the M metric, which is a well-known multiclass extension of AUC. We\nfirst pay a revisit to this metric, showing that it could eliminate the\nimbalance issue from the minority class pairs. Motivated by this, we propose an\nempirical surrogate risk minimization framework to approximately optimize the M\nmetric. Theoretically, we show that: (i) optimizing most of the popular\ndifferentiable surrogate losses suffices to reach the Bayes optimal scoring\nfunction asymptotically; (ii) the training framework enjoys an imbalance-aware\ngeneralization error bound, which pays more attention to the bottleneck samples\nof minority classes compared with the traditional $O(\\sqrt{1/N})$ result.\nPractically, to deal with the low scalability of the computational operations,\nwe propose acceleration methods for three popular surrogate loss functions,\nincluding the exponential loss, squared loss, and hinge loss, to speed up loss\nand gradient evaluations. Finally, experimental results on 11 real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 05:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-29"}

This paper describes a configuration space model of\nimmune function, where directed chemical potentials of the system constitute a\nspace of interactions. In the physical sense, the humoral adaptive immune\nsystem adjusts the chemical potential of all available antigenic molecules by\ntuning the chemical potential and organizing the network hierarchy of its\nsensor-effector molecules, antibodies. The coupling of sensors and effectors\nallows the system to adjust the thermodynamic activity of antigens and\nantibodies, while network organization helps minimize chemical potentials and\nmaximize diversity. Mathematically the system couples the variance of Gaussian\ndistributed interaction energies in its interaction space to the exponentially\ndistributed chemical potentials of its effector molecules to maintain its\nstationary state. This process creates a scale-free network in interaction\nspace, where absolute thermodynamic activity corresponds to node degree. In the\nthermodynamic interpretation, the system is an ensemble carrying out {mu}N\nwork, adjusting chemical potentials according to the changes in the chemical\npotentials of the surroundings. The validity of the model is supported by\nidentifying an interaction flexibility index, the corresponding variables in\nthermodynamics and network science, and by confirming its applicability to the\nhumoral immune system.

This novel\ninstrumental polarization calibration pipeline overcomes the limitations of\nLPCAL, a conventional calibration tool used in the previous M87 studies. The\nresulting images show a compact linear polarization structure with its peak\nnearly coincident with the total intensity peak, which is significantly\ndifferent from the results of previous studies. The core linear polarization is\ncharacterized as fractional polarization of $\\sim0.2-0.6$% and polarization\nangles of $\\sim66-92^\\circ$, showing moderate variability.

Our system\nbenefits from advances in the fields of face detection and face recognition to\nachieve long-term tracking, and is particularly unconstrained to the motion and\nocclusions of people. It follows a tracking-by-detection approach, combining a\nfast short-term visual tracker with a novel online tracklet reconnection\nstrategy grounded on rank-based face verification. The proposed rank-based\nconstraint favours higher inter-class distance among tracklets, and reduces the\npropagation of errors due to wrong reconnections. Additionally, a correction\nmodule is included to correct past assignments with no extra computational\ncost. We present a series of experiments introducing novel specialized metrics\nfor the evaluation of long-term tracking capabilities, and publicly release a\nvideo dataset with 10 manually annotated videos and a total length of 8' 54\".\nOur findings validate the robustness of each of the proposed modules, and\ndemonstrate that, in these challenging contexts, our approach yields up to 50%\nlonger tracks than state-of-the-art deep learning trackers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 11:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-29"}

Accurate diagnosis of the disease at\nearly stage is critical for precision disease control and management. Current\nfarm practices in crop disease diagnosis are based on manual visual inspection,\nwhich is costly, time consuming, subject to individual bias. Recent advances in\nimaging sensors (e.g. RGB, multiple spectral and hyperspectral cameras), remote\nsensing and machine learning offer the opportunity to address this challenge.\nParticularly, hyperspectral imagery (HSI) combining with machine learning/deep\nlearning approaches is preferable for accurately identifying specific plant\ndiseases because the HSI consists of a wide range of high-quality reflectance\ninformation beyond human vision, capable of capturing both spectral-spatial\ninformation. The proposed method considers the potential disease specific\nreflectance radiation variance caused by the canopy structural diversity,\nintroduces the multiple capsule layers to model the hierarchical structure of\nthe spectral-spatial disease attributes with the encapsulated features to\nrepresent the various classes and the rotation invariance of the disease\nattributes in the feature space. We have evaluated the proposed method with the\nreal UAV-based HSI data under the controlled field conditions. The\neffectiveness of the hierarchical features has been quantitatively assessed and\ncompared with the existing representative machine learning/deep learning\nmethods.

In this paper, we\npresent an LF magnetoelectric mechanical transmitting and receiving antenna\npair to significantly miniaturize the dimension of LF antennas.

We then propose BATS, an unsupervised learning-based system to predict\npatch correctness by checking patch Behaviour Against failing Test\nSpecification. BATS exploits deep representation learning models for code and\npatches: for a given failing test case, the yielded embedding is used to\ncompute similarity metrics in the search for historical similar test cases in\norder to identify the associated applied patches, which are then used as a\nproxy for assessing generated patch correctness.

Then, after collecting a large dataset of 1278 plausible patches\n(written by developers or generated by some 32 APR tools), we use BATS to\npredict correctness: BATS achieves an AUC between 0.557 to 0.718 and a recall\nbetween 0.562 and 0.854 in identifying correct patches. Compared against\nprevious work, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art\nperformance in patch correctness prediction, without the need for large labeled\npatch datasets in contrast with prior machine learning-based approaches. While\nBATS is constrained by the availability of similar test cases, we show that it\ncan still be complementary to existing approaches: used in conjunction with a\nrecent approach implementing supervised learning, BATS improves the overall\nrecall in detecting correct patches.

We present a new approach to\ncharacterize equilibria via a convexification technique using the Nikaido-Isoda\nfunction. To any given instance of the GNEP, we construct a set of convexified\ninstances and show that a feasible strategy profile is an equilibrium for the\noriginal instance if and only if it is an equilibrium for any convexified\ninstance and the convexified cost functions coincide with the initial ones. We\nfurther develop this approach along three dimensions. We first show that for\nquasi-linear models, where a convexified instance exists in which for fixed\nstrategies of the opponent players, the cost function of every player is linear\nand the respective strategy space is polyhedral, the convexification reduces\nthe GNEP to a standard (non-linear) optimization problem. Secondly, we derive\ntwo complete characterizations of those GNEPs for which the convexification\nleads to a jointly constrained or a jointly convex GNEP, respectively. These\ncharacterizations require new concepts related to the interplay of the convex\nhull operator applied to restricted subsets of feasible strategies and may be\ninteresting on their own.

Except a special condition, the motion is in general\nquasi periodic nature even in the absence of damping. Another interesting\nfinding is that the magnetic field may induce an asymmetric splitting of the\nspectrum of the output signal with two peaks in the case of a driven damped two\ndimensional harmonic oscillator.

The main idea is the reformulation of the 2-D problem\naccording to addition theorem for Hankel functions that appear in Green\nfunction of 2-D homogeneous media. In this regard, recursive formulas in\nspatial frequency domain are derived and the scattering field is rewritten into\ninward and outward components and, then, the primary 2-D problem can be solved\nusing 1D FFT in the stabilized biconjugate-gradient fast Fourier transform\nBCGS-FFT algorithm. Because the emerging method obtains 1D FFT over a circle,\nthere is no need to expand an object region by zero padding, whereas it is\nnecessary for conventional 2D FFT approach. Therefore, the method saves lots of\nmemory and time over the conventional approach. other interesting aspect of the\nproposed method is that the field on a circle outside a scattering object, can\nbe calculated efficiently using an analytical formula. This is, particularly,\nattractive in electromagnetic inverse scattering problems and microwave\nimaging. The numerical examples for 2-D TM problems demonstrate merits of\nproposed technique in terms of the accuracy and computational efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 11:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-29"}

(In\nfact, existing solutions also incur an extra factor of $1+\\epsilon$ in the\nstretch for weighted graphs, and an additional factor of $\\log^{O(1)}n$ in the\nspace.) The only existing solution of the second type uses $n^{1/2 -\nO(1/\\kappa)}$ passes over the stream (for space $O(n^{1+1/\\kappa})$), and\napplies only to unweighted graphs.\n  In this paper we show that $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate single-source shortest\npaths can be computed in this setting with $\\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/\\kappa})$ space\nusing just \\emph{constantly} many passes in unweighted graphs, and\npolylogarithmically many passes in weighted graphs (assuming $\\epsilon$ and\n$\\kappa$ are constant).

These adaptations are made\neither via attention or by attenuating or enhancing various\nlow-frequency/high-frequency signals, as needed for the task at hand.

Based on this interpretation, we present an\neigendecomposition based approach and propose EigenNetwork models that improve\nthe performance of GNNs on heterophilic graphs. Performance improvement is\nachieved by learning flexible graph adaptation functions that modulate the\neigenvalues of the graph.

To improve the noise robustness, we try to\nintegrate CNNs with wavelet by replacing the common down-sampling (max-pooling,\nstrided-convolution, and average pooling) with discrete wavelet transform\n(DWT). We firstly propose general DWT and inverse DWT (IDWT) layers applicable\nto various orthogonal and biorthogonal discrete wavelets like Haar, Daubechies,\nand Cohen, etc., and then design wavelet integrated CNNs (WaveCNets) by\nintegrating DWT into the commonly used CNNs (VGG, ResNets, and DenseNet).\nDuring the down-sampling, WaveCNets apply DWT to decompose the feature maps\ninto the low-frequency and high-frequency components. Containing the main\ninformation including the basic object structures, the low-frequency component\nis transmitted into the following layers to generate robust high-level\nfeatures. The high-frequency components are dropped to remove most of the data\nnoises. The experimental results show that %wavelet accelerates the CNN\ntraining, and WaveCNets achieve higher accuracy on ImageNet than various\nvanilla CNNs. We have also tested the performance of WaveCNets on the noisy\nversion of ImageNet, ImageNet-C and six adversarial attacks, the results\nsuggest that the proposed DWT/IDWT layers could provide better noise-robustness\nand adversarial robustness. When applying WaveCNets as backbones, the\nperformance of object detectors (i.e., faster R-CNN and RetinaNet) on COCO\ndetection dataset are consistently improved.

This is a nontrivial issue since a squeezed bath\nfield cannot reach equilibration and yet, as this work shows, the system\noscillator indeed can, which is a necessary condition for FDRs. We discuss\nthree different settings: A) The bath field essentially remains in a squeezed\nthermal state throughout, whose squeeze parameter is a mode- and\ntime-independent constant. This situation is often encountered in quantum\noptics and quantum thermodynamics. B) The field is initially in a thermal\nstate, but subjected to a parametric process leading to mode- and\ntime-dependent squeezing. This scenario is met in cosmology and dynamical\nCasimir effect. The squeezing in the bath in both types of processes will\naffect the oscillator's nonequilibrium evolution. We show that at late times it\napproaches equilibration, which warrants the existence of an FDR. The trait of\nsqueezing is marked by the oscillator's effective equilibrium temperature, and\nthe factor in the FDR is only related to the stationary component of bath's\nnoise kernel. Setting C) is more subtle: A finite system-bath coupling strength\ncan set the oscillator in a squeezed state even the bath field is stationary\nand does not engage in any parametric process. The squeezing of the system in\nthis case is in general time-dependent but becomes constant when the internal\ndynamics is fully relaxed. We begin with comments on the broad range of\nphysical processes involving squeezed thermal baths and end with some remarks\non the significance of FDRs in capturing the essence of quantum backreaction in\nnonequilibrium systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 13:18:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 03:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

We first\ndetermined the optimal symmetry of the simplest CeFe11Ti structure model. We\nthen observed that the calculated magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE)\ncorrelates with the magnetic moment, which in turn strongly depends on the\nchoice of the exchange-correlation potential. MAE, magnetic moments, and\nmagnetic hardness were determined for all compositions considered.

The power and mechanisms of language as a means of cultural\nlearning, however, are not well understood, and as a result, current AI systems\ndo not leverage language as a means for cultural knowledge transmission.

We developed a suite of complex tasks in the form of minimalist-style\nvideo games, which we deployed in an iterated learning paradigm. Human\nparticipants were limited to only two attempts (two lives) to beat each game\nand were allowed to write a message to a future participant who read the\nmessage before playing. Knowledge accumulated gradually across generations,\nallowing later generations to advance further in the games and perform more\nefficient actions. Multigenerational learning followed a strikingly similar\ntrajectory to individuals learning alone with an unlimited number of lives.\nSuccessive generations of learners were able to succeed by expressing distinct\ntypes of knowledge in natural language: the dynamics of the environment,\nvaluable goals, dangerous risks, and strategies for success.

Sgr A* provides us with a prototype of a\nlow-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN), but interstellar scattering and\nthe resolution limits of our instruments have limited our understanding of the\nemission sites in its inner accretion flow. The temporal variability of Sgr A*\ncan help us understand whether we see a plasma outflow or inflow in the region\nclose to the black hole. In this work, we look at a comprehensive set of\nmulti-epoch data recorded with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to\nunderstand the persistence of the time lag relations that have been found in\nprevious radio observations of Sgr A*. We analyse 8 epochs of data, observed in\nSpring 2015, each of which has a frequency coverage from 18 to 48 GHz. We\ncross-correlate the calibrated light curves across twelve frequency subbands.\nWe also generate synthetic data with the appropriate variability\ncharacteristics and use it to study the detectability of time lag relations in\ndata with this sampling structure. We find that the variability amplitude\nincreases with frequency. We see positive time lag slopes across all subbands\nin five out of eight epochs, with the largest slopes in the cases where a clear\nextremum in flux density is present. Three epochs show lag slopes close to\nzero. With the synthetic data analysis we show that these results are explained\nby a persistent lag relation of $\\sim$40 min/cm that covers the bulk of the\nvariability, with at most 2 percent of the total flux density in an\nuncorrelated variability component. Together with the size-frequency relation\nand inclination constraints this indicates an outflow velocity with $\\gamma\n\\beta$ = 1.5, consistent with predictions of jet models for Sgr A*.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-29"}

In this paper, we address this problem by introducing eXtreme\nFunction Labeling (XFL), an extreme multi-label learning approach to selecting\nappropriate labels for binary functions. XFL splits function names into tokens,\ntreating each as an informative label akin to the problem of tagging texts in\nnatural language. We relate the semantics of binary code to labels through\nDEXTER, a novel function embedding that combines static analysis-based features\nwith local context from the call graph and global context from the entire\nbinary. We demonstrate that XFL/DEXTER outperforms the state of the art in\nfunction labeling on a dataset of 10,047 binaries from the Debian project,\nachieving a precision of 83.5%. We also study combinations of XFL with\nalternative binary embeddings from the literature and show that DEXTER\nconsistently performs best for this task.

Though\neffective, the lexical features extracted from the successive word sequence may\nintroduce some noise that has little or no meaningful content. Meanwhile, the\nsyntactic features are usually encoded via graph convolutional networks which\nhave restricted receptive field. To address the above limitations, we propose a\nmulti-scale feature and metric learning framework for relation extraction.\nSpecifically, we first develop a multi-scale convolutional neural network to\naggregate the non-successive mainstays in the lexical sequence. We also design\na multi-scale graph convolutional network which can increase the receptive\nfield towards specific syntactic roles. Moreover, we present a multi-scale\nmetric learning paradigm to exploit both the feature-level relation between\nlexical and syntactic features and the sample-level relation between instances\nwith the same or different classes. We conduct extensive experiments on three\nreal world datasets for various types of relation extraction tasks.

AI is a recently\nintroduced measure which quantifies the difference between the Holevo and the\nSLD scalar bounds, and can be evaluated using only the symmetric logarithmic\nderivative (SLD) operators of the model. At first, we evaluate analytically the\nAI of the most general quantum statistical models involving two-level (qubit)\nand single-mode Gaussian continuous-variable quantum systems, and prove that AI\nis a simple monotonous function of the state purity. Then, we numerically\ninvestigate the same problem for qudits ($d$-dimensional quantum systems, with\n$2 < d \\leq 4$), showing that, while in general AI is not in general a function\nof purity, we have enough numerical evidence to conclude that the maximum\namount of AI is attainable only for quantum statistical models characterized by\na purity larger than $\\mu_{\\sf min} = 1/(d-1)$. In addition, by parametrizing\nqudit states as thermal (Gibbs) states, numerical results suggest that, once\nthe spectrum of the Hamiltonian is fixed, the AI measure is in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the fictitious temperature parameter $\\beta$ characterizing\nthe family of density operators. Finally, by studying in detail the definition\nand properties of the AI measure we find that: i) given a quantum statistical\nmodel, one can readily identify the maximum number of asymptotically\ncompatibile parameters; ii) the AI of a quantum statistical model bounds from\nabove the AI of any sub-model that can be defined by fixing one or more of the\noriginal unknown parameters (or functions thereof), leading to possibly useful\nbounds on the AI of models involving noisy quantum dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 15:16:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 11:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

The primary challenge is to\ncombat catastrophic forgetting of previously-seen IQA datasets (i.e., tasks).\nIn this paper, we present a simple yet effective continual learning method for\nBIQA with improved quality prediction accuracy, plasticity-stability trade-off,\nand task-order/-length robustness. The key step in our approach is to freeze\nall convolution filters of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) for an\nexplicit promise of stability, and learn task-specific normalization parameters\nfor plasticity. We assign each new task a prediction head, and load the\ncorresponding normalization parameters to produce a quality score. The final\nquality estimate is computed by a weighted summation of predictions from all\nheads with a lightweight K-means gating mechanism, without leveraging the\ntest-time oracle. Extensive experiments on six IQA datasets demonstrate the\nadvantages of the proposed method in comparison to previous training techniques\nfor BIQA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 15:21:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 06:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Aim: We proposed a new pipeline to automatically generate AI breast\nultrasound screening reports based on ultrasound images, aiming to assist\ndoctors in improving the efficiency of clinical screening and reducing\nrepetitive report writing. Methods: AI was used to efficiently generate\npersonalized breast ultrasound screening preliminary reports, especially for\nbenign and normal cases which account for the majority. Based on the\npreliminary AI report, doctors then make simple adjustments or corrections to\nquickly generate the final report. The approach has been trained and tested\nusing a database of 4809 breast tumor instances. Results: Experimental results\nindicate that this pipeline improves doctors' work efficiency by up to 90%,\nwhich greatly reduces repetitive work.

In order to avoid the number representation issue and reduce the\nsearch space of feasible solutions, existing works striving for MWP solving\nusually replace real numbers with symbolic placeholders to focus on logic\nreasoning. However, different from common symbolic reasoning tasks like program\nsynthesis and knowledge graph reasoning, MWP solving has extra requirements in\nnumerical reasoning. In other words, instead of the number value itself, it is\nthe reusable numerical property that matters more in numerical reasoning.\nTherefore, we argue that injecting numerical properties into symbolic\nplaceholders with contextualized representation learning schema can provide a\nway out of the dilemma in the number representation issue here. In this work,\nwe introduce this idea to the popular pre-training language model (PLM)\ntechniques and build MWP-BERT, an effective contextual number representation\nPLM.

Specially, the reported tunable metamaterials are composed of arrays of\ninter-jointed unit cells featuring metallic helices, enabling auxetic patterns\nwith a negative Poisson's ratio. The deployable deformation of the\nmetamaterials yields an added degree of freedom with respect to frequency\ntunability through the resultant modification of the electromagnetic\ninteractions between unit cells.

Movement is the primary means by which animals obtain resources and avoid\nhazards. Most movement exhibits directional bias that is related to\nenvironmental features (taxis), such as the location of food patches,\npredators, ocean currents, or wind. Numerous behaviours with directional bias\ncan be characterized by maintaining orientation at an angle relative to the\nenvironmental stimuli (menotaxis), including navigation relative to sunlight or\nmagnetic fields and energy-conserving flight across wind. However, no\nstatistical methods exist to flexibly classify and characterise such\ndirectional bias. 2. We propose a biased correlated random walk model that can\nidentify menotactic behaviours by predicting turning angle as a trade-off\nbetween directional persistence and directional bias relative to environmental\nstimuli without making a priori assumptions about the angle of bias. We apply\nthe model within the framework of a multi-state hidden Markov model (HMM) and\ndescribe methods to remedy information loss associated with coarse\nenvironmental data to improve the classification and parameterization of\ndirectional bias. 3. Using simulation studies, we illustrate how our method\nmore accurately classifies behavioural states compared to conventional\ncorrelated random walk HMMs that do not incorporate directional bias. We\nillustrate the application of these methods by identifying cross wind olfactory\nforaging and drifting behaviour mediated by wind-driven sea ice drift in polar\nbears (Ursus maritimus) from movement data collected by satellite telemetry. 4.\nThe extensions we propose can be readily applied to movement data to identify\nand characterize behaviours with directional bias toward any angle, and open up\nnew avenues to investigate more mechanistic relationships between animal\nmovement and the environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 20:14:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

The fluid is assumed to be characterized\nby a compressible linear viscoelastic model accounting for both the shear and\ncompressional relaxation processes. For small-amplitude vibrations, the\nequations governing the viscoelastic fluid can be linearized, which are then\nsolved by introducing appropriate potential functions. The solid is assumed to\nexhibit a particular material anisotropy, i.e. spherical isotropy, which\nincludes material isotropy as a special case. The equations governing the\nanisotropic solid are solved in spherical coordinates using the state-space\nformalism, which finally establishes two separate transfer relations\ncorrelating the state vectors at the innermost surface with those at the\noutermost surface of the multilayered hollow sphere. By imposing the continuity\nconditions at the fluid-solid interface, two separate analytical characteristic\nequations are derived, which characterize two independent classes of vibration.\nNumerical examples are finally conducted to validate the theoretical derivation\nas well as to investigate the effects of various factors, including fluid\nviscosity and compressibility, fluid viscoelasticity, solid anisotropy and\nsurface effect, as well as solid intrinsic damping, on the vibration\ncharacteristics of the submerged hollow sphere.

The system's scheduler\nuses the estimated WCET to schedule each task of these systems, and failure may\nlead to catastrophic events. It is thus imperative to build provably reliable\nsystems. WCET is available to us in the last stage of systems development when\nthe hardware is available and the application code is compiled on it. Different\nmethodologies measure the WCET, but none of them give early insights on WCET,\nwhich is crucial for system development. If the system designers overestimate\nWCET in the early stage, then it would lead to the overqualified system, which\nwill increase the cost of the final product, and if they underestimate WCET in\nthe early stage, then it would lead to financial loss as the system would not\nperform as expected. This paper estimates early WCET using Deep Neural Networks\nas an approximate predictor model for hardware architecture and compiler. This\nmodel predicts the WCET based on the source code without compiling and running\non the hardware architecture. Our WCET prediction model is created using the\nPytorch framework. The resulting WCET is too erroneous to be used as an upper\nbound on the WCET. However, getting these results in the early stages of system\ndevelopment is an essential prerequisite for the system's dimensioning and\nconfiguration of the hardware setup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 06:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}
