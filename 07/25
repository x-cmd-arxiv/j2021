While conventional human-visual inspection of casting products\nis slow and unproductive in mass productions, an automatic and reliable defect\ndetection not just enhances the quality control process but positively improves\nproductivity. However, casting defect detection is a challenging task due to\ndiversity and variation in defects' appearance. Convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) have been widely applied in both image classification and defect\ndetection tasks. Howbeit, CNNs with frequentist inference require a massive\namount of data to train on and still fall short in reporting beneficial\nestimates of their predictive uncertainty. Accordingly, leveraging the transfer\nlearning paradigm, we first apply four powerful CNN-based models (VGG16,\nResNet50, DenseNet121, and InceptionResNetV2) on a small dataset to extract\nmeaningful features. Extracted features are then processed by various machine\nlearning algorithms to perform the classification task. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that linear support vector machine (SVM) and multi-layer perceptron\n(MLP) show the finest performance in defect detection of casting images.\nSecondly, to achieve a reliable classification and to measure epistemic\nuncertainty, we employ an uncertainty quantification (UQ) technique (ensemble\nof MLP models) using features extracted from four pre-trained CNNs. UQ\nconfusion matrix and uncertainty accuracy metric are also utilized to evaluate\nthe predictive uncertainty estimates. Comprehensive comparisons reveal that UQ\nmethod based on VGG16 outperforms others to fetch uncertainty.

Two mechanisms play an important role for continuum\nemission in flares: hydrogen recombination after sudden ionization at\nchromospheric layers and transportation of the energy radiatively from the\nchromosphere to lower layers in the atmosphere, the so called back-warming. The\naim of the paper is to disentangle between these two mechanisms for the excess\nof Balmer continuum observed in a flare. Methods. We combine the observations\nof Balmer continuum obtained with IRIS (spectra and SJIs 2832 A) and hard X-ray\n(HXR) emission detected by FERMI Gamma Burst Monitor (GBM) during a mini flare.\nCalibrated Balmer continuum is compared to non-LTE radiative transfer flare\nmodels and radiated energy is estimated. Assuming thick target HXR emission, we\ncalculate the energy of non-thermal electrons detected by FERMI GBM and compare\nit to the radiated energy. The favorable argument of a relationship between the\nBalmer continuum excess and the HXR emission is that there is a good time\ncoincidence between both of them. In addition, the shape of the maximum\nbrightness in the 2832 SJIs, which is mainly due to this Balmer continuum\nexcess, is similar to the FERMI/GBM light curve. The electron-beam flux\nestimated from FERMI/GBM is consistent with the beam flux required in non-LTE\nradiative transfer models to get the excess of Balmer continuum emission\nobserved in the IRIS spectra. The low energy input by non thermal electrons\nabove 20 keV is sufficient to produce the enhancement of Balmer continuum\nemission. This could be explained by the topology of the reconnection site. The\nreconnection starts in a tiny bald patch region which is transformed\ndynamically in a X-point current sheet. The size of the interacting region\nwould be under the spatial resolution of the instrument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 16:41:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

GANs generally do not guarantee the existence of a probability\ndensity and are susceptible to mode collapse, while few GANs use likelihood to\nreduce mode collapse. In this paper, we create a GAN-based tail formation model\nfor anomaly detection, the Tail of distribution GAN (TailGAN), to generate\nsamples on the tail of the data distribution and detect anomalies near the\nsupport boundary. Using TailGAN, we leverage GANs for anomaly detection and use\nmaximum entropy regularization. Using GANs that learn the probability of the\nunderlying distribution has advantages in improving the anomaly detection\nmethodology by allowing us to devise a generator for boundary samples, and use\nthis model to characterize anomalies. TailGAN addresses supports with disjoint\ncomponents and achieves competitive performance on images. We evaluate TailGAN\nfor identifying Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data and its performance evaluated on\nMNIST, CIFAR-10, Baggage X-Ray, and OoD data shows competitiveness compared to\nmethods from the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 17:29:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 15:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

We\nassume that the devices exploit different types of sensors to extract and\nprocess the respiration signal. We illustrate B2P for the case of two devices\nthat use respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) and accelerometer\nsensors, respectively. Allowing for different types of sensors in pairing\nallows us to include wearable devices that use a variety of different sensors.\nIn practice, this form of sensor variety creates a number of challenges that\nlimit the ability of the shared-key establishment algorithm to generate\nmatching keys. The two main obstacles are the lack of synchronization across\nthe devices and the need for correct noise-induced mismatches between the\ngenerated key bit-strings.\n  B2P addresses the synchronization challenge by utilizing Change Point\nDetection (CPD) to detect abrupt changes in the respiration signal and consider\ntheir occurrences as synchronizing points. Any potential mismatches are handled\nby optimal quantization and encoding of the respiration signal in order to\nmaximize the error correction rate and minimize the message overheads.\nExtensive evaluation on a dataset collected from 30 volunteers demonstrates\nthat our protocol can generate a secure 256-bit key every 2.85 seconds (around\none breathing cycle). Particular attention is given to secure B2P against\ndevice impersonation attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 19:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

However, a common challenge is low image\nquality arising from undersampling. Deep learning (DL) is an emerging and\npowerful tool in computational imaging for many applications and researchers\nhave applied DL in SPI to achieve higher image quality than conventional\nreconstruction approaches. One outstanding challenge, however, is that the\naccuracy of DL predictions in SPI cannot be assessed in practical applications\nwhere the ground truths are unknown. Here, we propose the use of the Bayesian\nconvolutional neural network (BCNN) to approximate the uncertainty (coming from\nfinite training data and network model) of the DL predictions in SPI. Each\npixel in the predicted result from BCNN represents the parameter of a\nprobability distribution rather than the image intensity value. Then, the\nuncertainty can be approximated with BCNN by minimizing a negative\nlog-likelihood loss function in the training stage and Monte Carlo dropout in\nthe prediction stage. The results show that the BCNN can reliably approximate\nthe uncertainty of the DL predictions in SPI with varying compression ratios\nand noise levels. The predicted uncertainty from BCNN in SPI reveals that most\nof the reconstruction errors in deep-learning-based SPI come from the edges of\nthe image features. The results show that the proposed BCNN can provide a\nreliable tool to approximate the uncertainty of DL predictions in SPI and can\nbe widely used in many applications of SPI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 20:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

We adopt a different approach that\nallows us to write a stochastic solution in the level of a single trajectory\nundergoing resetting. Moments and the autocorrelation functions between any two\ntimes along the trajectory can then be computed directly using the laws of\ntotal expectation. Estimation of autocorrelation functions turns out to be\npivotal for investigating the ergodic properties of various observables for\nthis canonical model. In particular, we investigate two observables (i) sample\nmean which is widely used in economics and (ii)\ntime-averaged-mean-squared-displacement (TAMSD) which is of acute interest in\nphysics. We find that both diffusion and drift-diffusion processes are ergodic\nat the mean level unlike their reset-free counterparts. In contrast, resetting\nrenders ergodicity breaking in the TAMSD while both the stochastic processes\nare ergodic when resetting is absent. We quantify these behaviors with detailed\nanalytical study and corroborate with extensive numerical simulations. The\ncurrent study provides an important baseline that unifies two different\napproaches, used ubiquitously in economics and physics, for studying the\nergodic properties in diffusion with resetting.

However, training a deep learning\nmodel requires a considerable amount of labeled images, which can be expensive\nto obtain as time and effort from clinical practitioners is required. A number\nof publicly available datasets have been built with data from different\nhospitals and clinics. However, using models trained on these datasets for\nlater work on images sampled from a different hospital or clinic might result\nin lower performance. This is due to the distribution mismatch of the datasets,\nwhich include different patient populations and image acquisition protocols.\nThe scarcity of labeled data can also bring a challenge towards the application\nof transfer learning with models trained using these source datasets. In this\nwork, a real world scenario is evaluated where a novel target dataset sampled\nfrom a private Costa Rican clinic is used, with few labels and heavily\nimbalanced data. The use of two popular and publicly available datasets\n(INbreast and CBIS-DDSM) as source data, to train and test the models on the\nnovel target dataset, is evaluated. The use of the semi-supervised deep\nlearning approach known as MixMatch, to leverage the usage of unlabeled data\nfrom the target dataset, is proposed and evaluated. In the tests, the\nperformance of models is extensively measured, using different metrics to\nassess the performance of a classifier under heavy data imbalance conditions.\nIt is shown that the use of semi-supervised deep learning combined with\nfine-tuning can provide a meaningful advantage when using scarce labeled\nobservations.

Many users want to gain followers to increase the visibility\nand reach of their profiles to wide audiences. This has provoked several\nblackmarket services to garner huge attention by providing artificial followers\nvia the network of agreeable and compromised accounts in a collusive manner.\nTheir activity is difficult to detect as the blackmarket services shape their\nbehavior in such a way that users who are part of these services disguise\nthemselves as genuine users.\n  In this paper, we propose DECIFE, a framework to detect collusive users\ninvolved in producing 'following' activities through blackmarket services with\nthe intention to gain collusive followers in return. We first construct a\nheterogeneous user-tweet-topic network to leverage the follower/followee\nrelationships and linguistic properties of a user. The heterogeneous network is\nthen decomposed to form four different subgraphs that capture the semantic\nrelations between the users. An attention-based subgraph aggregation network is\nproposed to learn and combine the node representations from each subgraph. The\ncombined representation is finally passed on to a hypersphere learning\nobjective to detect collusive users.

Specifically, cells at bulging parts\nof a front are exposed to a smaller gradient, which slows them down and\npromotes stability, but they also respond more strongly to the gradient, which\nspeeds them up and promotes instability. We predict that this competition leads\nto chemotactic fingering when sensing is limited at too low chemical\nconcentrations.

In this work we explore the consequences of this instability on\nthe evolution of hierarchical black holes within dense stellar clusters. By\nreducing the spin of individual black holes, superradiance reduce the recoil\nvelocity of merging binary black holes, which, in turn, increases the retention\nfraction of hierarchical merger remnants.

The objective is to minimize a\nglobal function that is a sum of the agents' local loss functions. And the\noptimization is conducted by analog over-the-air model training. Specifically,\neach agent modulates its local gradient onto a set of waveforms and transmits\nto the edge server simultaneously. From the received analog signal the edge\nserver extracts a noisy aggregated gradient which is distorted by the channel\nfading and interference, and uses it to update the global model and feedbacks\nto all the agents for another round of local computing. Since the\nelectromagnetic interference generally exhibits a heavy-tailed intrinsic, we\nuse the $\\alpha$-stable distribution to model its statistic. In consequence,\nthe global gradient has an infinite variance that hinders the use of\nconventional techniques for convergence analysis that rely on second-order\nmoments' existence. To circumvent this challenge, we take a new route to\nestablish the analysis of convergence rate, as well as generalization error, of\nthe algorithm. Our analyses reveal a two-sided effect of the interference on\nthe overall training procedure. On the negative side, heavy tail noise slows\ndown the convergence rate of the model training: the heavier the tail in the\ndistribution of interference, the slower the algorithm converges. On the\npositive side, heavy tail noise has the potential to increase the\ngeneralization power of the trained model: the heavier the tail, the better the\nmodel generalizes. This perhaps counterintuitive conclusion implies that the\nprevailing thinking on interference -- that it is only detrimental to the edge\nlearning system -- is outdated and we shall seek new techniques that exploit,\nrather than simply mitigate, the interference for better machine learning in\nwireless networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2021 05:57:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 13:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

To support aerial user\nequipment (UEs) in the existing cellular networks, one promising approach is to\nassign a portion of the system bandwidth exclusively to the UAV-UEs. This is\nespecially favorable for use cases where a large number of UAV-UEs are\nexploited, e.g., for package delivery close to a warehouse. Although the nearly\nline-of-sight (LoS) channels can result in higher powers received, UAVs can in\nturn cause severe interference to each other in the same frequency band. In\nthis contribution, we focus on the uplink communications of massive\ncellular-connected UAVs. Different power allocation algorithms are proposed to\neither maximize the minimal spectrum efficiency (SE) or maximize the overall SE\nto cope with severe interference based on the successive convex approximation\n(SCA) principle. One of the challenges is that a UAV can affect a large area\nmeaning that many more UAV-UEs must be considered in the optimization problem,\nwhich is essentially different from that for terrestrial UEs. The necessity of\nsingle-carrier uplink transmission further complicates the problem.\nNevertheless, we find that the special property of large coherent bandwidths\nand coherent times of the propagation channels can be leveraged. The\nperformances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated via extensive simulations\nin the full-buffer transmission mode and bursty-traffic mode. Results show that\nthe proposed algorithms can effectively enhance the uplink SEs. This work can\nbe considered the first attempt to deal with the interference among massive\ncellular-connected UAV-UEs with optimized power allocations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2021 06:30:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 17:47:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 12:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

Recently, an\nemerging SNN supervised learning algorithm inspired by backpropagation through\ntime (BPTT) from the domain of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has\nsuccessfully boosted the accuracy of SNNs and helped improve the practicability\nof SNNs. However, current general-purpose processors suffer from low efficiency\nwhen performing BPTT for SNNs due to the ANN-tailored optimization. On the\nother hand, current neuromorphic chips cannot support BPTT because they mainly\nadopt local synaptic plasticity rules for simplified implementation.\n  In this work, we propose H2Learn, a novel architecture that can achieve high\nefficiency for BPTT-based SNN learning which ensures high accuracy of SNNs. At\nthe beginning, we characterized the behaviors of BPTT-based SNN learning.\nBenefited from the binary spike-based computation in the forward pass and the\nweight update, we first design lookup table (LUT) based processing elements in\nForward Engine and Weight Update Engine to make accumulations implicit and to\nfuse the computations of multiple input points.

In this paper, we make use of this cyclic\nstructure to provide an explicit construction of families of binary sequences\nof length $2^n+1$ via the finite field $\\F_{2^n}$. Each family of sequences has\nsize $2^n-1$ and its correlation is upper bounded by $\\lfloor\n2^{(n+2)/2}\\rfloor$. Our sequences can be constructed explicitly and have\ncompetitive parameters. In particular, compared with the Gold sequences of\nlength $2^n-1$ for even $n$, we have larger length and smaller correlation\nalthough the family size of our sequences is slightly smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2021 09:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

Additional\ntraining and prolonged experience is often required to make highly effective\nand time-critical diagnosis on frozen sections. On the other hand, the gold\nstandard tissue preparation technique of formalin-fixation and\nparaffin-embedding (FFPE) provides significantly superior image quality, but is\na very time-consuming process (12-48 hours), making it unsuitable for\nintra-operative use. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)\nmethod that improves FS image quality by computationally transforming\nfrozen-sectioned whole-slide images (FS-WSIs) into whole-slide FFPE-style\nimages in minutes. AI-FFPE rectifies FS artefacts with the guidance of an\nattention mechanism that puts a particular emphasis on artefacts while\nutilising a self-regularization mechanism established between FS input image\nand synthesized FFPE-style image that preserves clinically relevant features.\nAs a result, AI-FFPE method successfully generates FFPE-style images without\nsignificantly extending tissue processing time and consequently improves\ndiagnostic accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of AI-FFPE on lung and brain\nfrozen sections using a variety of different qualitative and quantitative\nmetrics including visual Turing tests from 20 board certified pathologists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2021 11:32:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 20:03:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 11:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Only relying on class activation maps (CAM) with image-level\nlabels provides deficient segmentation supervision. Prior works thus consider\npre-trained models to produce coarse saliency maps to guide the generation of\npseudo segmentation labels. However, the commonly used off-line heuristic\ngeneration process cannot fully exploit the benefits of these coarse saliency\nmaps. Motivated by the significant inter-task correlation, we propose a novel\nweakly supervised multi-task framework termed as AuxSegNet, to leverage\nsaliency detection and multi-label image classification as auxiliary tasks to\nimprove the primary task of semantic segmentation using only image-level\nground-truth labels. Inspired by their similar structured semantics, we also\npropose to learn a cross-task global pixel-level affinity map from the saliency\nand segmentation representations. The learned cross-task affinity can be used\nto refine saliency predictions and propagate CAM maps to provide improved\npseudo labels for both tasks. The mutual boost between pseudo label updating\nand cross-task affinity learning enables iterative improvements on segmentation\nperformance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed auxiliary learning network structure and the cross-task affinity\nlearning method.

Recent interest in this\nsparse problem has focused on the self-training approach, which expands\nsupervised signals with pseudo labels. Nevertheless, the self-training approach\ninherently cannot realize the full potential of refining the learning\nperformance on sparse graphs due to the unsatisfactory quality and quantity of\npseudo labels.\n  In this paper, we propose ROD, a novel reception-aware online knowledge\ndistillation approach for sparse graph learning.

To extract knowledge concealed in the multi-scale\nreception fields, ROD explicitly requires individual student models to preserve\ndifferent levels of locality information. For a given task, each student would\npredict based on its reception-scale knowledge, while simultaneously a strong\nteacher is established on-the-fly by combining multi-scale knowledge. Our\napproach has been extensively evaluated on 9 datasets and a variety of\ngraph-based tasks, including node classification, link prediction, and node\nclustering.

It requires learning deep and rich\nfeatures with superior distinctiveness for the subtle and abstract motions.\nMost existing methods generate features of a layer in a pure feedforward\nmanner, where the information moves in one direction from inputs to outputs.\nAnd they rely on stacking more layers to obtain more powerful features,\nbringing extra non-negligible overheads. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive\nRecursive Circle (ARC) framework, a fine-grained decorator for pure feedforward\nlayers. It inherits the operators and parameters of the original layer but is\nslightly different in the use of those operators and parameters. Specifically,\nthe input of the layer is treated as an evolving state, and its update is\nalternated with the feature generation. At each recursive step, the input state\nis enriched by the previously generated features and the feature generation is\nmade with the newly updated input state. We hope the ARC framework can\nfacilitate fine-grained action recognition by introducing deeply refined\nfeatures and multi-scale receptive fields at a low cost. Significant\nimprovements over feedforward baselines are observed on several benchmarks.

The approach to this final state is reached\nthrough the emission of a late train of radiation known as the black hole\nringdown. The ringdown morphology is described by a countably infinite set of\ndamped sinusoids, whose complex frequencies are solely determined by the final\nblack hole's mass and spin. Recent results advocate that ringdown waveforms\nfrom numerical relativity can be fully described from the peak of the strain\nonwards if quasi-normal mode models with $N_{max}=7$ overtones are used. In\nthis work we extend this analysis to models with $N_{max}\\geq 7$ up to\n$N_{max}=16$ overtones by exploring the parameter bias on the final mass and\nfinal spin obtained by fitting the nonprecessing binary black hole simulations\nfrom the SXS catalogue.

It is shown that Lagrange's equation, Hamilton's canonical\nequations, and Hamilton-Jacobi's equation are all formulated based on the\nprinciple of energy conservation with a simple energy conservation equation,\ni.e., the rate of kinetic and potential energy with time is equal to the rate\nof work with time done by external forces; while D'Alembert's principle is a\nspecial case of the law of the conservation of energy, with either the virtual\ndisplacements ('frozen' time) or the virtual displacement ('frozen' generalized\ncoordinates). It is argued that all of the formulations for characterizing the\ndynamical behaviors of a system can be derived from the principle of energy\nconservation, and the principle of energy conservation is an underlying guide\nfor constructing mechanics in a broad sense. The proposed methodology provides\nan efficient way to tackle the dynamical problems in general mechanics,\nincluding dissipation continuum systems, especially for those with\nmulti-physical field interactions and couplings. It is pointed out that, on the\ncontrary to the classical analytical mechanics, especially to existing\nHamiltonian mechanics, the physics essences of Hamilton's variational\nprinciple, Lagrange's equation, and the Newtonian second law of motion,\nincluding their derivatives such as momentum and angular momentum\nconservations, are the consequences of the law of conservation of energy. In\naddition, our proposed methodology is easier to understand with clear physical\nmeanings and can be used for explaining the existing mechanical principles or\ntheorems. Finally, as an application example, the methodology is applied in\nfluid mechanics to derive Cauchy's first law of motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2021 04:23:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 13:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

Our proposal aims at\ndynamically increasing the on-chip memory storage capacity of SRAM arrays\non-demand. The proposed scheme called - Augmented Memory Computing allows an\nSRAM cell to operate in two different modes 1) the Normal mode and 2) the\nAugmented mode. In the Normal mode of operation, the SRAM cell functions like a\nstandard 6 transistor (6T) SRAM cell, storing one bit of data in static format.\nWhile in the Augmented mode, each SRAM cell can store >1 bit of data (in a\ndynamic fashion). Specifically, we propose two novel SRAM cells - an 8\ntransistor (8T) dual bit storage augmented cell and a 7 transistor (7T) ternary\nbit storage augmented cell. The proposed 8T dual bit SRAM cell when operated in\nthe Augmented mode, can store a static bit of data while also, simultaneously,\nstoring another bit in a dynamic form. Thus, when operated in Augmented mode,\nthe 8T SRAM cell can store two bits of data - one SRAM-like data and one\nDRAM-like data, thereby increasing or augmenting the memory storage capacity.\nOn the other hand, the proposed 7T ternary bit storage augmented cell can\neither store a single SRAM data in Normal mode or can be configured to operate\nin Augmented mode, wherein it can store ternary data (3 levels (0,0), (0,1),\n(1,0)) in a dynamic manner. Thus, based on the mode of operation, the proposed\naugmented memory bit-cells can either store one static bit of data or >1 bit of\ndata in a dynamic format. We show the feasibility of our proposed bit-cells\nthrough extensive simulations at Globalfoundries 22nm FDX node. It is worth\nmentioning, the novel scheme of augmented memory bit-cells can be seamlessly\ncombined with existing in-memory computing approaches for added energy and\nthroughput benefits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2021 00:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

However, the evaluation mechanism in the fitness\nfunction of E-GAN cannot truly reflect the adaptability of individuals to their\nenvironment, leading to an inaccurate assessment of the diversity of\nindividuals. Moreover, the evolution step of E-GAN only contains mutation\noperators without considering the crossover operator jointly, isolating the\nsuperior characteristics among individuals.

In particular, the proposed fitness\nfunction, from an objective perspective, can model the evolutionary process of\nindividuals more accurately. The crossover operator, which has been commonly\nadopted in evolutionary algorithms, can enable offspring to imitate the\nsuperior gene expression of their parents through knowledge distillation.\nExperiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nIE-GAN in terms of the quality of the generated samples and time efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2021 13:55:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 06:25:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 09:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}
