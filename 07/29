[Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 076601 (2018)]. This expectation\noriginates from the same multi-band scattering processes with large momentum\ntransfer that were recently shown to account for the linear in $T$ resistivity\nof the strange metal Sr$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$. In contrast, the thermal\nresistivity $\\rho_{Q}\\equiv T/\\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is the thermal\nconductivity, is governed by qualitatively distinct processes that involve a\nbroad continuum of compressive modes, i.e. long wavelength density excitations\nin Van Hove systems. While these compressive modes do not affect the charge\ncurrent, they couple to thermal transport and yield $\\rho_{Q}\\propto T^{3/2}$.\nAs a result, we predict that the Wiedemann-Franz law in strained\nSr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ should be violated with a Lorenz ratio $L\\propto T^{1/2}{\\rm\nlog}\\left(1/T\\right)$. We expect this effect to be observable in the\ntemperature and strain regime where the anomalous charge transport was\nestablished.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 16:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

We have achieved this by using air as low\nindex dielectric where the evanescent wave extends, preceding to excitation of\nsurface plasmons. The magnetic sample under consideration is a thin layer of\ncobalt coated by an ultrathin silver layer, on a silicon substrate (Ag/Co/Si).\nThe sample is brought close enough to the prism//Air interface, allowing\nsurface plasmon excitation in the air/Ag interface.

Together with the model, a fully\nautomated, pairwise surface registration pipeline used to establish dense\ncorrespondence among 3D breast scans is introduced. Our method is\ncomputationally efficient and requires only four landmarks to guide the\nregistration process. A major challenge when modeling female breasts from\nsurface-only 3D breast scans is the non-separability of breast and thorax. In\norder to weaken the strong coupling between breast and surrounding areas, we\npropose to minimize the variance outside the breast region as much as possible.\nTo achieve this goal, a novel concept called breast probability masks (BPMs) is\nintroduced. A BPM assigns probabilities to each point of a 3D breast scan,\ntelling how likely it is that a particular point belongs to the breast area.\nDuring registration, we use BPMs to align the template to the target as\naccurately as possible inside the breast region and only roughly outside. This\nsimple yet effective strategy significantly reduces the unwanted variance\noutside the breast region, leading to better statistical shape models in which\nbreast shapes are quite well decoupled from the thorax. The RBSM is thus able\nto produce a variety of different breast shapes as independently as possible\nfrom the shape of the thorax. Our systematic experimental evaluation reveals a\ngeneralization ability of 0.17 mm and a specificity of 2.8 mm. To underline the\nexpressiveness of the proposed model, we finally demonstrate in two showcase\napplications how the RBSM can be used for surgical outcome simulation and the\nprediction of a missing breast from the remaining one.

However, the results are not always clinically acceptable and\nrequire tedious manual revision. Here, we present a novel concept called\nartificial intelligence assisted contour revision (AIACR) and demonstrate its\nfeasibility. The proposed clinical workflow of AIACR is as follows given an\ninitial contour that requires a clinicians revision, the clinician indicates\nwhere a large revision is needed, and a trained deep learning (DL) model takes\nthis input to update the contour. This process repeats until a clinically\nacceptable contour is achieved. The DL model is designed to minimize the\nclinicians input at each iteration and to minimize the number of iterations\nneeded to reach acceptance. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated the\nconcept on 2D axial images of three head-and-neck cancer datasets, with the\nclinicians input at each iteration being one mouse click on the desired\nlocation of the contour segment. The performance of the model is quantified\nwith Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile of Hausdorff\nDistance (HD95). The average DSC/HD95 (mm) of the auto-generated initial\ncontours were 0.82/4.3, 0.73/5.6 and 0.67/11.4 for three datasets, which were\nimproved to 0.91/2.1, 0.86/2.4 and 0.86/4.7 with three mouse clicks,\nrespectively. Each DL-based contour update requires around 20 ms. We proposed a\nnovel AIACR concept that uses DL models to assist clinicians in revising\ncontours in an efficient and effective way, and we demonstrated its feasibility\nby using 2D axial CT images from three head-and-neck cancer datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 16:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-29"}

In this work, we recognize that many state-of-the-art error\nmitigation methods share a common feature: they are data-driven, employing\nclassical data obtained from runs of different quantum circuits. For example,\nZero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) uses variable noise data and Clifford-data\nregression (CDR) uses data from near-Clifford circuits. We show that Virtual\nDistillation (VD) can be viewed in a similar manner by considering classical\ndata produced from different numbers of state preparations. Observing this fact\nallows us to unify these three methods under a general data-driven error\nmitigation framework that we call UNIfied Technique for Error mitigation with\nData (UNITED). In certain situations, we find that our UNITED method can\noutperform the individual methods (i.e., the whole is better than the\nindividual parts). Specifically, we employ a realistic noise model obtained\nfrom a trapped ion quantum computer to benchmark UNITED, as well as other\nstate-of-the-art methods, in mitigating observables produced from random\nquantum circuits and the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) applied to\nMax-Cut problems with various numbers of qubits, circuit depths and total\nnumbers of shots. We find that the performance of different techniques depends\nstrongly on shot budgets, with more powerful methods requiring more shots for\noptimal performance. For our largest considered shot budget ($10^{10}$), we\nfind that UNITED gives the most accurate mitigation. Hence, our work represents\na benchmarking of current error mitigation methods and provides a guide for the\nregimes when certain methods are most useful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 16:29:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 22:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

A fundamental understanding of the spray and\nmixing performance of the new fuel candidates in combustion systems is\nnecessary to design and develop the fuels for advanced combustion concepts. In\nthe fuel design process, a large number of candidates is required to be\nscreened to arrive at potential fuels for further detailed investigations. For\nsuch a screening process, three-dimensional (3D) simulation models are\ncomputationally too expensive and hence unfeasible. Therefore, in this paper,\nwe present a fast, reduced-order model (ROM) for inert sprays. The model is\nbased on the cross-sectionally averaged spray (CAS) model derived by Wan (1997)\nfrom 3D multiphase equations. The original model was first tested against a\nwide range of conditions and different fuels. The discrepancies between the CAS\nmodel and experimental data are addressed by integrating state-of-the-art\nbreakup and evaporation models. A transport equation for vapor mass fraction is\nproposed, which is important for evaporation modeling. Furthermore, the model\nis extended to consider polydisperse droplets by modeling the droplet size\ndistribution by commonly used presumed probability density functions, such as\nRosin-Rammler, lognormal, and gamma distributions. The improved CAS model is\ncapable of predicting trends in the macroscopic spray characteristics for a\nwide range of conditions and fuels. The computational cost of the CAS model is\nlower than the 3D simulation methods by up to 6 orders of magnitude depending\non the method. This enables the model to be used not only for the rapid\nscreening of novel fuel candidates, but also for other applications, where ROMs\nare useful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 16:42:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 13:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

State-of-the-art\n(SOTA) quantization approaches focus on post-training quantization, i.e.,\nquantization of pre-trained DNNs for speeding up inference. While work on\nquantized training exists, most approaches require refinement in full precision\n(usually single precision) in the final training phase or enforce a global word\nlength across the entire DNN. This leads to suboptimal assignments of\nbit-widths to layers and, consequently, suboptimal resource usage. In an\nattempt to overcome such limitations, we introduce AdaPT, a new fixed-point\nquantized sparsifying training strategy. AdaPT decides about precision switches\nbetween training epochs based on information theoretic conditions. The goal is\nto determine on a per-layer basis the lowest precision that causes no\nquantization-induced information loss while keeping the precision high enough\nsuch that future learning steps do not suffer from vanishing gradients.

Integrating\nartificial intelligence's high efficiency and repeatability with humans'\nadaptability in various contexts can advance timely and reliable\ndecision-making during civil engineering projects and emergencies. Successful\ncases in other domains, such as biomedical science, healthcare, and\ntransportation, showed the potential of IHMI in data-driven, knowledge-based\ndecision-making in numerous civil engineering applications. However, whether\nthe industry and academia are ready to embrace the era of IHMI and maximize its\nbenefit to the industry is still questionable due to several knowledge gaps.\nThis paper thus calls for future studies in exploring the value, method, and\nchallenges of applying IHMI in civil engineering. Our systematic review of the\nliterature and motivating cases has identified four knowledge gaps in achieving\neffective IHMI in civil engineering. First, it is unknown what types of tasks\nin the civil engineering domain can be assisted by AI and to what extent.\nSecond, the interface between human and AI in civil engineering-related tasks\nneed more precise and formal definition. Third, the barriers that impede\ncollecting detailed behavioral data from humans and contextual environments\ndeserve systematic classification and prototyping. Lastly, it is unknown what\nexpected and unexpected impacts will IHMI have on the AEC industry and\nentrepreneurship. Analyzing these knowledge gaps led to a list of identified\nresearch questions.

The quasi-linear\ndiffusion rate scales linearly with the wave intensity, D(QL) is proportional\nto Bw2, which should be small enough to satisfy the applicability criteria of\nthis theory.

In this paper, we focus on the category-consistent and\nrelativistic diverse constraints to optimize the diversity of synthetic images.\nBased on those constraints, a category-consistent and relativistic diverse\nconditional GAN (CRD-CGAN) is proposed to synthesize $K$ photo-realistic images\nsimultaneously. We use the attention loss and diversity loss to improve the\nsensitivity of the GAN to word attention and noises. Then, we employ the\nrelativistic conditional loss to estimate the probability of relatively real or\nfake for synthetic images, which can improve the performance of basic\nconditional loss. Finally, we introduce a category-consistent loss to alleviate\nthe over-category issues between K synthetic images. We evaluate our approach\nusing the Birds-200-2011, Oxford-102 flower and MSCOCO 2014 datasets, and the\nextensive experiments demonstrate superiority of the proposed method in\ncomparison with state-of-the-art methods in terms of photorealistic and\ndiversity of the generated synthetic images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 17:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-29"}

In this paper, we introduce a novel \\textit{Adversarial Sparse\nConvex Combination} (ASCC) method.

The first property is that the\nelectron-intense-laser collision results in a large flux of hard photons, as\nthe laser behaves effectively as a thick medium. The second property is that\nthe emitted photons free-stream inside the laser and thus for them the laser\nbehaves effectively as a very thin medium. Combining these two features implies\nthat the electron-intense-laser collision is an apparatus which can efficiently\nconvert UV electrons to a large flux of hard, co-linear photons. We further\npropose to direct this unique large and hard flux of photons onto a physical\ndump which in turn is capable of producing feebly interacting massive\nparticles, in a region of parameters that has never been probed before. We\ndenote this novel apparatus as ``optical dump'' or NPOD (new physics search\nwith optical dump). The proposed LUXE experiment at Eu.XFEL has all the\nrequired basic ingredients of the above experimental concept. We discuss how\nthis concept can be realized in practice by adding a detector after the last\nphysical dump of the experiment to reconstruct the two-photon decay product of\na new spin-0 particle. We show that even with a relatively short dump, the\nsearch can still be background free. Remarkably, even with a 40 TW laser, which\ncorresponds to the initial run, and definitely with a 350 TW laser, of the main\nrun with one year of data taking, LUXE-NPOD will be able to probe uncharted\nterritory of both models of pseudo-scalar and scalar fields, and in particular\nprobe natural of scalar theories for masses above 100 MeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

We study\nthe evolution of clumps as they migrate through the disc using an analytic\nmodel tested by simulations and confront theory with CANDELS observations. The\nclump ``bathtub\" model, which considers gas and stellar gain and loss, is\ncharacterized by four parameters: the accretion efficiency, the\nstar-formation-rate (SFR) efficiency, and the outflow mass-loading factors for\ngas and stars. The relevant timescales are all comparable to the migration\ntime, two-three orbital times. A clump differs from a galaxy by the internal\ndependence of the accretion rate on the varying clump mass. The analytic\nsolution, involving exponential growing and decaying modes, reveals a main\nevolution phase during the migration, where the SFR and gas mass are constant\nand the stellar mass is rising linearly with time. This makes the inverse of\nthe specific SFR an observable proxy for clump age. Later, the masses and SFR\napproach an exponential growth with a constant specific SFR, but this phase is\nhypothetical as the clump disappears in the galaxy center. The model matches\nsimulations with different, moderate feedback, both in isolated and\ncosmological settings. The observed clumps agree with our theoretical\npredictions, indicating that the massive clumps are long-lived and migrating. A\nnon-trivial challenge is to model feedback that is non-disruptive in massive\nclumps but suppresses SFR to match the galactic stellar-to-halo mass ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

These values are associated with\nsubsonic turbulence which is characteristic of the warm phase of the HI gas.\nThe spatial scale at which the transition between the two regimes occurs is\nfound to be $\\approx 0.5 R_{25}$ which is similar to the size of the molecular\ndisk in the THINGS galaxies. Overall, our results suggest that on scales < $0.5\nR_{25}$, the structure of the ISM is affected by the effects of supernova\nexplosions. On larger scales (> 0.5 $R_{25}$), stellar feedback has no\nsignificant impact, and the structure of the ISM is determined by large scale\nprocesses that govern the dynamics of the gas in the warm neutral medium such\nas the flaring of the HI disk and the effects of ram pressure stripping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 16:39:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 10:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

However, much of nature is not in thermal\nequilibrium. Remarkably, it was recently predicted that out-of-equilibrium\nsystems can exhibit novel dynamical phases that may otherwise be forbidden by\nequilibrium thermodynamics, a paradigmatic example being the discrete time\ncrystal (DTC). Concretely, dynamical phases can be defined in periodically\ndriven many-body localized systems via the concept of eigenstate order. In\neigenstate-ordered phases, the entire many-body spectrum exhibits quantum\ncorrelations and long-range order, with characteristic signatures in late-time\ndynamics from all initial states. It is, however, challenging to experimentally\ndistinguish such stable phases from transient phenomena, wherein few select\nstates can mask typical behavior. Here we implement a continuous family of\ntunable CPHASE gates on an array of superconducting qubits to experimentally\nobserve an eigenstate-ordered DTC. We demonstrate the characteristic\nspatiotemporal response of a DTC for generic initial states. Our work employs a\ntime-reversal protocol that discriminates external decoherence from intrinsic\nthermalization, and leverages quantum typicality to circumvent the exponential\ncost of densely sampling the eigenspectrum. In addition, we locate the phase\ntransition out of the DTC with an experimental finite-size analysis.

While the task of predicting pedestrian\ntrajectories has received much recent attention, an intrinsic difference\nbetween these settings is how groups form and disband. Evidence from social\npsychology suggests that group members in a conversation explicitly\nself-organize to sustain the interaction by adapting to one another's\nbehaviors. Crucially, the same individual is unlikely to adapt similarly across\ndifferent groups; contextual factors such as perceived relationships,\nattraction, rapport, etc., influence the entire spectrum of participants'\nbehaviors. A question arises: how can we jointly forecast the mutually\ndependent futures of conversation partners by modeling the dynamics unique to\nevery group? In this paper, we propose the Social Process (SP) models, taking a\nnovel meta-learning and stochastic perspective of group dynamics. Training\ngroup-specific forecasting models hinders generalization to unseen groups and\nis challenging given limited conversation data. In contrast, our SP models\ntreat interaction sequences from a single group as a meta-dataset: we condition\nforecasts for a sequence from a given group on other observed-future sequence\npairs from the same group. In this way, an SP model learns to adapt its\nforecasts to the unique dynamics of the interacting partners, generalizing to\nunseen groups in a data-efficient manner. Additionally, we first rethink the\ntask formulation itself, motivating task requirements from social science\nliterature that prior formulations have overlooked. For our formulation of\nSocial Cue Forecasting, we evaluate the empirical performance of our SP models\nagainst both non-meta-learning and meta-learning approaches with similar\nassumptions. The SP models yield improved performance on synthetic and\nreal-world behavior datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 18:01:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 20:01:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

Unlike traditional\nsupervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an\noutput y as P(y|x), prompt-based learning is based on language models that\nmodel the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform\nprediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a\ntextual string prompt x' that has some unfilled slots, and then the language\nmodel is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a\nfinal string x, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is\npowerful and attractive for a number of reasons: it allows the language model\nto be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new\nprompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot\nlearning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this paper\nwe introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of\nmathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and\norganize existing work along several dimensions, e.g.the choice of pre-trained\nmodels, prompts, and tuning strategies.

Similar pathology image search offers the opportunity to comb\nthrough large historical repositories of gigapixel WSIs to identify cases with\nsimilar morphological features and can be particularly useful for diagnosing\nrare diseases, identifying similar cases for predicting prognosis, treatment\noutcomes, and potential clinical trial success. A critical challenge in\ndeveloping a WSI search and retrieval system is scalability, which is uniquely\nchallenging given the need to search a growing number of slides that each can\nconsist of billions of pixels and are several gigabytes in size. Such systems\nare typically slow and retrieval speed often scales with the size of the\nrepository they search through, making their clinical adoption tedious and are\nnot feasible for repositories that are constantly growing.

We\nevaluated FISH on multiple tasks and datasets with over 22,000 patient cases\nspanning 56 disease subtypes.

Before the onset of Big\nBang nucleosynthesis, the energy density of the universe is dominated by a\nparticle field $\\phi$ described by a general equation of state $\\omega$. The\nensuing enhancement of the Hubble expansion rate decreases the temperature at\nwhich axions start to oscillate, opening this way the possibility for axions\nheavier than in the standard window. This is the case for kination, or in\ngeneral for scenarios with $\\omega > 1/3$. However, if $\\omega < 1/3$, as in\nthe case of an early matter domination, the decay of $\\phi$ injects additional\nentropy relative to the case of the standard model, diluting this way the\npreexisting axion abundance, and rendering lighter axions viable. For a\nmisalignment angle $0.5 < \\theta_i < \\pi/\\sqrt{3}$, the usual axion window\nbecomes expanded to $4 \\times 10^{-9}$ eV $\\lesssim m_a \\lesssim 2 \\times\n10^{-5}$ eV for the case of an early matter domination, or to $2 \\times\n10^{-6}$ eV $\\lesssim m_a \\lesssim 10^{-2}$ eV for the case of kination.\nInterestingly, the coupling axion-photon in such a wider range can be probed\nwith next generation experiments such as ABRACADABRA, KLASH, ADMX, MADMAX, and\nORGAN.

In experiments, measurements\nyield much richer information - e.g., continuous current values, discrete\nphoton counts - which is then mapped into binary outcomes by discarding some of\nthis information. In this work, we consider methods to incorporate all of this\nricher information, typically called soft information, into the decoding of\nquantum error correction codes, and in particular the surface code. We describe\nhow to modify both the Minimum Weight Perfect Matching and Union-Find decoders\nto leverage soft information, and demonstrate these soft decoders outperform\nthe standard (hard) decoders that can only access the binary measurement\noutcomes. Moreover, we observe that the soft decoder achieves a threshold 25\\%\nhigher than any hard decoder for phenomenological noise with Gaussian soft\nmeasurement outcomes. We also introduce a soft measurement error model with\namplitude damping, in which measurement time leads to a trade-off between\nmeasurement resolution and additional disturbance of the qubits. Under this\nmodel we observe that the performance of the surface code is very sensitive to\nthe choice of the measurement time - for a distance-19 surface code, a\nfive-fold increase in measurement time can lead to a thousand-fold increase in\nlogical error rate. Moreover, the measurement time that minimizes the physical\nerror rate is distinct from the one that minimizes the logical performance,\npointing to the benefits of jointly optimizing the physical and quantum error\ncorrection layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 18:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

We\ndemonstrate GaAs and Si/SiGe asymmetric sensing dots (ASDs) specifically\ndesigned to provide a significantly improved response compared to conventional\ncharge sensing dots. Our ASD design features a strongly decoupled drain\nreservoir from the sensor dot, which mitigates negative feedback effects found\nin conventional sensors. This results in a boosted output swing of\n$3\\,\\text{mV}$, which exceeds the response in the conventional regime of our\ndevice by more than ten times. The enhanced output signal paves the way for\nemploying very low-power readout amplifiers in close proximity to the qubit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 18:58:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 22:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

Our highest performing\nproposed few-shot approaches achieve 0.575 and 0.672 F1-score, respectively,\nwith 5-shot 5-way tasks on these two datasets. These represent absolute\nimprovements of 0.200 and 0.234 over strong proposal-free few-shot sound event\ndetection baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 19:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

Selecting regions\nto image for structural and chemical discovery via atomically resolved imaging\nhas traditionally proceeded via human operators making semi-informed judgements\non sampling locations and parameters. Recent efforts at automation for\nstructural and physical discovery have pointed towards the use of \"active\nlearning\" methods that utilize Bayesian optimization with surrogate models to\nquickly find relevant regions of interest. Yet despite the potential importance\nof this direction, there is a general lack of certainty in selecting relevant\ncontrol algorithms and how to balance a priori knowledge of the material system\nwith knowledge derived during experimentation.

In our simulations, the TEDI is not only triggered by adiabatic wind\nmass loss, but also by Roche lobe overflow in the inner binary: when the donor\nstar becomes less massive than the accretor, the inner binary orbit widens,\ntriggering triple dynamical instability. We find that collision rates are\nincreased by ~17% when fly-bys in the field are taken into account.

Our framework\naddresses AI assurance challenges lying at the intersection of domain\nadaptation, fairness, and counterfactuals analysis, operating via the discovery\nand intervention on factors of variations in data (e.g. weather or illumination\nconditions) that significantly affect the robustness of AI models. Robustness\nis understood here as insensitivity of the model performance to variations in\nsensitive factors. Sensitive factors are traditionally set in a supervised\nsetting, whereby factors are known a-priori (e.g. for fairness this could be\nfactors like sex or race). In contrast, our motivation is real-life scenarios\nwhere less, or nothing, is actually known a-priori about certain factors that\ncause models to fail. This leads us to consider various settings (unsupervised,\ndomain generalization, semi-supervised) that correspond to different degrees of\nincomplete knowledge about those factors. Therefore, our two step approach\nworks by a) discovering sensitive factors that cause AI systems to fail in a\nunsupervised fashion, and then b) intervening models to lessen these factor's\ninfluence.

This process, however, traditionally requires access to\nindividual source recordings, restricting the creative process. To work around\nthis, source separation algorithms can separate a mixture into its respective\ncomponents. Then, a user can adjust their levels and mix them back together.\nThis two-step approach, however, still suffers from audible artifacts and\nmotivates further work. In this work, we learn to remix music directly by\nre-purposing Conv-TasNet, a well-known source separation model, into two neural\nremixing architectures. To do this, we use an explicit loss term that directly\nmeasures remix quality and jointly optimize it with a separation loss. We\nevaluate our methods using the Slakh and MUSDB18 datasets and report remixing\nperformance as well as the impact on source separation as a byproduct. Our\nresults suggest that learning-to-remix significantly outperforms a strong\nseparation baseline and is particularly useful for small volume changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 20:45:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 17:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

A test is made on a synthetic datacube composed of a\nstatic background based on IRIS data, Poisson noise and $\\approx10^4$\nrandomly-distributed, moving, small-scale Gaussian brightenings.

Research\non adversarial training with imbalanced training datasets is rather limited. As\nthe initial effort to investigate this problem, we reveal the facts that\nadversarially trained models present two distinguished behaviors from naturally\ntrained models in imbalanced datasets: (1) Compared to natural training,\nadversarially trained models can suffer much worse performance on\nunder-represented classes, when the training dataset is extremely imbalanced.\n(2) Traditional reweighting strategies may lose efficacy to deal with the\nimbalance issue for adversarial training. For example, upweighting the\nunder-represented classes will drastically hurt the model's performance on\nwell-represented classes, and as a result, finding an optimal reweighting value\ncan be tremendously challenging.

Locating joints of a\nperson in images or videos is an important task that can be applied in action\nrecognition and object tracking. As have many computer vision tasks, HPE has\nadvanced massively with the introduction of deep learning to the field. In this\npaper, we focus on one of the deep learning-based approaches of HPE proposed by\nNewell et al., which they named the stacked hourglass network.

In GPU systems, similar LLC issues are alleviated using\nvarious cache bypassing techniques. These issues are worsened in heterogeneous\nCPU-GPU systems because the two processors have different data access patterns\nand frequencies. GPUs generally work on streaming data, but have many more\nthreads accessing memory as compared to CPUs.

Each drone operates out of platforms that may be move when not in use\nand each drone has a limited delivery range to service a demand points.\nAssociated with each demand point is a disutility function, or a cost function,\nwith respect to time that reflects preferred delivery clock time for the\ndemanded item, as well as the item's perishability characteristic that models\nnonincreasing quality with time. The paper first addresses the problem of\nlocating the platforms as well concurrently determining which platform serves\nwhich demand points and in what order to minimize total disutility for product\ndelivery. The second scenario addresses the two-period problem where the\nplatforms can be relocated, using useable road networks, after the first\nperiod.

Do these\neconomic and structural characteristics drive the transmission mechanism of the\ntax changes at the state level at different horizons? This study employs a\npanel factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) technique to answer these\nissues. The findings show that state economies respond homogeneously in terms\nof employment and price levels; however, they react heterogeneously in real GDP\nand personal income growth. In most states, these reactions are statistically\nsignificant, and the heterogeneity in the effects of tax cuts is significantly\nrelated to the state's fiscal structure, manufacturing and financial\ncomposition, and the labor market's rigidity. A cross-state regression analysis\nshows that states with higher tax elasticity, higher personal income tax,\nstrict labor market regulation, and economic policy uncertainties are\nrelatively less responsive to federal tax changes.

However, its performance is far inferior\nto large network such as ResNet and HRNet due to its limited fusion operation\nin the network. Specifically, we expand the number of fusion operation by\nbuilding bridges between two pyramid frameworks without adding layers.\nMeanwhile, to capture long-range dependency, we propose a lightweight attention\nblock -- HSA, which computes second-order attention map. In summary, SFM\nmaximizes the number of feature fusion in a limited number of layers. HSA\nlearns high precise spatial information by computing the attention of spatial\nattention map. With the help of SFM and HSA, our network is able to generate\nmulti-level feature and extract precise global spatial information with little\ncomputing resource.

Hopping like a spring is efficient and\nwithout the requirement of complicated control algorithms. Position and force\ncontrol are two main methods to realize such a spring-like behaviour. The\nposition control usually consumes the torque resources to ensure the position\naccuracy and compensate the tracking errors. In comparison, the force control\nstrategy is able to maintain a high elasticity. Currently, the position and\nforce control both leads to the discount of motor saturation ratio as well as\nthe bandwidth of the control system, and thus attenuates the performance of the\nactuator. To augment the performance, this letter proposes a motor saturation\nstrategy based on the force control to maximize the output torque of the\nactuator and realize the continuous hopping motion with natural dynamics. The\nproposed strategy is able to maximize the saturation ratio of motor and thus\nmaximize the foot clearance of the single leg.

Inadequate\nconsideration of security in the choice of a programming language may lead to\npotential ramifications for secure development. Whilst theoretical analysis of\nthe supposed security properties of different programming languages has been\nconducted, there has been relatively little effort to empirically explore the\nactual security challenges experienced by developers. We have performed a\nlarge-scale study of the security challenges of 15 programming languages by\nquantitatively and qualitatively analysing the developers' discussions from\nStack Overflow and GitHub. By leveraging topic modelling, we have derived a\ntaxonomy of 18 major security challenges for 6 topic categories. We have also\nconducted comparative analysis to understand how the identified challenges vary\nregarding the different programming languages and data sources. Our findings\nsuggest that the challenges and their characteristics differ substantially for\ndifferent programming languages and data sources, i.e., Stack Overflow and\nGitHub. The findings provide evidence-based insights and understanding of\nsecurity challenges related to different programming languages to software\nprofessionals (i.e., practitioners or researchers). The reported taxonomy of\nsecurity challenges can assist both practitioners and researchers in better\nunderstanding and traversing the secure development landscape. This study\nhighlights the importance of the choice of technology, e.g., programming\nlanguage, in secure software engineering. Hence, the findings are expected to\nmotivate practitioners to consider the potential impact of the choice of\nprogramming languages on software security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 03:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 09:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

Therefore, any deposition of the rotation power within the\nlight cylinder causes insufficient loss of angular momentum. In this paper, we\ninvestigate two cases of this type of energy release: polar cap acceleration\nand Ohmic heating in the magnetospheric current inside the star. As for the\nfirst case, the outer magnetosphere beyond the light cylinder is found to\ncompensate the insufficient loss of the angular momentum. We argue that the\nenergy flux coming from the sub-rotating magnetic field lines must be larger\nthan the solid-angle average value, and as a result, an enhanced energy flux\nemanating beyond the light cylinder is observed in different phases in the\nlight curve from those of emission inside the light cylinder.

However, many of these deep face recognition\nmodels perform much better in handling frontal faces compared to profile faces.\nThe major reason for poor performance in handling of profile faces is that it\nis inherently difficult to learn pose-invariant deep representations that are\nuseful for profile face recognition. In this paper, we hypothesize that the\nprofile face domain possesses a latent connection with the frontal face domain\nin a latent feature subspace. We look to exploit this latent connection by\nprojecting the profile faces and frontal faces into a common latent subspace\nand perform verification or retrieval in the latent domain. We leverage a\ncoupled conditional generative adversarial network (cpGAN) structure to find\nthe hidden relationship between the profile and frontal images in a latent\ncommon embedding subspace. Specifically, the cpGAN framework consists of two\nconditional GAN-based sub-networks, one dedicated to the frontal domain and the\nother dedicated to the profile domain. Each sub-network tends to find a\nprojection that maximizes the pair-wise correlation between the two feature\ndomains in a common embedding feature subspace. The efficacy of our approach\ncompared with the state-of-the-art is demonstrated using the CFP, CMU\nMulti-PIE, IJB-A, and IJB-C datasets.

It estimates depth dependent on heights, which introduces\nmathematical priors into the deep model. But projection process also introduces\nthe error amplification problem, in which the error of the estimated height\nwill be amplified and reflected greatly at the output depth. This property\nleads to uncontrollable depth inferences and also damages the training\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose a Geometry Uncertainty Projection Network\n(GUP Net) to tackle the error amplification problem at both inference and\ntraining stages. Specifically, a GUP module is proposed to obtains the\ngeometry-guided uncertainty of the inferred depth, which not only provides high\nreliable confidence for each depth but also benefits depth learning.\nFurthermore, at the training stage, we propose a Hierarchical Task Learning\nstrategy to reduce the instability caused by error amplification. This learning\nalgorithm monitors the learning situation of each task by a proposed indicator\nand adaptively assigns the proper loss weights for different tasks according to\ntheir pre-tasks situation. Based on that, each task starts learning only when\nits pre-tasks are learned well, which can significantly improve the stability\nand efficiency of the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.

Multimodal machine learning\ninvolves multiple aspects: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and\nco-learning. In the current state of multimodal machine learning, the\nassumptions are that all modalities are present, aligned, and noiseless during\ntraining and testing time. However, in real-world tasks, typically, it is\nobserved that one or more modalities are missing, noisy, lacking annotated\ndata, have unreliable labels, and are scarce in training or testing and or\nboth. This challenge is addressed by a learning paradigm called multimodal\nco-learning. The modeling of a (resource-poor) modality is aided by exploiting\nknowledge from another (resource-rich) modality using transfer of knowledge\nbetween modalities, including their representations and predictive models.\nCo-learning being an emerging area, there are no dedicated reviews explicitly\nfocusing on all challenges addressed by co-learning.

While the availability of high-quality\necological monitoring data is increasing, the quantification of functional\ndiversity so far requires the identification of species traits, for which data\nis harder to obtain. However, the traits that are relevant for the ecological\nfunction of a species also shape its performance in the environment and hence\nshould be reflected indirectly in its spatio-temporal distribution. Thus it may\nbe possible to reconstruct these traits from a sufficiently extensive\nmonitoring dataset. Here we use diffusion maps, a deterministic and de-facto\nparameter-free analysis method, to reconstruct a proxy representation of the\nspecies' traits directly from monitoring data and use it to estimate functional\ndiversity. We demonstrate this approach both with simulated data and real-world\nphytoplankton monitoring data from the Baltic sea. We anticipate that wider\napplication of this approach to existing data could greatly advance the\nanalysis of changes in functional biodiversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 07:39:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 05:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

By means of molecular dynamics simulations, the\nmelting points of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate and\n1-decyl-3-methyl-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate were determined and the effect\nof the molecular flexibility over the melting point was explicitly computed by\nrestraining the rotation of dihedral angles in both the solid and the liquid\nphase. The rotational flexibility over the bond between the ring and the alkyl\nchain affects the relative ordering of the anions around the cations and\nresults in substantial effects over both the enthalpy and the entropy of\nmelting. For the other dihedral angles of the alkyl group, the contributions\nare predominantly entropic and an alternating behavior was found. The\nflexibility of some dihedral angles has negligible effects on the melting\npoint, while others can lead to differences in the melting point as large as 20\nK. This alternating behavior is rationalized by the different probabilities of\nconformation defects in the crystal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 07:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

Among existing FL\nmodels, federated logistic regression (FLR) is a widely used statistic model\nand has been used in various industries. To ensure data security and user\nprivacy, FLR leverages homomorphic encryption (HE) to protect the exchanged\ndata among different collaborative parties. However, HE introduces significant\ncomputational overhead (i.e., the cost of data encryption/decryption and\ncalculation over encrypted data), which eventually becomes the performance\nbottleneck of the whole system. In this paper, we propose HAFLO, a GPU-based\nsolution to improve the performance of FLR. The core idea of HAFLO is to\nsummarize a set of performance-critical homomorphic operators (HO) used by FLR\nand accelerate the execution of these operators through a joint optimization of\nstorage, IO, and computation.

Since two arms are occupied for the\noverhead task, it is desired to have additional arms to assist us in achieving\nother subtasks such as supporting the far end of a long plate and pushing it\nupward to fit in the ceiling. In this study, a method that maps human muscle\nforce to SRD for overhead task assistance is proposed. Our methodology is to\nutilize redundant DoFs such as the idle muscles in the leg to control the\nsupporting force of the SRD. A sEMG device is worn on the operator's shank\nwhere muscle signals are measured, parsed, and transmitted to SRD for control.\nIn the control aspect, we adopted stiffness control in the task space based on\ntorque control at the joint level. We are motivated by the fact that humans can\nachieve daily manipulation merely through simple inherent compliance property\nin joint driven by muscles. We explore to estimate the force of some particular\nmuscles in humans and control the SRD to imitate the behaviors of muscle and\noutput supporting forces to accomplish the subtasks such as overhead\nsupporting. The sEMG signals detected from human muscles are extracted,\nfiltered, rectified, and parsed to estimate the muscle force. We use this force\ninformation as the intent of the operator for proper overhead supporting force.\nAs one of the well-known compliance control methods, stiffness control is easy\nto achieve using a few of straightforward parameters such as stiffness and\nequilibrium point. Through tuning the stiffness and equilibrium point, the\nsupporting force of SRD in task space can be easily controlled. The muscle\nforce estimated by sEMG is mapped to the desired force in the task space of the\nSRD.

The main goal of its high-energy\nstages is to search for the new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). The\nInert Doublet Model (IDM) is one of the simplest SM extensions and introduces\nfour new scalar particles: H$^\\pm$, A and H; the lightest, H, is stable and\nhence a natural dark matter (DM) candidate. A set of benchmark points is\nconsidered, which are consistent with current theoretical and experimental\nconstraints and promise detectable signals at future colliders. Prospects for\nobserving pair-production of the IDM scalars at CLIC were previously studied\nusing signatures with two leptons in the final state. In the current study,\ndiscovery reach for the IDM charged scalar pair-production is considered for\nthe semi-leptonic final state at the two high-energy CLIC stages. Full\nsimulation analysis, based on the current CLIC detector model, is presented for\nfive selected IDM scenarios. Results are then extended to the larger set of\nbenchmarks using the Delphes fast simulation framework.

Assuming that the\nscalar field is linearly dependent on time, we consider a general\nshift-symmetric scalar-tensor theory and a general form of the matter\nenergy-momentum tensor that allows for the anisotropic pressure and the heat\nflux in the radial direction. This is a natural starting point in light of how\nthe gravitational field equations and the energy-momentum tensor transform\nunder a disformal transformation. By inspecting the structure of the\nhydrostatic equilibrium equation in the presence of the derivative-dependent\nconformal and disformal factors, we show that the energy density and tangential\npressure must vanish at the surface of a star.

We turn then our attention to Matrix Partitions with finite\nsets of obstructions. We show that, for a fixed trigraph, the set of\ninclusion-wise minimal obstructions is finite for directed graphs if and only\nif it is finite for trigraphs. We also prove similar results for relational\nstructures. We conclude by showing that on trees (seen as trigraphs) it is\nNP-complete to decide whether a given tree has a trigraph homomorphism to\nanother input trigraph. The latter shows a notable difference on tractability\nbetween CSP and Matrix Partition as it is well-known that CSP is tractable on\nthe class of trees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 08:13:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

The rationale behind our solution is that the continuity of\nconsecutive images leads to inherent editable directions. This inborn property\nis used for two unique purposes: 1) regularizing the joint inversion process,\nsuch that each of the inverted code is semantically accessible from one of the\nother and fastened in a editable domain; 2) enforcing inter-image coherence,\nsuch that the fidelity of each inverted code can be maximized with the\ncomplement of other images.

Although the\nrelationship between processing and the resulting properties is well known, an\nunderstanding of the specific deformation mechanisms activated across its\napplication temperature range is required to create more mechanistically\naccurate property models. Direct atomic-scale imaging observations with high\nangle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy,\ncomplemented by phase-field modeling informed by generalized stacking fault\nsurface calculations using density functional theory, were employed to\nunderstand the shear process of ${\\gamma}''$ and ${\\gamma}'/{\\gamma}''$\nco-precipitates after 1 \\% macroscopic strain at lower temperature (ambient and\n$427 {\\deg}C$). Experimentally, intrinsic stacking faults were observed in the\n${\\gamma}''$, whereas the ${\\gamma}'$ was found to exhibit anti-phase\nboundaries or superlattice intrinsic stacking faults. Additionally, the\natomically flat ${\\gamma}'/{\\gamma}''$ interfaces in the co-precipitates were\nfound to exhibit offsets after shearing, which can be used as tracers for the\ndeformation events. Phase-field modeling shows that the developing\nfault-structure is dependent on the direction of the Burgers vector of the $a/2\n\\langle110\\rangle$ matrix dislocation (or dislocation group) due to the lower\ncrystal symmetry of the ${\\gamma''}$ phase. The interplay between ${\\gamma}'$\nand ${\\gamma}''$ phases results in unique deformation pathways of the\nco-precipitate and increases the shear resistance. Consistent with the\nexperimental observations, the simulation results indicate that complex\nshearing mechanisms are active in the low-temperature deformation regime and\nthat multiple $a/2 \\langle110\\rangle$ dislocations of non-parallel Burgers\nvectors may be active on the same slip plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 09:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

Approaches to top-k recommendation\nmainly rely on Learning-To-Rank algorithms and, among them, the most widely\nadopted is Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), which bases on a pair-wise\noptimization approach. Recently, BPR has been found vulnerable against\nadversarial perturbations of its model parameters. Adversarial Personalized\nRanking (APR) mitigates this issue by robustifying BPR via an adversarial\ntraining procedure. The empirical improvements of APR's accuracy performance on\nBPR have led to its wide use in several recommender models. However, a key\noverlooked aspect has been the beyond-accuracy performance of APR, i.e.,\nnovelty, coverage, and amplification of popularity bias, considering that\nrecent results suggest that BPR, the building block of APR, is sensitive to the\nintensification of biases and reduction of recommendation novelty. In this\nwork, we model the learning characteristics of the BPR and APR optimization\nframeworks to give mathematical evidence that, when the feedback data have a\ntailed distribution, APR amplifies the popularity bias more than BPR due to an\nunbalanced number of received positive updates from short-head items. Using\nmatrix factorization (MF), we empirically validate the theoretical results by\nperforming preliminary experiments on two public datasets to compare BPR-MF and\nAPR-MF performance on accuracy and beyond-accuracy metrics.

Methods: We\nused a modified stellar evolution code to study the effects of DM\nself-annihilation on the structure and evolution of low-mass RGB stars.\nResults: We find that the number of DM particles that accumulate inside\nlow-mass RGB stars is not only constant during this phase of evolution, but\nalso mostly independent of the stellar mass and to some extent stellar\nmetallicity. Moreover, we find that the energy injected into the stellar core\ndue to DM annihilation can promote the conditions necessary for helium burning\nand thus trigger an early end of the RGB phase. The premature end of the RGB,\nwhich is most pronounced for DM particles with $m_\\chi \\simeq\n100~\\mathrm{GeV}$, is thus achieved at a lower helium core mass, which results\nin a lower luminosity at the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB).

Given the high computational cost of\nmesh deformation, state-of-the-art radial basis function techniques are used\nfor data reduction. The principle procedures adopted are multi-level greedy\nsurface point selection and volume point reduction. The multi-level greedy\nsurface point selection reduces the control point list to increase the\nefficiency of the interpolation operation and the volume point reduction\nimproves the computational cost of the volume mesh update operation which is\nimportant for large data sets. The study demonstrates the capabilities of\nradial basis function mesh deformation in both two and three-dimensions.\nFurthermore, it compares localised ice deformation to more standardized test\ncases with global deformation. The convergence history of the multi-level\ngreedy point selection is assessed in terms of number of control points and\ncomputational cost for all the test cases.

We\npropose a novel methodology which does not require any knowledge or estimation\nof the tail index, or even knowledge as to whether certain moments (such as the\nvariance) exist or not, and develop an estimator of the number of stochastic\ntrends $m$ based on the eigenvalues of the sample second moment matrix of\n$y_{t}$. We study the rates of such eigenvalues, showing that the first $m$\nones diverge, as the sample size $T$ passes to infinity, at a rate faster by\n$O\\left(T \\right)$ than the remaining $N-m$ ones, irrespective of the tail\nindex. We thus exploit this eigen-gap by constructing, for each eigenvalue, a\ntest statistic which diverges to positive infinity or drifts to zero according\nto whether the relevant eigenvalue belongs to the set of the first $m$\neigenvalues or not. We then construct a randomised statistic based on this,\nusing it as part of a sequential testing procedure, ensuring consistency of the\nresulting estimator of $m$. We also discuss an estimator of the common trends\nbased on principal components and show that, up to a an invertible linear\ntransformation, such estimator is consistent in the sense that the estimation\nerror is of smaller order than the trend itself.

The biggest obstacle to RV\ndetection of such exoplanets is variability intrinsic to stars themselves, e.g.\nnuisance signals arising from surface magnetic activity such as rotating spots\nand plages, which can drown out or even mimic planetary RV signals. We use\nKepler-37 - known to host three transiting planets, one of which, Kepler-37d,\nshould be on the cusp of RV detectability with modern spectrographs - as a case\nstudy in disentangling planetary and stellar activity signals. We show how two\ndifferent statistical techniques - one seeking to identify activity signals in\nstellar spectra, and another to model activity signals in extracted RVs and\nactivity indicators - can enable detection of the hitherto elusive Kepler-37d.\nMoreover, we show that these two approaches can be complementary, and in\ncombination, facilitate a definitive detection and precise characterisation of\nKepler-37d.

The majority of Re-ID methods focus on\nsmall-scale surveillance systems in which each pedestrian is captured in\ndifferent camera views of adjacent scenes. However, in large-scale surveillance\nsystems that cover larger areas, it is required to track a pedestrian of\ninterest across distant scenes (e.g., a criminal suspect escapes from one city\nto another). Since most pedestrians appear in limited local areas, it is\ndifficult to collect training data with cross-camera pairs of the same person.\nIn this work, we study intra-camera supervised person re-identification across\ndistant scenes (ICS-DS Re-ID), which uses cross-camera unpaired data with\nintra-camera identity labels for training. It is challenging as cross-camera\npaired data plays a crucial role for learning camera-invariant features in most\nexisting Re-ID methods. To learn camera-invariant representation from\ncross-camera unpaired training data, we propose a cross-camera feature\nprediction method to mine cross-camera self supervision information from\ncamera-specific feature distribution by transforming fake cross-camera positive\nfeature pairs and minimize the distances of the fake pairs. Furthermore, we\nautomatically localize and extract local-level feature by a transformer. Joint\nlearning of global-level and local-level features forms a global-local\ncross-camera feature prediction scheme for mining fine-grained cross-camera\nself supervision information. Finally, cross-camera self supervision and\nintra-camera supervision are aggregated in a framework.

However, monocular 3D object detection remains a\nchallenging problem due to the unsatisfactory performance in depth estimation.\nMost existing monocular methods typically directly regress the scene depth\nwhile ignoring important relationships between the depth and various geometric\nelements (e.g. bounding box sizes, 3D object dimensions, and object poses). In\nthis paper, we propose to learn geometry-guided depth estimation with\nprojective modeling to advance monocular 3D object detection. Specifically, a\nprincipled geometry formula with projective modeling of 2D and 3D depth\npredictions in the monocular 3D object detection network is devised. We further\nimplement and embed the proposed formula to enable geometry-aware deep\nrepresentation learning, allowing effective 2D and 3D interactions for boosting\nthe depth estimation. Moreover, we provide a strong baseline through addressing\nsubstantial misalignment between 2D annotation and projected boxes to ensure\nrobust learning with the proposed geometric formula. Experiments on the KITTI\ndataset show that our method remarkably improves the detection performance of\nthe state-of-the-art monocular-based method without extra data by 2.80% on the\nmoderate test setting.

However, in\nmany real-world RL problems, besides optimizing the main objectives, the agent\nis expected to satisfy a certain level of safety (e.g., avoiding collisions in\nautonomous driving). While RL problems are commonly formalized as Markov\ndecision processes (MDPs), safety constraints are incorporated via constrained\nMarkov decision processes (CMDPs). Although recent advances in safe RL have\nenabled learning safe policies in CMDPs, these safety requirements should be\nsatisfied during both training and in the deployment process. Furthermore, it\nis shown that in memory-based and partially observable environments, these\nmethods fail to maintain safety over unseen out-of-distribution observations.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a Lyapunov-based uncertainty-aware\nsafe RL model. The introduced model adopts a Lyapunov function that converts\ntrajectory-based constraints to a set of local linear constraints. Furthermore,\nto ensure the safety of the agent in highly uncertain environments, an\nuncertainty quantification method is developed that enables identifying\nrisk-averse actions through estimating the probability of constraint\nviolations. Moreover, a Transformers model is integrated to provide the agent\nwith memory to process long time horizons of information via the self-attention\nmechanism. The proposed model is evaluated in grid-world navigation tasks where\nsafety is defined as avoiding static and dynamic obstacles in fully and\npartially observable environments. The results of these experiments show a\nsignificant improvement in the performance of the agent both in achieving\noptimality and satisfying safety constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 13:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

As anticipated by Betchov in a prescient series of works more than\nsix decades ago, this scale is about equal to the Kolmogorov length, even\nthough that is several orders of magnitude above the mean free path. This\nresult implies that the deterministic version of the incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equation is inadequate to describe the dissipation range of\nturbulence in molecular fluids. Within this range, the fluctuating\nhydrodynamics equation of Landau and Lifschitz is more appropriate. In\nparticular, our analysis implies that both the exponentially decaying energy\nspectrum and the far-dissipation range intermittency predicted by Kraichnan for\ndeterministic Navier-Stokes will be generally replaced by Gaussian thermal\nequipartition at scales just below the Kolmogorov length. Stochastic shell\nmodel simulations at high Reynolds numbers verify our theoretical predictions\nand reveal furthermore that inertial-range intermittency can propagate deep\ninto the dissipation range, leading to large fluctuations in the equipartition\nlength scale. We explain the failure of previous scaling arguments for the\nvalidity of deterministic Navier-Stokes equations at any Reynolds number and we\nprovide a mathematical interpretation and physical justification of the\nfluctuating Navier-Stokes equation as an ``effective field-theory'' valid below\nsome high-wavenumber cutoff $\\Lambda$, rather than as a continuum stochastic\npartial differential equation.

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to\nstudy the robustness of graph k-shell structure under adversarial attacks. In\nparticular, we propose a Simulated Annealing (SA) based k-shell attack method\nand testify it on four real-world social networks.

In this paper, we propose\na Patch Pyramid Transformer(PPT) to effectively address the above\nissues.Specifically, we first design a Patch Transformer to transform the image\ninto a sequence of patches, where transformer encoding is performed for each\npatch to extract local representations. In addition, we construct a Pyramid\nTransformer to effectively extract the non-local information from the entire\nimage. After obtaining a set of multi-scale, multi-dimensional, and multi-angle\nfeatures of the original image, we design the image reconstruction network to\nensure that the features can be reconstructed into the original input. To\nvalidate the effectiveness, we apply the proposed Patch Pyramid Transformer to\nimage fusion tasks. The experimental results demonstrate its superior\nperformance, compared to the state-of-the-art fusion approaches, achieving the\nbest results on several evaluation indicators.

Recent\nfield theoretical accurate calculations showed that this is wrong: the\nisotropic fixed point of the renormalization group (RG) is unstable, and RG\niterations flow either to a `cubic' fixed point or to a fluctuation-driven\nfirst-order transition. These distinct flows correspond to two distinct\nuniversality classes, identified by the symmetry of the ordered structures\nbelow the transitions. Here we show that perovskites which become trigonal or\ntetragonal belong to these two universality classes, respectively. The close\nvicinity of the isotropic and cubic fixed points explains the apparent wrong\nobservations of a single universality class, but also implies the existence of\nslowly varying effective material-dependent exponents. For the tetragonal case,\nthese effective exponents can have the `isotropic' values before crossing to\nthe first-order transition. We propose dedicated experiments to test these\npredictions.

The use of approximate methods is then of primary interest. One\npromising candidate method is the flux-limited diffusion (FLD), which recasts\nthe radiative transfer problem into a non-linear diffusion equation. One\nimportant aspect for the accuracy of the method lies in the implementation of\nappropriate boundary conditions (BCs). We present new BCs for the FLD\napproximation in circumstellar environments that we apply here to spherically\nsymmetric envelopes. At the inner boundary, the entering flux (coming from the\nstar and from the envelope itself) may be written in the FLD formalism and\nprovides us with an adequate BC. At the free outer boundary, we used the FLD\nformalism to constrain the ratio of the mean radiation intensity over the\nemerging flux. In both cases we derived non-linear mixed BCs relating the\nsurface values of the mean specific intensity and its gradient. We implemented\nthese conditions and compared the results with previous benchmarks and the\nresults of a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. A comparison with results\nderived from BCs that were previously proposed in other contexts is presented\nas well. For all the tested cases, the average relative difference with the\nbenchmark results is below 2\\% for the temperature profile and below 6\\% for\nthe corresponding spectral energy distribution or the emerging flux.

Despite the great progress achieved by these approaches, they\nare not robust to global motion, and lack the ability to accurately predict\nlocal motion with a small movement range. To alleviate these two problems, we\npropose a relative information encoding method that yields positional and\ntemporal enhanced representations. Firstly, we encode positional information by\nutilizing relative coordinates of 2D poses to enhance the consistency between\nthe input and output distribution. The same posture with different absolute 2D\npositions can be mapped to a common representation. It is beneficial to resist\nthe interference of global motion on the prediction results. Second, we encode\ntemporal information by establishing the connection between the current pose\nand other poses of the same person within a period of time. More attention will\nbe paid to the movement changes before and after the current pose, resulting in\nbetter prediction performance on local motion with a small movement range. The\nablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed relative\ninformation encoding method.

To answer this question, researchers\nhave studied pairing correlations in the bilayer Hubbard model, which has an\nincipient band for large interlayer hopping $t_\\perp$, using many-body\nperturbation theory and variational methods. They have generally found that\nsuperconductivity is enhanced as one of the bands approaches the Liftshiz\ntransition and even when it becomes incipient.

The agent learns to solve the task by exploring\nthe environment and exploiting the rewards it gets from the environment. For\nsome classical task environments, such as deterministic strictly epochal\nenvironments, an analogue quantum environment can be constructed which allows\nto find rewards quadratically faster by applying quantum algorithms. In this\npaper, we analytically analyze the behavior of a hybrid agent which combines\nthis quadratic speedup in exploration with the policy update of a classical\nagent.

In this paper, we investigate analytically and\nnumerically the minimizers among three-dimensional lattices of Riesz and\nLennard-Jones energies. We discuss the minimality of the Body-Centred-Cubic\nlattice (BCC), Face-Centred-Cubic lattice (FCC), Simple Hexagonal lattices (SH)\nand Hexagonal Close-Packing structure (HCP), globally and at fixed density. In\nthe Riesz case, new evidence of the global minimality at fixed density of the\nBCC lattice is shown for $s<0$ and the HCP lattice is computed to have higher\nenergy than the FCC (for $s>3/2$) and BCC (for $s<3/2$) lattices. In the\nLennard-Jones case with exponents $3<m<n$, the ground state among lattices is\nconfirmed to be a FCC lattice whereas a HCP phase occurs once added to the\ninvestigated structures. Furthermore, phase transitions of type ``FCC-SH\" and\n``FCC-HCP-SH\" (when the HCP lattice is added) as the inverse density $V$\nincreases are observed for a large spectrum of exponents $(n,m)$. In the SH\nphase, the variation of the ratio $\\Delta$ between the inter-layer distance $d$\nand the lattice parameter $a$ is studied as $V$ increases. In the critical\nregion of exponents $0<m<n<3$, the SH phase with an extreme value of the\nanisotropy parameter $\\Delta$ dominates.

We identify trading platform\ntechnical issues of one of the world's leading online trading providers and\ncalculate retail traders losses caused by these issues. To do this, we\nindependently record each trade details using the REST API response provided by\nthe broker. We show traders log activity files is the only way to assess any\nsuspected profit or loss manipulation by the broker. Therefore, it is essential\nfor any retail trader to have access to their log files. We compare our\nfindings with broker's Trustpilot customer reviews. We illustrate how traders'\nprofit and loss can be negatively affected by broker's platform technical\nissues such as not being able to close profitable trades, closing trades with\ndelays, disappearance of trades, disappearance of profit from clients\nstatements, profit and loss discrepancies, stop loss not being triggered, stop\nloss or limit order triggered too early. Although regulatory bodies try to\nensure that consumers get a fair deal, these attempts are hugely insufficient\nin protecting retail traders. Therefore, regulatory bodies such as the FCA\nshould take these technical issues seriously and not rely on brokers' internal\ninvestigations, because under any other circumstances, these platform\nmanipulations would be considered as crimes and connivingly misappropriating\nfunds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 14:47:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

Special points in this space correspond to\nsetting some terminals to the phase 0 and the rest to the phase of $\\pi$. For a\ngeneric nanostructure, three distinct spectra come together in the vicinity of\na special point: two gapped phases of different topology and a gapless phase\nseparating the two by virtue of topological protection.\n  In this paper, we show that a weak interaction manifesting as quantum\nfluctuations of superconducting phases drastically changes the spectrum in a\nnarrow vicinity of a special point.

We identify\nthe domains of strong coupling where the perturbation theory does not work. In\nthe gapless phase, we find the logarithmic divergence of the first-order\ncorrections.

However, many\ntravellers prefer to avoid risky or unpleasant road conditions such as roads\nwith high crime rates (e.g., robberies, kidnapping, riots etc.) and bumpy\nroads. To facilitate safe travel, we introduce a novel query for road networks\ncalled the k safest nearby neighbors (kSNN) query. Given a query location\n$v_l$, a distance constraint $d_c$ and a point of interest $p_i$, we define the\nsafest path from $v_l$ to $p_i$ as the path with the highest path safety score\namong all the paths from $v_l$ to $p_i$ with length less than $d_c$. The path\nsafety score is computed considering the road safety of each road segment on\nthe path. Given a query location $v_l$, a distance constraint $d_c$ and a set\nof POIs P, a kSNN query returns k POIs with the k highest path safety scores in\nP along with their respective safest paths from the query location.

Machine Learning has become a popular tool to\nperform wind-speed and power predictions. However, the existing approaches have\nseveral limitations. These include (i) insufficient consideration of\nspatio-temporal correlations in wind-speed data, (ii) a lack of existing\nmethodologies to quantify the uncertainty of wind speed prediction and its\npropagation to the wind-power estimation, and (iii) a focus on less than hourly\nfrequencies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a framework to\nreconstruct a spatio-temporal field on a regular grid from irregularly\ndistributed wind-speed measurements.

An accurate prediction of the most likely\nindividual disease progression can improve the planning of limited resources\nand finding the optimal treatment for patients.

The unsupervised open domain\nadaption for generating realistic photos from a hand-drawn sketch is\nchallenging as there is no such sketch of that class for training data. The\nabsence of learning supervision and the huge domain gap between both the\nfreehand drawing and picture domains make it hard. We present an approach that\nlearns both sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch generation to synthesise the\nmissing freehand drawings from pictures. Due to the domain gap between\nsynthetic sketches and genuine ones, the generator trained on false drawings\nmay produce unsatisfactory results when dealing with drawings of lacking\nclasses. To address this problem, we offer a simple but effective open-domain\nsampling and optimization method that tricks the generator into considering\nfalse drawings as genuine. Our approach generalises the learnt sketch-to-photo\nand photo-to-sketch mappings from in-domain input to open-domain categories. On\nthe Scribble and SketchyCOCO datasets, we compared our technique to the most\ncurrent competing methods. For many types of open-domain drawings, our model\noutperforms impressive results in synthesising accurate colour, substance, and\nretaining the structural layout.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 18:21:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 06:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

These variations make person\nRe-Identification (ReID) a challenging problem. Nevertheless, human attributes\nusually stand as robust visual properties to such variations. In this paper, we\npropose a new method to leverage features from human attributes for person\nReID. Our model uses a tensor to non-linearly fuse identity and attribute\nfeatures, and then forces the parameters of the tensor in the loss function to\ngenerate discriminative fused features for ReID. Since tensor-based methods\nusually contain a large number of parameters, training all of these parameters\nbecomes very slow, and the chance of overfitting increases as well. To address\nthis issue, we propose two new techniques based on Structural Sparsity Learning\n(SSL) and Tensor Decomposition (TD) methods to create an accurate and stable\nlearning problem. We conducted experiments on several standard pedestrian\ndatasets, and experimental results indicate that our tensor-based approach\nsignificantly improves person ReID baselines and also outperforms state of the\nart methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 04:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Facial image datasets\nare usually annotated by some commonly used attributes (e.g., gender), while\nlabels for the other attributes (e.g., big nose) are limited which causes their\nprediction challenging. To address this problem, we use a new Multi-Task\nLearning (MTL) paradigm in which a facial attribute predictor uses the\nknowledge of other related attributes to obtain a better generalization\nperformance. Here, we leverage MLT paradigm in two problem settings. First, it\nis assumed that the structure of the tasks (e.g., grouping pattern of facial\nattributes) is known as a prior knowledge, and parameters of the tasks (i.e.,\npredictors) within the same group are represented by a linear combination of a\nlimited number of underlying basis tasks. Here, a sparsity constraint on the\ncoefficients of this linear combination is also considered such that each task\nis represented in a more structured and simpler manner. Second, it is assumed\nthat the structure of the tasks is unknown, and then structure and parameters\nof the tasks are learned jointly by using a Laplacian regularization framework.\nOur MTL methods are compared with competing methods for facial attribute\nprediction to show its effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 08:38:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 01:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}
