However, the exploration of the posterior, which is done via Markov\nchain Monte Carlo sampling, is numerically expensive, which makes the analysis\nof large data sets unfeasible.

All prior art on\nrandomized smoothing has focused on isotropic $\\ell_p$ certification, which has\nthe advantage of yielding certificates that can be easily compared among\nisotropic methods via $\\ell_p$-norm radius. However, isotropic certification\nlimits the region that can be certified around an input to worst-case\nadversaries, i.e., it cannot reason about other \"close\", potentially large,\nconstant prediction safe regions. To alleviate this issue, (i) we theoretically\nextend the isotropic randomized smoothing $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ certificates to\ntheir generalized anisotropic counterparts following a simplified analysis.\nMoreover, (ii) we propose evaluation metrics allowing for the comparison of\ngeneral certificates - a certificate is superior to another if it certifies a\nsuperset region - with the quantification of each certificate through the\nvolume of the certified region. We introduce ANCER, a framework for obtaining\nanisotropic certificates for a given test set sample via volume maximization.\nWe achieve it by generalizing memory-based certification of data-dependent\nclassifiers.

We also introduced a novel technique to assign photometric redshift\nfor simulated galaxies, following a two-dimensional probability distribution\nwith VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) data. The calibration\nwas designed to match the observed abundance of galaxies as a function of\nphotometric redshift, the distribution of photometric redshift errors, and the\nclustering amplitude on scales smaller than those used for BAO measurements.

Suppression of speckle\nnoise is the key goal of wavefront control and adaptive optics (AO),\ncoronagraphy, and a host of post-processing techniques. Speckles average at a\nrate set by the statistical speckle lifetime, and speckle-limited integration\ntime in long exposures is directly proportional to this lifetime. As progress\ncontinues in post-coronagraph wavefront control, residual atmospheric speckles\nwill become the limiting noise source in high-contrast imaging, so a complete\nunderstanding of their statistical behavior is crucial to optimizing\nhigh-contrast imaging instruments. Here we present a novel power spectral\ndensity (PSD) method for calculating the lifetime, and develop a semi-analytic\nmethod for predicting intensity PSDs behind a coronagraph. Considering a\nfrozen-flow turbulence model, we analyze the residual atmosphere speckle\nlifetimes in a MagAO-X-like AO system as well as 25--39 m giant segmented\nmirror telescope (GSMT) scale systems. We find that standard AO control\nshortens atmospheric speckle lifetime from ~130 ms to ~50 ms, and predictive\ncontrol will further shorten the lifetime to ~20 ms on 6.5 m MagAO-X. We find\nthat speckle lifetimes vary with diameter, wind speed, seeing, and location\nwithin the AO control region. On bright stars lifetimes remain within a rough\nrange of ~20 ms to ~100 ms. Due to control system dynamics there are no simple\nscaling laws which apply across a wide range of system characteristics.\nFinally, we use these results to argue that telemetry-based post-processing\nshould enable ground-based telescopes to achieve the photon-noise limit in\nhigh-contrast imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 18:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

In this\npaper we consider conditions resembling giant molecular clouds (GMCs), HII\nregions, and distributed starbursts, where optical depths are modest,\nsingle-scattering effects dominate radiation-dust coupling, Lorentz forces\ndominate over drag on grains, and the fastest-growing RDIs are similar, such as\nmagnetosonic and fast-gyro RDIs. These RDIs generically produce strong\nsize-dependent dust clustering, growing nonlinear on timescales that are much\nshorter than the characteristic times of the outflow. The instabilities produce\nfilamentary and plume-like or 'horsehead' nebular morphologies that are\nremarkably similar to observed dust structures in GMCs and HII regions.\nAdditionally, in some cases they strongly alter the magnetic field structure\nand topology relative to filaments. Despite driving strong micro-scale dust\nclumping which leaves some gas behind, an order-unity fraction of the gas is\nalways efficiently entrained by dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 18:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 03:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

In the mammalian brain, time is\nrepresented by populations of neurons with temporal receptive fields.\nCritically, the peaks of the receptive fields form a geometric series, such\nthat the population codes a set of temporal basis functions over log time.\nBecause memory for the recent past is a function of log time, rescaling the\ninput results in translation of the memory.

Elastic\nsheets are modeled with a continuum model that accounts for in-plane\ndeformation and out-of-plane bending, and the fluid motion is computed using\nthe method of regularized Stokeslets. We explore two types of sheets: \"stiff\"\nsheets that strongly resist bending deformations and always stay flat, and\n\"flexible\" sheets with both in-plane and out-of plane deformability that can\nwrinkle. For stiff sheets, we observe a coil-stretch-like transition, similar\nto what has been observed for long-chain linear polymers under extension as\nwell as elastic sheets under planar extension: in a certain range of capillary\nnumber (flow strength relative to in-plane deformability), the sheets exhibit\neither a compact or a highly stretched conformation, depending on deformation\nhistory. For flexible sheets, sheets with sufficiently small bending stiffness\nwrinkle to form various conformations. Here, the compact-stretched bistability\nstill occurs, but is strongly modified by the wrinkling instability: a\nhighly-stretched planar state can become unstable and wrinkle, after which it\nmay dramatically shrink in length due to hydrodynamic screening associated with\nwrinkling.

The basic\ndemand of the proposal consists in setting a relational system (D, S), where S\nis a reflexive relation compatible with the preferential order of the set of\nclasses, and D is a transitive relation such that D is a subset of S. Different\nordinal classification methods can be derived from diverse model of preferences\nfulfilling the basic conditions on S and D. Two complementary assignment\nprocedures compose each method, which correspond through the transposition\noperation and should be used complementarily. The methods work under relatively\nslight conditions on the representative actions and satisfy several fundamental\nproperties. ELECTRE TRI-nC, INTERCLASS-nC, and the hierarchical ELECTRE TRI-nC\nwith interacting criteria, can be considered as particular cases of this\ngeneral framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 20:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

For PROM, the GPS\nprovides a probabilistic prediction at a new parameter point that retains the\naccuracy of local reduced models, at a computational complexity that does not\ndepend on system dimension, and thus is suitable for online computation.

Thus the values for some of the coalitions are not known. The main\nfocus of this paper is the class of 1-convex cooperative games under this\nframework.\n  We are interested in two heavily intertwined questions. First, given an\nincomplete game, in which ways can we fill in the missing values to obtain a\nclassical 1-convex game? Such complete games are called \\emph{1-convex\nextensions}. For the class of minimal incomplete games (in which precisely the\nvalues of singletons and grand coalitions are known), we provide an answer in\nterms of a description of the set of 1-convex extensions. The description\nemploys extreme points and extreme rays of the set.\n  Second, how to determine in a rational, fair, and efficient way the payoffs\nof players based only on the known values of coalitions? Based on the\ndescription of the set of 1-convex extensions, we introduce generalisations of\nthree solution concepts (values) for complete games, namely the $\\tau$-value,\nthe Shapley value and the nucleolus. We consider two variants where we compute\nthe centre of gravity of either extreme games or of a combination of extreme\ngames and extreme rays. We show that all of the generalised values coincide for\nminimal incomplete games which allows to introduce the \\emph{average value}.\nFor this value, we provide three different axiomatisations based on axiomatic\ncharacterisations of the $\\tau$-value and the Shapley value for classical\ncooperative games.\n  Finally, we turn our attention to \\emph{incomplete games with defined upper\nvector}, asking the same questions and this time arriving to different\nconclusions.

Otherwise, A is\nprime. This notion of primality was introduced by Kupferman and Mosheiff in\n2013, and while they proved that we can decide whether a DFA is composite, the\nprecise complexity of this problem is still open, with a doubly-exponential gap\nbetween the upper and lower bounds. In this work, we focus on permutation DFAs,\ni.e., those for which the transition monoid is a group. We provide an NP\nalgorithm to decide whether a permutation DFA is composite, and show that the\ndifficulty of this problem comes from the number of non-accepting states of the\ninstance: we give a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm with the number of\nrejecting states as the parameter. Moreover, we investigate the class of\ncommutative permutation DFAs. Their structural properties allow us to decide\ncompositionality in NLOGSPACE, and even in LOGSPACE if the alphabet size is\nfixed. Despite this low complexity, we show that complex behaviors still arise\nin this class: we provide a family of composite DFAs each requiring\npolynomially many factors with respect to its size. We also consider the\nvariant of the problem that asks whether a DFA is k-factor composite, that is,\ndecomposable into k smaller DFAs, for some given integer k. We show that, for\ncommutative permutation DFAs, restricting the number of factors makes the\ndecision computationally harder, and yields a problem with tight bounds: it is\nNP-complete. Finally, we show that in general, this problem is in PSPACE, and\nit is in LOGSPACE for DFAs with a singleton alphabet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 21:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

In this region, collisions between the plasma and neutral\nmolecules allow currents to flow across B, enabling the entire\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere current system to close. These same currents cause\nstrong DC electric fields in the E-region ionosphere where they drive plasma\ninstabilities, including the Farley-Buneman instability (FBI). These\ninstabilities give rise to small-scale plasma turbulence that modifies the\nlarge-scale ionospheric conductance that, in turn, affects the evolution of the\nentire near-Earth plasma environment. Also, during geomagnetic storms,\nprecipitating electrons of high energies, $\\gtrsim$ 5 keV, frequently penetrate\ndown to the same regions where intense currents and E fields develop. This\nresearch examines the effects of precipitating electrons on the generation of\nthe FBI and shows that, under many common conditions, it can easily suppress\nthe instability in a predictable manner. Therefore, we expect precipitation to\nexert a significant feedback on the magnetosphere by preventing the elevated\nconductivity caused by FBI driven turbulence. This suppression should be taken\ninto account in global modeling of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 22:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Can they efficiently compute MAJORITY and other symmetric\nfunctions? When $m$ is a constant prime power, the answer is well understood:\nRazborov and Smolensky proved in the 1980s that MAJORITY and $MOD_m$ require\nsuper-polynomial-size $MOD_q$ circuits, where $q$ is any prime power not\ndividing $m$. However, relatively little is known about the power of $MOD_m$\ncircuits for non-prime-power $m$. For example, it is still open whether every\nproblem in $EXP$ can be computed by depth-$3$ circuits of polynomial size and\nonly $MOD_6$ gates.\n  We shed some light on the difficulty of proving lower bounds for $MOD_m$\ncircuits, by giving new upper bounds. We construct $MOD_m$ circuits computing\nsymmetric functions with non-prime power $m$, with size-depth tradeoffs that\nbeat the longstanding lower bounds for $AC^0[m]$ circuits for prime power $m$.\nOur size-depth tradeoff circuits have essentially optimal dependence on $m$ and\n$d$ in the exponent, under a natural circuit complexity hypothesis.\n  For example, we show for every $\\varepsilon > 0$ that every symmetric\nfunction can be computed with depth-3 $MOD_m$ circuits of\n$\\exp(O(n^{\\varepsilon}))$ size, for a constant $m$ depending only on\n$\\varepsilon > 0$.

For each subgame, an evasion region (ER) is\nintroduced, based on which a pursuit strategy guaranteeing the winning of a\nsimple-motion pursuer under specific conditions is proposed. Motivated by the\nsimple-motion pursuer, a strategy for a Dubins-car pursuer is proposed when the\npursuer-evader configuration satisfies separation condition (SC) and\ninterception orientation (IO). The necessary and sufficient condition on\ncapture radius, minimum turning radius and speed ratio to guarantee the pursuit\nwinning is derived. When the IO is not satisfied (Non-IO), a heading adjustment\npursuit strategy is proposed, and the condition to achieve IO within a finite\ntime, is given. Then, a two-step pursuit strategy is proposed for the SC and\nNon-IO case. A non-convex optimization problem is introduced to give a\ncondition guaranteeing the winning of the pursuer. A polynomial equation gives\na lower bound of the non-convex problem, providing a sufficient and efficient\npursuit winning condition. Finally, these pairwise outcomes are collected for\nthe pursuer-evader matching. Simulations are provided to illustrate the\ntheoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 22:54:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Understanding how data constraints are\nimplemented is essential for testing, debugging, and software change.\nUnfortunately, there are no widely-accepted guidelines or best practices on how\nto implement data constraints.\n  This paper presents an empirical study that investigates how data constraints\nare implemented in Java. We study the implementation of 187 data constraints\nextracted from the documentation of eight real-world Java software systems.\nFirst, we perform a qualitative analysis of the textual description of data\nconstraints and identify four data constraint types. Second, we manually\nidentify the implementations of these data constraints and reveal that they can\nbe grouped into 30 implementation patterns. The analysis of these\nimplementation patterns indicates that developers prefer a handful of patterns\nwhen implementing data constraints and deviations from these patterns are\nassociated with unusual implementation decisions or code smells. Third, we\ndevelop a tool-assisted protocol that allows us to identify 256 additional\ntrace links for the data constraints implemented using the 13 most common\npatterns.

The characteristic size dependence of phonon thermal transport\nreveals an intriguing collective phonon transport regime, located in between\nthe ballistic and the diffusive transport regimes. Therefore, systematic\ninvestigations have been carried out to describe the signatures of phonon\nhydrodynamics via the competitive effects between grain size and temperature. A\ncharacteristic nonlocal length associated with phonon hydrodynamics and a heat\nwave propagation length has been extracted. The connections between phonon\nhydrodynamics and these length scales are discussed in terms of the Knudsen\nnumber. Further, the scaling relation of thermal conductivity as a function of\ncharacteristic size in the intermediate size range emerges as a crucial\nindicator of the strength of the hydrodynamic behavior. A ratio concerning\nnormal and resistive scattering rates has been employed to understand these\ndifferent scaling relations, which seems to control the strength and prominent\nvisibility of the collective phonon transport in GeTe. This systematic\ninvestigation emphasizes the importance of the competitive effects between\ntemperature and characteristic size on phonon hydrodynamics in GeTe, which can\nlead to a better understanding of the generic behavior and consequences of the\nphonon hydrodynamics and its controlling parameters in low-thermal conductivity\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 01:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Then, eventually,\nthey start overfitting on noisy labels due to their memorization ability, which\nlimits FER performance. This work proposes an effective training strategy in\nthe presence of noisy labels, called as Consensual Collaborative Training (CCT)\nframework. CCT co-trains three networks jointly using a convex combination of\nsupervision loss and consistency loss, without making any assumption about the\nnoise distribution. A dynamic transition mechanism is used to move from\nsupervision loss in early learning to consistency loss for consensus of\npredictions among networks in the later stage. Inference is done using a single\nnetwork based on a simple knowledge distillation scheme. Effectiveness of the\nproposed framework is demonstrated on synthetic as well as real noisy FER\ndatasets. In addition, a large test subset of around 5K images is annotated\nfrom the FEC dataset using crowd wisdom of 16 different annotators and reliable\nlabels are inferred. CCT is also validated on it. State-of-the-art performance\nis reported on the benchmark FER datasets RAFDB (90.84%) FERPlus (89.99%) and\nAffectNet (66%).

Meanwhile,\nowing to deficiency of single-antenna and single-anchor RSSI, which only\nindicates a coarse-grained distance information between a receiver and a\ntransmitter, realizing localization with single-antenna and single-anchor RSSI\nis challenging. Our key idea to address this challenge is to leverage CV\ntechnique and to estimate the most likely first Fresnel zone (FFZ) between the\nreceiver and transmitter, where the role of the RSSI is to detect blockage\ntimings. Specifically, historical positions of an obstacle that dynamically\nblocks the FFZ are detected by the CV technique, and we estimate positions at\nwhich a blockage starts and ends via a time series of RSSI.

As such, the overall process of\nlearning concept hierarchies from corpora encompasses a set of steps: parsing\nthe text into sentences, splitting the sentences and then tokenising it. After\nthe lemmatisation step, the pairs are extracted using FCA. However, there might\nbe some uninteresting and erroneous pairs in the formal context. Generating\nformal context may lead to a time-consuming process, so formal context size\nreduction is required to remove uninterested and erroneous pairs, taking less\ntime to extract the concept lattice and concept hierarchies accordingly. In\nthis premise, this study aims to propose two frameworks: (1) A framework to\nreview the current process of deriving concept hierarchies from corpus\nutilising FCA; (2) A framework to decrease the formal contexts ambiguity of the\nfirst framework using an adaptive version of ECA*. Experiments are conducted by\napplying 385 sample corpora from Wikipedia on the two frameworks to examine the\nreducing size of formal context, which leads to yield concept lattice and\nconcept hierarchy. The resulting lattice of formal context is evaluated to the\nstandard one using concept lattice-invariants. Accordingly, the homomorphic\nbetween the two lattices preserves the quality of resulting concept hierarchies\nby 89% in contrast to the basic ones, and the reduced concept lattice inherits\nthe structural relation of the standard one. The adaptive ECA* is examined\nagainst its four counterpart baseline algorithms to measure the execution time\non random datasets with different densities (fill ratios). The results show\nthat adaptive ECA* performs concept lattice faster than other mentioned\ncompetitive techniques in different fill ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 07:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Here we propose\nthe reactive force field for nucleation systems with good size scalability\nbased on deep neural network. The huge computational costs from direct\nmolecular dynamics in ambient conditions are surmounted by bridging the\nsimulation in the limited box with cluster kinetics, facilitating the aerosol\nnucleation simulation to be fully ab initio.

These findings show that the widely\nrecognized acid-base nucleation observed in the CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor\nDroplets) chamber experiments, pristine and polluted environments should be\nrevisited to considering the contribution of collision enhancement.

In clinical settings,\nit is difficult to collect enough annotated target domain data in a short\nperiod. Few-shot domain adaptation, i.e., adapting a trained model with a\nhandful of annotations, is highly practical and useful in this case. In this\npaper, we propose a Polymorphic Transformer (Polyformer), which can be\nincorporated into any DNN backbones for few-shot domain adaptation.\nSpecifically, after the polyformer layer is inserted into a model trained on\nthe source domain, it extracts a set of prototype embeddings, which can be\nviewed as a \"basis\" of the source-domain features. On the target domain, the\npolyformer layer adapts by only updating a projection layer which controls the\ninteractions between image features and the prototype embeddings. All other\nmodel weights (except BatchNorm parameters) are frozen during adaptation. Thus,\nthe chance of overfitting the annotations is greatly reduced, and the model can\nperform robustly on the target domain after being trained on a few annotated\nimages.

Real experiments show that the attack can\naffect the end devices in large areas up to about $50,000\\,\\text{m}^2$. In a\nbroader sense, the attack threatens any system functions requiring timely\ndeliveries of LoRaWAN frames. To address this threat, we propose a\n$\\mathsf{LoRaTS}$ gateway design that integrates a commodity LoRaWAN gateway\nand a low-power software-defined radio receiver to track the inherent frequency\nbiases of the end devices.

To address this crafty attack,\nwe propose a pseudorandom interval hopping scheme to enhance our frequency bias\ntracking approach.

We study BCP on c-claw-free graphs, the class of graphs that\ndo not have $K_{1,c}$ as an induced subgraph, and present efficient\n(c-1)-approximation algorithms for both objectives.

In particular, migrating code to these languages is\nchallenging. Gradual typing can make dependently-typed languages easier to use\nby mixing static and dynamic checking in a principled way. With gradual types,\nprogrammers can incrementally migrate code to a dependently typed language.\n  However, adding gradual types to dependent types creates a new challenge:\nmixing decidable type-checking and incremental migration in a full-featured\nlanguage is a precarious balance. Programmers expect type-checking to\nterminate, but dependent type-checkers evaluate terms at compile time, which is\nproblematic because gradual types can introduce non-termination into an\notherwise terminating language. Steps taken to mitigate this non-termination\nmust not jeopardize the smooth transitions between dynamic and static.\n  We present a gradual dependently-typed language that supports inductive type\nfamilies, has decidable type-checking, and provably supports smooth migration\nbetween static and dynamic, as codified by the refined criteria for gradual\ntyping proposed by Siek et al. (2015). Like Eremondi et al. (2019), we use\napproximate normalization for terminating compile-time evaluation. Unlike\nEremondi et al., our normalization does not require comparison of variables,\nallowing us to show termination with a syntactic model that accommodates\ninductive types. Moreover, we design a novel a technique for tracking\nconstraints on type indices, so that dynamic constraint violations signal\nrun-time errors eagerly. To facilitate these checks, we define an algebraic\nnotion of gradual precision, axiomatizing certain semantic properties of\ngradual terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 15:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

We investigate the detector's response which contains non-Markovian\ninformation about the quantum field squeezed by the dynamical spacetime. The\nchallenge is in the memory effects accumulated over the evolutionary history.\nWe first consider a detector $W$, the `\\textsl{Witness}', which co-existed and\nevolved with the quantum field from the beginning.

People can reason not only in\nfamiliar domains, but can also rapidly learn to reason through novel problems\nand situations, raising the question of how well modern neural network models\ncapture human intelligence and in which ways they diverge. In this work, we\nexplore this gap by investigating human adults' ability to learn an abstract\nreasoning task based on Sudoku from a brief instructional tutorial with\nexplanatory feedback for incorrect responses using a narrow range of training\nexamples. We find that participants who master the task do so within a small\nnumber of trials and generalize well to puzzles outside of the training range.\nWe also find that most of those who master the task can describe a valid\nsolution strategy, and such participants perform better on transfer puzzles\nthan those whose strategy descriptions are vague or incomplete.

These issues lead to difficulty in, for example motion feature\nextraction, activity classification using micro Doppler signatures ($\\mu$-DS),\netc. In this paper, we propose a latent feature-wise mapping strategy, called\nFeature Mapping Network (FMNet), to transform measured spectrograms so that\nthey more closely resemble the output from a simulation under the same\nconditions. Based on measured spectrogram and the matched simulated data, our\nframework contains three parts: an Encoder which is used to extract latent\nrepresentations/features, a Decoder outputs reconstructed spectrogram according\nto the latent features, and a Discriminator minimizes the distance of latent\nfeatures of measured and simulated data.

The solutions\nadopted to this task are expensive in general, involving trial-and-error\nprocedures or expert knowledge which are not always available. In this work, we\ninvestigated the use of meta-learning to the optimization of ANNs.\nMeta-learning is a research field aiming to automatically acquiring knowledge\nwhich relates features of the learning problems to the performance of the\nlearning algorithms. The meta-learning techniques were originally proposed and\nevaluated to the algorithm selection problem and after to the optimization of\nparameters for Support Vector Machines. However, meta-learning can be adopted\nas a more general strategy to optimize ANN parameters, which motivates new\nefforts in this research direction. In the current work, we performed a case\nstudy using meta-learning to choose the number of hidden nodes for MLP\nnetworks, which is an important parameter to be defined aiming a good networks\nperformance. In our work, we generated a base of meta-examples associated to 93\nregression problems. Each meta-example was generated from a regression problem\nand stored: 16 features describing the problem (e.g., number of attributes and\ncorrelation among the problem attributes) and the best number of nodes for this\nproblem, empirically chosen from a range of possible values. This set of\nmeta-examples was given as input to a meta-learner which was able to predict\nthe best number of nodes for new problems based on their features. The\nexperiments performed in this case study revealed satisfactory results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 15:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}
