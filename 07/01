Unfortunately,\nconfiguring RMIs involves setting several hyperparameters, the enumeration of\nwhich is often too time-consuming in practice. Therefore, in this work, we\nconduct the first inventor-independent broad analysis of RMIs with the goal of\nunderstanding the impact of each hyperparameter on performance. In particular,\nwe show that in addition to model types and layer size, error bounds and search\nalgorithms must be considered to achieve the best possible performance. Based\non our findings, we develop a simple-to-follow guideline for configuring RMIs.\nWe evaluate our guideline by comparing the resulting RMIs with a number of\nstate-of-the-art indexes, both learned and traditional. We show that our simple\nguideline is sufficient to achieve competitive performance with other learned\nindexes and RMIs whose configuration was determined using an expensive\nenumeration procedure. In addition, while carefully reimplementing RMIs, we are\nable to improve the build time by 2.5x to 6.3x.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 16:00:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 11:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

Over the past few decades, a large body\nof works studied the (in)tractability of various computational problems on grid\ngraphs, which often yield substantially faster algorithms than general graphs.\nUnfortunately, the recognition of a grid graph is particularly hard -- it was\nshown to be NP-hard even on trees of pathwidth 3 already in 1987. Yet, in this\npaper, we provide several positive results in this regard in the framework of\nparameterized complexity (additionally, we present new and complementary\nhardness results). Specifically, our contribution is threefold. First, we show\nthat the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by $k+\\mathsf\n{mcc}$ where $\\mathsf{mcc}$ is the maximum size of a connected component of\n$G$. This also implies that the problem is FPT parameterized by $\\mathtt{td}+k$\nwhere $\\mathtt{td}$ is the treedepth of $G$ (to be compared with the hardness\nfor pathwidth 2 where $k=3$). Further, we derive as a corollary that strip\npacking is FPT with respect to the height of the strip plus the maximum of the\ndimensions of the packed rectangles, which was previously only known to be in\nXP. Second, we present a new parameterization, denoted $a_G$, relating graph\ndistance to geometric distance, which may be of independent interest. We show\nthat the problem is para-NP-hard parameterized by $a_G$, but FPT parameterized\nby $a_G$ on trees, as well as FPT parameterized by $k+a_G$. Third, we show that\nthe recognition of $k\\times r$ grid graphs is NP-hard on graphs of pathwidth 2\nwhere $k=3$.

Elimination trees appear in\nmany guises in computer science and discrete mathematics, and they encode many\ninteresting combinatorial objects, such as bitstrings, permutations and binary\ntrees. We apply the recent Hartung-Hoang-M\\\"utze-Williams combinatorial\ngeneration framework to elimination trees, and prove that all elimination trees\nfor a chordal graph $G$ can be generated by tree rotations using a simple\ngreedy algorithm. This yields a short proof for the existence of Hamilton paths\non graph associahedra of chordal graphs. Graph associahedra are a general class\nof high-dimensional polytopes introduced by Carr, Devadoss, and Postnikov,\nwhose vertices correspond to elimination trees and whose edges correspond to\ntree rotations. As special cases of our results, we recover several classical\nGray codes for bitstrings, permutations and binary trees, and we obtain a new\nGray code for partial permutations.

Successful behavioral\nadaptation depends on internal models the brain builds to represent the\nrelational structure of an abstract task. Emerging evidence suggests that the\nwell-known roles of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (HC-EC) in\nintegrating spatial relationships into cognitive maps can be extended to map\nthe transition structure between states in non-spatial abstract tasks. However,\nwhat the EC grid-codes actually compute to afford generalization remains\nelusive. We introduce two non-exclusive ideas regarding what grid-codes may\nrepresent to afford higher-level cognition. One idea is that grid-codes are\neigenvectors of the successor representation (SR) learned online during a task.\nThis view assumes that the grid codes serve as an efficient basis function for\nlearning and representing experienced relationships between entities.\nSubsequently, the grid codes facilitate generalization in novel contexts such\nas when the goal changes. The second idea is that the grid-codes reflect the\ninferred global task structure. This view assumes that the grid-code represents\na structural code that is factorized from specific sensory content, enabling\nstructural information to be transferred across tasks. Subsequently, the brain\ncould afford one-shot inferences without requiring experience. The ability to\ngeneralize experiences and make appropriate decisions in novel situations is\ncritical for both animals and machines.

One crucial impediment of these searches is the limited ability to\nreconstruct the parents' separate boosts.

However, in real decentralised\napplications, agents only have partial observation capabilities. Under limited\ninformation, agents rely on communication to divulge some of their private (and\nunobservable) information to others. When an agent deliberates to resolve\nconflicts, limited knowledge may cause its perspective of a correct outcome to\ndiffer from the actual outcome of the conflict resolution. This is subjective\nunfairness.\n  To enable decentralised, fairness-aware conflict resolution under privacy\nconstraints, we have two contributions: (1) a novel interaction approach and\n(2) a formalism of the relationship between privacy and fairness. Our proposed\ninteraction approach is an architecture for privacy-aware explainable conflict\nresolution where agents engage in a dialogue of hypotheses and facts. To\nmeasure the privacy-fairness relationship, we define subjective and objective\nfairness on both the local and global scope and formalise the impact of partial\nobservability due to privacy in these different notions of fairness.\n  We first study our proposed architecture and the privacy-fairness\nrelationship in the abstract, testing different argumentation strategies on a\nlarge number of randomised cultures.

In this experiment, two participants were asked to respond to a\nyes or no question via an EEG-based BCI of three different types; SSVEP-based,\nmotor imagery-based, and laryngeal-imagery-based.

As clients perform local\nupdates on heterogeneous data through heterogeneous systems, their local models\ndrift apart.

Of particular\ninterest in this work is the possibility of high-temperature superconductivity.\nComparing calculations of the superconducting critical temperatures of the\nsolid phase to melting temperatures over a range of pressures leads to an\ninteresting question: Will the solid, in a superconducting state, melt to a\nliquid that remains a superconductor? In this work, the possibility of liquid\nsuperconductivity in metallic hydrogen is investigated. This is done by\nfirst-principles simulations, and using the results of these to solve the\nEliashberg equations. These are carried out over the pressure (and temperature)\nconditions where molecular dissociation is expected to first occur in the solid\nphase. Over the pressure range $386.8(4)$--$783.7(4)$ GPa, $T_c$ increases from\n$308(6)$ to $372(2)$ K with a maximum uncertainty of $10$ K; it then decreases\nto $356(2)$ K at $883.7(3)$ GPa. Comparisons to the solid phase show that the\ncritical temperature is not significantly changed between the two phases,\nthough the physics behind their superconductivity is different. Careful\ncomparisons of these values to recent results in the context of the hydrogen\nphase diagram show that they are higher than the melting temperatures and that\nthe solid will melt to liquid atomic hydrogen. The results of this work (in\nthis context) therefore suggest that liquid atomic hydrogen will indeed exist\nin a superconducting state.

Conventional adaptation\nstrategies that customize AM expect well-matched data for the target domain\nwith gold-standard transcriptions. We propose a cost-effective method of using\nCC scores to select an optimal adaptation data set, where we maximize ASR gains\nfrom minimal data. We study data in various confidence ranges and optimally\nchoose data for AM adaptation with KL-Divergence regularization. On the\nMicrosoft voice search task, data selection for supervised adaptation using the\nsequence-level confidence scores achieves word error rate reduction (WERR) of\n8.5% for row-convolution LSTM (RC-LSTM) and 5.2% for latency-controlled\nbidirectional LSTM (LC-BLSTM). In the semi-supervised case, with ASR hypotheses\nas labels, our method provides WERR of 5.9% and 2.8% for RC-LSTM and LC-BLSTM,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 20:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

Because there is in general no guarantee that\nmachine learning produces robot programs that are free of surprising behavior,\nthe safe execution of a robot program must utilize monitoring modules that take\nsensor data as inputs in real time to ensure the correctness of the skill\nexecution. Owing to the fact that sensors and monitoring algorithms are usually\nsubject to physical restrictions and that effective robot programming is\nsensitive to the selection of skill parameters, these considerations may lead\nto different sensor input qualities such as the view coverage of a vision\nsystem that determines whether a skill can be successfully deployed in\nperforming a task.

The free\nenergy principle is a general mathematical theory of the necessary\ninformation-theoretic behaviours of systems that maintain a separation from\ntheir environment. A core postulate of the theory is that complex systems can\nbe seen as performing variational Bayesian inference and minimizing an\ninformation-theoretic quantity called the variational free energy. The thesis\nis structured into three independent sections. Firstly, we focus on predictive\ncoding, a neurobiologically plausible process theory derived from the free\nenergy principle which argues that the primary function of the brain is to\nminimize prediction errors, showing how predictive coding can be scaled up and\nextended to be more biologically plausible, and elucidating its close links\nwith other methods such as Kalman Filtering. Secondly, we study active\ninference, a neurobiologically grounded account of action through variational\nmessage passing, and investigate how these methods can be scaled up to match\nthe performance of deep reinforcement learning methods. We additionally provide\na detailed mathematical understanding of the nature and origin of the\ninformation-theoretic objectives that underlie exploratory behaviour. Finally,\nwe investigate biologically plausible methods of credit assignment in the\nbrain. We first demonstrate a close link between predictive coding and the\nbackpropagation of error algorithm. We go on to propose novel and simpler\nalgorithms which allow for backprop to be implemented in purely local,\nbiologically plausible computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 22:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

The task assignment is dynamic since it is updated\nat discrete time stages (iterations) to account for the current states of the\nagents as the latter move towards the tasks assigned to them at the previous\nstage.

To explain how net current can be driven in spite of this\nconservation, the literature often appeals to mechanisms that transfer this\nnonresonant recoil momentum to ions, which carry negligible current. However,\nthis explanation does not allow the transport of net charge across magnetic\nfield lines, precluding ExB rotation drive. Here, we show that in steady state,\nthis picture of current drive is incomplete. Using a simple Fresnel model of\nthe plasma, we show that for lower hybrid waves, the electromagnetic energy\nflux (Poynting vector) and momentum flux (Maxwell stress tensor) associated\nwith the evanescent vacuum wave, become the Minkowski energy flux and momentum\nflux in the plasma, and are ultimately transferred to resonant particles. Thus,\nthe torque delivered to the resonant particles is ultimately supplied by the\nelectromagnetic torque from the antenna, allowing the nonresonant recoil\nresponse to vanish and rotation to be driven. We present a warm fluid model\nthat explains how this momentum conservation works out locally, via a Reynolds\nstress that does not appear in the 1D initial value problem. This model is the\nsimplest that can capture both the nonresonant recoil reaction in the\ninitial-value problem, and the absence of a nonresonant recoil in the\nsteady-state boundary value problem, thus forbidding rotation drive in the\nformer while allowing it in the latter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 23:18:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

The\nlight curve of the event, with a peak magnification $A_{\\rm peak}\\sim 800$,\nexhibits two anomaly features, one around the peak and the other on the falling\nside of the light curve. An interpretation with a binary lens and a single\nsource (2L1S) cannot describe the anomalies. By conducting additional modeling\nthat includes an extra lens (3L1S) or an extra source (2L2S) relative to a 2L1S\ninterpretation, we find that 2L2S interpretations with a planetary lens system\nand a binary source best explain the observed light curve with\n$\\Delta\\chi^2\\sim 188$ and $\\sim 91$ over the 2L1S and 3L1S solutions,\nrespectively. Assuming that these $\\Delta\\chi^2$ values are adequate for\ndistinguishing the models, the event is the fourth 2L2S event and the second\n2L2S planetary event. The 2L2S interpretations are subject to a degeneracy,\nresulting in two solutions with $s>1.0$ (wide solution) and $s<1.0$ (close\nsolution).

Most Turing-complete imperative languages share similar\ncontrol- and data-flow structures, which make it possible to transfer knowledge\nlearned from one language to another. In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual\ntransfer learning framework, PLATO, for statistical type inference, which\nallows us to leverage prior knowledge learned from the labeled dataset of one\nlanguage and transfer it to the others, e.g., Python to JavaScript, Java to\nJavaScript, etc. PLATO is powered by a novel kernelized attention mechanism to\nconstrain the attention scope of the backbone Transformer model such that the\nmodel is forced to base its prediction on commonly shared features among\nlanguages. In addition, we propose the syntax enhancement that augments the\nlearning on the feature overlap among language domains. Furthermore, PLATO can\nalso be used to improve the performance of the conventional supervised\nlearning-based type inference by introducing cross-lingual augmentation, which\nenables the model to learn more general features across multiple languages. We\nevaluated PLATO under two settings: 1) under the cross-domain scenario that the\ntarget language data is not labeled or labeled partially, the results show that\nPLATO outperforms the state-of-the-art domain transfer techniques by a large\nmargin, e.g., it improves the Python to TypeScript baseline by +5.40%@EM,\n+5.40%@weighted-F1, and 2) under the conventional monolingual supervised\nlearning based scenario, PLATO improves the Python baseline by +4.40%@EM,\n+3.20%@EM (parametric).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 00:20:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2022 14:50:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2022 04:15:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 02:10:24 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 03:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

This paper presents a\nhierarchical control system to provide ancillary services from a solar PV power\nplant to the grid without the need for additional non-solar resources. With\ncoordinated management of each inverter in the system, the control system\ncommands the power plant to proactively curtail a fraction of its instantaneous\nmaximum power potential, which gives the plant enough headroom to ramp up or\ndown power production from the overall power plant, for a service such as\nregulation reserve, even under changing cloud cover conditions. A case study\nfrom a site in Hawaii with one-second resolution solar irradiance data is used\nto verify the efficacy of the proposed control system. The algorithm is\nsubsequently compared with an alternative control technology from the\nliterature, the grouping control algorithm; the results show that the proposed\nhierarchical control system is over 10 times more effective in reducing\ngenerator mileage to support power fluctuations from solar PV power plants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 00:37:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

The potential of quantum annealers, which are the prototypes\nof adiabatic quantum computers, is yet to be fully explored. In this work, we\ndemonstrate the use of a D-Wave quantum annealer for the calculation of excited\nelectronic states of molecular systems. These simulations play an important\nrole in a number of areas, such as photovoltaics, semiconductor technology and\nnanoscience.

The resulting TDA\neigenvalue equations are solved on a D-Wave quantum annealer using the Quantum\nAnnealer Eigensolver (QAE), developed previously. The method is shown to\nreproduce a typical basis set convergence on the example H$_2$ molecule and is\nalso applied to several other molecular species. Characteristic properties such\nas transition dipole moments and oscillator strengths are computed as well.\nThree potential energy profiles for excited states are computed for NH$_3$ as a\nfunction of the molecular geometry.

Given an electricity retail rate and a set\nof travel demand requests, the optimization minimizes total cost for an\nautonomous EV fleet comprising of travel costs, station procurement costs,\nfleet procurement costs, and electricity costs, including demand charges.\nSpecifically, the optimization returns the number of charging plugs for each\ncharging rate (e.g., Level 2, DC fast charging) at each candidate location, as\nwell as the optimal routing and charging of the fleet. From a case-study of an\nelectric vehicle fleet operating in San Francisco, our results show that,\nalbeit with range limitations, small EVs with low procurement costs and high\nenergy efficiencies are the most cost-effective in terms of total ownership\ncosts. Furthermore, the optimal siting of charging stations is more spatially\ndistributed than the current siting of stations, consisting mainly of\nhigh-power Level 2 AC stations (16.8 kW) with a small share of DC fast charging\nstations and no standard 7.7kW Level 2 stations.

Developing quantum\nkernel function (QKF), which defines the distances among the samples in the\nHilbert space, belongs to the fundamental topics for machine learning. In this\nwork, we propose the rescaled logarithmic fidelity (RLF) and non-parametric\nsemi-supervised learning in the quantum space, which we name as RLF-NSSL. The\nrescaling takes advantage of the non-linearity of the kernel to tune the mutual\ndistances of samples in the Hilbert space, and meanwhile avoids the\nexponentially-small fidelities between quantum many-qubit states. Being\nnon-parametric excludes the possible effects from the variational parameters,\nand evidently demonstrates the advantages from the space itself.

Many existing works take the meta-learning approach, constructing a\nfew-shot learner that can learn from few-shot examples to generate a\nclassifier. Typically, the few-shot learner is constructed or meta-trained by\nsampling multiple few-shot tasks in turn and optimizing the few-shot learner's\nperformance in generating classifiers for those tasks. The performance is\nmeasured by how well the resulting classifiers classify the test (i.e., query)\nexamples of those tasks. In this paper, we point out two potential weaknesses\nof this approach.

Most existing methods tend to define the adjacency matrix among\nsamples manually based on meta-features, and then obtain the node embeddings\nfor downstream tasks by Graph Representation Learning (GRL). However, it is not\neasy for these approaches to generalize to unseen samples. Meanwhile, the\ncomplex correlation between modalities is also ignored. As a result, these\nfactors inevitably yield the inadequacy of providing valid information about\nthe patient's condition for a reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we propose an\nend-to-end Multimodal Graph Learning framework (MMGL) for disease prediction.\nTo effectively exploit the rich information across multi-modality associated\nwith diseases, amodal-attentional multi-modal fusion is proposed to integrate\nthe features of each modality by leveraging the correlation and complementarity\nbetween the modalities. Furthermore, instead of defining the adjacency matrix\nmanually as existing methods, the latent graph structure can be captured\nthrough a novel way of adaptive graph learning. It could be jointly optimized\nwith the prediction model, thus revealing the intrinsic connections among\nsamples. Unlike the previous transductive methods, our model is also applicable\nto the scenario of inductive learning for those unseen data. An extensive group\nof experiments on two disease prediction problems is then carefully designed\nand presented, demonstrating that MMGL obtains more favorable performances. In\naddition, we also visualize and analyze the learned graph structure to provide\nmore reliable decision support for doctors in real medical applications and\ninspiration for disease research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 03:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

To learn the comprehensive and effective\nembedding for job posts and candidates, we have constructed a fused-embedding\nvia different levels of representation learning from raw text, semantic\nentities and location information. The clusters of fused-embedding of job and\ncandidates are then used to build and train the Faiss index that supports\nruntime approximate nearest neighbor search for candidate retrieval. After the\nfirst stage of candidate retrieval, a second stage reranking model that\nutilizes other contextual information was used to generate the final matching\nresult. Both offline and online evaluation results indicate a significant\nimprovement of our proposed two-staged embedding-based system in terms of\nclick-through rate (CTR), quality and normalized discounted accumulated gain\n(nDCG), compared to those obtained from our baseline system. We further\ndescribed the deployment of the system that supports the million-scale job and\ncandidate matching process at CareerBuilder. The overall improvement of our job\nto candidate matching system has demonstrated its feasibility and scalability\nat a major online recruitment site.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 05:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

Let $x = (x_1, ... , x_n)$ (resp., $y = (y_1, ... ,\ny_n)$) be Boolean variables each of which takes the value one if and only if a\nneuron at place $i$ detects a feature (resp., another feature). We then simply\nformulate the feature and conjunction search as Boolean functions ${\\rm\nFTR}_n(x) = \\bigvee_{i=1}^n x_i$ and ${\\rm CONJ}_n(x, y) = \\bigvee_{i=1}^n x_i\n\\wedge y_i$, respectively. We employ a threshold circuit or a discretized\ncircuit (such as a sigmoid circuit or a ReLU circuit with discretization) as\nour models of neural networks, and consider the following four computational\nresources: [i] the number of neurons (size), [ii] the number of levels (depth),\n[iii] the number of active neurons outputting non-zero values (energy), and\n[iv] synaptic weight resolution (weight).\n  We first prove that any threshold circuit $C$ of size $s$, depth $d$, energy\n$e$ and weight $w$ satisfies $\\log rk(M_C) \\le ed (\\log s + \\log w + \\log n)$,\nwhere $rk(M_C)$ is the rank of the communication matrix $M_C$ of a\n$2n$-variable Boolean function that $C$ computes. Since ${\\rm CONJ}_n$ has rank\n$2^n$, we have $n \\le ed (\\log s + \\log w + \\log n)$. Thus, an exponential\nlower bound on the size of even sublinear-depth threshold circuits exists if\nthe energy and weight are sufficiently small. Since ${\\rm FTR}_n$ is computable\nindependently of $n$, our result suggests that computational capacity for the\nfeature and conjunction search are different. We also show that the inequality\nis tight up to a constant factor if $ed = o(n/ \\log n)$. We next show that a\nsimilar inequality holds for any discretized circuit. Thus, if we regard the\nnumber of gates outputting non-zero values as a measure for sparse activity,\nour results suggest that larger depth helps neural networks to acquire sparse\nactivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 05:37:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

The mid-IR unresolved emission contributes more than 60% of the nuclear\nemission in most galaxies. By contrast, the ALMA 870micron continuum emission\nis mostly resolved and typically along the torus equatorial direction (Paper I,\nGarcia-Burillo et al. 2021). The Eddington ratios and nuclear hydrogen column\ndensities NH of half the sample are favorable to launching polar and/or\nequatorial dusty winds, according to simulations. Six show mid-IR extended\nemission in the polar direction as traced by the NLR and perpendicular to the\nALMA emission. In a few, the nuclear NH might be too high to uplift large\nquantities of dusty material along the polar direction. Five galaxies have low\nNH and/or Eddington ratios and thus polar dusty winds are not likely. We\ngenerate new CAT3D-WIND disk-wind model images. At low wind-to-disk cloud\nratios the far-IR model images have disk- and ring-like morphologies. The\nX-shape associated with dusty winds is seen better in the far-IR at\nintermediate-high inclinations for the extended-wind configurations. In most\nmodels, the mid-IR emission comes from the inner part of the disk/cone.\nExtended bi-conical and one-sided polar mid-IR emission is seen in\nextended-wind configurations and high wind-to-disk cloud ratios. When convolved\nto our resolution, the model images reproduce qualitative aspects of the\nobserved morphologies. Low-intermediate wind-to-disk ratios are required to\naccount for the large fractions of unresolved mid-IR emission. This work and\nPaper I provide observational support for the torus+wind scenario. The wind\ncomponent is more relevant at high Eddington ratios and/or AGN luminosities,\nand polar dust emission is predicted at NH of up to $10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$.

In\ndecentralized settings, when agents have limited communication and sensory\ncapabilities, collisions are typically avoided in a reactive fashion, relying\non local observations/communications. Prominent collision avoidance techniques,\ne.g. ORCA, are computationally efficient and scale well to a large number of\nagents. However, in numerous scenarios, involving navigation through the tight\npassages or confined spaces, deadlocks are likely to occur due to the egoistic\nbehaviour of the agents and as a result, the latter can not achieve their\ngoals. To this end, we suggest an application of the locally confined\nmulti-agent path finding (MAPF) solvers that coordinate sub-groups of the\nagents that appear to be in a deadlock (to detect the latter we suggest a\nsimple, yet efficient ad-hoc routine). We present a way to build a grid-based\nMAPF instance, typically required by modern MAPF solvers.

To confirm this\nresult, theoretical predictions for the time-dependent partial temperatures are\ncompared against direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results; the comparison\nshows an excellent agreement confirming the applicability of hydrodynamics in\ngranular suspensions. Also, in the transient regime, the so-called Mpemba-like\neffect (namely, when an initially hotter sample cools sooner than the colder\none) is analyzed for inelastic collisions. The theoretical analysis of the\nMpemba effect is performed for initial states close to and far away from the\nasymptotic steady state.

In particular, in order to investigate some dynamical\nproperties, such as robustness or global sensitivity, many simulations have to\nbe performed by varying the initial concentration of chemical species. Results:\nIn order to reduce the computational effort required when many simulations are\nneeded to assess a property, we exploit a new notion of monotonicity of the\noutput of the system (the concentration of a target chemical species at the\nsteady-state) with respect to the input (the initial concentration of another\nchemical species). To assess such monotonicity behavior, we propose a new\ngraphical approach that allows us to state sufficient conditions for ensuring\nthat the monotonicity property holds. Our sufficient conditions allow us to\nefficiently verify the monotonicity property by exploring a graph constructed\non the basis of the reactions involved in the network. Once established, our\nmonotonicity property allows us to drastically reduce the number of simulations\nrequired to assess some dynamical properties of the CRN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 08:18:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

Recent observations of CR anisotropy show that the phase is consistent\nwith local regular magnetic field (LRMF) observed by Interstellar Boundary\nExplorer (IBEX) below 100 TeV, which indicates that diffusion along LRMF is\nimportant. In this work, we further introduce the LRMF and take into account\nthe effect of corresponding anisotropic diffusion to explain the anisotropy of\nCRs.

Recently however,\ntargeted search efforts have identified very hard Hamiltonian cycle problem\ninstances very far away from the Koml\\'os-Szemer\\'edi bound. In that study, the\nused backtracking algorithm was Vandegriend-Culberson's, which was supposedly\nthe most efficient of all Hamiltonian backtracking algorithms.\n  In this paper, we make a unified large scale quantitative comparison for the\nbest known backtracking algorithms described between 1877 and 2016.

In a more general algorithmic assessment, we\nconjecture that edge pruning and non-Hamiltonicity checks might be largely\nresponsible for these recursive savings.

Although\nprevious theoretical work investigating the role of minor body disruption\naround white dwarfs has focussed on spherical bodies, Solar System asteroids\ncan be more accurately modelled as triaxial ellipsoids. Here we present an\nanalytical framework to identify the type of disruption (tidal fragmentation,\ntotal sublimation or direct impact) experienced by triaxial asteroids\napproaching white dwarfs on extremely eccentric (e \\sim 1) orbits. This\nframework is then used to identify the outcomes for simplified Main belt\nanalogues of 100 bodies across five different white dwarf temperatures. We also\npresent an empirical relationship between cooling age and effective temperature\nfor both DA and DB white dwarfs to identify the age of the white dwarfs\nconsidered here. We find that using a purely spherical shape model can\nunderestimate the physical size and radial distance at which an asteroid is\nsubjected to complete sublimation, and these differences increase with greater\nelongation of the body. Contrastingly, fragmentation always occurs in the\nlargest semi-axis of a body and so can be modelled by a sphere of that radius.\nBoth fragmentation and sublimation are greatly affected by the body's material\ncomposition, and hence by the composition of their progenitor asteroid belts.\nThe white dwarf temperature, and hence cooling age, can affect the expected\ndebris distribution: higher temperatures sublimate large elongated asteroids,\nand cooler temperatures accommodate more direct impacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 09:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

However, the significant intra-class variations\nlike pose, illumination, and expressions in face images, still pose a challenge\nfor face image retrieval. In light of this, face image retrieval requires\nsufficiently powerful learning metrics, which are absent in current deep\nquantization works. Moreover, to tackle the growing unseen identities in the\nquery stage, face image retrieval drives more demands regarding model\ngeneralization and system scalability than general image retrieval tasks. This\npaper integrates product quantization with orthonormal constraints into an\nend-to-end deep learning framework to effectively retrieve face images.\nSpecifically, a novel scheme that uses predefined orthonormal vectors as\ncodewords is proposed to enhance the quantization informativeness and reduce\ncodewords' redundancy. A tailored loss function maximizes discriminability\namong identities in each quantization subspace for both the quantized and\noriginal features. An entropy-based regularization term is imposed to reduce\nthe quantization error.

In this paper, we propose a novel policy\ntransfer method with iterative \"environment grounding\", IDAPT, that alternates\nbetween (1) directly minimizing both visual and dynamics domain gaps by\ngrounding the source environment in the target environment domains, and (2)\ntraining a policy on the grounded source environment. This iterative training\nprogressively aligns the domains between the two environments and adapts the\npolicy to the target environment. Once trained, the policy can be directly\nexecuted on the target environment. The empirical results on locomotion and\nrobotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our approach can effectively\ntransfer a policy across visual and dynamics domain gaps with minimal\nsupervision and interaction with the target environment.

This generalization offers great expressive power, but has\nhistorically sacrificed the organizing principle of ``degree'' that is central\nto polynomial optimization theory. We reclaim that principle here through the\nconcept of signomial rings, which we use to derive complete convex relaxation\nhierarchies of upper and lower bounds for signomial optimization via sums of\narithmetic-geometric exponentials (SAGE) nonnegativity certificates. The\nPositivstellensatz underlying the lower bounds relies on the concept of\nconditional SAGE and removes regularity conditions required by earlier works,\nsuch as convexity and Archimedeanity of the feasible set. Through worked\nexamples we illustrate the practicality of this hierarchy in areas such as\nchemical reaction network theory and chemical engineering. These examples\ninclude comparisons to direct global solvers (e.g., BARON and ANTIGONE) and the\nLasserre hierarchy (where appropriate). The completeness of our hierarchy of\nupper bounds follows from a generic construction whereby a Positivstellensatz\nfor signomial nonnegativity over a compact set provides for arbitrarily strong\nouter approximations of the corresponding cone of nonnegative signomials. While\nworking toward that result, we prove basic facts on the existence and\nuniqueness of solutions to signomial moment problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 10:17:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

Also, a\nstrategy for trajectory generation and a design of disturbance-observer-based\ncontrollers for each operative mode are presented. Furthermore, the theory of\nhybrid automata is used to prove the stability and robustness during the mode\ntransition. We validate the proposed trajectory generation and control method\nby an actual wire-pulling experiment with a multirotor-based aerial\nmanipulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 10:36:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2021 03:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

The rewards\nare unknown from the outset, but they are drawn from a known probability\ndistribution. In the standard prophet setting, a single agent makes selection\ndecisions in an attempt to maximize her expected reward. The novelty of our\nmodel is the introduction of a competition setting, where multiple agents\ncompete over the arriving rewards, and make online selection decisions\nsimultaneously, as rewards arrive. If a given reward is selected by more than a\nsingle agent, ties are broken either randomly or by a fixed ranking of the\nagents. The consideration of competition turns the prophet setting from an\nonline decision making scenario to a multi-agent game.\n  For both random and ranked tie-breaking rules, we present simple threshold\nstrategies for the agents that give them high guarantees, independent of the\nstrategies taken by others. In particular, for random tie-breaking, every agent\ncan guarantee herself at least $\\frac{1}{k+1}$ of the highest reward, and at\nleast $\\frac{1}{2k}$ of the optimal social welfare. For ranked tie-breaking,\nthe $i$th ranked agent can guarantee herself at least a half of the $i$th\nhighest reward. We complement these results by matching upper bounds, even with\nrespect to equilibrium profiles. For ranked tie-breaking rule, we also show a\ncorrespondence between the equilibrium of the $k$-agent game and the optimal\nstrategy of a single decision maker who can select up to $k$ rewards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 10:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

This paper proposes to integrate RL with the Model\nMediated Teleoperation (MMT) concept. The teleoperator interacts with a\nsimulated virtual environment, which provides instant feedback. Whereas\nfeedback from the real environment is delayed, feedback from the model is\ninstantaneous, leading to high transparency. The MMT is realized in combination\nwith an intelligent system with two layers.

However, there currently is no method that is able\nto incorporate these visual clues and provide a comprehensive context of\ndietary intake from passive recording (e.g., is the subject sharing food with\nothers, what food the subject is eating, and how much food is left in the\nbowl). On the other hand, privacy is a major concern while egocentric wearable\ncameras are used for capturing. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserved\nsecure solution (i.e., egocentric image captioning) for dietary assessment with\npassive monitoring, which unifies food recognition, volume estimation, and\nscene understanding. By converting images into rich text descriptions,\nnutritionists can assess individual dietary intake based on the captions\ninstead of the original images, reducing the risk of privacy leakage from\nimages. To this end, an egocentric dietary image captioning dataset has been\nbuilt, which consists of in-the-wild images captured by head-worn and\nchest-worn cameras in field studies in Ghana. A novel transformer-based\narchitecture is designed to caption egocentric dietary images. Comprehensive\nexperiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and to justify\nthe design of the proposed architecture for egocentric dietary image\ncaptioning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies\nimage captioning for dietary intake assessment in real life settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 11:16:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 08:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

Many efforts have\nbeen made via building linear models, e.g. linear regression (LR), to extract\nthe association between imaging QTs and genetic factors such as single\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, to the best of our knowledge, these\nlinear models could not fully uncover the complicated relationship due to the\nloci's elusive and diverse impacts on imaging QTs. Though deep learning models\ncan extract the nonlinear relationship, they could not select relevant genetic\nfactors. In this paper, we proposed a novel multi-task deep feature selection\n(MTDFS) method for brain imaging genetics. MTDFS first adds a multi-task\none-to-one layer and imposes a hybrid sparsity-inducing penalty to select\nrelevant SNPs making significant contributions to abnormal imaging QTs. It then\nbuilds a multi-task deep neural network to model the complicated associations\nbetween imaging QTs and SNPs. MTDFS can not only extract the nonlinear\nrelationship but also arms the deep neural network with the feature selection\ncapability. We compared MTDFS to both LR and single-task DFS (DFS) methods on\nthe real neuroimaging genetic data. The experimental results showed that MTDFS\nperformed better than both LR and DFS in terms of the QT-SNP relationship\nidentification and feature selection. In a word, MTDFS is powerful for\nidentifying risk loci and could be a great supplement to the method library for\nbrain imaging genetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 11:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

Our participants volunteered 488 self-reported responses and data from\ntheir wearable sensors. We also find the physiologically measured student\nengagement and perceived student engagement are not always consistent.

We render each character into a\nbinary grayscale image and design two-channel position feature maps for it.\nFormally, we first design a two-layer residual convolutional neural network,\nnamely HanGlyph to generate the initial glyph representation of Chinese\ncharacters, and subsequently adopt multiple bidirectional encoder Transformer\nblocks as the superstructure to capture the context-sensitive information.\nMeanwhile, we feed the glyph features extracted from each layer of the HanGlyph\nmodule into the underlying Transformer blocks by skip-connection method to\nfully exploit the glyph features of Chinese characters.

On the one hand, these models can\ncapture complex object dynamics with less modeling required, but on the other\nhand, they depend on a large amount of training data for parameter tuning.\nTowards this end, we present an approach for generating synthetic trajectory\ndata of unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs) in image space. Since UAVs, or rather\nquadrotors are dynamical systems, they can not follow arbitrary trajectories.\nWith the prerequisite that UAV trajectories fulfill a smoothness criterion\ncorresponding to a minimal change of higher-order motion, methods for planning\naggressive quadrotors flights can be utilized to generate optimal trajectories\nthrough a sequence of 3D waypoints. By projecting these maneuver trajectories,\nwhich are suitable for controlling quadrotors, to image space, a versatile\ntrajectory data set is realized. To demonstrate the applicability of the\nsynthetic trajectory data, we show that an RNN-based prediction model solely\ntrained on the generated data can outperform classic reference models on a\nreal-world UAV tracking dataset.

Alas, both\napproaches are inadequate when a large portion of the data is missing. Here, we\nintroduce GapNet, an alternative deep-learning training approach that can use\nhighly incomplete datasets.

Our study aims to answer the following\nquestions: i) what information is captured within the representations? ii) how\nis it represented and distributed? and iii) can we identify a minimal subset of\nthe network that possesses this information?\n  Our results reveal several novel findings, including: i) channel and gender\ninformation are distributed across the network, ii) the information is\nredundantly available in neurons with respect to a task, iii) complex\nproperties such as dialectal information are encoded only in the task-oriented\npretrained network, iv) and is localised in the upper layers, v) we can extract\na minimal subset of neurons encoding the pre-defined property, vi) salient\nneurons are sometimes shared between properties, vii) our analysis highlights\nthe presence of biases (for example gender) in the network. Our\ncross-architectural comparison indicates that: i) the pretrained models capture\nspeaker-invariant information, and ii) CNN models are competitive with\nTransformer models in encoding various understudied properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 13:32:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 18:50:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

We introduce a new class of balanced\nSLPs, called contracting SLPs, where for every rule $A \\to \\beta_1 \\dots\n\\beta_k$ the string length of every variable $\\beta_i$ on the right-hand side\nis smaller by a constant factor than the string length of $A$. In particular,\nthe derivation tree of a contracting SLP has the property that every subtree\nhas logarithmic height in its leaf size. We show that a given SLP of size $g$\ncan be transformed in linear time into an equivalent contracting SLP of size\n$O(g)$ with rules of constant length.\n  We present an application to the navigation problem in compressed unranked\ntrees, represented by forest straight-line programs (FSLPs).

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely\ninvestigated and shown to be a promising solution for decision-making and\noptimal control processes. For RL in a decentralized setup, edge nodes (agents)\nconnected through a communication network aim to work collaboratively to find a\npolicy to optimize the global reward as the sum of local rewards. However,\ncommunication costs, scalability and adaptation in complex environments with\nheterogeneous agents may significantly limit the performance of decentralized\nRL. Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has a structure that\nallows for decentralized implementation, and has shown faster convergence than\ngradient descent based methods. Therefore, we propose an adaptive stochastic\nincremental ADMM (asI-ADMM) algorithm and apply the asI-ADMM to decentralized\nRL with edge-computing-empowered IIoT networks.

We aim to explore the effects of the wind-companion\ninteraction on the 3D density and velocity distribution of the wind, as a\nfunction of three key parameters: wind velocity, binary separation and\ncompanion mass. For the first time, we compare the impact on the outflow of a\nplanetary companion to that of a stellar companion.

With our grid\nof models we cover the prominent morphology changes in a companion-perturbed\nAGB outflow: slow winds with a close, massive binary companion show a more\ncomplex morphology. Additionally, we prove that massive planets are able to\nsignificantly impact the density structure of an AGB wind. We find that the\ninteraction with a companion affects the terminal velocity of the wind, which\ncan be explained by the gravitational slingshot mechanism. We distinguish\nbetween two types of wind focussing to the orbital plane resulting from\ndistinct mechanisms: global flattening of the outflow as a result of the AGB\nstar's orbital motion and the formation of an EDE as a consequence of the\ncompanion's gravitational pull.

In this Riesz gas, the particles repel each other via a pairwise\ninteraction that behaves as $|x_i - x_j|^{-k}$ for $k>-2$, with $x_i$ denoting\nthe position of the $i^{\\rm th}$ particle. This density can be classified into\nthree different regimes of $k$. For $k \\geq 1$, where the interactions are\neffectively short-ranged, the appropriately scaled density has a finite support\nover $[-l_k(w),w]$ where $w$ is the scaled position of the wall. While the\ndensity vanishes at the left edge of the support, it approaches a nonzero\nconstant at the right edge $w$. For $-1<k<1$, where the interactions are weakly\nlong-ranged, we find that the scaled density is again supported over\n$[-l_k(w),w]$. While it still vanishes at the left edge of the support, it\ndiverges at the right edge $w$ algebraically with an exponent $(k-1)/2$. For\n$-2<k< -1$, the interactions are strongly long-ranged that leads to a rather\nexotic density profile with an extended bulk part and a delta-peak at the wall,\nseparated by a hole in between. Exactly at $k=-1$ the hole disappears. For\n$-2<k< -1$, we find an interesting first-order phase transition when the scaled\nposition of the wall decreases through a critical value $w=w^*(k)$. For\n$w<w^*(k)$, the density is a pure delta-peak located at the wall. The amplitude\nof the delta-peak plays the role of an order parameter which jumps to the value\n$1$ as $w$ is decreased through $w^*(k)$.

The MIs provide a spin-flip backscattering of itinerant helical\nelectrons. Such a backscattering reduces the ballistic conductance if the\nexchange interaction between the MI and the electrons is anisotropic and the\nKondo screening is unimportant. It is well-known that the isotropic MIs do not\nsuppress the helical transport in systems with axial spin symmetry of the\nelectrons. We show that, if this symmetry is broken, the isotropic MI acquires\nan effective anisotropy and suppresses the helical conductance. The peculiar\nunderlying mechanism is a successive backscattering of the electrons which\npropagate in the same direction and have different energies. The respective\ncorrection to the linear conductance is determined by the allowed phase space\nof the electrons and scales with temperature as T^4. Hence, it disappears at\nsmall temperatures. This qualitatively distinguishes effects governed by the\nMIs with the induced and bare anisotropy; the latter is temperature\nindependent. If T is smaller than the applied bias, finite e V, the allowed\nphase space is provided by the bias and the differential conductance scales as\n(e V)^4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 15:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

The strength of this approach is that it\nremains close to classical software development practices. In fact, it avoids a\ncomplete analysis of the business domain and its variability (i.e. proactive\napproach), and avoids requiring a set of product variants that covers this\ndomain (i.e. extractive approach).

The maintenance of the SPL can be made on a\nwhite-box SPL implementation, generated by isiSPL. isiSPL is based on two\nsteps: first, the identification and integration of the artefacts of a newly\ncreated product into the structure of the SPL; second, the selection of a set\nof artefacts and their composition to generate a new product that can either\npartially or completely meet the requirements provided for a product intended\nby a developer.

The biomarkers are typically intermittently measured, missing at some\nevent times, and may be subject to high biological variations, which cannot be\nreadily used as time-dependent covariates in a standard time-to-event model.\nMoreover, they can be highly correlated if they are from in the same biological\npathway. To address these issues, we propose a flexible joint model framework\nthat models the multiple biomarkers with a shared latent reduced rank\nlongitudinal principal component model and correlates the latent process to the\nevent time by the Cox model for dynamic prediction of the event time. The\nproposed joint model for highly correlated biomarkers is more flexible than\nsome existing methods since the latent trajectory shared by the multiple\nbiomarkers does not require specification of a priori parametric time trend and\nis determined by data. We derive an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for\nparameter estimation, study large sample properties of the estimators, and\nadapt the developed method to make dynamic prediction of the time-to-event\noutcome. Bootstrap is used for standard error estimation and inference. The\nproposed method is evaluated using simulations and illustrated on a lung\ntransplant data to predict chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) using\nchemokines measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 20:31:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-05"}

In our recent work, we study the risk of hurricane-induced\ncascading failures in power systems of the U.S. East Coast using historical\nwind field data sets. For this purpose, we model the destruction of overhead\ntransmission lines during hurricanes, where each failing line causes a\nrerouting of power flow in the system. New power flows can overload additional\nlines, which are then automatically deactivated and thereby cause another\nrerouting of power flow and so on.

The optimised grid is generated by\napplying the multiresolution analysis (MRA) of multiwavelets (MWs) to\npiecewise-planar representation of raster-formatted topography data, for more\nsensible grid coarsening based on one user-specified parameter. Two adaptive\nsolvers are also explored that apply the MRA of MWs and of Haar wavelets (HWs)\nto, respectively, scale and adapt the DG2 (MWDG2) and FV1 (HWFV1) modelled data\ndynamically in time. The performance of the non-uniform grid and adaptive\nsolvers is assessed in terms of flood depth and extent, velocities, and CPU\nruntimes, with reference to the raster-based DG2 model predictions on their\nfinest resolution grid. The assessments considered three large-scale flooding\nscenarios, involving rapid and slow-to-gradual flows. MWDG2 is found to be the\nmost favourable choice when modelling rapid flows, where it excels in capturing\nsmall velocity variations. For slow-to-gradual flows, the adaptive solvers\ndeliver less accurate outcomes, and their efficiency can be hampered by\noverhead costs of the dynamic MRA. Instead, non-uniform DG2 is recommended to\ncapture urban flow interactions more accurately. Non-uniform ACC is 5 times\nfaster to run than non-uniform DG2 but delivers close flooding depth and extent\npredictions, thus is more attractive for fluvial/pluvial flood simulation over\nlarge areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 11:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Final rank, which indicates the performance of a player, is one\nof the most important feature for this game. This paper focuses on predicting\nthe final rank of the players based on their skills and abilities. In this\npaper we have used different machine learning algorithms to predict the final\nrank of the players on a dataset obtained from kaggle which has 29 features.\nUsing the correlation heatmap,we have varied the number of features used for\nthe model. Out of these models GBR and LGBM have given the best result with the\naccuracy of 91.63% and 91.26% respectively for 14 features and the accuracy of\n90.54% and 90.01% for 8 features. Although the accuracy of the models with 14\nfeatures is slightly better than 8 features, the empirical time taken by 8\nfeatures is 1.4x lesser than 14 features for LGBM and 1.5x lesser for GBR.\nFurthermore, reducing the number of features any more significantly hampers the\nperformance of all the ML models. Therefore, we conclude that 8 is the optimal\nnumber of features that can be used to predict the final rank of a player in\nPUBG with high accuracy and low run-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 07:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

When late detected, this fault can\ndeteriorate the bearings' performance and damage the rotating machine. Thus,\nearly fault identification techniques should be applied to avoid this scenario\nand allow effective maintenance. However, the literature about the\nidentification of oil starvation fault is relatively recent and very scarce.\nAmong the few studies available, oil starvation has been identified in early\nstages using a purely deterministic technique, which can be jeopardized by\nmodel inaccuracy. Alternatively, this paper proposes a novel method for the\nidentification of oil starvation faults in hydrodynamic bearings using the\nrotor vibrational responses and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is a\nstochastic-determinist state estimator that can deal with modelling and\nmeasurement errors. Computational simulations performed in this paper show that\nthe proposed method is suitable to successfully identify the oil starvation\nfaults in real-time even with noisy vibrational responses, thus representing a\npromising tool for the monitoring of rotating machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 15:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

However, the accuracy of manual classification of those\nhistopathological images is comparatively low. This research aims to increase\nthe accuracy of the classification of breast cancer images by utilizing a\nPatch-Based Classifier (PBC) along with deep learning architecture.\nMethodology: The proposed system consists of a Deep Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (DCNN) that helps in enhancing and increasing the accuracy of the\nclassification process. This is done by the use of the Patch-based Classifier\n(PBC). CNN has completely different layers where images are first fed through\nconvolutional layers using hyperbolic tangent function together with the\nmax-pooling layer, drop out layers, and SoftMax function for classification.\nFurther, the output obtained is fed to a patch-based classifier that consists\nof patch-wise classification output followed by majority voting. Results: The\nresults are obtained throughout the classification stage for breast cancer\nimages that are collected from breast-histology datasets. The proposed solution\nimproves the accuracy of classification whether or not the images had normal,\nbenign, in-situ, or invasive carcinoma from 87% to 94% with a decrease in\nprocessing time from 0.45 s to 0.2s on average. Conclusion: The proposed\nsolution focused on increasing the accuracy of classifying cancer in the breast\nby enhancing the image contrast and reducing the vanishing gradient. Finally,\nthis solution for the implementation of the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram\nEqualization (CLAHE) technique and modified tangent function helps in\nincreasing the accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 08:36:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

In this paper, we establish a formalism for\nfundamental duality and study its various properties and theorems. One of the\nmost profound results is that we establish a relation between dual invariance\nand topological invariance, and we find that the topological Chern-Simons form\nis a dual invariant action. Finally we apply the concept of duality to study\ndual state oscillation, and predict a theoretical new matter of state of\ndualiton, which is the particle excitation of the dual field by second\nquantization.
