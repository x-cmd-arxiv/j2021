A new approach, BERT, has been\nintroduced as a transfer learning model with a pre-trained model that has\npreviously been trained to have a better context representation. This study\nexamines the effectiveness of fine-tuning BERT for sentiment analysis using two\ndifferent pre-trained models. Besides the multilingual pre-trained model, we\nuse the pre-trained model that only has been trained in Indonesian. The dataset\nused is Indonesian user reviews of the ten best apps in 2020 in Google Play\nsites. We also perform hyper-parameter tuning to find the optimum trained\nmodel. Two training data labeling approaches were also tested to determine the\neffectiveness of the model, which is score-based and lexicon-based. The\nexperimental results show that pre-trained models trained in Indonesian have\nbetter average accuracy on lexicon-based data. The pre-trained Indonesian model\nhighest accuracy is 84%, with 25 epochs and a training time of 24 minutes.\nThese results are better than all of the machine learning and multilingual\npre-trained models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 16:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}

Hence,\nremoving rains from an image has become an important issue in the field. To\nhandle such an ill-posed single image deraining task, in this paper, we\nspecifically build a novel deep architecture, called rain convolutional\ndictionary network (RCDNet), which embeds the intrinsic priors of rain streaks\nand has clear interpretability. In specific, we first establish a RCD model for\nrepresenting rain streaks and utilize the proximal gradient descent technique\nto design an iterative algorithm only containing simple operators for solving\nthe model. By unfolding it, we then build the RCDNet in which every network\nmodule has clear physical meanings and corresponds to each operation involved\nin the algorithm. This good interpretability greatly facilitates an easy\nvisualization and analysis on what happens inside the network and why it works\nwell in inference process. Moreover, taking into account the domain gap issue\nin real scenarios, we further design a novel dynamic RCDNet, where the rain\nkernels can be dynamically inferred corresponding to input rainy images and\nthen help shrink the space for rain layer estimation with few rain maps so as\nto ensure a fine generalization performance in the inconsistent scenarios of\nrain types between training and testing data. By end-to-end training such an\ninterpretable network, all involved rain kernels and proximal operators can be\nautomatically extracted, faithfully characterizing the features of both rain\nand clean background layers, and thus naturally lead to better deraining\nperformance.

The thermoelectric transport coefficients such as the Seebeck coefficient,\nelectrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity are calculated within the\nlinearized Boltzmann transport theory combined with the relaxation time\napproximation. We consider various effects such as band gaps, dimensionalities,\nand dispersion powers to understand the conditions that can give the optimal\nthermoelectric efficiency or figure of merit ($ZT$). Our calculations show that\nthe so-called pudding-mold band structure produces larger electrical and\nthermal conductivities than the parabolic band, but no significant difference\nis found in the Seebeck coefficients of the pudding-mold and parabolic bands.\nFurthermore, we find that a high $ZT$ can be obtained by tuning the band gap of\nthe material to an optimum value simultaneously with breaking the band\nsymmetry. The largest $ZT$ is found in a combination of two-contrasting\npolynomial powers in the dispersion relations of valence and conduction bands.\nThis band asymmetry also shifts the charge neutrality away from the undoped\nlevel and allows optimal $ZT$ to be located at a smaller chemical potential.\nWith some reasonable values of thermal conductivity parameters, the maximum\n$ZT$ for the bulk systems can be larger than 1, while for one-dimensional\nsystems it can even reach almost 4. We expect this work to trigger\nhigh-throughput calculations for screening of potential thermoelectric\nmaterials combining various polynomial powers in the energy dispersion\nrelations of semiconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 16:33:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 16:31:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 19:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

Building on a highly efficient tightly-coupled iterated\nKalman filter, FAST-LIO2 has two key novelties that allow fast, robust, and\naccurate LiDAR navigation (and mapping). The first one is directly registering\nraw points to the map (and subsequently update the map, i.e., mapping) without\nextracting features. This enables the exploitation of subtle features in the\nenvironment and hence increases the accuracy. The elimination of a\nhand-engineered feature extraction module also makes it naturally adaptable to\nemerging LiDARs of different scanning patterns; The second main novelty is\nmaintaining a map by an incremental k-d tree data structure, ikd-Tree, that\nenables incremental updates (i.e., point insertion, delete) and dynamic\nre-balancing. Compared with existing dynamic data structures (octree, R*-tree,\nnanoflann k-d tree), ikd-Tree achieves superior overall performance while\nnaturally supports downsampling on the tree. We conduct an exhaustive benchmark\ncomparison in 19 sequences from a variety of open LiDAR datasets. FAST-LIO2\nachieves consistently higher accuracy at a much lower computation load than\nother state-of-the-art LiDAR-inertial navigation systems. Various real-world\nexperiments on solid-state LiDARs with small FoV are also conducted. Overall,\nFAST-LIO2 is computationally-efficient (e.g., up to 100 Hz odometry and mapping\nin large outdoor environments), robust (e.g., reliable pose estimation in\ncluttered indoor environments with rotation up to 1000 deg/s), versatile (i.e.,\napplicable to both multi-line spinning and solid-state LiDARs, UAV and handheld\nplatforms, and Intel and ARM-based processors), while still achieving higher\naccuracy than existing methods. Our implementation of the system FAST-LIO2, and\nthe data structure ikd-Tree are both open-sourced on Github.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 16:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

However, soft\nbiometric analysis is not extensively reported in wild conditions. In\nparticular, previous works on gender recognition report their results in face\ndatasets, with relatively good image quality and frontal poses. Given the\nuncertainty of the availability of the facial region in wild conditions, we\nconsider that these methods are not adequate for surveillance settings. To\novercome these limitations, we: 1) present frontal and wild face versions of\nthree well-known surveillance datasets; and 2) propose YinYang-Net (YY-Net), a\nmodel that effectively and dynamically complements facial and body information,\nwhich makes it suitable for gender recognition in wild conditions. The frontal\nand wild face datasets derive from widely used Pedestrian Attribute Recognition\n(PAR) sets (PETA, PA-100K, and RAP), using a pose-based approach to filter the\nfrontal samples and facial regions. This approach retrieves the facial region\nof images with varying image/subject conditions, where the state-of-the-art\nface detectors often fail. YY-Net combines facial and body information through\na learnable fusion matrix and a channel-attention sub-network, focusing on the\nmost influential body parts according to the specific image/subject features.\nWe compare it with five PAR methods, consistently obtaining state-of-the-art\nresults on gender recognition, and reducing the prediction errors by up to 24%\nin frontal samples. The announced PAR datasets versions and YY-Net serve as the\nbasis for wild soft biometrics classification and are available in\nhttps://github.com/Tiago-Roxo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 17:02:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 09:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

However, this excess is subject to many\nuncertainties related to the evaluation of the antiproton spectrum produced\nfrom spallation interactions of CRs. In this work, we implement a combined\nMarkov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the secondary ratios of B, Be and Li and\nthe antiproton-to-proton ratio ($\\bar{p}/p$), while also including nuisance\nparameters to consider the uncertainties related to the spallation cross\nsections.

In this way, we provide a set of\npropagation parameters and scale factors for renormalizing the cross sections\nparametrizations that allow us to reproduce all the ratios of B, Be, Li and\n$\\bar{p}$ simultaneously.

In a QCQP, we are asked to minimize a (possibly\nnonconvex) quadratic function subject to a number of (possibly nonconvex)\nquadratic constraints. Such problems arise naturally in many areas of\noperations research, computer science, and engineering. Although QCQPs are\nNP-hard to solve in general, they admit a natural convex relaxation via the\nstandard (Shor) semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation. In this tutorial, we\nwill study the SDP relaxation for general QCQPs, present various exactness\nconcepts related to this relaxation and discuss conditions guaranteeing such\nSDP exactness. In particular, we will define and examine three notions of SDP\nexactness: (i) objective value exactness -- the condition that the optimal\nvalue of the QCQP and the optimal value of its SDP relaxation coincide, (ii)\nconvex hull exactness -- the condition that the convex hull of the QCQP\nepigraph coincides with the (projected) SDP epigraph, and (iii) the rank-one\ngenerated (ROG) property -- the condition that a particular conic subset of the\npositive semidefinite matrices related to a given QCQP is generated by its\nrank-one matrices. Our analysis for objective value exactness and convex hull\nexactness stems from a geometric treatment of the projected SDP relaxation and\ncrucially considers how the objective function interacts with the constraints.\nThe ROG property complements these results by offering a sufficient condition\nfor both objective value exactness and convex hull exactness which is oblivious\nto the objective function.

In this\npaper, we present a novel filter pruning method, dubbed dynamic-coded filter\nfusion (DCFF), to derive compact CNNs in a computation-economical and\nregularization-free manner for efficient image classification. Each filter in\nour DCFF is firstly given an inter-similarity distribution with a temperature\nparameter as a filter proxy, on top of which, a fresh Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence based dynamic-coded criterion is proposed to evaluate the filter\nimportance. In contrast to simply keeping high-score filters in other methods,\nwe propose the concept of filter fusion, i.e., the weighted averages using the\nassigned proxies, as our preserved filters. We obtain a one-hot\ninter-similarity distribution as the temperature parameter approaches infinity.\nThus, the relative importance of each filter can vary along with the training\nof the compact CNN, leading to dynamically changeable fused filters without\nboth the dependency on the pretrained model and the introduction of sparse\nconstraints.

A physically\ninteresting question is whether such a violation in the monogamy of\nentanglement can be posed in empty flat space. The answer is not immediately\nclear since flat space gravity has an entirely different vacuum and infrared\nstructure than the gapped and unique AdS vacuum, which was exploited in Raju's\ntoy model. We answer this question in the affirmative, with an explicit\nconstruction. We formulate the paradox in terms of monogamy of CHSH\ncorrelations, which we use to quantify the monogamy of entanglement. Extending\nRaju's analysis to empty flat space, within effective field theory, we show\nthat the entanglement of approximately local bulk modes just outside a light\ncone with modes just inside the light cone as well as with modes situated far\naway at the past of future null infinity gives rise to an O($1$) violation in\nthe monogamy of entanglement. This cannot be resolved by small corrections of\nO($\\sqrt{G_N}$). The issues arising from the above-mentioned vacuum and\ninfrared features unique to flat spacetime are dealt with by introducing a\nphysically motivated boundary projector onto states below a given infrared\ncutoff, which allows us to construct suitable operators at the past of future\nnull infinity that give rise to the violation. We argue that the resolution of\nthe paradox is that our spatially separated observables probe the same\nunderlying degrees of freedom, i.e., such observables act on a non-factorized\nHilbert space arising from the Gauss constraint, thereby circumventing the\nconflict with monogamy of entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 18:10:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 04:10:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 17:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

In practice, it is often statistically hopeless to identify all\nthe important features with no false discovery, let alone the intimidating\nexpense of experiments to test their significance. Such realistic limitation\ncalls for statistical guarantee for the early discoveries of a model selector.\nIn this paper, we focus on the early solution path of best subset selection\n(BSS), where the sparsity constraint is set to be lower than {the true\nsparsity}. Under a sparse high-dimensional linear model, we establish the\nsufficient and (near) necessary condition for BSS to achieve sure early\nselection, or equivalently, zero false discovery throughout its early path.\nEssentially, this condition boils down to a lower bound of the minimum\nprojected signal margin that characterizes the gap of the captured signal\nstrength between sure selection models and those with spurious discoveries.\nDefined through projection operators, this margin is independent of the\nrestricted eigenvalues of the design, suggesting the robustness of BSS against\ncollinearity. Moreover, our model selection guarantee tolerates reasonable\noptimization error and thus applies to near best subsets. Finally, to overcome\nthe computational hurdle of BSS under high dimension, we propose the \"screen\nthen select\" (STS) strategy to reduce dimension for BSS. Our numerical\nexperiments show that the resulting early path exhibits much lower false\ndiscovery rate (FDR) than LASSO, MCP and SCAD, especially in the presence of\nhighly correlated design.

Essentially, quantum information theorists have extended\nEinstein's use of NPRF from the boost invariance of measurements of c to\ninclude the SO(3) invariance of measurements of h between different reference\nframes of mutually complementary spin measurements via the principle of\nInformation Invariance & Continuity. Consequently, the \"mystery\" of the Bell\nstates that is responsible for the Tsirelson bound and the exclusion of the\nno-signalling, \"superquantum\" Popescu-Rohrlich joint probabilities is\nunderstood to result from conservation per Information Invariance & Continuity\nbetween different reference frames of mutually complementary qubit\nmeasurements, and this maps to conservation per NPRF in spacetime. If one\nfalsely conflates the relativity principle with the classical theory of SR,\nthen it may seem impossible that the relativity principle resides at the\nfoundation of non-relativisitic QM. In fact, there is nothing inherently\nclassical or quantum about NPRF. Thus, the axiomatic reconstructions of QM have\nsucceeded in producing a principle account of QM that reveals as much about\nNature as the postulates of SR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 19:11:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 23:44:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 21:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-24"}

The semi-Lagrangian (SL) approach\nfully couples the space and time discretization, thus making the use of RK\nstrategies particularly difficult to be combined with. First, a simple scalar\nadvection-diffusion equation is considered as a prototype PDE for the\ndevelopment of a high order formulation of the semi-Lagrangian IMEX algorithms.\nThe advection part of the PDE is discretized explicitly at the aid of a SL\ntechnique, while an implicit discretization is employed for the diffusion\nterms. Second, the SL-IMEX approach is extended to deal with hyperbolic systems\nwith multiple scales, including balance laws, that involve shock waves and\nother discontinuities. A novel SL technique is proposed, which is based on the\nintegration of the governing equations over the space-time control volume which\narises from the motion of each grid point. High order of accuracy is ensured by\nthe usage of IMEX RK schemes combined with a Cauchy-Kowalevskaya procedure that\nprovides a predictor solution within each space-time element.

ML networks with large\nconvolutional layers can easily exceed available memory, increasing latency due\nto excessive swapping. Previous memory reduction techniques such as pruning and\nquantization reduce model accuracy and often require retraining. Alternatively,\ndistributed methods partition the convolutions into equivalent smaller\nsub-computations, but the implementations introduce communication costs and\nrequire a network of devices. However, a distributed partitioning approach can\nalso be used to run in a reduced memory footprint on a single device by\nsubdividing the network into smaller operations.\n  This report extends prior work on distributed partitioning using tiling and\nfusing of convolutional layers into a memory-aware execution on a single\ndevice. Our approach extends prior fusing strategies to allow for two groups of\nconvolutional layers that are fused and tiled independently. This approach\nreduces overhead via data reuse, and reduces the memory footprint further. We\nalso propose a memory usage predictor coupled with a search algorithm to\nprovide fusing and tiling configurations for an arbitrary set of convolutional\nlayers. When applied to the YOLOv2 object detection network, results show that\nour approach can run in less than half the memory, and with a speedup of up to\n2.78 under severe memory constraints. Additionally, our algorithm will return a\nconfiguration with a latency that is within 6% of the best latency measured in\na manual search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 19:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

The resulting interference stems from an\naggressive strategy for enhancing the throughput via frequency reuse across\ndifferent users and the squeezing of signals in the time-frequency plane beyond\nthe Nyquist limit. The error-free spectral efficiency is proved to be\nincreasing with the frequency packing and FTN acceleration factors. The lower\nbound for the FTN sampling period that guarantees information losslesness is\nderived as a function of the transmitting-filter roll-off factor, the\nfrequency-packing factor, and the number of subcarriers. Space-time-frequency\nsymbol-level precoders (SLPs) that trade off constructive and destructive\ninterblock interference (IBI) at the single-antenna user terminals are\nproposed. Redundant elements are added as guard interval to cope with vestigial\ndestructive IBI effects. The proposals can handle channels with delay spread\nlonger than the multicarrier-symbol duration. The receiver architecture is\nsimple, for it does not require digital multicarrier demodulation.

Among these measures are state media labels which help\nusers identify and evaluate the credibility of state-backed news. YouTube was\nthe first platform to introduce labels that provide information about\nstate-backed news channels. While previous work has examined the efficiency of\ninformation labels in controlled lab settings, few studies have examined how\nstate media labels affect user perceptions of content from state-backed\noutlets. This paper proposes new methodological and theoretical approaches to\ninvestigate the effect of state media labels on user engagement with content.\nDrawing on a content analysis of 8,071 YouTube comments posted before and after\nthe labelling of five state-funded channels (Al Jazeera English, CGTN, RT, TRT\nWorld, and Voice of America), this paper analyses the effect state media labels\nhad on user engagement with state-backed media content. We found the labels had\nno impact on the amount of likes videos received before and after the policy\nintroduction, except for RT which received less likes after it was labelled.\nHowever, for RT, comments left by users were associated with 30 percent\ndecrease in the likelihood of observing a critical comment following the policy\nimplementation, and a 70 percent decrease in likelihood of observing a critical\ncomment about RT as a media source. While other state-funded broadcasters, like\nAl Jazeera English and VOA News, received fewer critical comments after YouTube\nintroduced its policy; this relationship was associated with how political the\nvideo was, rather than the policy change. Our study contributes to the ongoing\ndiscussion on the efficacy of platform governance in relation to state-backed\nmedia, showing that audience preferences impact the effectiveness of labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 20:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

On the one hand, if a guaranteed contract is not fully\ndelivered, it incurs a penalty for the publisher. On the other hand, the\npublisher might be able to sell an impression at a high price in the Ad\nExchange. How does a publisher maximize its total revenue as a sum of the\nrevenue from the Ad Exchange and the loss from the under-delivery penalty? We\nstudy this problem parameterized by \\emph{supply factor $f$}: a notion we\nintroduce that, intuitively, captures the number of times a publisher can\nsatisfy all its guaranteed contracts given its inventory supply. In this work\nwe present a fast simple deterministic algorithm with the optimal competitive\nratio.

A major aspect and benefit of Bayesian\ninference is that priors, in principle, provide the means to encode prior\nknowledge for use in inference and prediction. However, it is difficult to\nspecify priors on weights since the weights have no intuitive interpretation.\nFurther, the relationships of priors on weights to the functions computed by\nnetworks are difficult to characterize.

The key novel feature of the developed\nprocess lies on its ability to switch the transition rate as it moves from one\nstate to another with switching probability depending on the current state and\ntime of the process as well as its past trajectories. As such, the transition\nfrom current state to another depends on the holding time of the process in the\nstate. Distributional properties of the process are given explicitly in terms\nof the speed regimes represented by a finite number of different transition\nmatrices, the probabilities of selecting regime membership within each state,\nand past realization of the process. In particular, it has distributional\nequivalent stochastic representation with a general mixture of Markov jump\nprocesses introduced in Frydman and Surya (2020). Maximum likelihood estimates\n(MLE) of the distribution parameters of the process are derived in closed form.\nThe estimation is done iteratively using the EM algorithm. Akaike information\ncriterion is used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the selected model. An\nexplicit observed Fisher information matrix of the MLE is derived for the\ncalculation of standard errors of the MLE. The information matrix takes on a\nsimplified form of the general matrix formula of Louis (1982). Large sample\nproperties of the MLE are presented. In particular, the covariance matrix for\nthe MLE of transition rates is equal to the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound, and is\nless for the MLE of regime membership. The simulation study confirms these\nfindings and shows that the parameter estimates are accurate, consistent, and\nhave asymptotic normality as the sample size increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 22:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

In this study, we\ninvestigate how the dust grows in escaping atmospheres and influence the\ntransit radii using a microphysical model of grain growth. Collision growth is\nefficient in many cases, leading to hinder the upward transport of dust via\nenhanced gravitational settling. We find that dust abundance in the outflow\nhardly exceeds the Mach number at the dust production region. Thus, dust formed\nat upper atmospheres, say $P\\lesssim{10}^{-5}$ bar, are needed to launch a\ndusty outflow with high dust abundance. With sufficiently high dust production\naltitudes and rates, the dusty outflow can enhance the observable radius by a\nfactor of $\\sim$2 or even more.

Machine learning\nrises in this context to efficiently optimize this search, exploring the\nimmense materials space, consisting of simultaneously the atomic,\ncompositional, and structural spaces. Topological insulators, presenting\nsymmetry-protected metallic edge states, are a promising class of materials for\ndifferent applications. However, further, development is limited by the\nscarcity of viable candidates. Here we present and discuss machine\nlearning-accelerated strategies for searching the materials space for\ntwo-dimensional topological materials. We show the importance of detailed\ninvestigations of each machine learning component, leading to different\nresults. Using recently created databases containing thousands of ab initio\ncalculations of 2D materials, we train machine learning models capable of\ndetermining the electronic topology of materials, with an accuracy of over 90%.\nWe can then generate and screen thousands of novel materials, efficiently\npredicting their topological character without the need for a priori structural\nknowledge. We discover 56 non-trivial materials, of which 17 novel insulating\ncandidates for further investigation, for which we corroborate their\ntopological properties with density functional theory calculations. This\nstrategy is 10$\\times$ more efficient than the trial-and-error approach while\nfew orders of magnitude faster and is a proof of concept for guiding improved\nmaterials discovery search strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 22:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

Existing methods use exact or\nheuristic algorithms to optimize the timetable in an offline manner. In\npractice, the passenger flow may change significantly over time. Timetables\ndetermined in offline cannot adjust the departure interval to satisfy the\nchanged passenger flow. Aiming at improving the online performance of bus\ntimetable, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning based bus Timetable dynamic\nOptimization method (DRL-TO). In this method, the timetable optimization is\nconsidered as a sequential decision problem. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) is employed\nas the decision model to determine whether to dispatch a bus service during\neach minute of the service period. Therefore, the departure intervals of bus\nservices are determined in real time in accordance with passenger demand. We\nidentify several new and useful state features for the DQN, including the load\nfactor, carrying capacity utilization rate, and the number of stranding\npassengers. Taking into account both the interests of the bus company and\npassengers, a reward function is designed, which includes the indicators of\nfull load rate, empty load rate, passengers' waiting time, and the number of\nstranding passengers.

Recent\nfindings, such as a missing multi-Gyr cooling delay for a number of\nultramassive white dwarfs and a white dwarf with a quasi-Chandrasekhar mass,\nmotivate a better understanding of their evolution. A key process still subject\nto important uncertainties is the crystallization of their dense cores, which\nare generally assumed to be constituted of $^{16}$O, $^{20}$Ne, and a mixture\nof several trace elements (most notably $^{23}$Na and $^{24}$Mg). In this work,\nwe use our recently developed Clapeyron integration technique to compute\naccurate phase diagrams of three-component mixtures relevant to the modeling of\nO/Ne ultramassive white dwarfs. We show that, unlike the phase separation of\n$^{22}$Ne impurities in C/O cores, the phase separation of $^{23}$Na impurities\nin O/Ne white dwarfs cannot lead to the enrichment of their cores in $^{23}$Na\nvia a distillation process. This severely limits the prospect of transporting\nlarge quantities of $^{23}$Na toward the center of the star, as needed in the\nwhite dwarf core collapse mechanism recently proposed by Caiazzo et al. We also\nshow that despite representing $\\approx 10\\%$ of the ionic mixture, $^{23}$Na\nand $^{24}$Mg impurities only have a negligible impact on the O/Ne phase\ndiagram, and the two-component O/Ne phase diagram can be safely used in white\ndwarf evolution codes.

This allows us to establish the linear convergence of\nthe sequence of iterates generated by PAMe and to determine the criticality of\nthe limit of the sequence with respect to both the L1-PCA problem and its\ntwo-block reformulation. To complement our theoretical development, we show via\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets that PAMe is\ncompetitive with a host of existing methods. Our results not only significantly\nadvance the convergence theory of iterative methods for L1-PCA but also\ndemonstrate the potential of our proposed method in applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 04:10:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

Despite that pre-trained models achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance in many NLP benchmarks, we prove that they are not robust to noisy\ntexts generated by real OCR engines.

Still, little is known on how the\ncomplexity of multicellular organisms evolved by elaborating developmental\nprograms and inventing new cell types. A hurdle to understanding developmental\nevolution is the difficulty of even describing the intertwined network of\nspatiotemporal processes underlying the development of complex multicellular\norganisms. Nonetheless, an overview of developmental trajectories can be\nobtained from cell type lineage maps. Here, we propose that these lineage maps\ncan also reveal how developmental programs evolve: the modes of evolving new\ncell types in an organism should be visible in its developmental trajectories,\nand therefore in the geometry of its cell type lineage map. This idea is\ndemonstrated using a parsimonious generative model of developmental programs,\nwhich allows us to reliably survey the universe of all possible programs and\nexamine their topological features. We find that, contrary to belief, tree-like\nlineage maps are rare and lineage maps of complex multicellular organisms are\nlikely to be directed acyclic graphs where multiple developmental routes can\nconverge on the same cell type. While cell type evolution prescribes what\ndevelopmental programs come into existence, natural selection prunes those\nprograms which produce low-functioning organisms.

These results are established under a general\nspecification of the moment inequality model, nesting both conditional and\nunconditional models, and allowing for an infinite number of such inequalities.\nAn essential innovation of the paper is the exhibition of the dual variable as\na weak vector-valued integral to formulate an approximation scheme of the\n$I$-projection's equivalent Fenchel dual problem. In particular, it is shown\nunder suitable assumptions that the dual problem's optimum value can be\napproximated by the values of finite-dimensional programs and that, in\naddition, every accumulation point of a sequence of optimal solutions for the\napproximating programs is an optimal solution for the dual problem.

The most important risk factors for KGHM, one of the biggest\ncompanies active in the metals and mining industry, are the price of copper\n(Cu), traded in US dollars, and the Polish zloty (PLN) exchange rate (USDPLN).\nThe main scope of the paper is to understand the mid- and long-term dynamics of\nthese two risk factors.

From the\nmarket risk management perspective, it is also important to analyze the\ndynamics of these two factors combined with the price of copper in Polish zloty\n(Cu in PLN), which jointly drive the revenues, cash flows, and financial\nresults of the company. Based on the relation between analyzed risk factors and\ndistribution analysis, we propose to use two-dimensional vector autoregressive\n(VAR) model with the $\\alpha-$stable distribution. The non-homogeneity of the\ndata is reflected in two identified regimes: first - corresponding to the 2008\ncrisis and second - to the stable market situation.

To\nrealize such a goal, we propose AdaRec, a knowledge distillation (KD) framework\nwhich compresses knowledge of a teacher model into a student model adaptively\naccording to its recommendation scene by using differentiable Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS). Specifically, we introduce a target-oriented\ndistillation loss to guide the structure search process for finding the student\nnetwork architecture, and a cost-sensitive loss as constraints for model size,\nwhich achieves a superior trade-off between recommendation effectiveness and\nefficiency. In addition, we leverage Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to realize\nmany-to-many layer mapping during knowledge distillation, which enables each\nintermediate student layer to learn from other intermediate teacher layers\nadaptively. Extensive experiments on real-world recommendation datasets\ndemonstrate that our model achieves competitive or better accuracy with notable\ninference speedup comparing to strong counterparts, while discovering diverse\nneural architectures for sequential recommender models under different\nrecommendation scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 07:47:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2022 14:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

It suffers from systematic errors, such as a\ncenter-to-limb error in travel-time measurements. Understanding these errors\nrequires a good understanding of the nontrivial relationship between wave\ndisplacement and helioseismic observables. The wave displacement causes\nperturbations in the atmospheric thermodynamical quantities which perturb the\nopacity, the optical depth, the source function, and the local ray geometry,\nthus affecting the emergent intensity. We aim to establish the most complete\nrelationship up to now between the displacement and the intensity perturbation\nby solving the radiative transfer problem in the atmosphere. We derive an\nexpression for the intensity perturbation caused by acoustic oscillations at\nany point on the solar disk by applying the first-order perturbation theory. As\ninput, we consider adiabatic modes of oscillation of different degrees. The\nbackground and the perturbed intensities are computed considering the main\nsources of opacity in the continuum. We find that, for all modes, the\nperturbations to the thermodynamical quantities are not sufficient to model the\nintensity. In addition, the geometrical effects due to the displacement must be\ntaken into account as they lead to a difference in amplitude and a phase shift\nbetween the temperature at the surface and intensity perturbations. The closer\nto the limb, the larger the differences. This work presents improvements for\nthe computation of the intensity perturbations, in particular for high-degree\nmodes, and explains differences in intensity computations in earlier works. The\nphase shifts and amplitude differences between the temperature and intensity\nperturbations increase towards the limb. This should help to interpret some of\nthe systematic center-to-limb effects observed in local helioseismology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 09:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

Most\nexperiments use target-normal-sheath-acceleration sources with a wide energy\nrange in the proton beam, as the velocity spread can help differentiate between\nelectric and magnetic fields and provide time histories in a single shot.\nHowever, in magnetised plasma experiments with strong background fields, the\nbroadband proton spectrum leads to velocity-spread-dependent displacement of\nthe beam and significant blurring of the radiograph. We describe the origins of\nthis blurring and show how it can be removed from the experimental measurement,\nand we outline the conditions under which such deconvolutions are successful.\nAs an example, we apply this method to a magnetised plasma experiment that used\na background magnetic field of 3 T. The strong displacement and energy spread\nof the proton beam reduced the spatial resolution from tens of microns to a few\nmillimetres. The deconvolution procedure is applied showing the accurate\nrecovery of radiographs with resolutions better than 100 microns, enabling the\nrecovery of more accurate estimates of the path integrated magnetic field. This\nwork extends accurate proton radiography to a class of experiments with\nsignificant background magnetic fields, particularly those experiments with an\napplied external magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 10:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

However, using non-canonical link functions does not give this property\nand leads to potentially important error under the null. The error is present\neven in large samples and hence constitutes bias.\n  We conclude that covariate adjustment analyses of randomised trials should\navoid non-canonical links. If a marginal risk difference is the target of\nestimation then this should not be estimated using an identity link;\nalternative preferable methods include standardisation and inverse probability\nof treatment weighting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 12:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

They are also very flexible due\nto their non-parametric nature. Nevertheless, GPs suffer from poor scalability\nas the number of training instances N increases. More precisely, they have a\ncubic cost with respect to $N$. To overcome this problem, sparse GP\napproximations are often used, where a set of $M \\ll N$ inducing points is\nintroduced during training. The location of the inducing points is learned by\nconsidering them as parameters of an approximate posterior distribution $q$.\nSparse GPs, combined with variational inference for inferring $q$, reduce the\ntraining cost of GPs to $\\mathcal{O}(M^3)$. Critically, the inducing points\ndetermine the flexibility of the model and they are often located in regions of\nthe input space where the latent function changes. A limitation is, however,\nthat for some learning tasks a large number of inducing points may be required\nto obtain a good prediction performance. To address this limitation, we propose\nhere to amortize the computation of the inducing points locations, as well as\nthe parameters of the variational posterior approximation q. For this, we use a\nneural network that receives the observed data as an input and outputs the\ninducing points locations and the parameters of $q$. We evaluate our method in\nseveral experiments, showing that it performs similar or better than other\nstate-of-the-art sparse variational GP approaches. However, with our method the\nnumber of inducing points is reduced drastically due to their dependency on the\ninput data. This makes our method scale to larger datasets and have faster\ntraining and prediction times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 12:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

The semantics of a stream is hard-coded into the DSL\nlanguage and cannot be changed by the user of the library. We introduce an\napproach to modify the semantics of a streaming library by means of\nmeta-programming at both run-time and compile-time, and showcase its\ngenerality. We show that the expressiveness of the meta-facilities is strong\nenough to enable push and pull semantics, error handling, parallelism, and\noperator fusion. We evaluate our work by implementing the identified\nshortcomings in terms of a novel stream meta-architecture and show that its\ndesign and architecture adhere to the design principles of a meta-level\narchitecture. The state of the art offers plenty of choice to programmers\nregarding reactive stream processing libraries. Expressing reactive systems is\notherwise difficult to do in general purpose languages. Extensibility and\nfine-tuning should be possible in these libraries to ensure a broad variety of\napplications can be expressed within this single DSL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 13:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

A\nsynchronisation with a \"get\" operation blocks the caller until the computation\nis over, to return the corresponding value. When a computation in charge of\nfulfilling a future delegates part of its processing to another task,\nmainstream languages return nested futures, and several \"get\" operations are\nneeded to retrieve the computed value (we call such futures \"control-flow\nfutures\"). Several approaches were proposed to tackle this issues: the\n\"forward\" construct, that allows the programmer to make delegation explicit and\navoid nested futures, and \"data-flow explicit futures\" which natively collapse\nnested futures into plain futures. This paper supports the claim that data-flow\nexplicit futures form a powerful set of language primitives, on top of which\nother approaches can be built. We prove the equivalence, in the context of\ndata-flow explicit futures, between the \"forward\" construct and classical\n\"return\" from functions. The proof relies on a branching bisimulation between a\nprogram using \"forward\" and its \"return\" counterpart. This result allows\nlanguage designers to consider \"forward\" as an optimisation directive rather\nthan as a language primitive. Following the principles of the Godot system, we\nprovide a library implementation of control-flow futures, based on data-flow\nexplicit futures implemented in the compiler. This small library supports the\nclaim that the implementation of classical futures based on data-flow ones is\neasier than the opposite.

The RASP mechanism enforces\nsecurity policies by instrumenting a base program to trap security-relevant\noperations and execute the required policy enforcement code. The static\nanalysis of security policies is then obtained from the RASP mechanism by first\nstatically analyzing the base program without any traps. The results of this\nfirst phase are used in a second phase to detect trapped operations and\nabstractly execute the associated and unaltered RASP policy enforcement code.\n  Knowledge: Splitting the analysis into two phases enables running each phase\nwith a specific analysis configuration, rendering the static analysis approach\ntractable while maintaining sufficient precision.\n  Grounding: We validate the applicability of our two-phase analysis approach\nby using it to both dynamically enforce and statically detect a range of\nsecurity policies found in related work. Our experiments suggest that our\ntwo-phase analysis can enable faster and more precise policy violation\ndetection compared to analyzing the full instrumented application under a\nsingle analysis configuration.\n  Importance: Deriving a SAST component from a RASP mechanism enables\nequivalent semantics for the security policies across the static and dynamic\ncontexts in which policies are verified during the software development\nlifecycle.

As the predominant operation in\nDNNs is multiply-accumulate (MAC) of activations with weights to compute inner\nproducts, skipping operations where (at least) one of the two operands is zero\ncan make inference more efficient in terms of latency and power. Spatial\nsparsification of activations is a popular topic in DNN literature and several\nmethods have already been established to bias a DNN for it. On the other hand,\ntemporal sparsity is an inherent feature of bio-inspired spiking neural\nnetworks (SNNs), which neuromorphic processing exploits for hardware\nefficiency. Introducing and exploiting spatio-temporal sparsity, is a topic\nmuch less explored in DNN literature, but in perfect resonance with the trend\nin DNN, to shift from static signal processing to more streaming signal\nprocessing. Towards this goal, in this paper we introduce a new DNN layer\n(called Delta Activation Layer), whose sole purpose is to promote temporal\nsparsity of activations during training. A Delta Activation Layer casts\ntemporal sparsity into spatial activation sparsity to be exploited when\nperforming sparse tensor multiplications in hardware. By employing delta\ninference and ``the usual'' spatial sparsification heuristics during training,\nthe resulting model learns to exploit not only spatial but also temporal\nactivation sparsity (for a given input data distribution). One may use the\nDelta Activation Layer either during vanilla training or during a refinement\nphase. We have implemented Delta Activation Layer as an extension of the\nstandard Tensoflow-Keras library, and applied it to train deep neural networks\non the Human Action Recognition (UCF101) dataset.

In this paper, we propose a\ndistributional RL framework in order to learn adaptive policies that can tune\ntheir level of conservativity at run-time based on the desired comfort and\nutility. Using a proactive safety verification approach, the proposed framework\ncan guarantee that actions generated from RL are fail-safe according to the\nworst-case assumptions.

Many researchers have developed frameworks that\ncan detect baggage threats from X-ray scans. However, to the best of our\nknowledge, all of these frameworks require extensive training on large-scale\nand well-annotated datasets, which are hard to procure in the real world. This\npaper presents a novel unsupervised anomaly instance segmentation framework\nthat recognizes baggage threats, in X-ray scans, as anomalies without requiring\nany ground truth labels. Furthermore, thanks to its stylization capacity, the\nframework is trained only once, and at the inference stage, it detects and\nextracts contraband items regardless of their scanner specifications. Our\none-staged approach initially learns to reconstruct normal baggage content via\nan encoder-decoder network utilizing a proposed stylization loss function. The\nmodel subsequently identifies the abnormal regions by analyzing the disparities\nwithin the original and the reconstructed scans. The anomalous regions are then\nclustered and post-processed to fit a bounding box for their localization. In\naddition, an optional classifier can also be appended with the proposed\nframework to recognize the categories of these extracted anomalies. A thorough\nevaluation of the proposed system on four public baggage X-ray datasets,\nwithout any re-training, demonstrates that it achieves competitive performance\nas compared to the conventional fully supervised methods (i.e., the mean\naverage precision score of 0.7941 on SIXray, 0.8591 on GDXray, 0.7483 on\nOPIXray, and 0.5439 on COMPASS-XP dataset) while outperforming state-of-the-art\nsemi-supervised and unsupervised baggage threat detection frameworks by 67.37%,\n32.32%, 47.19%, and 45.81% in terms of F1 score across SIXray, GDXray, OPIXray,\nand COMPASS-XP datasets, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 13:56:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 18:24:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

In the\nexact $k$-sparse case the best known dimension-independent algorithm runs in\nnear cubic time in $k$ and it is unclear whether a faster algorithm like in low\ndimensions is possible. Beyond that, all known approaches either suffer from an\nexponential dependence on the dimension $d$ or can only tolerate a trivial\namount of noise.

With numerous algorithms available, it is difficult to decide on\nan oversampling algorithm for a chosen classifier. Here, we overcome this\nproblem with a multi-schematic and classifier-independent oversampling\napproach: ProWRAS(Proximity Weighted Random Affine Shadowsampling). ProWRAS\nintegrates the Localized Random Affine Shadowsampling (LoRAS)algorithm and the\nProximity Weighted Synthetic oversampling (ProWSyn) algorithm. By controlling\nthe variance of the synthetic samples, as well as a proximity-weighted\nclustering system of the minority classdata, the ProWRAS algorithm improves\nperformance, compared to algorithms that generate synthetic samples through\nmodelling high dimensional convex spaces of the minority class. ProWRAS has\nfour oversampling schemes, each of which has its unique way to model the\nvariance of the generated data. Most importantly, the performance of ProWRAS\nwith proper choice of oversampling schemes, is independent of the classifier\nused.

ProWRAS outperforms other oversampling algorithms\nin a statistically significant way, in terms of both F1-score and Kappa-score.\nMoreover, we have introduced a novel measure for classifier independence\nI-score, and showed quantitatively that ProWRAS performs better, independent of\nthe classifier used.

Background:\nMost existing studies measured trust by administering questionnaires at the end\nof an experiment. Only a limited number of studies viewed trust as a dynamic\nvariable that can strengthen or decay over time. Method: Seventy-five\nparticipants took part in an aided memory recognition task. In the task,\nparticipants viewed a series of images and later on performed 40 trials of the\nrecognition task to identify a target image when it was presented with a\ndistractor. In each trial, participants performed the initial recognition by\nthemselves, received a recommendation from an automated decision aid, and\nperformed the final recognition. After each trial, participants reported their\ntrust on a visual analog scale. Results: Outcome bias and contrast effect\nsignificantly influence human operators' trust adjustments. An automation\nfailure leads to a larger trust decrement if the final outcome is undesirable,\nand a marginally larger trust decrement if the human operator succeeds the task\nby him-/her-self. An automation success engenders a greater trust increment if\nthe human operator fails the task. Additionally, automation failures have a\nlarger effect on trust adjustment than automation successes.

We introduce the canonical\ntrellis $T_n$ that represents all permutations, and show that the permanent of\na $n$ by $n$ matrix $A$ can be computed as a flow on this trellis. Under\ncertain normalization, the trellis-based method invokes slightly less\noperations than best known exact methods. Moreover, if $A$ has structure, then\n$T_n$ becomes amenable to vertex merging, thereby significantly reducing its\ncomplexity.\n  - Repeated rows: Suppose $A$ has only $t<n$ distinct rows. The best known\nmethod to compute $per(A)$, due to Clifford and Clifford (2020), has complexity\n$O(n^{t+1})$. Merging vertices in $T_n$, we obtain a reduced trellis that has\ncomplexity $O(n^t)$.\n  - Order statistics: Using trellises, we compute the joint distribution of $t$\norder statistics of $n$ independent, but not identically distributed, random\nvariables in time $O(n^{t+1})$.

However, the $P-T$ phase diagram also suggested that 4D XY nature\nappears at finite temperatures. Here, we have determined the critical exponent\nof the superfluid density of $^4$He in two Gelsil samples that have pore\ndiameter to be about 3 nm, using a newly developed mechanical resonator\ntechnique. The critical exponent $\\zeta$ in the powerlaw fitting $\\rho_{\\mathrm\ns} \\propto \\left| 1 - T/T_{\\mathrm c} \\right| ^{\\zeta}$, where $T_{\\mathrm c}$\nis the superfluid transition temperature, was found to be 1.0 $\\pm$ 0.1 for all\npressures realized in this experiment, 0.1 $<$ $P$ $<$ 2.4 MPa. This value of\n$\\zeta$ gives a decisive evidence that the finite-temperature superfluid\ntransition belongs to 4D XY universality class. The emergence of the 4D XY\ncriticality is explained by the existence of many nanoscale superfluid\ndroplets, the so called localized Bose - Einstein condensates (LBECs), above\n$T_{\\mathrm c}$. Due to the large energy cost for $^4$He atoms to move between\nthe LBECs, the phase of the LBEC order parameters fluctuates not only in\nspatial (3D) but imaginary time ($+1$D) dimensions, resulting in the 4D XY\ncriticality by a temperature near $T_{\\mathrm c}$, which is determined by the\nfinite size of the system in the imaginary time dimension. Below $T_{\\mathrm\nc}$, macroscopic superfluidity grows in the nanopores of Gelsil by the\nalignment of the phases of the LBEC order parameters. An excess dissipation\npeak observed below $T_{\\mathrm c}$ is well explained by this phase matching\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 15:28:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 07:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

In order to learn a more generic policy, we\npropose a scalable RL architecture for the merging scenario that is not\nsensitive to changes in the environment configurations. According to our\nexperiments, the proposed RL agent can efficiently identify cooperative drivers\nfrom their vehicle state history and generate interactive maneuvers, resulting\nin faster and more comfortable automated driving. At the same time, thanks to\nthe safety constraints inside the planner, all of the maneuvers are collision\nfree and safe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 15:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

In addition, it is shown that the fraction\nand location of critical links have a strong influence on the performance of\nprediction algorithms.

A previous bitmap web\nAtlas was created in 1996, and was a pilot activity investigating the potential\nfor using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in the South Pacific. The\nobjective of the new atlas is to provide sets of spatial and attributive data\nand maps for use of educators, students, researchers, policy makers and other\nrelevant user groups and the public. GIS is a highly flexible and dynamic\ntechnology that allows the construction and analysis of maps and data sets from\na variety of sources and formats. Nowadays, GIS application has moved from\nlocal and client-server applications to a three-tier architecture: Client (Web\nBrowser) -- Application Web Map Server -- Spatial Data Warehouses. The\nobjective of this project is to produce an Atlas that will include interactive\nmaps and data on an Application Web Map Server. Intergraph products such as\nGeoMedia Professional, Web Map and Web Publisher have been selected for the web\natlas production and design. In an interactive environment, an atlas will be\ncomposed from a series of maps and data profiles, which will be based on legend\nentries, queries, hot spots and cartographic tools.

We have compared horizontal averages of the phase\nrelaxation, evaporation, reaction and condensation times within the cloud-clear\nair interface for the size distributions of the initial monodisperse and\npolydisperse droplets. For the monodisperse population, a clustering of the\nvalues of the reaction, phase and evaporation times, that is around 20-30\nseconds, is observed in the central area of the mixing layer, just before the\nlocation where the maximum value of the supersaturation turbulent flux occurs.\nThis clustering of values is similar for the polydisperse population but also\nincludes the condensation time. The mismatch between the time derivative of the\nsupersaturation and the condensation term in the interfacial mixing layer is\ncorrelated with the planar covariance of the horizontal longitudinal velocity\nderivatives of the carrier air flow and the supersaturation field, thus\nsuggesting that a quasi-linear relationship may exist between these quantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 15:46:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 14:52:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 14:29:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 18:21:19 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 22:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

Instead we propose learning features using a fully unsupervised\nneural network that does not require any human annotation. Specifically our\nmodel assigns each glyph written by the same scribal hand a shared vector\nembedding to represent that author's stylistic patterns, and each glyph\nrepresenting the same syllabic sign a shared vector embedding to represent the\nidentifying shape of that character. Thus the properties of each image in our\ndataset are represented as the combination of a scribe embedding and a sign\nembedding. We train this model using both a reconstructive loss governed by a\ndecoder that seeks to reproduce glyphs from their corresponding embeddings, and\na discriminative loss which measures the model's ability to predict whether or\nnot an embedding corresponds to a given image. Among the key contributions of\nthis work we (1) present a new dataset of Linear B glyphs, annotated by scribal\nhand and sign type, (2) propose a neural model for disentangling properties of\nscribal hands from glyph shape, and (3) quantitatively evaluate the learned\nembeddings on findplace prediction and similarity to manually extracted\nfeatures, showing improvements over simpler baseline methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 20:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}
