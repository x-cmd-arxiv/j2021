The more accurate the model the better\nthe control performance. However, in bipedal robots that demonstrate high\nagility actions, such as running and hopping, the robot hardware will suffer\nfrom impacts with the environment and deform in vulnerable parts, which\ninvalidates the predefined model. Thus, it is desired to have an adaptable\nkinematic structure that takes deformation into consideration. To account for\nthis we propose an approach that models all of the robotic joints as 6-DOF\njoints and develop an algorithm that can identify the kinematic structure from\nmotion capture data. We evaluate the algorithm's performance both in simulation\n- a three link pendulum, and on a bipedal robot - ATRIAS. In the simulated case\nthe algorithm produces a result that has a 3.6% error compared to the ground\ntruth, and on the real life bipedal robot the algorithm's result confirms our\nprior assumption where the joint deforms on out-of-plane degrees of freedom. In\naddition our algorithm is able to predict torques and forces using the\nreconstructed joint mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2021 16:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

Multi-modal missing imputation is challenging\nwith existing methods when 1) the missing data span across heterogeneous\nmodalities (e.g., image vs. non-image); or 2) one modality is largely missing.\nIn this paper, we address imputation of missing data by modeling the joint\ndistribution of multi-modal data. Motivated by partial bidirectional generative\nadversarial net (PBiGAN), we propose a new Conditional PBiGAN (C-PBiGAN) method\nthat imputes one modality combining the conditional knowledge from another\nmodality. Specifically, C-PBiGAN introduces a conditional latent space in a\nmissing imputation framework that jointly encodes the available multi-modal\ndata, along with a class regularization loss on imputed data to recover\ndiscriminative information. To our knowledge, it is the first generative\nadversarial model that addresses multi-modal missing imputation by modeling the\njoint distribution of image and non-image data. We validate our model with both\nthe national lung screening trial (NLST) dataset and an external clinical\nvalidation cohort.

Within the\nRM123 approach, it is possible to cleanly extract the value of $\\ell_{7}$ from\neither the pion mass splitting $M_{\\pi^{+}}-M_{\\pi^{0}}$ induced by strong\nisospin breaking at order $\\mathcal{O}\\left((\\Delta m)^{2}\\right)$ (mass\nmethod), or from the coupling of the neutral pion $\\pi^{0}$ to the isoscalar\noperator $\\left(\\bar{u}\\gamma_{5}u + \\bar{d}\\gamma_{5} d\\right)/\\sqrt{2}$ at\norder $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta m)$ (matrix element method). In this pilot study we\nlimit the analysis to a single ensemble generated by the Extended Twisted Mass\nCollaboration (ETMC) with $N_{f}=2+1+1$ dynamical quark flavours, which\ncorresponds to a lattice spacing $a\\simeq 0.095~{\\rm fm}$ and to a pion mass\n$M_{\\pi}\\simeq 260~{\\rm MeV}$. We find that the matrix element method\noutperforms the mass method in terms of resulting statistical accuracy. Our\ndetermination, $\\ell_{7} = 2.5(1.4)\\times 10^{-3}$, is in agreement and\nimproves previous calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2021 21:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

Thus, there is substantial value in\nunderstanding the performance of index policies and other policies that can be\ncomputed efficiently for large $N$. We study the growth of the optimality gap,\ni.e., the loss in expected performance compared to an optimal policy, for such\npolicies in a classical asymptotic regime proposed by Whittle in which $N$\ngrows while holding constant the fraction of arms that can be pulled per\nperiod. Intuition from the Central Limit Theorem and the tightest previous\ntheoretical bounds suggest that this optimality gap should grow like\n$O(\\sqrt{N})$.

Among its design principles, Rust is\naimed at matching C in terms of efficiency, but with increased code security\nand productivity. This paper presents a comparative study between C and Rust in\nterms of performance and programming effort, selecting as a case study the\nsimulation of N computational bodies (N-Body), a popular problem in the HPC\ncommunity. Based on the experimental work, it was possible to establish that\nRust is a language that reduces programming effort while maintaining acceptable\nperformance levels, meaning that it is a possible alternative to C for HPC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 00:09:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 22:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

However,\nthe uncertainty caused by unreliable relations in the propagation structure is\ncommon and inevitable due to wily rumor producers and the limited collection of\nspread data. Most approaches neglect it and may seriously limit the learning of\nfeatures. Towards this issue, this paper makes the first attempt to explore\npropagation uncertainty for rumor detection. Specifically, we propose a novel\nEdge-enhanced Bayesian Graph Convolutional Network (EBGCN) to capture robust\nstructural features. The model adaptively rethinks the reliability of latent\nrelations by adopting a Bayesian approach. Besides, we design a new edge-wise\nconsistency training framework to optimize the model by enforcing consistency\non relations.

One of these is the naturally existing statistical heterogeneity\namong clients, making local data distributions non independently and\nidentically distributed (i.e., non-iid), which poses challenges for model\naggregation and personalization. For FL with a deep neural network (DNN),\nprivatizing some layers is a simple yet effective solution for non-iid\nproblems. However, which layers should we privatize to facilitate the learning\nprocess? Do different categories of non-iid scenes have preferred privatization\nways? Can we automatically learn the most appropriate privatization way during\nFL? In this paper, we answer these questions via abundant experimental studies\non several FL benchmarks. First, we present the detailed statistics of these\nbenchmarks and categorize them into covariate and label shift non-iid scenes.\nThen, we investigate both coarse-grained and fine-grained network splits and\nexplore whether the preferred privatization ways have any potential relations\nto the specific category of a non-iid scene. Our findings are exciting, e.g.,\nprivatizing the base layers could boost the performances even in label shift\nnon-iid scenes, which are inconsistent with some natural conjectures. We also\nfind that none of these privatization ways could improve the performances on\nthe Shakespeare benchmark, and we guess that Shakespeare may not be a seriously\nnon-iid scene. Finally, we propose several approaches to automatically learn\nwhere to aggregate via cross-stitch, soft attention, and hard selection. We\nadvocate the proposed methods could serve as a preliminary try to explore where\nto privatize for a novel non-iid scene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 04:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

To develop FBM-CENet and FBM-DetNet, the maximum-likelihood channel\nestimation and data detection problems are reformulated to overcome the\nvanishing gradient issue. An important feature of the proposed FBM-CENet\nstructure is that the pilot matrix is integrated into its weight matrices of\nthe channel estimator.

The core design of ThunderRW is motivated by our\nprofiling results: common RW algorithms have as high as 73.1% CPU pipeline\nslots stalled due to irregular memory access, which suffers significantly more\nmemory stalls than the conventional graph workloads such as BFS and SSSP.

The average spectrum over the entire duration exhibits a strong soft\nX-ray excess above the power-law continuum. The soft X-ray excess is well\ndescribed by two thermal components with temperatures of kT_BB1 ~120 eV and\nkT_BB2 ~460 eV. The warm thermal component is likely due to the presence of an\noptically thick and warm Comptonizing plasma in the inner accretion disk. The\nfractional variability amplitude is found to be decreasing with increasing\nwavelength, i.e. from the soft X-ray to UV/optical emission. However, the hard\nX-ray (2-8 keV) emission shows very low variability.

It was thought that\nrelativistic electrons, responsible for the radio emission, originate in\ncurrent sheets formed where the wind opens the magnetic field lines.

High-risk PE is caused by right ventricular (RV)\ndysfunction from acute pressure overload, which in return can help identify\nwhich patients require more aggressive therapy.

Traditional land cover classification usually needs tremendous\ncomputational resources, which often becomes a huge burden to the remote\nsensing community. Undoubtedly cloud computing is one of the best choices for\nland cover classification, however, if not managed properly, the computation\ncost on the cloud could be surprisingly high. Recently, cutting the unnecessary\ncomputation long tail has become a promising solution for saving the cost in\nthe cloud. For land cover classification, it is generally not necessary to\nachieve the best accuracy and 85% can be regarded as a reliable land cover\nclassification. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for\ncost-effective remote sensing classification. Given the desired accuracy, the\nclustering algorithm can stop early for cost-saving whilst achieving sufficient\naccuracy for land cover image classification. Experimental results show that\nachieving 85%-99.9% accuracy needs only 27.34%-60.83% of the total cloud\ncomputation cost for achieving a 100% accuracy. To put it into perspective, for\nthe US land cover classification example, the proposed approach can save over\n$1,593,490.18 for the government in each single-use when the desired accuracy\nis 90%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 08:13:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 06:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

SN 2019hcc\npost-peak spectra show a well-developed H alpha P-Cygni profile from 19 days\npast maximum and its light curve, in terms of its absolute peak luminosity and\nevolution, resembles that of a fast-declining Hydrogen-rich supernova (SN IIL).\nThe object does not show any unambiguous sign of interaction as there is no\nevidence of narrow lines in the spectra or undulations in the light curve. Our\ntardis spectral modelling of the first spectrum shows that Carbon, Nitrogen and\nOxygen (CNO) at 19000 K reproduce the `w' shape and suggests that a combination\nof non-thermally excited CNO and metal lines at 8000 K could reproduce the\nfeature seen at 4000 {\\AA}.

For example, the\ncontinuous features are usually transformed to the power forms by adding a new\nfeature to allow it to easily form non-linear functions of the feature.\nHowever, this kind of feature engineering heavily relies on peoples experience\nand it is both time consuming and labor consuming.

Solvated ions have a profound\neffect on the behavior of ionic solutions, which is crucial in nature and\ntechnology. Experimentally, ions have been classified into \"structure makers\"\nor \"structure breakers\", depending on whether they slow down or accelerate the\nsolution dynamics. Theoretically, the dynamics of ions has been explained by a\ndielectric friction model combining hydrodynamics and charge-dipole interaction\nin the continuum description. However, both approaches lack a microscopic\nstructural basis, leaving the microscopic understanding of salt effects\nunclear. Here we elucidate unique microscopic features of solvation of\nspherical ions by computer simulations. We find that increasing the ion\nelectric field causes a sharp transitional decrease in the hydration-shell\nthickness, signaling the ion mobility change from the Stokes to dielectric\nfriction regime. The dielectric friction regime can be further divided into two\ndue to the competition between the water-water hydrogen bonding and ion-water\nelectrostatic interactions: Whether the former or latter prevails determines\nwhether the water dynamics are accelerated or decelerated. In the ion-water\ninteraction predominant regime, a specific combination of ion size and charge\nstabilizes the hydration shell via orientational-symmetry breaking, reminiscent\nof the Thomson problem for the electron configuration of atoms. Notably, the\nhydration-shell stability is much higher for a composite coordination number\nthan a prime one, a prime-number effect on solvent dynamics.

The origin of the heating of the solar atmosphere is still an\nunsolved problem. As the photosphere and chromosphere radiate more energy than\nthe solar corona, it is challenging but important to reveal all the mechanisms\nthat contribute to plasma heating there. Ion-neutral collisions could play an\nimportant role. Aims. We aim to investigate the impulsively generated two-fluid\nmagnetoacoustic waves in the partially ionized solar chromosphere and to study\nthe associated heating and plasma outflows, which higher up may result in\nnascent solar wind. Methods. To describe the plasma dynamics, we applied a\ntwo-fluid model in which ions+electrons and neutrals are treated as separate\nfluids. We solved the two-fluid equations numerically using the JOANNA code.\nResults. We show that magnetoacoustic waves triggered in the photosphere by\nlocalised velocity pulses can steepen into shocks which heat the chromosphere\nthrough ion-neutral collisions. Pulses of greater amplitude heat plasma more\neffectively and generate larger plasma outflows. Rising the altitude at which\nthe pulse is launched results in opposite effects, mainly in local cooling of\nthe chromosphere and slower plasma outflows. Conclusions. Even a solitary pulse\nresults in a train of waves. These waves can transform into shock waves and\nrelease thermal energy, heating the chromosphere significantly. A pulse can\ndrive vertical flows which higher up can result in the origin of the solar\nwind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 09:19:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

Most current works simply measure\nthe video-text similarity based on video-level and text-level embeddings.\nHowever, the neglect of more fine-grained or local information causes the\nproblem of insufficient representation. Some works exploit the local details by\ndisentangling sentences, but overlook the corresponding videos, causing the\nasymmetry of video-text representation. To address the above limitations, we\npropose a Hierarchical Alignment Network (HANet) to align different level\nrepresentations for video-text matching. Specifically, we first decompose video\nand text into three semantic levels, namely event (video and text), action\n(motion and verb), and entity (appearance and noun). Based on these, we\nnaturally construct hierarchical representations in the individual-local-global\nmanner, where the individual level focuses on the alignment between frame and\nword, local level focuses on the alignment between video clip and textual\ncontext, and global level focuses on the alignment between the whole video and\ntext. Different level alignments capture fine-to-coarse correlations between\nvideo and text, as well as take the advantage of the complementary information\namong three semantic levels. Besides, our HANet is also richly interpretable by\nexplicitly learning key semantic concepts.

Methods: We combine high-resolution\nspectroscopic Ca II data from the Dunn Solar Telescope and vector magnetic\nfield observations from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) to\ninvestigate thermal enhancements in a sunspot light bridge. The photospheric\nmagnetic field from HMI was extrapolated to the corona using a non-force-free\nfield technique that provided the three-dimensional distribution of electric\ncurrents, while an inversion of the chromospheric Ca II line with a local\nthermodynamic equilibrium and a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium spectral\narchive delivered the temperature stratifications from the photosphere to the\nchromosphere. Results: We find that the light bridge is a site of strong\nelectric currents, of about 0.3 A/m^2 at the bottom boundary, which extend to\nabout 0.7 Mm while decreasing monotonically with height. These currents produce\na chromospheric temperature excess of about 600-800 K relative to the umbra.\nOnly the light bridge, where relatively weak and highly inclined magnetic\nfields emerge over a duration of 13 hr, shows a spatial coincidence of thermal\nenhancements and electric currents. The temperature enhancements and the\nCowling heating are primarily confined to a height range of 0.4-0.7 Mm above\nthe light bridge. The corresponding increase in internal energy of 200 J/m^3\ncan be supplied by the heating in about 10 min. Conclusions: Our results\nprovide direct evidence for currents heating the lower solar chromosphere\nthrough Ohmic dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 09:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

In this work, we explore the robustness of visual object\ntrackers against motion blur from a new angle, i.e., adversarial blur attack\n(ABA). Our main objective is to online transfer input frames to their natural\nmotion-blurred counterparts while misleading the state-of-the-art trackers\nduring the tracking process. To this end, we first design the motion blur\nsynthesizing method for visual tracking based on the generation principle of\nmotion blur, considering the motion information and the light accumulation\nprocess. With this synthetic method, we propose optimization-based ABA (OP-ABA)\nby iteratively optimizing an adversarial objective function against the\ntracking w.r.t. the motion and light accumulation parameters. The OP-ABA is\nable to produce natural adversarial examples but the iteration can cause heavy\ntime cost, making it unsuitable for attacking real-time trackers. To alleviate\nthis issue, we further propose one-step ABA (OS-ABA) where we design and train\na joint adversarial motion and accumulation predictive network (JAMANet) with\nthe guidance of OP-ABA, which is able to efficiently estimate the adversarial\nmotion and accumulation parameters in a one-step way. The experiments on four\npopular datasets (e.g., OTB100, VOT2018, UAV123, and LaSOT) demonstrate that\nour methods are able to cause significant accuracy drops on four\nstate-of-the-art trackers with high transferability.

However, coronal magnetic extrapolations indicated\nthat some magnetic field lines might possess more than one dip. It is expected\nthat the formation process would be significantly different in this case\ncompared to a single-dipped magnetic flux tube. In this paper, based on the\nevaporation-condensation model, we study filament thread formation in\ndouble-dipped magnetic flux tubes by numerical simulations. We find that only\nwith particular combinations of magnetic configuration and heating, e.g.,\nconcentrated localized heating and a long magnetic flux tube with deep dips,\ncan two threads form and persist in a double-dipped magnetic flux tube.\nComparing our parametric survey with observations, we conclude that such\nmagnetically connected threads due to multiple dips are more likely to exist in\nquiescent filaments than in active-region filaments. Moreover, we find that\nthese threads are usually shorter than independently trapped threads, which\nmight be one of the reasons why quiescent filaments have short threads. These\ncharacteristics of magnetically connected threads could also explain barbs and\nvertical threads in quiescent filaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 12:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

We show\nthat the ability of neural machine translation (NMT) models to translate\nnegation has improved with deeper and more advanced networks, although the\nperformance varies between language pairs and translation directions. The\naccuracy of manual evaluation in EN-DE, DE-EN, EN-ZH, and ZH-EN is 95.7%,\n94.8%, 93.4%, and 91.7%, respectively. In addition, we show that\nunder-translation is the most significant error type in NMT, which contrasts\nwith the more diverse error profile previously observed for statistical machine\ntranslation. To better understand the root of the under-translation of\nnegation, we study the model's information flow and training data. While our\ninformation flow analysis does not reveal any deficiencies that could be used\nto detect or fix the under-translation of negation, we find that negation is\noften rephrased during training, which could make it more difficult for the\nmodel to learn a reliable link between source and target negation. We finally\nconduct intrinsic analysis and extrinsic probing tasks on negation, showing\nthat NMT models can distinguish negation and non-negation tokens very well and\nencode a lot of information about negation in hidden states but nevertheless\nleave room for improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 13:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

Our\nlocal2global approach proceeds by first dividing the input graph into\noverlapping subgraphs (or \"patches\") and training local representations for\neach patch independently. In a second step, we combine the local\nrepresentations into a globally consistent representation by estimating the set\nof rigid motions that best align the local representations using information\nfrom the patch overlaps, via group synchronization. A key distinguishing\nfeature of local2global relative to existing work is that patches are trained\nindependently without the need for the often costly parameter synchronisation\nduring distributed training. This allows local2global to scale to large-scale\nindustrial applications, where the input graph may not even fit into memory and\nmay be stored in a distributed manner. Preliminary results on medium-scale data\nsets (up to $\\sim$7K nodes and $\\sim$200K edges) are promising, with a graph\nreconstruction performance for local2global that is comparable to that of\nglobally trained embeddings.

Such an SGWB would contribute an extra radiation component to\nthe background Universe which may affect its expansion history. As such, it may\nhelp alleviate the current Hubble tension, a novel connection between\ngravitational waves and cosmology. We demonstrate this by considering a\ncosmological model, the \"standard inflation + stiff amplification\" scenario,\nwith two components added to the LCDM model: a stiff component (w=1) and the\nprimordial SGWB. Previously, we showed that even for standard inflation, the\nSGWB may be detectable at the high frequencies probed by laser interferometers,\nif it is amplified by a possible early stiff era after reheating. Models that\nboost the SGWB enough to cause significant backreaction, however, must still\npreserve the well-measured radiation-matter equality, as precision cosmology\ndemands. For that, we calculate the fully-coupled evolution of the SGWB and\nexpansion history, sampling parameter space (tensor-to-scalar ratio, reheating\ntemperature and temperature at stiff-to-radiation equality). We then perform a\njoint analysis of the NANOGrav results and latest upper bounds from Planck, big\nbang nucleosynthesis and Advanced LIGO-Virgo, to constrain the model. The\nresulting blue-tilted, stiff-amplified SGWB is still too small to explain the\nNANOGrav results. However, if someday, Advanced LIGO-Virgo detects the SGWB,\nour model can explain it within standard inflation (without requiring an\ninitial blue tilt). Meanwhile, this model may bring current high-z measurements\nof the Hubble constant within 3.4 sigma of the low-z measurements by SH0ES\n(from 4.4 sigma) and within 2.6 sigma of those by H0LiCOW (from 3.1 sigma),\nreducing the tension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 14:17:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 03:44:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 01:45:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 10:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

When analyzing architecture implementations\nof quantum hardware, characterizing this quality forms an important factor in\nunderstanding their performance. Fundamental characteristics of quantum\nhardware lead to inherent tradeoffs between the quality of states and\ntraditional performance metrics such as throughput. Furthermore, any real-world\nimplementation of quantum hardware exhibits time-dependent noise that degrades\nthe quality of quantum states over time. Here, we study the performance of two\npossible architectures for interfacing a quantum processor with a quantum\nnetwork. The first corresponds to the current experimental state of the art in\nwhich the same device functions both as a processor and a network device. The\nsecond corresponds to a future architecture that separates these two functions\nover two distinct devices. We model these architectures as Markov chains and\ncompare their quality of executing quantum operations and producing entangled\nquantum states as functions of their memory lifetimes, as well as the time that\nit takes to perform various operations within each architecture. As an\nillustrative example, we apply our analysis to architectures based on\nNitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond, where we find that for present-day device\nparameters one architecture is more suited to computation-heavy applications,\nand the other for network-heavy ones. Besides the detailed study of these\narchitectures, a novel contribution of our work are several formulas that\nconnect an understanding of waiting time distributions to the decay of quantum\nquality over time for the most common noise models employed in quantum\ntechnologies.

To circumvent the use of approximate\ninference, we start by studying the infinite-width case, where Bayesian\ninference can be exact considering the corresponding Gaussian process.\nStrikingly, the kernels induced under common architectural choices lead to\nuncertainties that do not reflect the underlying data generating process and\nare therefore unsuited for OOD detection.

The basis of our approach is to develop a global\nunderstanding of light scalar and pseudoscalar mesons (up to around 2 GeV) and\nthereby explore the underlying mixings among composite quark matter fields and\nglueballs. The chiral sector of the Lagrangian is formulated in terms of two\nchiral nonets representing quark-antiquarks and tetraquarks (in the leading\norder, this sector contains terms with eight or fewer number of quak or\nantiquark lines). The Lagrangian also contains a sector that represents scalar\nand pseudoscalar glueballs and their interactions with the matter chiral\nfields, in a manner that the axial and trace anomalies of QCD are exactly\nrealized. In this construct, the model has two scalar octets and two\npdeudoscalar octets (each a linear combination of two- and four-quark\ncomponents), as well as three scalar SU(3) singlets and three pseudoscalar\nSU(3) singlets (each a linear combination of two- and four-quark components as\nwell as a glueball component).

The recently-developed process of loading\natoms into traps results in approximately half of the traps being filled. To\nconsolidate the atoms so that they form a dense and regular arrangement, such\nas all locations in a grid, atoms are rearranged using moving optical tweezers.\nTime is of the essence, as the longer that the process takes and the more that\natoms are moved, the higher the chance that atoms will be lost in the process.\n  Viewed as a problem on graphs, we wish to solve the problem of reconfiguring\none arrangement of tokens (representing atoms) to another using as few moves as\npossible. Because the problem is NP-complete on general graphs as well as on\ngrids, we focus on the parameterized complexity for various parameters,\nconsidering both undirected and directed graphs, and tokens with and without\nlabels. For unlabelled tokens, the problem is in FPT when parameterizing by the\nnumber of tokens, the number of moves, or the number of moves plus the number\nof vertices without tokens in either the source or target configuration, but\nintractable when parameterizing by the difference between the number of moves\nand the number of differences in the placement of tokens in the source and\ntarget configurations.

Therefore, precise knowledge of\nthe production cross section of $^{11}\\text{C}$ is very relevant for the\nunderstanding of Boron production in the Galaxy. We present a preliminary\nmeasurement of the fragmentation cross section of $\\text{C+p}\\to\n^{11}\\text{C}$, which, together with our previously reported B-production cross\nsection, provides a new constraint on Boron production in the Galaxy in the\nhigh-energy range relevant for modern space based cosmic-ray experiments like\nAMS-02.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 15:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

First, due to\nintertwining with intrinsic band topology-driven energy-zero modes in the\npristine case, spin-filtered chiral edge states in zigzag-Xene nanoribbons\nremain gapless and protected against backward scattering even with finite\ninter-edge overlapping in ultra-narrow ribbons, i.e., a 2D quantum spin Hall\nmaterial turns into a 1D topological metal.

Third,\nwhen the width of zigzag-Xene nanoribbons is smaller than a critical limit,\ntopological switching between edge states can be attained without bulk bandgap\nclosing and reopening.

However, the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) SNNs suffer from high inference latency, resulting from inefficient\ninput encoding and training techniques. The most widely used input coding\nschemes, such as Poisson based rate-coding, do not leverage the temporal\nlearning capabilities of SNNs. This paper presents a training framework for\nlow-latency energy-efficient SNNs that uses a hybrid encoding scheme at the\ninput layer in which the analog pixel values of an image are directly applied\nduring the first timestep and a novel variant of spike temporal coding is used\nduring subsequent timesteps. In particular, neurons in every hidden layer are\nrestricted to fire at most once per image which increases activation sparsity.\nTo train these hybrid-encoded SNNs, we propose a variant of the gradient\ndescent based spike timing dependent back propagation (STDB) mechanism using a\nnovel cross entropy loss function based on both the output neurons' spike time\nand membrane potential. The resulting SNNs have reduced latency and high\nactivation sparsity, yielding significant improvements in computational\nefficiency.

Suppose one considers initial\nopinions equally spaced on an interval of length $L$. As first observed by\nLorenz, simulations suggest that there are three intervals $[0, L_1)$, $(L_1,\nL_2)$ and $(L_2, L_3)$, with $L_1 \\approx 5.23$, $L_2 \\approx 5.67$ and $L_3\n\\approx 6.84$ such that, when the number of agents is sufficiently large,\nconsensus occurs in the first and third intervals, whereas for the second\ninterval the system fragments into three clusters. In this paper, we prove\nconsensus for $L \\leq 5.2$ and for $L$ sufficiently close to 6. These proofs\ninclude large computations and in principle the set of $L$ for which consensus\ncan be proven using our approach may be extended with the use of more computing\npower. We also prove that the set of $L$ for which consensus occurs is open.\nMoreover, we prove that, when consensus is assured for the equally spaced\nsystems, this in turn implies asymptotic almost sure consensus for the same\nvalues of $L$ when initial opinions are drawn independently and uniformly at\nrandom. We thus conjecture a pair of phase transitions, making precise the\nformulation of Lorenz's \"consensus strikes back\" hypothesis. Our approach makes\nuse of the continuous agent model introduced by Blondel, Hendrickx and\nTsitsiklis. Indeed, one contribution of the paper is to provide a presentation\nof the relationships between the three different models with equally spaced,\nuniformly random and continuous agents, respectively, which is more rigorous\nthan what can be found in the existing literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 15:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

Yet traditional hunter-gatherers, who lead physically hard lives,\nburn no more calories each day than western populations living in labour-saving\nenvironments. Indeed, there is now a wealth of data, both for humans and other\nanimals, demonstrating that long-term lifestyle changes involving increases in\nexercise or other physical activities do not result in commensurate increases\nin daily energy expenditure (DEE). This is because humans and other animals\nexhibit a degree of energy compensation at the organismal level, ameliorating\nsome of the increases in DEE that would occur from the increased activity by\ndecreasing the energy expended on other biological processes. And energy\ncompensation can be sizable, reaching many hundreds of calories in humans. But\nthe processes that are downregulated in the long-term to achieve energy\ncompensation are far from clear, particularly in humans. We do not know how\nenergy compensation is achieved.

Prevailing methods are limited to a transductive setting and\nhard to process unseen entities. The recent proposed subgraph-based models\nprovided alternatives to predict links from the subgraph structure surrounding\na candidate triplet. However, these methods require abundant known facts of\ntraining triplets and perform poorly on relationships that only have a few\ntriplets. In this paper, we propose Meta-iKG, a novel subgraph-based\nmeta-learner for few-shot inductive relation reasoning. Meta-iKG utilizes local\nsubgraphs to transfer subgraph-specific information and learn transferable\npatterns faster via meta gradients. In this way, we find the model can quickly\nadapt to few-shot relationships using only a handful of known facts with\ninductive settings. Moreover, we introduce a large-shot relation update\nprocedure to traditional meta-learning to ensure that our model can generalize\nwell both on few-shot and large-shot relations. We evaluate Meta-iKG on\ninductive benchmarks sampled from NELL and Freebase, and the results show that\nMeta-iKG outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods both in few-shot\nscenarios and standard inductive settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 11:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

Purcell presented a basic explanation of the magnetic\nforce experienced by a test charge moving parallel to a stationary\ncurrent-carrying wire. According to Purcell's derivation, this force results\nfrom the difference between the relativistic length contraction of the distance\namong the stationary positive charges of the wire and the relativistic length\ncontraction of the distance among the negative charges moving in the wire, when\nthe charges are observed in the rest frame of the test charge. The contraction\ndifference generates a charge density unbalance that in the rest frame of the\ntest charge is experienced as an electrostatic force, while in the lab frame is\nperceived as the magnetic force. In the present paper, we show that Purcell's\napproach is problematic since it generates inconsistencies and paradoxes. We\nmaintain that Purcell's derivation has only an illustrative and expository\nvalue and should not be taken literally as describing something that really and\nphysically happens in the wire.
