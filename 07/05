It requires both nontrivial band\ntopology and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking. In most cases, one could\nbreak the TRS of time-reversal invariant topological materials to yield QAH\neffect, which is essentially a topological phase transition. Conventional\ntopological phase transition induced by external field/stimulus needs a route\nalong which the bandgap closes and re-opens. Hence, the phase transition occurs\nonly when the magnitude of field/stimulus is larger than a critical value. In\nthis work we propose that using gapless surface states, the transition can\nhappen at arbitrarily weak (but finite) external field strength.

IRS, also known as software-controlled\nmetasurfaces, consist of an array of adjustable radio wave reflectors, enabling\nsmart radio environments, e.g., for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nand spatial diversity of wireless channels. Research on IRS to date has been\nlargely focused on constructive applications. In this work, we demonstrate for\nthe first time that the IRS provides a practical low-cost toolkit for attackers\nto easily perform complex signal manipulation attacks on the physical layer in\nreal time. We introduce the environment reconfiguration attack (ERA) as a novel\nclass of jamming attacks in wireless radio networks. Here, an adversary\nleverages the IRS to rapidly vary the electromagnetic propagation environment\nto disturb legitimate receivers. The IRS gives the adversary a key advantage\nover traditional jamming: It no longer has to actively emit jamming signals,\ninstead the IRS reflects existing legitimate signals. In addition, the\nadversary doesn't need any knowledge about the legitimate channel.

Here, we tackle two major challenges with TS that limit\nits usability: \\textit{distribution shift} and \\textit{scalability}. We first\ndiscover and analyze a counter-intuitive phenomenon: action selection through\nTS and a pre-trained value function often leads to lower performance compared\nto the original pre-trained agent, even when having access to the exact state\nand reward in future steps. We show this is due to a distribution shift to\nareas where value estimates are highly inaccurate and analyze this effect using\nExtreme Value theory. To overcome this problem, we introduce a novel off-policy\ncorrection term that accounts for the mismatch between the pre-trained value\nand its corresponding TS policy by penalizing under-sampled trajectories. We\nprove that our correction eliminates the above mismatch and bound the\nprobability of sub-optimal action selection. Our correction significantly\nimproves pre-trained Rainbow agents without any further training, often more\nthan doubling their scores on Atari games.

Rational\nexpectations of forward looking agents on the dynamics of aggregate mobility\nand epidemic determine individual mobility decisions. The model allows to\nevaluate alternative scenarios of mobility restrictions, especially policies\ndependent on the state of epidemic.

In this work, we present a generalized formalism of\nacoustic radiation force and radiation torque based on the polarizability\ntensor, where Willis coupling terms are included to account for geometric\nasymmetry. Following Gorkov's approach, the effects of geometric asymmetry are\nexplicitly formulated as additional terms in the radiation force and torque\nexpressions.

We investigate in detail the cases\nof standing and travelling plane waves, showing how the equilibrium positions\nand angles are shifted by these additional terms. We show that while the\ncontributions of asymmetry to the force are often negligible for small\nparticles, these terms greatly affect the radiation torque.

However, existing RGB-D SOD models often fail to perform well in\nterms of both efficiency and accuracy, which hinders their potential\napplications on mobile devices and real-world problems. An underlying challenge\nis that the model accuracy usually degrades when the model is simplified to\nhave few parameters. To tackle this dilemma and also inspired by the fact that\ndepth quality is a key factor influencing the accuracy, we propose a novel\ndepth quality-inspired feature manipulation (DQFM) process, which is efficient\nitself and can serve as a gating mechanism for filtering depth features to\ngreatly boost the accuracy. DQFM resorts to the alignment of low-level RGB and\ndepth features, as well as holistic attention of the depth stream to explicitly\ncontrol and enhance cross-modal fusion. We embed DQFM to obtain an efficient\nlight-weight model called DFM-Net, where we also design a tailored depth\nbackbone and a two-stage decoder for further efficiency consideration.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that our DFM-Net achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy when comparing to existing non-efficient models, and\nmeanwhile runs at 140ms on CPU (2.2$\\times$ faster than the prior fastest\nefficient model) with only $\\sim$8.5Mb model size (14.9% of the prior\nlightest).

We use a random grating substrate to introduce\nAnderson localization of the SPP waves propagating through the graphene\nmonolayer to enhance their optical amplification at resonant frequencies. It is\nshown that the enhancement factor of the resonant peaks corresponding to the\ngraphene SPPs can be as high as 175. We also analyze their corresponding field\nintensity distributions along the graphene monolayer and find out that their\nintensities and localization positions are different from each other. By\ninvestigating the pump dependent and temperature dependent variations of the\ntransmittance of the structure, it is shown that the resonant peak frequencies\nare blue-shifted by increasing the temperature and the external pump intensity.\nAlso, we show that increasing the ambient temperature by 60 K can dramatically\nreduce the output amplified intensity by a factor of 70.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved super-human prediction\nperformance in particular data types, e.g., images. However, existing DNNs may\nnot produce meaningful results when applied to structured data. The reason is\nthat there are correlations and dependencies across combinations of attribute\nvalues in a table, and these do not follow simple additive patterns that can be\neasily mimicked by a DNN. The number of possible such cross features is\ncombinatorial, making them computationally prohibitive to model. Furthermore,\nthe deployment of learning models in real-world applications has also\nhighlighted the need for interpretability, especially for high-stakes\napplications, which remains another issue of concern to DNNs.\n  In this paper, we present ARM-Net, an adaptive relation modeling network\ntailored for structured data, and a lightweight framework ARMOR based on\nARM-Net for relational data analytics. The key idea is to model feature\ninteractions with cross features selectively and dynamically, by first\ntransforming the input features into exponential space, and then determining\nthe interaction order and interaction weights adaptively for each cross\nfeature. We propose a novel sparse attention mechanism to dynamically generate\nthe interaction weights given the input tuple, so that we can explicitly model\ncross features of arbitrary orders with noisy features filtered selectively.\nThen during model inference, ARM-Net can specify the cross features being used\nfor each prediction for higher accuracy and better interpretability. Our\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ARM-Net\nconsistently outperforms existing models and provides more interpretable\npredictions for data-driven decision making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 07:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

In\npractice, they often provide improved performance over (stochastic) gradient\ndescent~(GD) with faster convergence. Despite these empirical successes,\ntheoretical understandings of their accelerated convergence rates are still\nlacking. Recently, some attempts have been made by analyzing the trajectories\nof gradient-based methods in an over-parameterized regime, where the number of\nthe parameters is significantly larger than the number of the training\ninstances. However, the majority of existing theoretical work is mainly\nconcerned with GD and the established convergence result of NAG is inferior to\nHB and GD, which fails to explain the practical success of NAG. In this paper,\nwe take a step towards closing this gap by analyzing NAG in training a randomly\ninitialized over-parameterized two-layer fully connected neural network with\nReLU activation. Despite the fact that the objective function is non-convex and\nnon-smooth, we show that NAG converges to a global minimum at a non-asymptotic\nlinear rate $(1-\\Theta(1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}))^t$, where $\\kappa > 1$ is the\ncondition number of a gram matrix and $t$ is the number of the iterations.\nCompared to the convergence rate $(1-\\Theta(1/{\\kappa}))^t$ of GD, our result\nprovides theoretical guarantees for the acceleration of NAG in neural network\ntraining.

An updating packet generated\nat source is sent to receiver and the relay simultaneously. When the direct\npacket transmission fails, the relay replaces the source and retransmits the\npacket until it is eventually obtained at the receiver side. Assume that the\npropagation delay on each link is one time slot, we determine the stationary\ndistribution of the AoI for three cases: (a) relay has no buffer and the packet\ndelivery from relay cannot be preempted by fresher updates from source; (b)\nrelay has no buffer but the packet substitution is allowable; (c) relay has\nsize 1 buffer and the packet in buffer is refreshed when a newer packet is\nobtained. The idea is invoking a multiple-dimensional state vector which\ncontains the AoI as a part and constituting the multiple-dimensional AoI\nstochastic process. We find the steady state of each multiple-dimensional AoI\nprocess by solving the system of stationary equations. Once the steady-state\ndistribution of larger-dimensional AoI process is known, the stationary AoI\ndistribution is also obtained as it is one of the marginal distributions of\nthat process's steady-state distribution. For all the situations, we derive the\nexplicit expression of AoI distribution, and calculate the mean and the\nvariance of the stationary AoI. All the results are compared numerically,\nincluding the AoI performance of the non-relay state updating system. Numerical\nresults show that adding the relay improves the system's timeliness\ndramatically, and no-buffer-and-preemption setting in relay achieves both\nminimal average AoI and AoI's variance. Thus, for the system model discussed in\nthis paper, to reduce the AoI at receiver there is no need to add the buffer in\nrelay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 07:45:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 09:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-12"}

As one of the key issues of\nrealizing these applications autonomously, path planning problem has been\nstudied with main objectives on minimizing travel distance, flight time and\nenergy cost. However, AAM operations in metropolitan areas bring safety and\nsociety issues. Because most of AAM aircraft are unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) and they may fail to operate resulting in fatality risk, property damage\nrisk and societal impacts (noise and privacy) to the public. To quantitatively\nassess these risks and mitigate them in planning phase, this paper proposes an\nintegrated risk assessment model and develops a hybrid algorithm to solve the\nrisk-based 3D path planning problem. The integrated risk assessment method\nconsiders probability and severity models of UAV impact ground people and\nvehicle. By introducing gravity model, the population density and traffic\ndensity are estimated in a finer scale, which enables more accurate risk\nassessment. The 3D risk-based path planning problem is first formulated as a\nspecial minimum cost flow problem. Then, a hybrid estimation of distribution\nalgorithm (EDA) and risk-based A* (named as EDA-RA*) algorithm is proposed to\nsolve the problem. To improve computational efficiency, k-means clustering\nmethod is incorporated into EDA-RA* to provide both global and local search\nheuristic information, which formed the EDA and fast risk-based A* algorithm we\ncall EDA-FRA*.

Although the use of a large number of legs can overcome these\nproblems, it makes the body long and leads to many legs being constrained to\ncontact with the ground to support the long body, which impedes\nmaneuverability. To improve the locomotion maneuverability of such robots, the\npresent study focuses on dynamic instability, which induces rapid and large\nmovement changes, and uses a 12-legged robot with a flexible body axis. Our\nprevious work found that the straight walk of the robot becomes unstable\nthrough Hopf bifurcation when the body axis flexibility is changed, which\ninduces body undulations.

As a possible component of SGWB, gravitational\nwaves (GW) from bubble collisions during the first order cosmological phase\ntransitions deserve comprehensive analyses. In 2017, Ryusuke Jinno and Masahiro\nTakimoto proposed an elegant analysis approach to derive the analytical\nexpressions of energy spectra of GW from bubble collisions in Minkowski\nspacetime avoiding large-scale numerical simulations for the first time[26].\nHowever, they neglect the expansion of the universe and regard the duration of\nphase transitions as infinity in their derivation which could deviate their\nestimations from true values. For these two reasons, we give a new expression\nof GW spectra by adopting their method, switching spacetime background to FLRW\nspacetime, and considering a finite duration of phase transitions. By denoting\n$\\sigma$ as the fraction of the speed of phase transitions to the expansion\nspeed of the universe, we find when $\\sigma$ is around $\\mathcal{O}(10)$, the\nmaxima of estimated GW energy spectra drop by around 1 order of magnitude than\nthe results given by their previous work.

Among the numerous ways\nto address privacy-preserving learning, we here take the perspective of\ncomputing the divergences between distributions under the Differential Privacy\n(DP) framework -- being able to compute divergences between distributions is\npivotal for many machine learning problems, such as learning generative models\nor domain adaptation problems. Instead of resorting to the popular\ngradient-based sanitization method for DP, we tackle the problem at its roots\nby focusing on the Sliced Wasserstein Distance and seamlessly making it\ndifferentially private. Our main contribution is as follows: we analyze the\nproperty of adding a Gaussian perturbation to the intrinsic randomized\nmechanism of the Sliced Wasserstein Distance, and we establish the\nsensitivityof the resulting differentially private mechanism. One of our\nimportant findings is that this DP mechanism transforms the Sliced Wasserstein\ndistance into another distance, that we call the Smoothed Sliced Wasserstein\nDistance. This new differentially private distribution distance can be plugged\ninto generative models and domain adaptation algorithms in a transparent way,\nand we empirically show that it yields highly competitive performance compared\nwith gradient-based DP approaches from the literature, with almost no loss in\naccuracy for the domain adaptation problems that we consider.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 08:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

In this paper, we\naim to overcome this limitation by integrating expert knowledge with domain\nadaptation in a synthetic-to-real framework for unsupervised fault diagnosis.\nMotivated by the fact that domain experts often have a relatively good\nunderstanding on how different fault types affect healthy signals, in the first\nstep of the proposed framework, a synthetic fault dataset is generated by\naugmenting real vibration samples of healthy bearings. This synthetic dataset\nintegrates expert knowledge and encodes class information about the fault\ntypes. However, models trained solely based on the synthetic data often do not\nperform well because of the distinct distribution difference between the\nsynthetically generated and real faults. To overcome this domain gap between\nthe synthetic and real data, in the second step of the proposed framework, an\nimbalance-robust domain adaptation~(DA) approach is proposed to adapt the model\nfrom synthetic faults~(source) to the unlabeled real faults~(target) which\nsuffer from severe class imbalance. The framework is evaluated on two\nunsupervised fault diagnosis cases for bearings, the CWRU laboratory dataset\nand a real-world wind-turbine dataset.

As\ngenetic-type particle filters (a.k.a. sequential Monte Carlo), this\nensemble-type methodology can also be interpreted as mean-field particle\napproximations of the Kalman-Bucy filtering equation. In contrast with\nconventional mean-field type interacting particle methods equipped with a\nglobally Lipschitz interacting drift-type function, Ensemble Kalman filters\ndepend on a nonlinear and quadratic-type interaction function defined in terms\nof the sample covariance of the particles. Most of the literature in applied\nmathematics and computer science on these sophisticated interacting particle\nmethods amounts to designing different classes of useable observer-type\nparticle methods. These methods are based on a variety of inconsistent but\njudicious ensemble auxiliary transformations or include additional\ninflation/localisationtype algorithmic innovations, in order to avoid the\ninherent time-degeneracy of an insufficient particle ensemble size when solving\na filtering problem with an unstable signal. To the best of our knowledge, the\nfirst and the only rigorous mathematical analysis of these sophisticated\ndiscrete generation particle filters is developed in the pioneering articles by\nLe Gland-Monbet-Tran and by Mandel-Cobb-Beezley, which were published in the\nearly 2010s.

To resolve this problem, most existing\nstudies attempted to transfer stable information to unseen environments.\nParticularly, independent causal mechanisms-based methods proposed to remove\nmutable causal mechanisms via the do-operator. Compared to previous methods,\nthe obtained stable predictors are more effective in identifying stable\ninformation. However, a key question remains: which subset of this whole stable\ninformation should the model transfer, in order to achieve optimal\ngeneralization ability? To answer this question, we present a comprehensive\nminimax analysis from a causal perspective. Specifically, we first provide a\ngraphical condition for the whole stable set to be optimal. When this condition\nfails, we surprisingly find with an example that this whole stable set,\nalthough can fully exploit stable information, is not the optimal one to\ntransfer. To identify the optimal subset under this case, we propose to\nestimate the worst-case risk with a novel optimization scheme over the\nintervention functions on mutable causal mechanisms. We then propose an\nefficient algorithm to search for the subset with minimal worst-case risk,\nbased on a newly defined equivalence relation between stable subsets. Compared\nto the exponential cost of exhaustively searching over all subsets, our\nsearching strategy enjoys a polynomial complexity.

The topology\nchange, when translated into nuclear EFT with \"effective\" QCD degrees of\nfreedom in terms of hidden local and scale symmetries duly taken into account,\npredicts an EoS that is soft below and stiff above $n\\gsim n_{1/2}$, involving\nno low-order phase transitions, and yields the macrophysical properties of\nneutron stars consistent -- so far with no tension -- with the astrophysical\nobservations, including the maximum mass $ 2.0\\lsim M/ M_\\odot\\lsim 2.2$ as\nwell as the GW data.

It has been modified,\nspecified, and generalized from various perspectives to tackle more concrete or\ncomplicated application problems. Despite its versatility and phenomenal\npopularity, it remains unknown whether or not the ADMM can be extended to\nseparable convex optimization problems with linear inequality constraints. In\nthis paper, we lay down the foundation of how to extend the ADMM to two-block\nand multiple-block (more than two blocks) separable convex optimization\nproblems with linear inequality constraints. From a high-level and\nmethodological perspective, we propose a unified framework of algorithmic\ndesign and a roadmap for convergence analysis in the context of variational\ninequalities, based on which it is possible to design a series of concrete\nADMM-based algorithms with provable convergence in the prediction-correction\nstructure. The proposed algorithmic framework and roadmap for convergence\nanalysis are eligible to various convex optimization problems with different\ndegrees of separability, in which both linear equality and linear inequality\nconstraints can be included. The analysis is comprehensive yet can be presented\nby elementary mathematics, and hence generically understandable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 09:45:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 15:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

Our first result is an answer to the following question: Given a\n(positive) function p=p(r) on a bounded interval [0,R], how can one recognize p\nas the local density of a stellar dynamic model of the given type (\"inverse\nproblem\")? If this is the case, we say that p is \"extendable\" (to a complete\nstellar dynamic model). Assuming that p is strictly decreasing, we reveal the\nconnection between p and F, which appears in the nonlinear integral equation\np=FU[p] and the solvability of Eddington's equation between F and q. Second, we\ninvestigate the following question (\"direct problem\"): Which q induce\ndistribution functions f of the form f=q(-E(r,u)-E0) of a stellar dynamic\nmodel? This leads to the investigation of the nonlinear equation p=FU[p] in an\napproximate and constructive way by mainly numerical methods.\n  The paper extends preceding work on flat galaxies to the three-dimensional\ncase.

The skin effect discovered recently\nin non-hermitian systems reveals the sensitivity to the spatial boundary\ncondition even deeply in bulk. In this letter, we show that these two seemingly\ndifferent phenomena can be unified through space-time duality. The intuition is\nthat the space-time duality maps unitary dynamics to non-unitary dynamics and\nexchanges the temporal direction and spatial direction. Therefore, the\nspace-time duality can establish the connection between the sensitivity to the\ninitial condition in the temporal direction and the sensitivity to the boundary\ncondition in the spatial direction. Here we demonstrate this connection by\nstudying the space-time duality of the out-of-time-ordered commutator in a\nconcrete chaotic hermitian model. We show that the out-of-time-ordered\ncommutator is mapped to a special two-point correlator in a non-hermitian\nsystem in the dual picture.

Existing methods typically learn\nbody and motion features from the body-joint trajectory, whereas they lack a\nsystematic way to model body structure and underlying relations of body\ncomponents beyond the scale of body joints. In this paper, we for the first\ntime propose a Self-supervised Multi-scale Skeleton Graph Encoding (SM-SGE)\nframework that comprehensively models human body, component relations, and\nskeleton dynamics from unlabeled skeleton graphs of various scales to learn an\neffective skeleton representation for person Re-ID. Specifically, we first\ndevise multi-scale skeleton graphs with coarse-to-fine human body partitions,\nwhich enables us to model body structure and skeleton dynamics at multiple\nlevels. Second, to mine inherent correlations between body components in\nskeletal motion, we propose a multi-scale graph relation network to learn\nstructural relations between adjacent body-component nodes and collaborative\nrelations among nodes of different scales, so as to capture more discriminative\nskeleton graph features. Last, we propose a novel multi-scale skeleton\nreconstruction mechanism to enable our framework to encode skeleton dynamics\nand high-level semantics from unlabeled skeleton graphs, which encourages\nlearning a discriminative skeleton representation for person Re-ID.

As a main result using our developed model, we derive\nin closed form the probabilities that posts originating from a given user are\nfound on the Wall and Newsfeed of any other. These are the solution of a linear\nsystem of equations, which can be resolved iteratively. In fact, our model is\nvery flexible with respect to the modelling assumptions. Using the\nprobabilities derived from the solution, we define a new measure of per-user\ninfluence over the entire network, the $\\Psi$-score, which combines the user\nposition on the graph with user (re-)posting activity.

Often,\nscientists are interested in linear transformations of such data which are easy\nto interpret and might be used as dimension reduction. Recently, for that\npurpose spatial blind source separation (SBSS) was introduced which assumes\nthat the observed data are formed by a linear mixture of uncorrelated, weakly\nstationary random fields. However, in practical applications, it is well-known\nthat when the spatial domain increases in size the weak stationarity\nassumptions can be violated in the sense that the second order dependency is\nvarying over the domain which leads to non-stationary analysis.

There\nhas been a surge of work on automatic code summarization to reduce the burden\nof writing summaries manually. However, most contemporary approaches mainly\nleverage the information within the boundary of the method being summarized\n(i.e., local context), and ignore the broader context that could assist with\ncode summarization. This paper explores two global contexts, namely intra-class\nand inter-class contexts, and proposes the model CoCoSUM: Contextual Code\nSummarization with Multi-Relational Graph Neural Networks. CoCoSUM first\nincorporates class names as the intra-class context to generate the class\nsemantic embeddings. Then, relevant Unified Modeling Language (UML) class\ndiagrams are extracted as inter-class context and are encoded into the class\nrelational embeddings using a novel Multi-Relational Graph Neural Network\n(MRGNN). Class semantic embeddings and class relational embeddings, together\nwith the outputs from code token encoder and AST encoder, are passed to a\ndecoder armed with a two-level attention mechanism to generate high-quality,\ncontext-aware code summaries. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our\napproach and compare it with other automatic code summarization models. The\nexperimental results show that CoCoSUM is effective and outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Increasingly often, link prediction problem is tackled by\nmeans of network embedding methods, owing to their state-of-the-art\nperformance. However, these methods lack transparency when compared to simpler\nbaselines, and as a result their robustness against adversarial attacks is a\npossible point of concern: could one or a few small adversarial modifications\nto the network have a large impact on the link prediction performance when\nusing a network embedding model? Prior research has already investigated\nadversarial robustness for network embedding models, focused on classification\nat the node and graph level. Robustness with respect to the link prediction\ndownstream task, on the other hand, has been explored much less.\n  This paper contributes to filling this gap, by studying adversarial\nrobustness of Conditional Network Embedding (CNE), a state-of-the-art\nprobabilistic network embedding model, for link prediction. More specifically,\ngiven CNE and a network, we measure the sensitivity of the link predictions of\nthe model to small adversarial perturbations of the network, namely changes of\nthe link status of a node pair. Thus, our approach allows one to identify the\nlinks and non-links in the network that are most vulnerable to such\nperturbations, for further investigation by an analyst. We analyze the\ncharacteristics of the most and least sensitive perturbations, and empirically\nconfirm that our approach not only succeeds in identifying the most vulnerable\nlinks and non-links, but also that it does so in a time-efficient manner thanks\nto an effective approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 11:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

Consequently, we observe a smaller number of\nhighly energetic events such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections (CMEs),\nwhich are often associated with active regions on the photosphere. Nonetheless,\nour magnetofrictional simulations during the minimum period suggest that the\nsolar corona is still dynamically evolving in response to the large-scale\nshearing velocities on the solar surface. The non-potential evolution of the\ncorona leads to the accumulation of magnetic free energy and helicity, which is\nperiodically shed in eruptive events. We find that these events fall into two\ndistinct classes: One set of events are caused by eruption and ejection of\nlow-lying coronal flux ropes, and they could explain the origin of occasional\nCMEs during solar minimum. The other set of events are not driven by\ndestabilisation of low-lying structures but rather by eruption of overlying\nsheared arcades. These could be associated with streamer blowouts or stealth\nCMEs. The two classes differ significantly in the amount of magnetic flux and\nhelicity shed through the outer coronal boundary. We additionally explore how\nother measurables such as current, open magnetic flux, free energy, coronal\nholes, and the horizontal component of the magnetic field on the outer model\nboundary vary during the two classes of event.

As\nsuch, these systems are now being incorporated into commercial products. With\nthis comes an additional challenge: how can we build AI systems that solve\ntasks where there is not a crisp, well-defined specification? While multiple\nsolutions have been proposed, in this competition we focus on one in\nparticular: learning from human feedback. Rather than training AI systems using\na predefined reward function or using a labeled dataset with a predefined set\nof categories, we instead train the AI system using a learning signal derived\nfrom some form of human feedback, which can evolve over time as the\nunderstanding of the task changes, or as the capabilities of the AI system\nimprove.\n  The MineRL BASALT competition aims to spur forward research on this important\nclass of techniques. We design a suite of four tasks in Minecraft for which we\nexpect it will be hard to write down hardcoded reward functions.

Tremendous progress in parameter measurement of ultrafast laser has\nbeen made, including single-shot spectra acquired by time-stretch dispersive\nFourier transform in spectral domain, and pulse magnification or compression\nrealized by time lens in temporal domain. Nevertheless, single-shot measurement\nof frequency-resolved states of polarization (SOPs) of ultrafast lasers has not\nbeen reported so far, and the unregular SOP evolution dynamics in ultrafast\npulses is hardly explored. Here, we demonstrate a new single-shot\nfrequency-resolved SOPs measurement system by utilizing division-of-amplitude\nmethod under far-field approximation. Large dispersion is utilized to\ntime-stretch the laser pulses, where the spectrum information is mapped into\ntemporal waveform via dispersive Fourier transform. By calibrating system\nmatrix with different wavelengths, the precise frequency-resolved SOPs are\nobtained together with high speed opto-electron detection. We demonstrate\napplications in direct measurement of transient mode-locked fiber laser\ndynamics. We observe complex frequency-dependent SOPs dynamics in the building\nup of dissipative solitons, and apparent discrepancy of SOPs between sideband\nand main peak in conventional solitons. Our observations reveal that the SOP\nplays a far more complex part in mode-locking process, which is different from\nthe traditional viewpoint. Taking advantage of broadband achromatic optical\nelements, this method can be extended to measurement of much broad pulse\nlasers, which will pave the way for reliable measurement and precise control of\nultrafast lasers with frequency-resolved SOPs structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 12:22:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 08:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Our method is generic, it can integrate any clustering method and\ncan be driven by both binary classification and regression.

To achieve such level of\nperformances, a system approach based on an innovatory control model is\nproposed. The latter control model drops classic hypothesis for separation of\nvoltage and frequency dynamics used till now in order to gather these dynamics\ninto a small size model. From the system point of view, dynamics are grouped by\ntime-scales of phenomena in the proposed control model. This results in more\nperformant controls in comparison to classic approaches which orient controls\nto physical actuators (control of grid side converter and of generator side\nconverter). Also, this allows coordination between control of converters and\ngenerator or, in case of multimachines specifications, among several PPMs. From\nthe control synthesis point of view, classic robust approaches are used (like,\ne.g., H-infinity synthesis).

The Modified Quasichemical Model in the Pair\nApproximation (MQMPA) can effectively capture the thermodynamic features of a\nbinary solution with a onefold SRO. However, once the SRO occurs at multiple\ncompositions in a binary solution, the MQMPA is in principle inconvenient to\ntreat the solution thermodynamics. It usually requires a large number of model\nparameters to fit the thermodynamic data of such a solution. The present work\nproposes the Modified Quasichemical Model in the Distinguishable-Pair\nApproximation (MQMDPA), which is a further improvement of the MQMPA. The MQMDPA\ncan more realistically describe the solution thermodynamics with manifold SROs\nusing fewer model parameters. It benefits from grouping the ordered pairs,\nwhich were assumed to be indistinguishable within the MQMPA, into several\ndistinguishable types. Each kind of ordered pair has unique coordination\nnumbers and pair energy, which is responsible for describing one of the SROs at\nthe desired composition and strength. Interestingly, the MQMDPA can be\ncompletely transformed into the MQMPA when all kinds of ordered pairs are\nassigned the same pair energy and coordination numbers. The distinguishable\npairs have thus become indistinguishable.

Then, we\npropose an algorithm, herein called Distributed Alternating Direction Method of\nMultipliers using Finite-Time Exact Ratio Consensus (D-ADMM-FTERC), to solve\nthe multi-node convex optimization problem, in which every node performs\niterative computations and exchanges information with its neighbors.

Thus, detecting deepfakes has attracted increasing attentions from\nboth academia and industry.

In this work, we aim to bridge the gap. In\nparticular, we perform a systematic measurement study to understand the\nsecurity of the state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods in adversarial\nsettings. We use two large-scale public deepfakes data sources including\nFaceForensics++ and Facebook Deepfake Detection Challenge, where the deepfakes\nare fake face images; and we train state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods.\nThese detection methods can achieve 0.94--0.99 accuracies in non-adversarial\nsettings on these datasets. However, our measurement results uncover multiple\nsecurity limitations of the deepfake detection methods in adversarial settings.\nFirst, we find that an attacker can evade a face extractor, i.e., the face\nextractor fails to extract the correct face regions, via adding small Gaussian\nnoise to its deepfake images. Second, we find that a face classifier trained\nusing deepfakes generated by one method cannot detect deepfakes generated by\nanother method, i.e., an attacker can evade detection via generating deepfakes\nusing a new method. Third, we find that an attacker can leverage backdoor\nattacks developed by the adversarial machine learning community to evade a face\nclassifier.

In this paper, we focus on the\nadversarial player strategy aspect in the game iNNk, in which players try to\ncommunicate secret code words through drawings with the goal of not being\ndeciphered by a NN. Some strategies exploit weaknesses in the NN that\nconsistently trick it into making incorrect classifications, leading to\nunbalanced gameplay. We present a method that combines transfer learning and\nensemble methods to obtain a data-efficient adaptation to these strategies.\nThis combination significantly outperforms the baseline NN across all\nadversarial player strategies despite only being trained on a limited set of\nadversarial examples. We expect the methods developed in this paper to be\nuseful for the rapidly growing field of NN-based games, which will require new\napproaches to deal with unforeseen player creativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 14:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

One way to improve domain generalization is to\ncollect diverse source data from multiple relevant domains so that a CNN model\nis allowed to learn more domain-invariant, and hence generalizable\nrepresentations. In this work, we address domain generalization with MixStyle,\na plug-and-play, parameter-free module that is simply inserted to shallow CNN\nlayers and requires no modification to training objectives. Specifically,\nMixStyle probabilistically mixes feature statistics between instances. This\nidea is inspired by the observation that visual domains can often be\ncharacterized by image styles which are in turn encapsulated within\ninstance-level feature statistics in shallow CNN layers. Therefore, inserting\nMixStyle modules in effect synthesizes novel domains albeit in an implicit way.\nMixStyle is not only simple and flexible, but also versatile -- it can be used\nfor problems whereby unlabeled images are available, such as semi-supervised\ndomain generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation, with a simple\nextension to mix feature statistics between labeled and pseudo-labeled\ninstances. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MixStyle can\nsignificantly boost the out-of-distribution generalization performance across a\nwide range of tasks including object recognition, instance retrieval, and\nreinforcement learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 14:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

Despite being commonly used to derive\napproximately-optimal algorithms for multi-resource allocation problems that\nsuffer from the curse of dimensionality, the tightness of Alaei's procedure for\na given $k$ has remained unknown. In this paper we resolve this question,\ncharacterizing the optimal procedure and tight bound, and consequently\nimproving the best-known guarantee for $k$-unit prophet inequalities for all\n$k>1$. We also consider a more general online stochastic knapsack problem where\neach individual allocation can consume an arbitrary fraction of the initial\ncapacity. We introduce a new \"best-fit\" procedure for implementing a\nfractionally-feasible knapsack solution online, with a performance guarantee of\n$\\frac{1}{3+e^{-2}}\\approx0.319$, which we also show is tight. This improves\nthe previously best-known guarantee of 0.2 for online knapsack. Our analysis\ndiffers from existing ones by eschewing the need to split items into \"large\" or\n\"small\" based on capacity consumption, using instead an invariant for the\noverall utilization on different sample paths.

In order to gain some further insights into this elusive\nemission mechanism, we performed a multi-frequency study of two very well-known\npulsars, PSR~B0919+06 and PSR~B1859+07. These pulsars show peculiar radio\nemission properties whereby the emission shifts to an earlier rotation phase\nbefore returning to the nominal emission phase in a few tens of pulsar\nrotations (also known as `swooshes'). We confirm the previous claim that the\nemission during the swoosh is not necessarily absent at low frequencies and the\nsingle pulses during a swoosh show varied behaviour at 220~MHz. We also confirm\nthat in PSR~B0919+06, the pulses during the swoosh show a chromatic dependence\nof the maximum offset from the normal emission phase with the offset following\na consistent relationship with observing frequency. We also observe that the\nflux density spectrum of the radio profile during the swoosh is inverted\ncompared to the normal emission. For PSR~B1859+07, we have discovered a new\nmode of emission in the pulsar that is potentially quasi-periodic with a\ndifferent periodicity than is seen in its swooshes. We invoke an emission model\npreviously proposed in the literature and show that this simple model can\nexplain the macroscopic observed characteristics in both pulsars.

How to select a\nproper network structure that may be dramatically different in different\napplications is a hard issue for deep models, given little prior knowledge of\ndata. In this paper, we aim to automatically determine the optimal network\nstructure of a deep model, named multilayer bootstrap networks (MBN), via\nsimple ensemble learning and selection techniques. Specifically, we first\npropose an MBN ensemble (MBN-E) algorithm which concatenates the sparse outputs\nof a set of MBN base models with different network structures into a new\nrepresentation. Then, we take the new representation produced by MBN-E as a\nreference for selecting the optimal MBN base models. Moreover, we propose a\nfast version of MBN-E (fMBN-E), which is not only theoretically even faster\nthan a single standard MBN but also does not increase the estimation error of\nMBN-E. Importantly, MBN-E and its ensemble selection techniques maintain the\nsimple formulation of MBN that is based on one-nearest-neighbor learning.\nEmpirically, comparing to a number of advanced deep clustering methods and as\nmany as 20 representative unsupervised ensemble learning and selection methods,\nthe proposed methods reach the state-of-the-art performance without manual\nhyperparameter tuning. fMBN-E is empirically even hundreds of times faster than\nMBN-E without suffering performance degradation.

Recently it has been shown that improper priors\nassumed on multiple penalty parameters in RVM may lead to an improper\nposterior. Currently in the literature, the sufficient conditions for posterior\npropriety of RVM do not allow improper priors over the multiple penalty\nparameters. In this article, we propose a single penalty relevance vector\nmachine (SPRVM) model in which multiple penalty parameters are replaced by a\nsingle penalty and we consider a semi Bayesian approach for fitting the SPRVM.\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions for posterior propriety of SPRVM are\nmore liberal than those of RVM and allow for several improper priors over the\npenalty parameter.

Most of the time,\nsparsity is introduced using a three-stage pipeline: 1) train the model to\nconvergence, 2) prune the model according to some criterion, 3) fine-tune the\npruned model to recover performance. The last two steps are often performed\niteratively, leading to reasonable results but also to a time-consuming and\ncomplex process. In our work, we propose to get rid of the first step of the\npipeline and to combine the two other steps in a single pruning-training cycle,\nallowing the model to jointly learn for the optimal weights while being pruned.\nWe do this by introducing a novel pruning schedule, named One-Cycle Pruning,\nwhich starts pruning from the beginning of the training, and until its very\nend. Adopting such a schedule not only leads to better performing pruned models\nbut also drastically reduces the training budget required to prune a model.\nExperiments are conducted on a variety of architectures (VGG-16 and ResNet-18)\nand datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Caltech-101), and for relatively high\nsparsity values (80%, 90%, 95% of weights removed).

Compared to other approaches, quantum annealing technology has been\nscaled up to a larger number of qubits.

It is thus natural\nto investigate potentially game changing technologies such as quantum annealers\nto augment the capabilities of deep learning. In this work, we explore binary\nneural networks, which are lightweight yet powerful models typically intended\nfor resource constrained devices. Departing from current training regimes for\nbinary networks that smooth/approximate the activation functions to make the\nnetwork differentiable, we devise a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization\nformulation for the training problem. While the problem is intractable, i.e.,\nthe cost to estimate the binary weights scales exponentially with network size,\nwe show how the problem can be optimized directly on a quantum annealer,\nthereby opening up to the potential gains of quantum computing. We\nexperimentally validated our formulation via simulation and testing on an\nactual quantum annealer (D-Wave Advantage), the latter to the extent allowable\nby the capacity of current technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 03:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

This work studies multimodal\nlearning in the context of visually grounded speech (VGS) models, and focuses\non their recently demonstrated capability to extract spatiotemporal alignments\nbetween spoken words and the corresponding visual objects without ever been\nexplicitly trained for object localization or word recognition. As the main\ncontributions, we formalize the alignment problem in terms of an audiovisual\nalignment tensor that is based on earlier VGS work, introduce systematic\nmetrics for evaluating model performance in aligning visual objects and spoken\nwords, and propose a new VGS model variant for the alignment task utilizing\ncross-modal attention layer. We test our model and a previously proposed model\nin the alignment task using SPEECH-COCO captions coupled with MSCOCO images. We\ncompare the alignment performance using our proposed evaluation metrics to the\nsemantic retrieval task commonly used to evaluate VGS models. We show that\ncross-modal attention layer not only helps the model to achieve higher semantic\ncross-modal retrieval performance, but also leads to substantial improvements\nin the alignment performance between image object and spoken words.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 12:54:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

We seek to place\nspecial relativity back in its physics context, and to make the subject\napproachable. The Lagrangian formulation of special relativity follows\nlogically by combining the Lagrangian approach to mechanics and the postulates\nof special relativity. In this paper, we derive and explicate some of the most\nimportant results of how the Lagrangian formalism and Lagrangians themselves\nbehave in the context of special relativity. We derive two foundations of\nspecial relativity: the invariance of any spacetime interval, and the Lorentz\ntransformation. We then develop the Lagrangian formulation of relativistic\nparticle dynamics, including the transformation law of the electromagnetic\npotentials, the Lagrangian of a relativistic free particle, and Einstein's\nmass-energy equivalence law ($E=mc^2$). We include a discussion of relativistic\nfield Lagrangians and their transformation properties, showing that the\nLagrangians and the equations of motion for the electric and magnetic fields\nare indeed invariant under Lorentz transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2021 18:07:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 01:28:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

Energy and information available anywhere and\nanytime has always been people's good wishes. On this basis, resonant beam\nsystem (RBS) has demonstrated its unique superiority in meeting the needs for\nenergy and communication. The previous work has mostly focused on the analysis\nof charging performance of RBS and its steady-state characteristics. In order\nto analyze the communication performance of RBS more thoroughly, we propose a\nresonant beam charging and communication (RBCC) system and use the equivalent\ncircuit analysis method to conduct transient analysis on it. The equivalent\ncircuit reveals the dynamic establishment process of the resonant beam from\nscratch, which facilitates the analysis of the relaxation oscillation process\nand a deeper understanding of the energy transmission and communication\nperformance. In addition, we explore the energy transmission and communication\nperformance of the RBCC under different energy allocation strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 02:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}
