Even\ndefining the problem is not straight forward. We study the complexity of\nestimating the ground energy of a fixed, translationally invariant Hamiltonian\nin the thermodynamic limit, to within a given precision; the number of bits $n$\nfor the precision is the sole input to the problem. The complexity of this\nproblem captures how difficult it is for the physicist to measure or compute\nanother digit in the approximation of a physical quantity in the thermodynamic\nlimit. We show that this problem is contained in $\\mbox{FEXP}^{\\mbox{QMA-EXP}}$\nand is hard for $\\mbox{FEXP}^{\\mbox{NEXP}}$. This means that the problem is\ndoubly exponentially hard in the size of the input. As an ingredient in our\nconstruction, we study the problem of computing the ground energy of\ntranslationally invariant finite 1D chains. A single Hamiltonian term, which is\na fixed parameter of the problem, is applied to every pair of particles in a\nfinite chain. The length of the chain is the sole input to the problem and the\ntask is to compute an approximation of the ground energy. No thresholds are\nprovided as in the standard formulation of the local Hamiltonian problem. We\nshow that this problem is contained in $\\mbox{FP}^{\\mbox{QMA-EXP}}$ and is hard\nfor $\\mbox{FP}^{\\mbox{NEXP}}$.

This requires more\nprecise expressions for the ground states of the resulting matrices than was\nrequired for previous QMA-completeness constructions and even exact analytical\nbounds for the infinite case which we derive using techniques from spectral\ngraph theory.

Despite the\nimportance of equipping classifiers with uncertainty estimates ready for the\nreal world, prior work has focused on small datasets and little or no class\ndiscrepancy between training and testing data. To close this gap, we introduce\nUIMNET: a realistic, ImageNet-scale test-bed to evaluate predictive uncertainty\nestimates for deep image classifiers. Our benchmark provides implementations of\neight state-of-the-art algorithms, six uncertainty measures, four in-domain\nmetrics, three out-domain metrics, and a fully automated pipeline to train,\ncalibrate, ensemble, select, and evaluate models. Our test-bed is open-source\nand all of our results are reproducible from a fixed commit in our repository.\nAdding new datasets, algorithms, measures, or metrics is a matter of a few\nlines of code-in so hoping that UIMNET becomes a stepping stone towards\nrealistic, rigorous, and reproducible research in uncertainty estimation. Our\nresults show that ensembles of ERM classifiers as well as single MIMO\nclassifiers are the two best alternatives currently available to measure\nuncertainty about both in-domain and out-domain classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 16:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Since unlabeled data are far more accessible, we seek to\nexplore how unsupervised learning can help deep models generalize across\ndomains. Specifically, we study a novel generalization problem called\nunsupervised domain generalization (UDG), which aims to learn generalizable\nmodels with unlabeled data and analyze the effects of pre-training on DG. In\nUDG, models are pretrained with unlabeled data from various source domains\nbefore being trained on labeled source data and eventually tested on unseen\ntarget domains. Then we propose a method named Domain-Aware Representation\nLearnING (DARLING) to cope with the significant and misleading heterogeneity\nwithin unlabeled pretraining data and severe distribution shifts between source\nand target data.

We find a class of synchrotron-dominated\nnovae with mildly evolved companions, exemplified by V5589 Sgr and V392 Per,\nthat appear to be a bridge between classical novae with dwarf companions and\nsymbiotic binaries with giant companions. Four of the novae in our sample have\ntwo distinct radio maxima (the first dominated by synchrotron and the later by\nthermal emission), and in four cases the early synchrotron peak is temporally\ncoincident with a dramatic dip in the optical light curve, hinting at a common\nsite for particle acceleration and dust formation. We publish the light curves\nas tables and encourage use of these data by the broader community in\nmulti-wavelength studies and modeling efforts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 17:16:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

While bottom-up synthesis techniques can work better than top-down\nmethods in certain settings, there is no prior technique for synthesizing\nrecursive programs from logical specifications in a purely bottom-up fashion.\nThe main challenge is that effective bottom-up methods need to execute\nsub-expressions of the code being synthesized, but it is impossible to execute\na recursive subexpression of a program that has not been fully constructed yet.\nIn this paper, we address this challenge using the concept of angelic\nsemantics. Specifically, our method finds a program that satisfies the\nspecification under angelic semantics (we refer to this as angelic synthesis),\nanalyzes the assumptions made during its angelic execution, uses this analysis\nto strengthen the specification, and finally reattempts synthesis with the\nstrengthened specification. Our proposed angelic synthesis algorithm is based\non version space learning and therefore deals effectively with many incremental\nsynthesis calls made during the overall algorithm. We have implemented this\napproach in a prototype called Burst and evaluate it on synthesis problems from\nprior work. Our experiments show that Burst is able to synthesize a solution to\n94% of the benchmarks in our benchmark suite, outperforming prior work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 17:25:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 22:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

While it was\nrecently discovered that achiral but bent core mesogens can also form chiral\nhelices, the assembly of chiral microstructures from achiral polymers has\nrarely been explored. Here, we reveal chiral emergence from achiral conjugated\npolymers for the first time, in which hierarchical helical structures are\ndeveloped through a multistep assembly pathway.

Debris disks have commonly been studied around intermediate-mass\nstars. Their intense radiation fields are believed to efficiently remove the\nsmall dust grains that are constantly replenished by collisions. For lower-mass\nstars, in particular M-stars, the dust removal mechanism needs to be further\ninvestigated given the much weaker radiation field produced by these objects.\nAims. We present new polarimetric observations of the nearly edge-on disk\naround the pre-main sequence M-type star GSC 07396-00759, taken with VLT/SPHERE\nIRDIS, with the aim to better understand the morphology of the disk, its dust\nproperties, and the star-disk interaction via the stellar mass-loss rate.\nMethods. We model our observations to characterize the location and properties\nof the dust grains using the Henyey-Greenstein approximation of the polarized\nphase function and evaluate the strength of the stellar winds. Results. We find\nthat the observations are best described by an extended and highly inclined\ndisk ($i\\approx 84.3\\,^{\\circ}\\pm0.3$) with a dust distribution centered at a\nradius $r_{0}\\approx107\\pm2$ au. The polarized phase function $S_{12}$ is best\nreproduced by an anisotropic scattering factor $g\\approx0.6$ and small\nmicron-sized dust grains with sizes $s>0.3\\,\\mathrm{\\mu}$m. We furthermore\ndiscuss some of the caveats of the approach and a degeneracy between the grain\nsize and the porosity. Conclusions. Even though the radius of the disk may be\nover-estimated, our results suggest that using a given scattering theory might\nnot be sufficient to fully explain key aspects such as the shape of the phase\nfunction, or the dust grain size. With the caveats in mind, we find that the\naverage mass-loss rate of GSC 07396-00759 can be up to 500 times stronger than\nthat of the Sun, supporting the idea that stellar winds from low-mass stars can\nevacuate small dust grains from the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 18:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

We derive Teff = 6210 +/- 70 K, log g = 4.64 +/- 0.10,\n[Fe/H] = -1.95 +/- 0.04, and [$\\alpha$/Fe] = +0.40 +/- 0.04 for the sdF\ncomponent. Radial velocity variations, although poorly sampled at present,\nindicate that the binary system has a long orbital period of about 457 days.\nThis suggests that the system was likely formed through stable Roche lobe\noverflow (RLOF). A kinematic analysis shows that EC22536-5304 is on an\neccentric orbit around the Galactic centre. This, as well as the low\nmetallicity and strong alpha-enhancement of the sdF-type companion, indicate\nthat EC22536-5304 is part of the Galactic halo or metal-weak thick disc. As the\nfirst long-period hot subdwarf binary below about [Fe/H] = -1, EC22536-5304 may\nhelp to constrain the RLOF mechanism for mass transfer from low-mass,\nlow-metallicity red giant branch (RGB) stars to main-sequence companions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 19:07:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 16:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

On the Earth,\npetroleum and natural gas reservoirs show a vertical gradient in chemical\ncomposition, established over geological timescales. In this work, we aim to\ninvestigate the conditions under which Titan's processes could lead to similar\nsituations. We built numerical models including barodiffusion and\nthermodiffusion (Soret's effect) in N_2+CH_4+C_2H_6 liquid mixtures, which are\nrelevant for Titan's possible alkanofers. Our main assumption is the existence\nof reservoirs of liquids trapped in a porous matrix with low permeability. Due\nto the small size of the molecule, nitrogen seems to be more sensitive to\ngravity than ethane, even if the latter has a slightly larger mass. This\nbehavior, noticed for an isothermal crust, is reinforced by the presence of a\ngeothermal gradient. Vertical composition gradients, formed over timescales of\nbetween a fraction of a mega-year to several tens of mega-years, are not\ninfluenced by molecular diffusion coefficients. We find that ethane does not\naccumulate at the bottom of the alkanofers under diffusion, leaving the\nquestion of why ethane is not observed on Titan's surface unresolved. If the\nalkanofer liquid was in contact with water-ice, we checked that N_2 did not, in\ngeneral, impede the clathration of C_2H_6, except in some layers.\nInterestingly, we found that noble gases could easily accumulate at the bottom\nof an alkanofer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 19:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

The purpose of this article is to bridge this gap between the\napproaches used by academicians and industry. To this end, we propose a\nstochastic correlation approach to asses WWR. The methods based on constant\ncorrelation to model the dependency between exposure and counterparty credit\nrisk assume a linear dependency, thus fail to capture the tail dependence.\nUsing a stochastic correlation we move further away from the Gaussian copula\nand can capture the tail risk.

An embryo can\nprogressively cleave from one cell to multiple cells and finally transform to\nmorula and blastocyst. For time-lapse videos of embryos, most existing\ndevelopmental stage classification methods conduct per-frame predictions using\nan image frame at each time step. However, classification using only images\nsuffers from overlapping between cells and imbalance between stages. Temporal\ninformation can be valuable in addressing this problem by capturing movements\nbetween neighboring frames. In this work, we propose a two-stream model for\ndevelopmental stage classification. Unlike previous methods, our two-stream\nmodel accepts both temporal and image information. We develop a linear-chain\nconditional random field (CRF) on top of neural network features extracted from\nthe temporal and image streams to make use of both modalities. The linear-chain\nCRF formulation enables tractable training of global sequential models over\nmultiple frames while also making it possible to inject monotonic development\norder constraints into the learning process explicitly. We demonstrate our\nalgorithm on two time-lapse embryo video datasets: i) mouse and ii) human\nembryo datasets. Our method achieves 98.1 % and 80.6 % for mouse and human\nembryo stage classification, respectively. Our approach will enable more\nprofound clinical and biological studies and suggests a new direction for\ndevelopmental stage classification by utilizing temporal information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 19:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

Stellar rotation, along with heterogeneities in the photosphere and\nchromosphere caused by activity, can result in false-positive planet\ndetections. Hence, it is necessary to determine the stellar rotation period and\ncompare it to any putative planetary RV signature. Long-term measurements of\nactivity indicators such as the chromospheric emission in the Ca II H&K lines\nenable the identification of magnetic activity cycles. In order to determine\nstellar rotation periods and study the long-term behavior of magnetic activity\nof the CARMENES guaranteed time observations (GTO) sample, it is advantageous\nto extract Ca II H&K time series from archival data, since the CARMENES\nspectrograph does not cover the blue range of the stellar spectrum containing\nthe Ca II H&K lines. We have assembled a catalog of 11634 archival spectra of\n186 M dwarfs acquired by seven different instruments covering the Ca II H&K\nregime: ESPADONS, FEROS, HARPS, HIRES, NARVAL, TIGRE, and UVES. The relative\nchromospheric flux in these lines was directly extracted from the spectra by\nrectification with PHOENIX synthetic spectra via narrow passbands around the Ca\nii H&K line cores. The combination of archival spectra from various instruments\nresults in time series for 186 stars from the CARMENES GTO sample. As an\nexample of the use of the catalog, we report the tentative discovery of three\npreviously unknown activity cycles of M dwarfs. We conclude that the method of\nextracting Ca II H&K fluxes with the use of model spectra yields consistent\nresults for different instruments and that the compilation of this catalog will\nenable the analysis of long-term activity time series for a large number of M\ndwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 20:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

In\nthis paper, we provide a theoretical framework that yields optimal control\nstrategies for such CPS at the intersection of control theory and learning. In\nthe proposed framework, we use the actual CPS, i.e., the \"true\" system that we\nseek to optimally control online, in parallel with a model of the CPS that is\navailable. We then institute an information state for the system which does not\ndepend on the control strategy. An important consequence of this independence\nis that for any given choice of a control strategy and a realization of the\nsystem's variables until time t, the information states at future times do not\ndepend on the choice of the control strategy at time t but only on the\nrealization of the decision at time t, and thus they are related to the concept\nof separation between estimation of the state and control. Namely, the future\ninformation states are separated from the choice of the current control\nstrategy. Such control strategies are called separated control strategies.\nHence, we can derive offline the optimal control strategy of the system with\nrespect to the information state, which might not be precisely known due to\nmodel uncertainties or complexity of the system, and then use standard learning\napproaches to learn the information state online while data are added gradually\nto the system in real time.

In this paper we investigate whether the recent\ndevelopment of language models sensitive to the semantics and context of words,\nsuch as Google's BERT, may be useful to overcome this adversarial attack\n(called \"Mad-lib\" as per the word substitution game). Using a dataset of 5572\nSMS spam messages, we first established a baseline of detection performance\nusing widely known document representation models (BoW and TFIDF) and the novel\nBERT model, coupled with a variety of classification algorithms (Decision Tree,\nkNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron). Then, we\nbuilt a thesaurus of the vocabulary contained in these messages, and set up a\nMad-lib attack experiment in which we modified each message of a held out\nsubset of data (not used in the baseline experiment) with different rates of\nsubstitution of original words with synonyms from the thesaurus. Lastly, we\nevaluated the detection performance of the three representation models (BoW,\nTFIDF and BERT) coupled with the best classifier from the baseline experiment\n(SVM). We found that the classic models achieved a 94% Balanced Accuracy (BA)\nin the original dataset, whereas the BERT model obtained 96%. On the other\nhand, the Mad-lib attack experiment showed that BERT encodings manage to\nmaintain a similar BA performance of 96% with an average substitution rate of\n1.82 words per message, and 95% with 3.34 words substituted per message. In\ncontrast, the BA performance of the BoW and TFIDF encoders dropped to chance.\nThese results hint at the potential advantage of BERT models to combat these\ntype of ingenious attacks, offsetting to some extent for the inappropriate use\nof semantic relationships in language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 21:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

Recent observations have shown that\nthe nightsides of hot Jupiters are a nearly constant 1100 K for a wide range of\nequilibrium temperatures (T$_{eq}$), lower than those predicted by 3D global\ncirculation models. Here we investigate the impact of nightside clouds on the\nobserved nightside temperatures of hot Jupiters using an aerosol microphysics\nmodel. We find that silicates dominate the cloud composition, forming an\noptically thick cloud deck on the nightsides of all hot Jupiters with T$_{eq}$\n$\\leq$ 2100 K. The observed nightside temperature is thus controlled by the\noptical depth profile of the silicate cloud with respect to the\ntemperature-pressure profile. As nightside temperatures increase with T$_{eq}$,\nthe silicate cloud is pushed upwards, forcing observations to probe cooler\naltitudes. The cloud vertical extent remains fairly constant due to competing\nimpacts of increasing vertical mixing strength with T$_{eq}$ and higher rates\nof sedimentation at higher altitudes. These effects, combined with the\nintrinsically subtle increase of the nightside temperature with T$_{eq}$ due to\ndecreasing radiative timescale at higher instellation levels lead to low,\nconstant nightside photospheric temperatures consistent with observations. Our\nresults suggest a drastic reduction in the day-night temperature contrast when\nnightside clouds dissipate, with the nightside emission spectra transitioning\nfrom featureless to feature-rich. We also predict that cloud absorption\nfeatures in the nightside emission spectra of hot Jupiters should reach\n$\\geq$100 ppm, potentially observable with the James Webb Space Telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 22:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

This growth in adaptation comes\nat the cost of prohibitively large memory requirements and computational\ncomplexity, especially at higher number of input elements. This limitation is\ndue to inherently limited data reuse opportunities and quadratic growth in\nmemory footprints, leading to severe memory-boundedness and limited scalability\nof input elements. This work addresses these challenges by devising a tailored\ndataflow optimization, called FLAT, for attention mechanisms without altering\ntheir functionality. This dataflow processes costly attention operations\nthrough a unique fusion mechanism, transforming the memory footprint quadratic\ngrowth to merely a linear one. To realize the full potential of this bespoke\nmechanism, we propose a tiling approach to enhance the data reuse across\nattention operations. Our method both mitigates the off-chip bandwidth\nbottleneck as well as reduces the on-chip memory requirement.

Computing\nWMD between two documents is costly because it requires solving an\n$O(V^3log(V))$ optimization problem where $V$ is the number of unique words in\nthe document. Fortunately, WMD can be framed as an Earth Mover's Distance (EMD)\nfor which the algorithmic complexity can be reduced to $O(V^2)$ by adding an\nentropy penalty to the optimization problem and solving it using the\nSinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. Additionally, the computation can be made highly\nparallel by adopting a batching approach, i.e., computing the WMD of a single\nquery document against multiple target documents at once.\n  Sinkhorn WMD is a key kernel used in many ML/NLP applications. and usually\ngets implemented in Python.

Recent works approached this task with innovative\nweakly-supervised algorithms such as multi-instance learning (MIL) and class\nactivation maps (CAM), however, these methods often yield inaccurate or\nincomplete regions. One of the reasons is the neglection of the pathological\nimplications hidden in the relationship across anatomical regions within each\nimage and the relationship across images. In this paper, we argue that the\ncross-region and cross-image relationship, as contextual and compensating\ninformation, is vital to obtain more consistent and integral regions. To model\nthe relationship, we propose the Graph Regularized Embedding Network (GREN),\nwhich leverages the intra-image and inter-image information to locate diseases\non chest X-ray images. GREN uses a pre-trained U-Net to segment the lung lobes,\nand then models the intra-image relationship between the lung lobes using an\nintra-image graph to compare different regions. Meanwhile, the relationship\nbetween in-batch images is modeled by an inter-image graph to compare multiple\nimages. This process mimics the training and decision-making process of a\nradiologist: comparing multiple regions and images for diagnosis. In order for\nthe deep embedding layers of the neural network to retain structural\ninformation (important in the localization task), we use the Hash coding and\nHamming distance to compute the graphs, which are used as regularizers to\nfacilitate training.

Returning to the lunar surface with a long-lived\ngeophysical network is a key next step to advance lunar and planetary science.\nLGN will greatly expand our primarily Apollo-based knowledge of the deep lunar\ninterior by identifying and characterizing mantle melt layers, as well as core\nsize and state. To meet the mission objectives, the instrument suite provides\ncomplementary seismic, geodetic, heat flow, and electromagnetic observations.\nWe discuss the network landing site requirements and provide example sites that\nmeet these requirements. Landing site selection will continue to be optimized\nthroughout the formulation of this mission. Possible sites include the P-5\nregion within the Procellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT; (lat:$15^{\\circ}$;\nlong:$-35^{\\circ}$), Schickard Basin (lat:$-44.3^{\\circ}$;\nlong:$-55.1^{\\circ}$), Crisium Basin (lat:$18.5^{\\circ}$; long:$61.8^{\\circ}$),\nand the farside Korolev Basin (lat:$-2.4^{\\circ}$; long:$-159.3^{\\circ}$).\nNetwork optimization considers the best locations to observe seismic core\nphases, e.g., ScS and PKP. Ray path density and proximity to young fault scarps\nare also analyzed to provide increased opportunities for seismic observations.\nGeodetic constraints require the network to have at least three nearside\nstations at maximum limb distances. Heat flow and electromagnetic measurements\nshould be obtained away from terrane boundaries and from magnetic anomalies at\nlocations representative of global trends. An in-depth case study is provided\nfor Crisium. In addition, we discuss the consequences for scientific return of\nless than optimal locations or number of stations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 02:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

Based on the thermodynamic relation that the\nderivative of volume with respect to temperature, i.e., thermal expansion, is\nequal to the negative derivative of entropy with respect to pressure, we\ndeveloped a general theory in terms of multiscale entropy to understand and\npredict the change of volume as a function of temperature, which is termed as\nzentropy theory in the present work. It is shown that a phase at high\ntemperatures is a statistical representation of the ground-state stable and\nmultiple nonground-state metastable configurations. It is demonstrated that\nwhen the volumes of the major nonground-state configurations are smaller than\nthat of the ground-state configuration, the volume of the phase may decrease\nwith the increase of temperature in certain ranges of temperature-pressure\ncombinations, depicting the negative divergency of thermal expansion at the\ncritical point. As examples, positive and negative divergencies of thermal\nexpansion are predicted at the critical points of Ce and Fe3Pt, respectively,\nalong with the temperature and pressure ranges for abnormally positive and\nnegative thermal expansion.

Two key components of learned image compression frameworks are\nthe entropy model of the latent representations and the encoding/decoding\nnetwork architectures. Various models have been proposed, such as\nautoregressive, softmax, logistic mixture, Gaussian mixture, and Laplacian.\nExisting schemes only use one of these models. However, due to the vast\ndiversity of images, it is not optimal to use one model for all images, even\ndifferent regions of one image. In this paper, we propose a more flexible\ndiscretized Gaussian-Laplacian-Logistic mixture model (GLLMM) for the latent\nrepresentations, which can adapt to different contents in different images and\ndifferent regions of one image more accurately. Besides, in the\nencoding/decoding network design part, we propose a concatenated residual\nblocks (CRB), where multiple residual blocks are serially connected with\nadditional shortcut connections. The CRB can improve the learning ability of\nthe network, which can further improve the compression performance.\nExperimental results using the Kodak and Tecnick datasets show that the\nproposed scheme outperforms all the state-of-the-art learning-based methods and\nexisting compression standards including VVC intra coding (4:4:4 and 4:2:0) in\nterms of the PSNR and MS-SSIM.

To address the issue, many\nML practitioners have turned to model parallelism as a method of distributing\nthe computational requirements across several devices. Unfortunately, the\nsequential nature of neural networks causes very low efficiency and device\nutilization in model parallel training jobs. We propose a new form of \"shard\nparallelism\" combining task and model parallelism, then package it into a\nframework we name Hydra. Hydra recasts the problem of model parallelism in the\nmulti-model context to produce a fine-grained parallel workload of independent\nmodel shards, rather than independent models. This new parallel design promises\ndramatic speedups relative to the traditional model parallelism paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 03:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

Here\nwe deploy a new measurement framework to investigate the scientific response to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and the adaptability of science as a whole. We find that\nscience rapidly shifted to engage COVID-19 following the advent of the virus,\nwith scientists across all fields making large jumps from their prior research\nstreams. However, this adaptive response reveals a pervasive \"pivot penalty\",\nwhere the impact of the new research steeply declines the further the\nscientists move from their prior work. The pivot penalty is severe amidst\nCOVID-19 research, but it is not unique to COVID-19. Rather it applies nearly\nuniversally across the sciences, and has been growing in magnitude over the\npast five decades. While further features condition pivoting, including a\nscientist's career stage, prior expertise and impact, collaborative scale, the\nuse of new coauthors, and funding, we find that the pivot penalty persists and\nremains substantial regardless of these features, suggesting the pivot penalty\nacts as a fundamental friction that governs science's ability to adapt. The\npivot penalty not only holds key implications for the design of the scientific\nsystem and human capacity to confront emergent challenges through scientific\nadvance, but may also be relevant to other social and economic systems, where\nshifting to meet new demands is central to survival and success.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 03:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

Many existing planning algorithms guarantee these\nby maintaining the clearance needed to perform an emergency brake, which is\nitself a robust and persistently feasible maneuver.

Recently, Eppstein and Khodabandeh showed that\nthe greedy spanner in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ admits a sublinear separator in a strong\nsense: any subgraph of $k$ vertices of the greedy spanner in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ has\na separator of size $O(\\sqrt{k})$. Their technique is inherently planar and is\nnot extensible to higher dimensions.

Our\nfitting results are consistent with past results for the mini-BAL system in\nthis quasar by Hamann et al. (1997b).

Although literature\npertaining to this problem dates back to 1959, the relation between inviscid\nand viscous stability criteria has not yet been clarified. While the viscous\ncriterion for stability, given by $We = n^2+k^2-1$, is both necessary and\nsufficient, this relation has only been shown to be sufficient in the inviscid\ncase. Here, $We = \\rho \\Omega^2 a^3/\\gamma$ is the Weber number and measures\nthe relative magnitudes of the centrifugal and surface tension forces, with\n$\\Omega$ being the angular velocity of the rigidly rotating column, $a$ the\ncolumn radius, $\\rho$ the density of the fluid, and $\\gamma$ the surface\ntension coefficient; $k$ and $n$ denote the axial and azimuthal wavenumbers of\nthe imposed perturbation.

Understanding such\nnetworks is a primary goal of science due to serving as the scaffold for many\nemergent social phenomena from disease spreading to political movements. An\nappropriate tool for studying them is agent-based modeling, in which nodes,\nrepresenting persons, make decisions about creating and deleting links, thus\nyielding various macroscopic behavioral patterns. Here we focus on studying a\ngeneralization of the weighted social network model, being one of the most\nfundamental agent-based models for describing the formation of social ties and\nsocial networks. This Generalized Weighted Social Network (GWSN) model\nincorporates triadic closure, homophilic interactions, and various link\ntermination mechanisms, which have been studied separately in the previous\nworks. Accordingly, the GWSN model has an increased number of input parameters\nand the model behavior gets excessively complex, making it challenging to\nclarify the model behavior. We have executed massive simulations with a\nsupercomputer and using the results as the training data for deep neural\nnetworks to conduct regression analysis for predicting the properties of the\ngenerated networks from the input parameters. The obtained regression model was\nalso used for global sensitivity analysis to identify which parameters are\ninfluential or insignificant.

To mitigate this issue,\nwe propose the GraphJigsaw that constructs jigsaw puzzles at various stages in\nthe classification network and solves the puzzles with the graph convolutional\nnetwork (GCN) in a progressive manner. Solving the puzzles requires the model\nto spot the shape patterns of the cartoon faces as the texture information is\nquite limited.

Information freshness\nis quantified by age of information (AoI), defined as the time elapsed since\nthe generation time of the latest received information update. PNC reduces\ncommunication latency of TWRNs by turning superimposed electromagnetic waves\ninto network-coded messages so that end users can send update packets to each\nother via the relay more frequently. Although sending update packets more\nfrequently is potential to reduce AoI, how to deal with packet corruption has\nnot been well investigated. Specifically, if old packets are corrupted in any\nhop of a TWRN, one needs to decide the old packets to be dropped or to be\nretransmitted, e.g., new packets have recent information, but may require more\ntime to be delivered. We study the average AoI with and without ARQ in\nPNC-enabled TWRNs. We first consider a non-ARQ scheme where old packets are\nalways dropped when corrupted, referred to once-lost-then-drop (OLTD), and a\nclassical ARQ scheme with no packet lost, referred to as reliable packet\ntransmission (RPT). Interestingly, our analysis shows that neither the non-ARQ\nscheme nor the pure ARQ scheme achieves good average AoI. We then put forth an\nuplink-lost-then-drop (ULTD) protocol that combines packet drop and ARQ.\nExperiments on software-defined radio indicate that ULTD significantly\noutperforms OLTD and RPT in terms of average AoI. Although this paper focuses\non TWRNs, we believe the insight of ULTD applies generally to other two-hop\nnetworks.

Despite\ntheir significant improvements, most existing methods still focus on the most\ndiscriminative parts from a single image, ignoring informative details in other\nregions and lacking consideration of clues from other associated images. In\nthis paper, we analyze the difficulties of fine-grained image recognition from\na new perspective and propose a transformer architecture with the peak\nsuppression module and knowledge guidance module, which respects the\ndiversification of discriminative features in a single image and the\naggregation of discriminative clues among multiple images. Specifically, the\npeak suppression module first utilizes a linear projection to convert the input\nimage into sequential tokens. It then blocks the token based on the attention\nresponse generated by the transformer encoder. This module penalizes the\nattention to the most discriminative parts in the feature learning process,\ntherefore, enhancing the information exploitation of the neglected regions. The\nknowledge guidance module compares the image-based representation generated\nfrom the peak suppression module with the learnable knowledge embedding set to\nobtain the knowledge response coefficients. Afterwards, it formalizes the\nknowledge learning as a classification problem using response coefficients as\nthe classification scores. Knowledge embeddings and image-based representations\nare updated during training so that the knowledge embedding includes\ndiscriminative clues for different images. Finally, we incorporate the acquired\nknowledge embeddings into the image-based representations as comprehensive\nrepresentations, leading to significantly higher performance. Extensive\nevaluations on the six popular datasets demonstrate the advantage of the\nproposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 08:07:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 06:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

This paper presents FAPR\n-- our novel approach that suggests repairs based on program differences in a\nfast and accurate manner. FAPR is different from current tools in three\naspects. First, it encodes syntactic information into token sequences to enable\nhigh-speed comparison between incorrect and correct programs. Second, to\naccurately extract program differences, FAPR adopts a novel matching algorithm\nthat maximizes token-level matches and minimizes statement-level differences.\nThird, FAPR relies on testing instead of static/dynamic analysis to validate\nand refine candidate repairs, so it eliminates the language dependency or high\nruntime overhead incurred by complex program analysis. We implemented FAPR to\nsuggest repairs for both C and C++ programs; our experience shows the great\ncross-language portability of FAPR.

Halide mixing is one of the most powerful techniques to tune the\noptical bandgap of metal-halide perovskites across wide spectral ranges.\nHowever, halide mixing has commonly been observed to result in phase\nsegregation, which reduces excited-state transport and limits device\nperformance. While the current emphasis lies on the development of strategies\nto prevent phase segregation, it remains unclear how halide mixing may affect\nexcited-state transport even if phase purity is maintained.

Incorporating a new class requires the collection of labeled\ndata, which is not a trivial task, especially for less frequently-occurring\ndiseases. As a result, it becomes inconceivable to build a model that can\ndiagnose all possible disease classes. Here, we propose a multi-label\ngeneralized zero shot learning (CXR-ML-GZSL) network that can simultaneously\npredict multiple seen and unseen diseases in CXR images.

The interaction between the central\nnervous system and the surrounding environment is shown to perform a quantum\nmeasurement upon the neural constituents, which actualize a single measurement\noutcome selected from the resulting quantum probability distribution.

Recently successful examples\non learning slow dynamics by LSTM are given with simulation data of low\ndimensional reaction coordinate. However, in this report we show that the\nfollowing three key factors significantly affect the performance of language\nmodel learning, namely dimensionality of reaction coordinates, temporal\nresolution and state partition. When applying recurrent neural networks to\nmolecular dynamics simulation trajectories of high dimensionality, we find that\nrare events corresponding to the slow dynamics might be obscured by other\nfaster dynamics of the system, and cannot be efficiently learned. Under such\nconditions, we find that coarse graining the conformational space into\nmetastable states and removing recrossing events when estimating transition\nprobabilities between states could greatly help improve the accuracy of slow\ndynamics learning in molecular dynamics. Moreover, we also explore other models\nlike Transformer, which do not show superior performance than LSTM in\novercoming these issues. Therefore, to learn rare events of slow molecular\ndynamics by LSTM and Transformer, it is critical to choose proper temporal\nresolution (i.e., saving intervals of MD simulation trajectories) and state\npartition in high resolution data, since deep neural network models might not\nautomatically disentangle slow dynamics from fast dynamics when both are\npresent in data influencing each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 09:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

So, if a firm cannot fully repay\nits debt, then the exact (partial) payments it makes to each of its creditors\ncan affect the cash inflow back to itself. We naturally assume that the firms\nare interested in their financial well-being (utility) which is aligned with\nthe amount of incoming payments they receive from the network.

While in practice many other\nmethods and heuristics are used, not much is known in terms of bounds on their\nperformance. The question of whether the JL method is optimal for practical\nmeasures of distortion was recently raised in BFN19 (NeurIPS'19). They provided\nupper bounds on its quality for a wide range of practical measures and showed\nthat indeed these are best possible in many cases. Yet, some of the most\nimportant cases, including the fundamental case of average distortion were left\nopen. In particular, they show that the JL transform has $1+\\epsilon$ average\ndistortion for embedding into $k$-dimensional Euclidean space, where\n$k=O(1/\\epsilon^2)$, and for more general $q$-norms of distortion, $k =\nO(\\max\\{1/\\epsilon^2,q/\\epsilon\\})$, whereas tight lower bounds were\nestablished only for large values of $q$ via reduction to the worst case.\n  In this paper we prove that these bounds are best possible for any\ndimensionality reduction method, for any $1 \\leq q \\leq O(\\frac{\\log\n(2\\epsilon^2 n)}{\\epsilon})$ and $\\epsilon \\geq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$, where $n$\nis the size of the subset of Euclidean space.\n  Our results imply that the JL method is optimal for various distortion\nmeasures commonly used in practice such as stress, energy and relative error.\nWe prove that if any of these measures is bounded by $\\epsilon$ then\n$k=\\Omega(1/\\epsilon^2)$ for any $\\epsilon \\geq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$, matching\nthe upper bounds of BFN19 and extending their tightness results for the full\nrange moment analysis.\n  Our results may indicate that the JL dimensionality reduction method should\nbe considered more often in practical applications, and the bounds we provide\nfor its quality should be served as a measure for comparison when evaluating\nthe performance of other methods and heuristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 12:00:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 21:16:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-17"}

We show the full characterization of all dual\nsystems for a given continuous frame, a result interesting by itself, and apply\nthis to dual tensor frames. Furthermore, we discuss the existence on non-simple\ntensor product (dual) frames. Continuous frame multipliers and their Schatten\nclass properties are considered in the context of tensor products. In\nparticular, we give sufficient conditions for obtaining partial trace\nmultipliers of the same form, which is illustrated with examples related to\nshort-time Fourier transform and wavelet localization operators. As an\napplication, we offer an interpretation of a class of tensor product continuous\nframe multipliers as density operators for bipartite quantum states, and show\nhow their structure can be restricted to the corresponding partial traces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 12:04:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 07:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

To select an optimal recommendation\nmodel, it is common to conduct A/B testing to compare model performance.\nHowever, A/B testing of causal effects requires a large number of users, making\nsuch experiments costly and risky. We therefore propose the first interleaving\nmethods that can efficiently compare recommendation models in terms of causal\neffects. In contrast to conventional interleaving methods, we measure the\noutcomes of both items on an interleaved list and items not on the interleaved\nlist, since the causal effect is the difference between outcomes with and\nwithout recommendations. To ensure that the evaluations are unbiased, we either\nselect items with equal probability or weight the outcomes using inverse\npropensity scores. We then verify the unbiasedness and efficiency of online\nevaluation methods through simulated online experiments.

Most established\nschemes apply rather unspecific signal models such as sinusoidal models to the\nestimation problem, which may limit time resolution and estimation accuracy.\nThis study proposes a novel time-domain locked-loop algorithm with low\ncomputational effort and low memory footprint for $f_0$ estimation. The loop\ncontrol signal is directly derived from the input time signal, using a harmonic\nsignal model. Theoretically, this allows for a noise-robust and rapid $f_0$\nestimation for periodic signals of arbitrary waveform, and without the\nrequirement of a prior frequency analysis. Several simulations with short\nsignals employing different types of periodicity and with added wide-band noise\nwere performed to demonstrate and evaluate the basic properties of the proposed\nalgorithm. Depending on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), the estimator was\nfound to converge within 3-4 signal repetitions, even at SNR close to or below\n0dB. Furthermore, it was found to follow fundamental frequency sweeps with a\ndelay of less than one period and to track all tones of a three-tone musical\nchord signal simultaneously. Quasi-periodic sounds with shifted harmonics as\nwell as signals with stochastic periodicity were robustly tracked. Mean and\nstandard deviation of the estimation error, i.e., the difference between true\nand estimated $f_0$, were at or below 1 Hz in most cases. The results suggest\nthat the proposed algorithm may be applicable to low-delay speech and music\nanalysis and processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 12:33:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 17:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

For ergodic continuous-time systems, we prove that both excess risk and\ngeneralization error are bounded above by terms that diminish with the\nsquare-root of T, the time-interval over which training data is specified.\n  Secondly, we study scenarios that benefit from modeling with memory, proving\nuniversal approximation theorems for two classes of continuous-time recurrent\nneural networks (RNNs): both can learn memory-dependent model error.

When the participating particles are treated in the\nmassless limit, the soft theorems are known to depend only on the directions of\nthe states on null infinity. Leveraging this fact, we develop dual\ntwo-dimensional descriptions of soft theorems, recasting them as Ward\nidentities of such dual models on the celestial sphere. This is done by first\npostulating putative holographic representations of the hard scattering\namplitudes and dressing the asymptotic operators with appropriate\ntwo-dimensional analogues of the Wilson line. The soft theorems are then\nrecovered by inserting currents that generate the Ward identities of the dual\nmodels. In addition to providing naturally holographic representations of the\nsoft theorems, we see that it becomes possible to develop presentations of the\nasymptotic symmetries associated to these theorems entirely in terms of the\ndual two-dimensional fields. In the course of carrying out this analysis for\nsoft theorems at leading order and beyond, we find that the two-dimensional\ndual description of soft theorems may be directly inferred by drawing analogies\nwith the existing framework of asymptotic symmetry charges. We find that the\nsoft charges generating the asymptotic symmetries can be brought into\ncorrespondence with dual two-dimensional currents, while the two-dimensional\nWilson loops can be related to the hard parts of the conserved charges.\nConsequently, we rewrite the triality of asymptotic symmetries, soft theorems\nand conserved charges directly in the language of a class of two-dimensional\ntheories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 12:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

A proof of convergence is presented, along with experiments\nbased firstly on synthetic data, and secondly on a more realistic dataset for\nV2X, with both experiments showing promising results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 13:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

A\nvery short computational time of DBM ($<$ 0.01s) allowed us to develop the\nDrag-Based Ensemble Model (DBEM) that takes into account the variability of\nmodel input parameters by making an ensemble of n different input parameters to\ncalculate the distribution and significance of the DBM results.

A new DBEMv3\nversion is described in detail and evaluated for the first time determing the\nDBEMv3 performance and errors by using various CME-ICME lists as well as it is\ncompared with previous DBEM versions. The analysis to find the optimal drag\nparameter $\\gamma$ and ambient solar wind speed $w$ showed that somewhat higher\nvalues ($\\gamma \\approx 0.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ km$^{-1}$, $w \\approx$ 425\nkm\\,s$^{-1}$) for both of these DBEM input parameters should be used for the\nevaluation compared to the previously employed ones.

In fact, safe learning is one of the major obstacles towards\nreal-world agents that can learn during deployment. One way of ensuring that\nagents respect hard limitations is to explicitly configure boundaries in which\nthey can operate. While this might work in some cases, we do not always have\nclear a-priori information which states and actions can lead dangerously close\nto hazardous states. Here, we present an approach where an additional policy\ncan override the main policy and offer a safer alternative action.

Traditional AL frameworks\nhave two limitations: First, they perform data selection in a multi-round\nmanner, which is time-consuming and impractical. Second, they usually assume\nthat there are a small amount of labeled data points available in the same\ndomain as the data in the unlabeled pool. Recent work proposes a solution for\none-round active learning based on data utility learning and optimization,\nwhich fixes the first issue but still requires the initially labeled data\npoints in the same domain. In this paper, we propose $\\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ as a\nsolution that solves both issues. Specifically, $\\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ leverages the\nidea of domain adaptation (DA) to train a data utility model which can\neffectively predict the utility for any given unlabeled data in the target\ndomain once labeled. The trained data utility model can then be used to select\nhigh-utility data and at the same time, provide an estimate for the utility of\nthe selected data. Our algorithm does not rely on any feedback from annotators\nin the target domain and hence, can be used to perform zero-round active\nlearning or warm-start existing multi-round active learning strategies. Our\nexperiments show that $\\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ outperforms the existing\nstate-of-the-art AL strategies equipped with domain adaptation over various\ndomain shift settings (e.g., real-to-real data and synthetic-to-real data).\nParticularly, $\\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ is applicable to the scenario where source and\ntarget labels have mismatches, which is not supported by the existing works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 13:47:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 00:49:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 04:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-09"}

NPIs promote\nprotective actions to reduce exposure risk and can reduce mobility patterns\nwithin communities. Growing research literature suggests that socially\nvulnerable populations are disproportionately impacted with higher infection\nand higher fatality rates of COVID-19, though there is limited understanding of\nthe underlying mechanisms to this health disparity. Thus, the research examines\ntwo distinct and complimentary datasets at a granular scale for five urban\nlocations. Through statistical and spatial analyses, the research extensively\ninvestigates the exposure risk reduction of socially vulnerable populations due\nto NPIs. The mobility dataset tracks population movement across ZIP codes; it\nis used for an origin-destination network analysis. The population activity\ndataset is based on the number of visits from census block groups (CBG) to\npoints of interest (POIs), such as grocery stores, restaurants, education\ncenters, and medical facilities; it is used for network analysis of\npopulation-facilities interactions. The mobility dataset showed that, after the\nimplementation of NPIs, socially vulnerable populations engaged in increased\nmobility in the form of inflow between ZIP code areas. Similarly, population\nactivity analysis showed an increased exposure risk for socially vulnerable\npopulations based on a greater number of inflow visits of CBGs to POIs, which\nincreases the risk of contact at POIs, and a greater number of outflow visits\nfrom POIs to home CBGs, which increases risk of transmission within CBGs. These\nfindings can assist emergency planners and public health officials in\ncomprehending how different groups are able to implement protective actions and\ncan inform more equitable and data-driven NPI policies for future epidemics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 13:49:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 01:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

While previous studies concluded that shared rides can offer\nsubstantial benefits, initial evidence suggests low adoption levels. We\npostulate that previous studies that investigated the potential of ride-pooling\nfailed to account for the trade-off that users are likely to make when\nconsidering a shared ride. We address this shortcoming by formulating user net\nbenefit stemming from sharing as a compensatory function where the additional\ntravel time and on-board discomfort need to be compensated by the price\ndiscount for a traveller to choose a shared ride over a private ride. The\nproposed formulation is embedded in a method for matching travel requests and\nvehicles. We conduct a series of experiments investigating how the potential of\nride-pooling services depends on travel demand characteristics, user\npreferences and the pricing policy adopted by the service provider. In\nparticular, the impact of various behavioural settings in terms of users'\nwillingness to share their ride and delay aversion on service adoption and its\noperational efficiency is assessed. Our results suggest that the total vehicle\nmileage savings found by previous studies is only attainable when users are\nvery willing to share their ride (i.e. attach low premium to private rides) and\nare offered a 50% discount for doing so. We find ride-pooling transportation\ndistance savings as low as 15% in less favourable behavioural scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 13:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

Since the ordered weighted sum includes as particular case the sum\nof these deviations, the classical SVM model is a particular case of the model\nunder study. A quadratic continuous formulation for the case in which weights\nare sorted in non-decreasing order is introduced, and a mixed integer quadratic\nformulation for general weights is presented.

Historical data provides some information of this distribution\nthat we can use to approximately quantify the risk of an evaluation function\nthat depends on both decision and uncertainty. This empirical optimization is\nvulnerable to the issues of overfitting, which could be overcome by several\ndata-driven robust optimization techniques. To tackle overfitting, Long et al.\n(2022) propose a robust satisficing model, which is specified by a performance\ntarget and a penalty function that measures the deviation of the uncertainty\nfrom its nominal value, and yields solutions with superior out-of-sample\nperformance. We generalize the robust satisficing framework to conic\noptimization problems with recourse, which has broader applications in\npredictive and prescriptive analytics including risk management and statistical\nsupervised learning. We derive an exact semidefinite optimization formulation\nfor biconvex quadratic evaluation function, with quadratic penalty and\nellipsoidal support set. More importantly, under complete and bounded recourse,\nand reasonably chosen polyhedral support set and penalty function, we propose\nsafe approximations that do not lead to infeasible problems for any reasonably\nchosen target. We demonstrate that the assumption of complete and bounded\nrecourse is however not unimpeachable, and then introduce a novel perspective\ncasting technique to derive an equivalent conic optimization problem that\nsatisfies the stated assumptions. Finally, through a computational study on\ndata-driven portfolio optimization (that maximizes the expected exponential\nutility of the portfolio returns), we show that the robust satisficing\nsolutions significantly improve over the celebrated Markowitz model, which is\nprone to overfitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 14:00:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 10:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

Unfairness occurs when an agent with higher merit obtains a\nworse outcome than an agent with lower merit. Our central point is that a\nprimary cause of unfairness is uncertainty. A principal or algorithm making\ndecisions never has access to the agents' true merit, and instead uses proxy\nfeatures that only imperfectly predict merit (e.g., GPA, star ratings,\nrecommendation letters). None of these ever fully capture an agent's merit; yet\nexisting approaches have mostly been defining fairness notions directly based\non observed features and outcomes.\n  Our primary point is that it is more principled to acknowledge and model the\nuncertainty explicitly. The role of observed features is to give rise to a\nposterior distribution of the agents' merits. We use this viewpoint to define a\nnotion of approximate fairness in ranking. We call an algorithm $\\phi$-fair\n(for $\\phi \\in [0,1]$) if it has the following property for all agents $x$ and\nall $k$: if agent $x$ is among the top $k$ agents with respect to merit with\nprobability at least $\\rho$ (according to the posterior merit distribution),\nthen the algorithm places the agent among the top $k$ agents in its ranking\nwith probability at least $\\phi \\rho$.\n  We show how to compute rankings that optimally trade off approximate fairness\nagainst utility to the principal.

For magnetization dynamics simulations explicit\nevaluation methods are in common use. Higher order methods call for evaluation\nof all effective field terms, including the demagnetizing field, at all\nsub-steps. Here a general method of speeding up such explicit evaluation\nmethods is discussed, by skipping the demagnetizing field computation at\nsub-steps, and instead approximating it using polynomial extrapolation based on\nstored previous exact computations. This approach is tested for a large number\nof explicit evaluation methods, both adaptive and fixed time-step, ranging from\n2nd order up to 5th order.

Traditional methods rely on static images of a\ncalibration pattern. This raises interesting challenges towards the practical\nusage of event cameras, which notably require image change to produce\nsufficient measurements. The current standard for event camera calibration\ntherefore consists of using flashing patterns. They have the advantage of\nsimultaneously triggering events in all reprojected pattern feature locations,\nbut it is difficult to construct or use such patterns in the field. We present\nthe first dynamic event camera calibration algorithm. It calibrates directly\nfrom events captured during relative motion between camera and calibration\npattern. The method is propelled by a novel feature extraction mechanism for\ncalibration patterns, and leverages existing calibration tools before\noptimizing all parameters through a multi-segment continuous-time formulation.\nAs demonstrated through our results on real data, the obtained calibration\nmethod is highly convenient and reliably calibrates from data sequences\nspanning less than 10 seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 14:52:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 14:37:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 03:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-29"}

The interest arises\nfrom the possibility of controlling their properties by exchanging ions in the\ncrystal lattice. However, the ion exchange process itself remains largely\nunexplored in atomically thin materials. Here we use atomic-resolution scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy to study the dynamics of the process and\nreveal the binding sites of individual ions in atomically thin and artificially\nrestacked clays and micas. Imaging ion exchange after different exposure time\nand for different crystal thicknesses, we find that the ion diffusion constant,\nD, for the interlayer space of atomically thin samples is up to 10^4 times\nlarger than in bulk crystals and approaches its value in free water.\nSurprisingly, samples where no bulk exchange is expected display fast exchange\nif the mica layers are twisted and restacked; but in this case, the exchanged\nions arrange in islands controlled by the moir\\'e superlattice dimensions. We\nattribute the fast ion diffusion to enhanced interlayer expandability resulting\nfrom weaker interlayer binding forces in both atomically thin and restacked\nmaterials. Finally, we demonstrate images of individual surface cations for\nthese materials, which had remained elusive in previous studies.

The switch between the two jump rates happens at rate\n$\\gamma\\in(0,\\infty)$. In the exclusion process, the interaction is such that\neach site can be occupied by at most one particle of each type.

Through a hypercube logical layout, queries are efficiently routed\namong the network, where each node is responsible for a specific keywords set\nand the related contents. Second, we provide a framework for the governance of\nthe above network, based on a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)\nimplementation. We show how the use of smart contracts enables organizational\ndecision making and rewards for nodes that have actively contributed to the\nDHT. Finally, we provide experimental validation of an implementation of our\nproposal, where the execution of the same protocol for different logical nodes\nof the hypercube allows us to evaluate the efficiency of communication within\nthe network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 15:46:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 15:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-13"}

First, we deploy passive permanent magnets that do not\nrequire a power supply, in contrast to active magnetic transmitters. Second, we\nperform localization based on smartphone motion rather than on static\npositioning of the magnetometer. In our previous study, we considered a single\nsuperstructure pattern. Here, we present an extended version of that algorithm\nfor multi-superstructure localization, which covers a broader localization area\nof the user. Experimental results demonstrate localization accuracy of 95% with\na mean localization error of less than 1m using artificial intelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 09:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

We report faster training\ntimes, alongside accuracy, theoretical privacy guarantees and success of\nMembership inference attacks for our models and observe that fine-tuning with\nproposed variant of DP-SGD can yield competitive models without significant\ndegradation in training time and improvement in privacy protection. We also\nmake observations such as looser theoretical $\\epsilon, \\delta$ can translate\ninto significant practical privacy gains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 15:23:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 22:04:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 18:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-03"}

A\nnon-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion is integrated into a topology\noptimization algorithm to calculate low-order statistical moments of the\nmechanical-mathematical model response. This procedure, known as robust\ntopology optimization, can optimize the mean of the compliance while\nsimultaneously minimizing its standard deviation. In order to address possible\nvariabilities in the loads applied to the mechanical system of interest,\nmagnitude and direction of the external forces are assumed to be uncertain. In\nthis probabilistic framework, forces are described as a random field or a set\nof random variables. Representation of the random objects and propagation of\nload uncertainties through the model are efficiently done through\nKarhunen-Lo\\`{e}ve and polynomial chaos expansions. We take advantage of using\npolygonal elements, which have been shown to be effective in suppressing\ncheckerboard patterns and reducing mesh dependency in the solution of topology\noptimization problems. Accuracy and applicability of the proposed methodology\nare demonstrated by means of several topology optimization examples. The\nobtained results, which are in excellent agreement with reference solutions\ncomputed via Monte Carlo method, show that load uncertainties play an important\nrole in optimal design of structural systems, so that they must be taken into\naccount to ensure a reliable optimization process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 15:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

However, due\nto the Fabry-Perot resonance, only the EM waves with discrete frequencies can\nbe squeezed and, as far as we know, in the previous energy-squeezing devices,\nstringent requirements of the materials or the geometrical shape are needed. We\nnote that the structures filled with epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mediums as\nreported in some works can squeeze and tunnel EM waves at frequencies (e.g.\nplasma frequency). However, the group velocity is usually near zero which means\nfew EM information travel through the structures. In this paper, low-loss\nenergy squeezing and tunneling (EST) based on unidirectional modes were\ndemonstrated in YIG-based one-way waveguides at microwave frequencies.\nAccording to our theoretical analysis and the simulations using finite element\nmethod, broadband EST was achieved and the EM EST was observed even for\nextremely bended structures. Besides, similar EM EST was achieved in a\nrealistic three-dimensional remanence-based one-way waveguide as well.

For this purpose, we use higher derivatives in the form of non-local\nvariables, known as the Ostrogradsky formalism.

From the food\ncrop production side, the travel bans and border closures, the late reception\nand the use of agricultural inputs such as imported seeds, fertilizers, and\npesticides could lead to poor food crop production performances. Another layer\nof disruption introduced by the mobility restriction measures is the scarcity\nof agricultural workers, mainly seasonal workers. The lockdown measures and\nborder closures limit seasonal workers' availability to get to the farm on time\nfor planting and harvesting activities. Moreover, most of the imported\nagricultural inputs travel by air, which the pandemic has heavily impacted.\nSuch transportation disruptions can also negatively affect the food crop\nproduction system.\n  This chapter assesses food crop production levels in 2020 -- before the\nharvesting period -- in all African regions and four staples such as maize,\ncassava, rice, and wheat. The production levels are predicted using the\ncombination of biogeophysical remote sensing data retrieved from satellite\nimages and machine learning artificial neural networks (ANNs) technique. The\nremote sensing products are used as input variables and the ANNs as the\npredictive modeling framework. The input remote sensing products are the\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the daytime Land Surface\nTemperature (LST), rainfall data, and agricultural lands' Evapotranspiration\n(ET).
