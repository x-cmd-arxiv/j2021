The subject has found many\napplications over the centuries, e.g., in physics, economics, engineering and\nbiology. Up to this moment, however, the theory of the calculus of variations\nhas been confined to Newton's approach to calculus. As in many applications\nnegative values of admissible functions are not physically plausible, we\npropose here to develop an alternative calculus of variations based on the\nnon-Newtonian approach first introduced by Grossman and Katz in the period\nbetween 1967 and 1970, which provides a calculus defined, from the very\nbeginning, for positive real numbers only, and it is based on a (non-Newtonian)\nderivative that permits one to compare relative changes between a dependent\npositive variable and an independent variable that is also positive. In this\nway, the non-Newtonian calculus of variations we introduce here provides a\nnatural framework for problems involving functions with positive images.

Inspired by the fact that the samples with\nhigher loss are usually more informative to the model than the samples with\nlower loss, in this paper we present a novel deep active learning approach that\nqueries the oracle for data annotation when the unlabeled sample is believed to\nincorporate high loss. The core of our approach is a measurement Temporal\nOutput Discrepancy (TOD) that estimates the sample loss by evaluating the\ndiscrepancy of outputs given by models at different optimization steps. Our\ntheoretical investigation shows that TOD lower-bounds the accumulated sample\nloss thus it can be used to select informative unlabeled samples. On basis of\nTOD, we further develop an effective unlabeled data sampling strategy as well\nas an unsupervised learning criterion that enhances model performance by\nincorporating the unlabeled data. Due to the simplicity of TOD, our active\nlearning approach is efficient, flexible, and task-agnostic. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior\nperformances than the state-of-the-art active learning methods on image\nclassification and semantic segmentation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 16:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

This paper first presents a systematic study on\nthis problem.

Moreover, recent methods directly estimate the depth\nbased on isolated instances or pixels while ignoring the geometric relations\nacross different objects. To this end, we construct geometric relation graphs\nacross predicted objects and use the graph to facilitate depth estimation. As\nthe preliminary depth estimation of each instance is usually inaccurate in this\nill-posed setting, we incorporate a probabilistic representation to capture the\nuncertainty.

We first consider a discrete\nmemoryless (DM) MAC-WT channel where both Bob and Eve jointly decode their\ninterested messages. By using random coding, we find an achievable rate region,\nwithin which perfect secrecy can be realized, i.e., all users can communicate\nwith Bob with arbitrarily small probability of error, while the confidential\ninformation leaked to Eve tends to zero. Due to the high implementation\ncomplexity of joint decoding, we also consider the DM MAC-WT channel where Bob\nsimply decodes messages independently while Eve still applies joint decoding.\nWe then extend the results in the DM case to a Gaussian vector (GV) MAC-WT\nchannel.

Since the Reynolds\nnumber of microscopic flows is very small on the scale of individual agents,\ninertial effects are typically excluded in continuum theories of active nematic\nturbulence. Whether active stresses can collectively excite inertial flows is\ncurrently unclear. To address this question, we investigate a two-dimensional\ncontinuum theory for active nematic turbulence. In particular, we compare\nmesoscale turbulence with and without the effects of advective inertia. We find\nthat inertial effects can influence the flow already close to the onset of the\nturbulent state and, moreover, give rise to large-scale fluid motion for strong\nactive driving. A detailed analysis of the kinetic energy budget reveals an\nenergy transfer to large scales mediated by inertial advection. While this\ntransfer is small in comparison to energy injection and dissipation, its\neffects accumulate over time. The inclusion of friction, which is typically\npresent in experiments, can compensate for this effect. The findings suggest\nthat the inclusion of inertia and friction may be necessary for dynamically\nconsistent theories of active nematic turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 16:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Constructing an approximately unbiased\nestimate of the parameter of interest is a crucial step towards performing\nstatistical inference. Several authors suggest to orthogonalize both the\nvariable of interest and the outcome with respect to the nuisance variables,\nand then regress the residual outcome with respect to the residual variable.\nThis is possible if the covariance structure of the regressors is perfectly\nknown, or is sufficiently structured that it can be estimated accurately from\ndata (e.g., the precision matrix is sufficiently sparse).\n  Here we consider a regime in which the covariate model can only be estimated\ninaccurately, and hence existing debiasing approaches are not guaranteed to\nwork. When errors in estimating the covariate model are correlated with errors\nin estimating the linear model parameter, an incomplete elimination of the bias\noccurs.

Current processing\nmethods associated with large whole-body volumes are time intensive and prone\nto artifacts during fat-water separation performed on the scanner, making the\ndata difficult to analyse. The most common artifact are fat-water swaps, where\nthe labels are inverted at the voxel level. It is common for researchers to\ndiscard swapped data (generally around 10%), which can be wasteful and lead to\nunintended biases. The UK Biobank is acquiring Dixon MRI for over 100,000\nparticipants, and thousands of swaps will occur. If those go undetected, errors\nwill propagate into processes such as abdominal organ segmentation and dilute\nthe results in population-based analyses. There is a clear need for a fast and\nrobust method to accurately separate fat and water channels. In this work we\npropose such a method based on style transfer using a conditional generative\nadversarial network. We also introduce a new Dixon loss function for the\ngenerator model.

The coding process of dynamic\npoint clouds, especially video-based point cloud compression (V-PCC) developed\nby the MPEG standardization group, is now delivering state-of-the-art\nperformance in compression efficiency. V-PCC is based on the projection of the\npoint cloud patches to 2D planes and encoding the sequence as 2D texture and\ngeometry patch sequences. However, the resulting quantization errors from\ncoding can introduce compression artifacts, which can be very unpleasant for\nthe quality of experience (QoE).

The point cloud sampling scheme\nemploys a cube-based neighborhood patch extraction to divide the point cloud\ninto patches. The geometry artifact removal network then processes these\npatches to obtain artifact-removed patches. The artifact-removed patches are\nthen merged together using an aggregation scheme to obtain the final\nartifact-removed point cloud. We employ 3D deep convolutional feature learning\nfor geometry artifact removal that jointly recovers both the quantization\ndirection and the quantization noise level by exploiting projection and\nquantization prior.

The theory of asymmetry grew out of\ninformation-theoretic work on entanglement and quantum reference frames, and\nallows us to quantify the degree to which a quantum system encodes coordinates\nof a symmetry group. Recently, a complete set of entropic conditions was found\nfor asymmetry in terms of correlations relative to infinitely many quantum\nreference frames.

This in turn implies that asymmetry can\nbe reduced to just a single entropic condition evaluated at the maximally mixed\nstate.

Existing transferable attacks\ntend to craft adversarial examples by indiscriminately distorting features to\ndegrade prediction accuracy in a source model without aware of intrinsic\nfeatures of objects in the images. We argue that such brute-force degradation\nwould introduce model-specific local optimum into adversarial examples, thus\nlimiting the transferability. By contrast, we propose the Feature\nImportance-aware Attack (FIA), which disrupts important object-aware features\nthat dominate model decisions consistently. More specifically, we obtain\nfeature importance by introducing the aggregate gradient, which averages the\ngradients with respect to feature maps of the source model, computed on a batch\nof random transforms of the original clean image. The gradients will be highly\ncorrelated to objects of interest, and such correlation presents invariance\nacross different models. Besides, the random transforms will preserve intrinsic\nfeatures of objects and suppress model-specific information. Finally, the\nfeature importance guides to search for adversarial examples towards disrupting\ncritical features, achieving stronger transferability. Extensive experimental\nevaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of the\nproposed FIA, i.e., improving the success rate by 9.5% against normally trained\nmodels and 12.8% against defense models as compared to the state-of-the-art\ntransferable attacks.

An ML API\ncan change over time due to model updates or retraining. This presents a key\nchallenge in the usage of the API because it is often not clear to the user if\nand how the ML model has changed. Model shifts can affect downstream\napplication performance and also create oversight issues (e.g. if consistency\nis desired). In this paper, we initiate a systematic investigation of ML API\nshifts. We first quantify the performance shifts from 2020 to 2021 of popular\nML APIs from Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others on a variety of datasets. We\nidentified significant model shifts in 12 out of 36 cases we investigated.\nInterestingly, we found several datasets where the API's predictions became\nsignificantly worse over time. This motivated us to formulate the API shift\nassessment problem at a more fine-grained level as estimating how the API\nmodel's confusion matrix changes over time when the data distribution is\nconstant. Monitoring confusion matrix shifts using standard random sampling can\nrequire a large number of samples, which is expensive as each API call costs a\nfee. We propose a principled adaptive sampling algorithm, MASA, to efficiently\nestimate confusion matrix shifts. MASA can accurately estimate the confusion\nmatrix shifts in commercial ML APIs using up to 90% fewer samples compared to\nrandom sampling. This work establishes ML API shifts as an important problem to\nstudy and provides a cost-effective approach to monitor such shifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 17:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

Our method learns to predict the motions that occur during the nominal\nexecution of a task, including camera and robot body motion. A probabilistic\nU-Net architecture is used to learn to predict optical flow, and the robot's\nkinematics and 3D model are used to model camera and body motion. The errors\nbetween the observed and predicted motion are used to calculate an anomaly\nscore. We evaluate our method on a dataset of a robot placing a book on a\nshelf, which includes anomalies such as falling books, camera occlusions, and\nrobot disturbances. We find that modeling camera and body motion, in addition\nto the learning-based optical flow prediction, results in an improvement of the\narea under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.752 to 0.804, and\nthe area under the precision-recall curve from 0.467 to 0.549.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 17:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}

In this work, we take the lead in solving this issue by proposing a\nnovel Point Noise-Adaptive Learning (PNAL) framework.

Finally, we show that the independent constraints on\nreionization from FRBs will improve limits on other cosmological parameters\nsuch as the amplitude of the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 15:10:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 15:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

The universality of the IMF, suggested by observations in our\nown Milky Way, has been thoroughly revisited due to the apparent excess of\nlow-mass stars in the central regions of massive quiescent galaxies. As part of\nthe efforts within the Fornax 3D project, we aim to characterize the\ntwo-dimensional IMF variations in a sample of 23 quiescent galaxies within the\nFornax cluster. For each galaxy in the sample, we measured the mean age,\nmetallicity, [Mg/Fe], and IMF slope maps from spatially resolved integrated\nspectra. The IMF maps show a variety of behaviors and internal substructures,\nroughly following metallicity variations. However, metallicity alone is not\nable to fully explain the complexity exhibited by the IMF maps. In particular,\nfor relatively metal-poor stellar populations, the slope of the IMF seems to\ndepend on the (specific) star formation rate at which stars were formed.\nMoreover, metallicity maps have systematically higher ellipticities than IMF\nslope ones. At the same time, both metallicity and IMF slope maps have at the\nsame time higher ellipticities than the stellar light distribution in our\nsample of galaxies. In addition we find that, regardless of the stellar mass,\nevery galaxy in our sample shows a positive radial [Mg/Fe] gradient. This\nresults in a strong [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] relation, similar to what is observed in\nnearby, resolved galaxies. Since the formation history and chemical enrichment\nof galaxies are causally driven by changes in the IMF, our findings call for a\nphysically motivated interpretation of stellar population measurements based on\nintegrated spectra that take into account any possible time evolution of the\nstellar populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

As in previous studies, we find that all haloes are\nmore massive at the centre compared to their DM-only (DMO) counterparts at the\npresent day as a result of the dissipational collapse of baryons during the\nassembly of the galaxy. However, we identify two processes that can reduce the\ncentral halo mass during the evolution of the galaxy. Firstly, gas blowouts\ninduced by AGN feedback can lead to a substantial decrease of the central DM\nmass. Secondly, the formation of a stellar bar and its interaction with the DM\ncan induce a secular expansion of the halo; the rate at which DM is evacuated\nfrom the central region by this process is related to the average bar strength\nand the timescale on which it acts determines how much the halo has\ndecontracted. Although the inner regions of the haloes we have investigated are\nstill more massive than their DMO counterparts at $z = 0$, they are\nsignificantly less massive than in the past and less massive than expected from\nthe classic adiabatic contraction model.

To do this, we exploit\nintegrated magnitudes of simulated GCs with MPs, and multi-band Hubble Space\nTelescope photometry of 56 Galactic GCs, where MPs are widely studied, and\ncharacterized as part of the UV Legacy Survey of Galactic GCs.

The size and kinematics of the BLR\ncan be better constrained by a joint analysis that combines both GRAVITY and RM\ndata.

The question remains, if plasmon-induced and\nphoton-induced hot carriers are fundamentally different, or if plasmonic\nenhancement is only an effect of field concentration producing these carriers\nin greater numbers. For the bulk plasmon resonance, a fundamental difference is\nknown, yet for the technologically important surface plasmons this is far from\nbeing settled. The direct imaging of surface plasmon-induced hot carriers could\nprovide essential insight, but the separation of the influence of driving\nlaser, field-enhancement, and fundamental plasmon decay has proven to be\ndifficult. Here, we present an approach using a two-color femtosecond\npump-probe scheme in time-resolved 2-photon-photoemission (tr-2PPE), supported\nby a theoretical analysis of the light and plasmon energy flow. We separate the\nenergy and momentum distribution of the plasmon-induced hot electrons from the\none of photoexcited electrons by following the spatial evolution of\nphotoemitted electrons with energy-resolved Photoemission Electron Microscopy\n(PEEM) and Momentum Microscopy during the propagation of a Surface Plasmon\nPolariton (SPP) pulse along a gold surface. With this scheme, we realize a\ndirect experimental access to plasmon-induced hot electrons. We find a\nplasmonic enhancement towards high excitation energies and small in-plane\nmomenta, which suggests a fundamentally different mechanism of hot electron\ngeneration, as previously unknown for surface plasmons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 18:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

In this paper,\nwe propose a two-step automatic feature-based cross-staining WSI alignment to\nassist localization of even tiny metastatic foci in the assessment of lymph\nnode. Image pairs were aligned allowing for translation, rotation, and scaling.\nThe registration was performed automatically by first detecting landmarks in\nboth images, using the scale-invariant image transform (SIFT), followed by the\nfast sample consensus (FSC) protocol for finding point correspondences and\nfinally aligned the images. The Registration results were evaluated using both\nvisual and quantitative criteria using the Jaccard index. The average Jaccard\nsimilarity index of the results produced by the proposed system is 0.942 when\ncompared with the manual registration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 19:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Existing approaches for learning representations in\nthis domain handle these challenges by either aggregation or imputation of\nvalues, which in-turn suppresses the fine-grained information and adds\nundesirable noise/overhead into the machine learning model. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose a Self-supervised Transformer for Time-Series (STraTS)\nmodel which overcomes these pitfalls by treating time-series as a set of\nobservation triplets instead of using the standard dense matrix representation.\nIt employs a novel Continuous Value Embedding technique to encode continuous\ntime and variable values without the need for discretization. It is composed of\na Transformer component with multi-head attention layers which enable it to\nlearn contextual triplet embeddings while avoiding the problems of recurrence\nand vanishing gradients that occur in recurrent architectures. In addition, to\ntackle the problem of limited availability of labeled data (which is typically\nobserved in many healthcare applications), STraTS utilizes self-supervision by\nleveraging unlabeled data to learn better representations by using time-series\nforecasting as an auxiliary proxy task. Experiments on real-world multivariate\nclinical time-series benchmark datasets demonstrate that STraTS has better\nprediction performance than state-of-the-art methods for mortality prediction,\nespecially when labeled data is limited. Finally, we also present an\ninterpretable version of STraTS which can identify important measurements in\nthe time-series data.

The objective of this\npaper is to solve such a tracking problem for the unstable Burgers' equation\nwithout this assumption. Our treatment of this problem is straightforward.\nUsing the method of variable transform, the tracking problem is split into two\nseparate problems: a simple Neumann boundary stabilization problem and a\ndynamical Neumann boundary regulator problem. Unlike the existing literature\nwhere the regulator problem is always kept independent, the stabilization\nproblem here is simplified to an independent linear diffusion equation by\nmoving the instability term and the nonlinear term to the dynamical regulator\nproblem, whereas the dynamical regulator problem does depend on the\nstabilization problem.\n  Thus we can first easily handle the stabilization problem and then solve the\ndynamical regulator problem by using the fundamental theory of partial\ndifferential equations. The boundary feedforward controller is explicitly\nconstructed by using the reference, the disturbance and the solution of the\nstabilization problem while the boundary feedback controller is easily designed\nfor the linear diffusion equation without using a complex method such as the\nbackstepping method. It is proved that, under the designed feedback and\nfeedforward controllers, the tracking error converges to zero exponentially.\nThis theoretical result is confirmed by a numerical example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 20:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

Thus began study of the\ndirect products of dynamic physics in the solar corona. As we have progressed\nfrom 4-min sounding-rocket samples to continuous satellite coverage of SEP\nevents, we have extended the observations to the unusual distribution of\nelement abundances throughout the periodic table. Small \"impulsive\" SEP events\nfrom islands of magnetic reconnection on open magnetic-field lines in solar\njets generate huge enhancements in abundances of 3He and of the heaviest\nelements. Solar flares involve the same physics but there the SEPs are trapped\non closed loops, expending their energy as heat and light. The larger,\nenergetic \"gradual\" SEP events are accelerated at shock waves driven by fast,\nwide coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, these shocks can also reaccelerate\nions from pools of residual suprathermal impulsive ions, and CMEs from jets can\nalso drive fast shocks, complicating the picture. The underlying element\nabundances in SEP events represent the solar corona, which differs from\ncorresponding abundances in the photosphere as a function of the first\nionization potential (FIP) of the elements, distinguishing low-FIP (<10 eV)\nions from high-FIP neutral atoms as they expand through the chromosphere.\nDependence of SEP acceleration upon A/Q allows best-fit estimation of ion\nQ-values and hence of the source plasma temperature of ~1 - 3 MK, derived from\nabundances, which correlates with recent measures of temperatures using extreme\nultraviolet emission from jets. New questions arise, however, about the\ntheoretical basis of correlations of energy-spectral indices with power-laws of\nabundances, about the coexistence of mechanisms for enhancements of 3He and of\nheavy elements, and about the overall paucity of C in FIP comparisons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 20:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

It is suggested that the gravitational-wave\n(GW) emitted by a BBH has a high probability to be lensed by the SMBH if the\nBBH's orbit around the SMBH (i.e., the outer orbit) has a period of less than a\nyear and is less than the duration of observation of the BBH by a space-borne\nGW observatory. For such a BBH + SMBH triple system, the de Sitter precession\nof the BBH's orbital plane is also significant. In this work, we thus study GW\nwaveforms emitted by the BBH and then modulated by the SMBH due to effects\nincluding Doppler shift, de Sitter precession, and gravitational lensing. We\nshow specifically that for an outer orbital period of 0.1 yr and an SMBH mass\nof $10^7 M_\\odot$, there is a 3\\%-10\\% chance for the standard, strong lensing\nsignatures to be detectable by space-borne GW detectors such as LISA and/or\nTianGO. For more massive lenses ($\\gtrsim 10^8 M_\\odot$) and more compact outer\norbits with periods <0.1 yr, retro-lensing of the SMBH might also have a\n1%-level chance of detection. Furthermore, by combining the lensing effects and\nthe dynamics of the outer orbit, we find the mass of the central SMBH can be\naccurately determined with a fraction error of $\\sim 10^{-4}$. This is much\nbetter than the case of static lensing because the degeneracy between the lens'\nmass and the source's angular position is lifted by the outer orbital motion.\nIncluding lensing effects also allows the de Sitter precession to be detectable\nat a precession period 3 times longer than the case without lensing. Lastly, we\ndemonstrate that one can check the consistency between the SMBH's mass\ndetermined from the orbital dynamics and the one inferred from gravitational\nlensing, which serves as a test on theories behind both phenomena.

How simulation can best contribute to\nscientific insight about RS alongside qualitative and quantitative empirical\napproaches is an open question. Philosophers and researchers have long debated\nthe epistemological nature of simulation compared to wholly theoretical or\nempirical methods. Simulation is often implicitly or explicitly conceptualized\nas occupying a middle ground between empirical and theoretical approaches,\nallowing researchers to realize the benefits of both. However, what is often\nignored in such arguments is that without firm grounding in any single\nmethodological tradition, simulation studies have no agreed upon scientific\nnorms or standards, resulting in a patchwork of theoretical motivations,\napproaches, and implementations that are difficult to reconcile. In this\nposition paper, we argue that simulation studies of RS are conceptually similar\nto empirical experimental approaches and therefore can be evaluated using the\nstandards of empirical research methods. Using this empirical lens, we argue\nthat the combination of high heterogeneity in approaches and low transparency\nin methods in simulation studies of RS has limited their interpretability,\ngeneralizability, and replicability.

In this work, we conduct molecular\nsimulations of two model supercapacitors based on nanoporous electrodes with\nthe same average pore size, a property often used when comparing porous\nmaterials, but different morphologies.

In contrast, the mammalian visual system is robust to a wide range of\nperturbations. Recent work suggests that this generalization ability can be\nexplained by useful inductive biases encoded in the representations of visual\nstimuli throughout the visual cortex. Here, we successfully leveraged these\ninductive biases with a multi-task learning approach: we jointly trained a deep\nnetwork to perform image classification and to predict neural activity in\nmacaque primary visual cortex (V1). We measured the out-of-distribution\ngeneralization abilities of our network by testing its robustness to image\ndistortions. We found that co-training on monkey V1 data leads to increased\nrobustness despite the absence of those distortions during training.\nAdditionally, we showed that our network's robustness is very close to that of\nan Oracle network where parts of the architecture are directly trained on noisy\nimages. Our results also demonstrated that the network's representations become\nmore brain-like as their robustness improves. Using a novel constrained\nreconstruction analysis, we investigated what makes our brain-regularized\nnetwork more robust. We found that our co-trained network is more sensitive to\ncontent than noise when compared to a Baseline network that we trained for\nimage classification alone.

Prior research in computational empathy has\nfocused on designing empathic agents that use verbal and nonverbal behaviors to\nsimulate empathy and attempt to elicit empathic responses from humans. The\nchallenge of developing agents with the ability to automatically perceive\nelicited empathy in humans remains largely unexplored. Our paper presents the\nfirst approach to modeling user empathy elicited during interactions with a\nrobotic agent. We collected a new dataset from the novel interaction context of\nparticipants listening to a robot storyteller (46 participants, 6.9 hours of\nvideo). After each storytelling interaction, participants answered a\nquestionnaire that assessed their level of elicited empathy during the\ninteraction with the robot. We conducted experiments with 8 classical machine\nlearning models and 2 deep learning models (long short-term memory networks and\ntemporal convolutional networks) to detect empathy by leveraging patterns in\nparticipants' visual behaviors while they were listening to the robot\nstoryteller. Our highest-performing approach, based on XGBoost, achieved an\naccuracy of 69% and AUC of 72% when detecting empathy in videos. We contribute\ninsights regarding modeling approaches and visual features for automated\nempathy detection. Our research informs and motivates future development of\nempathy perception models that can be leveraged by virtual and robotic agents\nduring human-machine interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 21:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

To address this question, I study the\nassociation between the incidence of COVID-19 and the degree of spousal sorting\ninto occupations that differ by contact intensity at the workplace. The\nmechanism, that I explore, implies that the higher degree of positive spousal\nsorting mitigates intra-household contagion and this translates into a smaller\nnumber of individuals exposed to COVID-19 risk. Using the U.S. data at the\nstate level, I argue that spousal sorting is an important factor for\nunderstanding the disparities in the prevalence of COVID-19 during the early\nstages of the pandemic. First, I document that it creates about two-thirds of\nthe U.S. dual-earner couples that are exposed to higher COVID-19 health risk\ndue to within-household transmission. Moreover, I uncover substantial\nheterogeneity in the degree of spousal sorting by state.

They\npresent a great potential for the analysis and visualization of time-varying\ndata. First, they give compressed and topology-preserving representations of\ndata instances. Second, their comparisons provide a basis for studying the\nrelations among data instances, such as their distributions, clusters,\noutliers, and periodicities. A number of comparative measures have been\ndeveloped for merge trees. However, these measures are often computationally\nexpensive since they implicitly consider all possible correspondences between\ncritical points of the merge trees. In this paper, we perform geometry-aware\ncomparisons of merge trees using labeled interleaving distances. The main idea\nis to decouple the computation of a comparative measure into two steps: a\nlabeling step that generates a correspondence between the critical points of\ntwo merge trees, and a comparison step that computes distances between a pair\nof labeled merge trees by encoding them as matrices. We show that our approach\nis general, computationally efficient, and practically useful. Our general\nframework makes it possible to integrate geometric information of the data\ndomain in the labeling process. At the same time, it reduces the computational\ncomplexity since not all possible correspondences have to be considered.

However, many aspects with regard to some unique\nproperties of AUs, such as the regional and relational characteristics, are not\nsufficiently explored in previous works. Motivated by this, we take the AU\nproperties into consideration and propose two auxiliary AU related tasks to\nbridge the gap between limited annotations and the model performance in a\nself-supervised manner via the unlabeled data. Specifically, to enhance the\ndiscrimination of regional features with AU relation embedding, we design a\ntask of RoI inpainting to recover the randomly cropped AU patches.

Based on these two self-supervised auxiliary\ntasks, local features, mutual relation and motion cues of AUs are better\ncaptured in the backbone network with the proposed regional and temporal based\nauxiliary task learning (RTATL) framework.

The problem has been\nformulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation in the\nliterature. We first propose a novel linear programming (LP) relaxation of the\nMILP formulation. We show that compared with a natural LP relaxation of the\nMILP formulation, the novel LP relaxation is much more compact in terms of\nsmaller numbers of variables and constraints, and much stronger in terms of\nproviding a better LP bound, which makes it particularly suitable to be\nembedded in an LP relaxation based algorithm. Then we design an efficient\ntwo-stage LP dynamic rounding-and-refinement algorithm based on this novel LP\nrelaxation. In the first stage, the proposed algorithm uses an LP dynamic\nrounding procedure to place the virtual network functions of all services into\ncloud nodes while taking traffic routing of all services into consideration; in\nthe second stage, the proposed algorithm uses an iterative LP refinement\nprocedure to obtain a solution for traffic routing of all services with their\nend-to-end delay constraints being satisfied. Compared with the existing\nalgorithms which either have an exponential complexity or return a low-quality\nsolution, our proposed algorithm achieves a better trade-off between the\nsolution quality and the computational complexity. In particular, the\nworst-case complexity of our proposed algorithm is polynomial, which makes it\nsuitable for solving large-scale problems.

The crash risk under fog conditions\nwas estimated using a crash risk prediction model based on Bayesian logistic\nregression. The traffic flow with VSL control was simulated by a modified cell\ntransmission model (MCTM).

Specifically, we use multiple compression\nprojections to cast the feature into many low dimensional spaces, and then use\ntransformer to globally optimize these projections such that the features are\nwell compressed following the guidance from our loss function.

However, the\nsimulation of reactions and mechanical properties up to failure remains\nchallenging and expensive. Here we introduce the Reactive Interface Force Field\n(IFF-R) to analyze bond breaking and failure of complex materials using\nmolecular dynamics simulations. IFF-R uses a Morse potential instead of a\nharmonic potential as typically employed in molecular dynamics force fields to\ndescribe the bond energy, which can render any desired bond reactive by\nspecification of the curve shape of the potential energy and the bond\ndissociation energy. This facile extension of IFF and other force fields that\nutilize a harmonic bond energy term allows the description of bond breaking\nwithout loss in functionality, accuracy, and speed. The method enables\nquantitative, on-the-fly computations of bond breaking and stress-strain curves\nup to failure in any material. We illustrate accurate predictions of mechanical\nbehavior for a variety of material systems, including metals (iron), ceramics\n(carbon nanotubes), polymers (polyacrylonitrile and cellulose I\\b{eta}), and\ninclude sample parameters for common bonds based on using experimental and\nhigh-level (MP2) quantum mechanical reference data.

In particular, we\nask how $\\gamma$ changes when there is a small modification to a regular graph\n$G$.

However,\nsince taking a picture is a process of projection of a 3D scene onto a 2D\nimaging sensor, the depth information is embedded in the image. Extracting the\ndepth information from the image is a challenging task. A guiding principle is\nthat the level of blurriness due to defocus is related to the distance between\nthe object and the focal plane. Based on this principle and the widely used\nassumption that Gaussian blur is a good model for defocus blur, we formulate\nthe problem of estimating the spatially varying defocus blurriness as a\nGaussian blur classification problem. We solved the problem by training a deep\nneural network to classify image patches into one of the 20 levels of\nblurriness. We have created a dataset of more than 500000 image patches of size\n$32\\times32$ which are used to train and test several well-known network\nmodels.

The trained model is used to\ndetermine the patch blurriness which is then refined by applying an iterative\nweighted guided filter. The result is a defocus map that carries the\ninformation of the degree of blurriness for each pixel.

Increasingly the focus amongst the policy makers and general\npublic is on the potential third wave. Due to uncertainties regarding emergence\nof new variants and reinfections, instead of projecting our best guess\nscenario, in this report we conduct an extensive scenario analysis for Mumbai\nand track peak fatalities in the coming months in each of these scenarios. Our\nkey conclusions are - As per our model, about 80% of Mumbai population has been\nexposed to Covid-19 by June 1, 2021. Under the assumption that all who are\nexposed have immunity against further infection, it is unlikely that Mumbai\nwould see a large third wave. It is the reinfections that may lead to a large\nwave. Reinfections could occur because of declining antibodies amongst the\ninfected as well as by variants that can break through the immunity provided by\nprior infections. Even under a reasonably pessimistic scenario we observe the\nresulting peak to be no larger than that under the second wave. We further\nobserve that under the scenario where the reinfections are mild so that they\naffect the fatality figures negligibly, where the new variants (beyond the\nexisting delta variant) have a mild impact, as the city opens up, we observe a\nsmall wave in the coming months. However, if by then the vaccine coverage is\nextensive, this wave will be barely noticeable. We also plot $R_t$, the\ninfection growth rate at time $t$, and highlight some interesting observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 07:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

The formalism of labelled\nsequents has been successful in that cut-free calculi in possession of\ndesirable proof-theoretic properties can be automatically generated for large\nclasses of logics. Despite these qualities, labelled systems make use of a\ncomplicated syntax that explicitly incorporates the semantics of the associated\nlogic, and such systems typically violate the subformula property to a high\ndegree. By contrast, nested sequent calculi employ a simpler syntax and adhere\nto a strict reading of the subformula property, making such systems useful in\nthe design of automated reasoning algorithms. However, the downside of the\nnested sequent paradigm is that a general theory concerning the automated\nconstruction of such calculi (as in the labelled setting) is essentially\nabsent, meaning that the construction of nested systems and the confirmation of\ntheir properties is usually done on a case-by-case basis. The refinement method\nconnects both paradigms in a fruitful way, by transforming labelled systems\ninto nested (or, refined labelled) systems with the properties of the former\npreserved throughout the transformation process.\n  To demonstrate the method of refinement and some of its applications, we\nconsider grammar logics, first-order intuitionistic logics, and deontic STIT\nlogics. The introduced refined labelled calculi will be used to provide the\nfirst proof-search algorithms for deontic STIT logics. Furthermore, we employ\nour refined labelled calculi for grammar logics to show that every logic in the\nclass possesses the effective Lyndon interpolation property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 08:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

Consequently, LoRaWAN is gradually replacing Wi-Fi\nand Bluetooth in sundry IoT applications including utility metering, smart\ncities, and localization. Localization, in particular, has already witnessed a\nsurge of alternatives to Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), based on\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ultra Wide Band, 5G, etc. in indoor and low power domains due\nto the poor indoor coverage and high power consumption of GNSS. With the need\nfor localization only shooting up with dense IoT deployments, LoRaWAN is seen\nas a promising solution in this context. Indeed, many attempts employing\nvarious techniques such as Time of Arrival (ToA), Time Difference of Arrival\n(TDoA), and Received Signal Strength Index (RSSI) have been made to achieve\nlocalization using LoRaWAN. However, a significant drawback in this scenario is\nthe lack of extensive data on path loss and signal propagation modeling,\nparticularly in Indian cityscapes. Another demerit is the use of GNSS at some\nstage primarily for time synchronization of gateways. In this work, we attempt\nto nullify these two disadvantages of LoRaWAN based localization. The first\npart of this work presents experimental data of LoRaWAN transmissions inside a\ntypical city building to study signal propagation and path loss.

An additional\nstationary node is introduced into the network to allow the synchronization of\ngateways without GNSS.

As each UAV operates independently, however, it is challenging to\nmeet the computation demands of the mobile users due to the limited computing\ncapacity at the UAV's MEC server as well as the UAV's energy constraint.\nTherefore, collaboration among UAVs is needed. In this paper, a collaborative\nmulti-UAV-assisted MEC system integrated with a MEC-enabled terrestrial base\nstation (BS) is proposed. Then, the problem of minimizing the total latency\nexperienced by the mobile users in the proposed system is studied by optimizing\nthe offloading decision as well as the allocation of communication and\ncomputing resources while satisfying the energy constraints of both mobile\nusers and UAVs. The proposed problem is shown to be a non-convex, mixed-integer\nnonlinear problem (MINLP) that is intractable.

Optical\nlight curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, complemented with data from\nSwift and near-IR photometry are presented. The 350-day duration bolometric\nlight curve exhibits a relatively short (~ 65 days) plateau. This implies a\nmoderate ejecta mass (~ 5 Msun). A series of spectroscopy is presented,\nincluding spectropolarimetric observations. The nebular spectra are dominated\nby Halpha but also reveal emission lines from oxygen and calcium. Comparisons\nto synthetic nebular spectra indicate an initial progenitor mass of about 12\nMsun. Stable nickel is present in the nebular spectrum, with a super-solar\nNi/Fe ratio. Several years of pre-discovery data are examined, but no signs of\npre-cursor activity is found. Pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope imaging\nreveals a probable progenitor star, detected only in the reddest band and is\nfainter than expected for stars in the 10 - 15 Msun range, in tension with the\nanalysis of the LC and the nebular spectral modeling. We present two additional\ncore-collapse SNe monitored by the ZTF, which also have nebular\nHalpha-dominated spectra. This illustrates how the absence or presence of\ninteraction with circumstellar material affect both the LCs and in particular\nthe nebular spectra. Type II SN 2020amv has a LC powered by CSM interaction, in\nparticular after about 40 days when the LC is bumpy and slowly evolving. The\nlate-time spectra show strong Halpha emission with a structure suggesting\nemission from a thin, dense shell. The evolution of the complex three-horn line\nprofile is reminiscent of that observed for SN 1998S. SN 2020jfv has a poorly\nconstrained early-time LC, but shows a transition from a hydrogen-poor Type IIb\nto a Type IIn, where the nebular spectrum after the light-curve rebrightening\nis dominated by Halpha, although with an intermediate line width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 09:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

The obtained distribution when the coupling is fixed exhibits a\nshape characteristic of a recently developed model for diffractive\ndissociation, which indicates the relevance of the study of that diffractive\nobservable for the partonic-level understanding of diffraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 09:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

During this\nepisode, the envelope of a giant star engulfs the whole binary. The energy\ntransferred from the orbit to the envelope by drag forces or from other energy\nsources can eject the envelope from the binary system, leading to a stripped\nshort-period binary. In this paper, we use one-dimensional single stellar\nevolution to explore the final stages of the common-envelope phase in\nprogenitors of neutron star binaries. We consider an instantaneously stripped\ndonor star as a proxy for the common-envelope phase and study the star's\nsubsequent radial evolution.

The current\npractice of operations planning with deterministic optimization models may be\nill-suited for a future with abundant uncertainty. To overcome the potential\nreliability and economic challenges, we present a stochastic hierarchical\nplanning (SHP) framework.

The\nanalysis of the mutual microscopic interactions is of central importance to\nelucidate the local structure of benzothiadiazine as well as the mechanisms\nresponsible for the access of benzothiadiazine to the interior of the cell. We\nhave performed molecular dynamics simulations of benzothiadiazine embedded in\nthree different model zwitterionic bilayer membranes made by\ndimyristoilphosphatidylcholine, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, 1,2-\ndioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine and cholesterol inside aqueous\nsodium-chloride solution in order to systematically examine microscopic\ninteractions of benzothiadiazine with the cell membrane at liquid-crystalline\nphase conditions. From data obtained through radial distribution functions,\nhydrogen-bonding lengths and potentials of mean force based on reversible work\ncalculations, we have observed that benzothiadiazine has a strong affinity to\nstay at the cell membrane interface although it can be fully solvated by water\nin short periods of time. Furthermore, benzothiadiazine is able to bind lipids\nand cholesterol chains by means of single and double hydrogen-bonds of\ndifferent characteristic lengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 11:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

In this paper we consider small breathers for semilinear\nKlein-Gordon equations with analytic odd nonlinearities. A breather with small\namplitude exists only when its temporal frequency is close to be resonant with\nthe linear Klein-Gordon dispersion relation. Our main result is that, for such\nfrequencies, we rigorously identify the leading order term in the exponentially\nsmall (with respect to the small amplitude) obstruction to the existence of\nsmall breathers in terms of the so-called Stokes constant which depends on the\nnonlinearity analytically, but is independent of the frequency. As a corollary\nit proves that, for generic analytic odd nonlinearities, there does not exist\nany {\\it small} breather of {\\it any} temporal frequency, even though this had\nbeen intuitive for any single given frequency due to the dimension counting.

We find that for rapidly rotating planets, the transit\natmospheric thickness on the evening terminator (east of the substellar region)\nis significantly larger than that of the morning terminator (west of the\nsubstellar region). The asymmetry is mainly related to the spatial\nheterogeneity in ice clouds, as the contributions of liquid clouds and water\nvapor are smaller. The underlying mechanism is that there are always more ice\nclouds on the evening terminator, due to the combined effect of coupled\nRossby--Kelvin waves and equatorial superrotation that advect vapor and clouds\nto the east, especially at high levels of the atmosphere. For slowly rotating\nplanets, the asymmetry reverses (the morning terminator has a larger\ntransmission depth than the evening terminator) but the magnitude is small or\neven negligible. For both rapidly and slowly rotating planets, there is strong\nvariability in the transmission spectra. The asymmetry signal is nearly\nimpossible to be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), because the\nmagnitude of the asymmetry (about 10 ppm) is smaller than the instrumental\nnoise and the high variability further increases the challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 12:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

Close-in planets, however, leave additional\nimprints in the light curve even if they do not transit. These are the\nso-called phase curve variations that include ellipsoidal, reflection and\nbeaming effects. In Millholland & Laughlin (2017), the authors scrutinized the\nKepler database looking for these phase variations from non-transiting planets.\nThey found 60 candidates whose signals were compatible with planetary\ncompanions. In this paper, we perform a ground-based follow-up of a sub-sample\nof these systems with the aim of confirming and characterizing these planets\nand thus validating the detection technique. We used the CAFE and HERMES\ninstruments to monitor the radial velocity of ten non-transiting planet\ncandidates along their orbits. We additionally used AstraLux to obtain\nhigh-resolution images of some of these candidates to discard blended binaries\nthat contaminate the Kepler light curves by mimicking planetary signals. Among\nthe ten systems, we confirm three new hot-Jupiters (KIC8121913 b, KIC10068024\nb, and KIC5479689 b) with masses in the range 0.5-2 M$_{\\rm Jup}$ and set mass\nconstraints within the planetary regime for the other three candidates\n(KIC8026887b, KIC5878307 b, and KIC11362225 b), thus strongly suggestive of\ntheir planetary nature. For the first time, we validate the technique of\ndetecting non-transiting planets via their phase curve variations. We present\nthe new planetary systems and their properties. We find good agreement between\nthe RV-derived masses and the photometric masses in all cases except KIC8121913\nb, which shows a significantly lower mass derived from the ellipsoidal\nmodulations than from beaming and radial velocity data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 13:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

An outstanding question is why\nthe stars in this class of pulsator seem to form two distinct groups by surface\ngravity, despite predictions that stars in the gap between them should also\npulsate. We use a binary population synthesis model to identify potential\nevolutionary pathways that a star can take to become a BLAP. We find that BLAPs\ncan be produced either through common envelope evolution or Roche lobe\noverflow, with a Main Sequence star or an evolved compact object being\nresponsible for the envelope stripping. The mass distribution of the inferred\npopulation indicates that fewer stars would be expected in the range of masses\nintermediate to the two known groups of pulsators, suggesting that the lack of\nobservational discoveries in this region may be a result of the underlying\npopulation of pre-white dwarf stars. We also consider metallicity variation and\nfind evidence that BLAPs at $Z = 0.010$ (half-Solar) would be pulsationally\nunstable and may also be more common.

However, detailed disciplinary analysis demonstrates\nheterogeneity across sub-fields, revealing the importance of local disciplinary\ncultures and epistemic characteristics of disagreement. Paper-level analysis\nreveals notable episodes of disagreement in science, and illustrates how\nmethodological artifacts can confound analyses of scientific texts.

The\nvulnerability of automatic speaker verification systems (ASVs) to spoofing\nattacks instigated the development of countermeasures (CMs), whose task is to\ntell apart bonafide and spoofed speech. Together, ASVs and CMs form today's\nvoice authentication platforms, advertised as an impregnable access control\nmechanism. We develop the first practical attack on CMs, and show how a\nmalicious actor may efficiently craft audio samples to bypass voice\nauthentication in its strictest form. Previous works have primarily focused on\nnon-proactive attacks or adversarial strategies against ASVs that do not\nproduce speech in the victim's voice. The repercussions of our attacks are far\nmore severe, as the samples we generate sound like the victim, eliminating any\nchance of plausible deniability. Moreover, the few existing adversarial attacks\nagainst CMs mistakenly optimize spoofed speech in the feature space and do not\ntake into account the existence of ASVs, resulting in inferior synthetic audio\nthat fails in realistic settings. We eliminate these obstacles through our key\ntechnical contribution: a novel joint loss function that enables mounting\nadvanced adversarial attacks against combined ASV/CM deployments directly in\nthe time domain. Our adversarials achieve concerning black-box success rates\nagainst state-of-the-art authentication platforms (up to 93.57\\%). Finally, we\nperform the first targeted, over-telephony-network attack on CMs, bypassing\nseveral challenges and enabling various potential threats, given the increased\nuse of voice biometrics in call centers. Our results call into question the\nsecurity of modern voice authentication systems in light of the real threat of\nattackers bypassing these measures to gain access to users' most valuable\nresources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 14:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

However, existing DIL\nmethods cannot generalise well across domains, that is, a network trained on\nthe data of source domain gives rise to poor generalisation on the data of\ntarget domain. In the present study, we propose a novel brain-inspired deep\nimitation method that builds on the evidence from human brain functions, to\nimprove the generalisation ability of deep neural networks so that autonomous\ndriving systems can perform well in various scenarios.

Whilst abundance\ndata from standardized monitoring schemes are biased towards well-studied taxa\nand locations, opportunistic data are available for many taxonomic groups, from\na large number of locations and across long timescales. Hence, these data\nprovide opportunities to measure species' changes in occurrence, particularly\nthrough the use of occupancy models, which account for imperfect detection.\nHowever, existing Bayesian occupancy models are extremely slow when applied to\nlarge citizen-science data sets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\nfor fast Bayesian inference in occupancy models that account for both spatial\nand temporal autocorrelation. We express the occupancy and detection processes\nwithin a logistic regression framework, which enables us to use the Polya-Gamma\nscheme to perform inference quickly and efficiently, even for very large data\nsets.

However, standard visual odometry or SLAM\nalgorithms require motion parallax to initialize (see Figure 1) and, therefore,\nsuffer from delayed initialization. In this paper, we present a 6-DoF monocular\nvisual odometry that initializes instantly and without motion parallax. Our\nmain contribution is a pose estimator that decouples estimating the 5-DoF\nrelative rotation and translation direction from the 1-DoF translation\nmagnitude. While scale is not observable in a monocular vision-only setting, it\nis still paramount to estimate a consistent scale over the whole trajectory\n(even if not physically accurate) to avoid AR effects moving erroneously along\ndepth. In our approach, we leverage the fact that depth errors are not\nperceivable to the user during rotation-only motion. However, as the user\nstarts translating the device, depth becomes perceivable and so does the\ncapability to estimate consistent scale. Our proposed algorithm naturally\ntransitions between these two modes. We perform extensive validations of our\ncontributions with both a publicly available dataset and synthetic data. We\nshow that the proposed pose estimator outperforms the classical approaches for\n6-DoF pose estimation used in the literature in low-parallax configurations.

In this paper we consider\nthe influence of stochastic resetting on a diffusive motion modeled in terms of\nthe non-linear differential equation. The reason for its non-linearity is the\npower-law dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the probability density\nfunction or, in another context, the concentration of particles. We briefly\noutline this issue at first to prepare the foundations for our further\nconsiderations. Then, we derive an exact formula for the mean squared\ndisplacement and demonstrate how it attains the steady-state value under the\ninfluence of exponential resetting. This mechanism brings also about that the\nspatial support of the probability density function, which for the free\nnon-linear diffusion is confined to the set of a finite measure, tends to span\nthe entire domain of real numbers. In addition, we explore the first-passage\nproperties for the non-linear diffusion intermittent by the exponential\nresetting and find analytical expressions for the mean first-passage time and\ndetermine numerically the optimal resetting rate which minimizes the mean time\nneeded for a particle to reach a pre-determined target.

Several\nmethods of combining range- and color-data have been investigated and\nsuccessfully used in various robotic applications. Most of these systems suffer\nfrom the problems of noise in the range-data and resolution mismatch between\nthe range sensor and the color cameras, since the resolution of current range\nsensors is much less than the resolution of color cameras. High-resolution\ndepth maps can be obtained using stereo matching, but this often fails to\nconstruct accurate depth maps of weakly/repetitively textured scenes, or if the\nscene exhibits complex self-occlusions. Range sensors provide coarse depth\ninformation regardless of presence/absence of texture. The use of a calibrated\nsystem, composed of a time-of-flight (TOF) camera and of a stereoscopic camera\npair, allows data fusion thus overcoming the weaknesses of both individual\nsensors. We propose a novel TOF-stereo fusion method based on an efficient\nseed-growing algorithm which uses the TOF data projected onto the stereo image\npair as an initial set of correspondences. These initial \"seeds\" are then\npropagated based on a Bayesian model which combines an image similarity score\nwith rough depth priors computed from the low-resolution range data.

In time periods with low load, the energy consumption can be reduced\nby powering down unused servers. We resort to a model introduced by Lin,\nWierman, Andrew and Thereska that considers data centers with identical\nmachines, and generalize it to heterogeneous data centers with $d$ different\nserver types. The operating cost of a server depends on its load and is modeled\nby an increasing, convex function for each server type. In contrast to earlier\nwork, we consider the discrete setting, where the number of active servers must\nbe integral. Thereby, we seek truly feasible solutions. For homogeneous data\ncenters ($d=1$), both the offline and the online problem were solved optimally\nby Albers and Quedenfeld (2018).\n  In this paper, we study heterogeneous data centers with general\ntime-dependent operating cost functions. We develop an online algorithm based\non a work function approach which achieves a competitive ratio of $2d + 1 +\n\\epsilon$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$. For time-independent operating cost\nfunctions, the competitive ratio can be reduced to $2d + 1$. There is a lower\nbound of $2d$ shown by Albers and Quedenfeld (2021), so our algorithm is nearly\noptimal. For the offline version, we give a graph-based\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm. Additionally, our offline algorithm is\nable to handle time-variable data-center sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 15:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

This may result in the merged SMBH receiving a\nrecoil kick velocity ~100 - 1000 km/s, causing it to oscillate in the\ngravitational potential of the host galaxy. The luminous quasar E1821+643,\nidentified as an SMBH recoil candidate via spectropolarimetry observations,\nshows Doppler shifting of the broad emission lines in direct and scattered\nlight, consistent with a relative velocity of 2100 km/s between the quasar\nnucleus and host galaxy. In this paper, we attempt to detect the expected\nspatial displacement using a combination of optical spectroastrometry and\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) narrow band images. The spectroastrometry reveals\na relative spatial displacement between the quasar nucleus and the gas emitting\nthe [OIII]4959,5007 lines of ~130mas (~580pc) to the North-West. Our HST images\nresolve the [OIII] emission on sub-arcsecond scales, showing that it is\nasymmetrically distributed, extending to radial distances ~0.5 - 0.6\" from the\nnucleus in a wide arc running from the North-East around to the West. A\nsimulated spectroastrometry observation based on the HST [OIII] image indicates\nthat only a small fraction of the measured displacement can be attributed to\nthe asymmetric [OIII] emission. This displacement therefore appears to be a\nreal spatial offset of the quasar nucleus with respect to the narrow-line\nregion, presumed to be located at the host galaxy center, further supporting\nthe interpretation that a post-merger gravitational recoil of the SMBH has\noccurred in E1821+643.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 15:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

HST images captured dawn\nstorms and injection events in the far ultraviolet aurora several times during\nthe observation period. Magnetic reconnection occurring in the middle\nmagnetosphere caused by internal drivers is thought to start the production of\nthose features. The field lines then dipolarize which injects hot\nmagnetospheric plasma from the reconnection site to enter the inner\nmagnetosphere. Hisaki observed an impulsive brightening in the dawnside Io\nplasma torus (IPT) during the final appearance of the dawn storms and injection\nevents which is evidence that a large-scale plasma injection penetrated the\ncentral IPT between 6-9 RJ (Jupiter radii). The extreme ultraviolet aurora\nbrightened and XMM-Newton detected an increase in the hard X-ray aurora count\nrate, suggesting an increase in electron precipitation. The dawn storms and\ninjections did not change the brightness of the soft X-ray aurora and they did\nnot \"switch-on\" its commonly observed quasi-periodic pulsations. Spectral\nanalysis of the X-ray aurora suggests that the precipitating ions responsible\nfor the soft X-ray aurora were iogenic and that a powerlaw continuum was needed\nto fit the hard X-ray part of the spectra. The spectra coincident with the dawn\nstorms and injections required two powerlaw continua to get good fits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 15:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Today,\nmany robotic platforms are equipped with high-accuracy 3D LiDAR sensors, which\nallow a geometric mapping, and cameras able to provide semantic cues of the\nenvironment. Segment-based mapping and localization have been applied with\ngreat success to 3D point-cloud data, while semantic understanding has been\nshown to improve localization performance in vision based systems. In this\npaper we combine both modalities in SemSegMap, extending SegMap into a segment\nbased mapping framework able to also leverage color and semantic data from the\nenvironment to improve localization accuracy and robustness. In particular, we\npresent new segmentation and descriptor extraction processes. The segmentation\nprocess benefits from additional distance information from color and semantic\nclass consistency resulting in more repeatable segments and more overlap after\nre-visiting a place. For the descriptor, a tight fusion approach in a\ndeep-learned descriptor extraction network is performed leading to a higher\ndescriptiveness for landmark matching. We demonstrate the advantages of this\nfusion on multiple simulated and real-world datasets and compare its\nperformance to various baselines.

Equally, we also\ncompute the x-ray excess emission resulting from the conversion of axions back\nto photons in the presence of a strong magnetic field in the envelope of these\nstars. Hence, a given star will have a unique axion spectrum and $L_a$ axion\nluminosity. And if such star has a strong magnetic field in its stellar\nenvelope, it will also show a characteristic x-ray spectrum and $L_{a\\gamma}$\nx-ray luminosity. Such radiation will add up to the x-ray electromagnetic\nspectrum and $L_X$ luminosity of the star. The present study focuses on axion\nmodels with an axion-photon coupling constant, $5\\;10^{-11} {\\rm GeV}^{-1}$, a\nvalue just below the most recent upper limit of $6.6\\;10^{-11} {\\rm GeV}^{-1}$\nfound by CAST and IAXO helioscopes.

This permits the computation of\nvolume, surface area, mean curvature, Gaussian curvature, and the\nEuler-Poincar\\'e characteristic as well as comparison of these morphometrics\nbetween structures of different topology. The structures are commonly\nrepresented implicitly in curve evolution problems as the zero level set of an\nembedding. Practically, binary images of anatomical structures are embedded\nusing a signed distance transform. However, quantization prevents the accurate\ncomputation of curvatures, leading to considerable errors in morphometry. This\npaper presents a fast, simple embedding procedure for accurate local\nmorphometry as the zero crossing of the Gaussian blurred binary image. The\nproposed method was validated based on the femur and fourth lumbar vertebrae of\n50 clinical computed tomography datasets. The results show that the signed\ndistance transform leads to large quantization errors in the computed local\ncurvature. Global validation of morphometry using regression and Bland-Altman\nanalysis revealed that the coefficient of determination for the average mean\ncurvature is improved from 93.8% with the signed distance transform to 100%\nwith the proposed method. For the surface area, the proportional bias is\nimproved from -5.0% for the signed distance transform to +0.6% for the proposed\nmethod. The Euler-Poincar\\'e characteristic is improved from unusable in the\nsigned distance transform to 98% accuracy for the proposed method. The proposed\nmethod enables an improved local and global evaluation of curvature for\npurposes of morphometry on closed, implicit surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 18:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}
