Although many centralized control methods\nexist, literature lacks decentralized control frameworks with broad\napplicability. To address this knowledge gap, we present a novel decentralized\nUAV swarm control strategy using a decision-theoretic framework called\ndecentralized Markov decision process (Dec-MDP). We build these control\nstrategies in the context of two case studies: a) swarm formation control\nproblem; b) swarm control for multitarget tracking. As most decision theoretic\nformulations suffer from the curse of dimensionality, we adapt an approximate\ndynamic programming method called nominal belief-state optimization (NBO) to\nsolve the decentralized control problems approximately in both the case\nstudies. In the formation control case study, the objective is to drive the\nswarm from a geographical region to another geographical region where the swarm\nmust form a certain geometrical shape (e.g., selected location on the surface\nof a sphere). The motivation for studying such problems comes from data fusion\napplications with UAV swarms where the fusion performance depends on the\nstrategic relative separation of the UAVs from each other. In the target\ntracking case study, the objective is the control the motion of the UAVs in a\ndecentralized manner while maximizing the overall target tracking performance.\nMotivation for this case study comes from the surveillance applications using\nUAV swarms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 07:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

We find a universal way to describe the mass and current quadrupole\ngravitational waves emitted by these systems during the merger and ringdown\nstage: (i) The time evolutions of these waves are insensitive to the\nprogenitor's parameters (spins) after being normalized by their own peak\nvalues. (ii) The peak values, which encode all the spin information of the\nprogenitor, can be consistently fitted to formulas inspired by post-Newtonian\ntheory. We find that the universal evolution of the mass quadrupole wave can be\naccurately modeled by the so-called Backwards One-Body (BOB) model. However,\nthe BOB model, in its present form, leads to a lower waveform match and a\nsignificant parameter-estimation bias for the current quadrupole wave. We also\ndecompose the ringdown signal into seven overtones, and study the dependence of\nmode amplitudes on the progenitor's parameters. Such dependence is found to be\ninsensitive to the overtone index (up to a scaling factor). Finally, we use the\nFisher matrix technique to investigate how the ringdown waveform can be at\nleast as important for parameter estimation as the inspiral stage. Assuming the\nCosmic Explorer, we find the contribution of ringdown portion dominates as the\ntotal mass exceeds ~ 250 solar mass. For massive BBH systems, the accuracy of\nparameter measurement is improved by incorporating the information of ringdown\n-- the ringdown sector gives rise to a different parameter correlation from\ninspiral stage, hence the overall parameter correlation is reduced in the full\nsignal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 18:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

The key idea advocated for\nin this article is that the \"correct\" notion of positivity on a *-algebra $A$\nis not necessarily the algebraic one whose positive elements are the sums of\nHermitian squares $a^* a$ with $a \\in A$, but can be a more general one that\ndepends on the example at hand, like pointwise positivity on *-algebras of\nfunctions or positivity in a representation as operators. The notion of states\n(normalized positive Hermitian linear functionals) on $A$ thus depends on this\nchoice of positivity on $A$, and the notion of positivity on the reduced\nalgebra $A_{red}$ should be such that states on $A_{red}$ are obtained as\nreductions of certain states on $A$. In the special case of the *-algebra of\nsmooth functions on a Poisson manifold $M$, this reduction scheme reproduces\nthe coisotropic reduction of $M$, where the reduced manifold $M_{red}$ is just\na geometric manifestation of the reduction of the evaluation functionals\nassociated to certain points of $M$.

To avoid transaction\ngridlock, public blockchains impose large fees and per-block resource limits,\nmaking it difficult to accommodate the ever-growing transaction demand.\nPrevious research endeavors to improve the scalability of blockchain through\nvarious technologies, such as side-chaining, sharding, secured off-chain\ncomputation, communication network optimizations, and efficient consensus\nprotocols. However, these approaches have not attained a widespread adoption\ndue to their inability in delivering a cloud-like performance, in terms of the\nscalability in transaction throughput, storage, and compute capacity. In this\nwork, we determine that the major obstacle to public blockchain scalability is\ntheir underlying unstructured P2P networks. We further show that a centralized\nnetwork can support the deployment of decentralized smart contracts. We propose\na novel approach for achieving scalable decentralization: instead of trying to\nmake blockchain scalable, we deliver decentralization to already scalable cloud\nby using an Ethereum smart contract.

For convenience, we shall refer to such an\nestimator as a deep quantile regression (DQR) estimator. We show that the DQR\nestimator achieves the nonparametric optimal convergence rate up to a\nlogarithmic factor determined by the intrinsic dimension of the underlying\ncompositional structure of the conditional quantile function, not the ambient\ndimension of the predictor. Therefore, DQR is able to mitigate the curse of\ndimensionality under the assumption that the conditional quantile function has\na compositional structure. To establish these results, we analyze the\napproximation error of a composite function by neural networks and show that\nthe error rate only depends on the dimensions of the component functions. We\napply our general results to several important statistical models often used in\nmitigating the curse of dimensionality, including the single index, the\nadditive, the projection pursuit, the univariate composite, and the generalized\nhierarchical interaction models.

In this\nwork, we propose a radio frequency (RF) based UAV detection and identification\nsystem by exploiting signals emanating from both the UAV and its flight\ncontroller, respectively. While several RF devices (i.e., Bluetooth and WiFi\ndevices) operate in the same frequency band as UAVs, the proposed framework\nutilizes a semi-supervised learning approach for the detection of UAV or UAV's\ncontrol signals in the presence of other wireless signals such as Bluetooth and\nWiFi. The semi-supervised learning approach uses stacked denoising autoencoder\nand local outlier factor algorithms. After the detection of UAV or UAV's\ncontrol signals, the signal is decomposed by using Hilbert-Huang transform and\nwavelet packet transform to extract features from the time-frequency-energy\ndomain of the signal. The extracted feature sets are used to train a\nthree-level hierarchical classifier for identifying the type of signals (i.e.,\nUAV or UAV control signal), UAV models, and flight mode of UAV. To demonstrate\nthe feasibility of the proposed framework, we carried out an outdoor experiment\nfor data collection using six UAVs, five Bluetooth devices, and two WiFi\ndevices.

The most studied violation of ensemble\nequivalence requires phase transitions, in which case it has a `restricted'\n(i.e. confined to a certain region in parameter space) but `strong' (i.e.\ncharacterized by a difference between the entropies of the two ensembles that\nis of the same order as the entropies themselves) form. However, recent\nresearch on networks has shown that the presence of an extensive number of\nlocal constraints can lead to ensemble nonequivalence even in the absence of\nphase transitions. This occurs in a `weak' (i.e. leading to a subleading\nentropy difference) but remarkably `unrestricted' (i.e. valid in the entire\nparameter space) form.

To capture\nsuch information, we observe that RAQs can be represented by query functions,\nwhich are functions that take a query instance (i.e., a specific RAQ) as an\ninput and output its corresponding answer. Using this representation, we\nformulate the problem of learning to approximate the query function, and\npropose NeuroDB, a query specialized neural network framework, that answers\nRAQs efficiently. NeuroDB is query-type agnostic (i.e., it does not make any\nassumption about the underlying query type) and our observation that queries\ncan be represented by functions is not specific to RAQs. Thus, we investigate\nwhether NeuroDB can be used for other query types, by applying it to distance\nto nearest neighbour queries. We experimentally show that NeuroDB outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art for this query type, often by orders of magnitude.\nMoreover, the same neural network architecture as for RAQs is used, bringing to\nlight the possibility of using a generic framework to answer any query type\nefficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 22:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

The problem is challenging due to two main reasons.\nFirst, the traffic events are stochastic, both temporally and spatially.\nSecond, the problem has a non-homogeneous structure as the traffic events\narrive at different locations of the road network at different rates.\nAccordingly, some locations require more visits by the robots compared to other\nlocations. To address these issues, we define an uncertainty metric for each\nlocation of the road network and formulate a path planning problem for the\naerial robots to minimize the network's average uncertainty. We express this\nproblem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose a\ndistributed and scalable algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to\nsolve it. We consider two different scenarios depending on the communication\nmode between the agents (aerial robots) and the traffic management center\n(TMC). The first scenario assumes that the agents continuously communicate with\nthe TMC to send/receive real-time information about the traffic events. Hence,\nthe agents have global and real-time knowledge of the environment. However, in\nthe second scenario, we consider a challenging setting where the observation of\nthe aerial robots is partial and limited to their sensing ranges. Moreover, in\ncontrast to the first scenario, the information exchange between the aerial\nrobots and the TMC is restricted to specific time instances. We evaluate the\nperformance of our proposed algorithm in both scenarios for a real road network\ntopology and demonstrate its functionality in a traffic monitoring system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 22:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Automating steerable needle procedures can enable physicians and patients\nto harness the full potential of steerable needles by maximally leveraging\ntheir steerability to safely and accurately reach targets for medical\nprocedures such as biopsies and localized therapy delivery for cancer. For the\nautomation of medical procedures to be clinically accepted, it is critical from\na patient care, safety, and regulatory perspective to certify the correctness\nand effectiveness of the motion planning algorithms involved in procedure\nautomation. In this paper, we take an important step toward creating a\ncertifiable motion planner for steerable needles. We introduce the first motion\nplanner for steerable needles that offers a guarantee, under clinically\nappropriate assumptions, that it will, in finite time, compute an exact,\nobstacle-avoiding motion plan to a specified target, or notify the user that no\nsuch plan exists. We present an efficient, resolution-complete motion planner\nfor steerable needles based on a novel adaptation of multi-resolution planning.\nCompared to state-of-the-art steerable needle motion planners (none of which\nprovide any completeness guarantees), we demonstrate that our new\nresolution-complete motion planner computes plans faster and with a higher\nsuccess rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 02:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Although it is well\nknown that pipelined HotStuff is secure against up to $1/3$ of Byzantine nodes,\nits performance in terms of throughput and delay is still under-explored. In\nthis paper, we develop a multi-metric evaluation framework to quantitatively\nanalyze pipelined \\mbox{HotStuff's performance} with respect to its chain\ngrowth rate, chain quality, and latency. We then propose two attack strategies\nand evaluate their effects on the performance of pipelined HotStuff.

Node initial opinions are independently\nand identically distributed; at each time step, nodes review the average\nopinions of a randomly selected local clique. The clique averages may represent\nlocal group pressures on peers. Then nodes update their opinions under bounded\nconfidence: only when the difference between an agent individual opinion and\nthe corresponding local clique pressure is below a threshold, this agent\nopinion is updated according to the DeGroot rule as a weighted average of the\ntwo values. As a result, this opinion dynamics is a generalization of the\nclassical Deffuant-Weisbuch model in which only pairwise interactions take\nplace. First of all, we prove conditions under which all node opinions converge\nto finite limits. We show that in the limits the event that all nodes achieve a\nconsensus, and the event that all nodes achieve pairwise distinct limits, i.e.,\nsocial disagreements, are both nontrivial events. Next, we show that opinion\nfluctuations may take place in the sense that at least one agent in the network\nfails to hold a converging opinion trajectory. In fact, we prove that this\nfluctuation event happens with a strictly positive probability, and also\nconstructively present an initial value event under which the fluctuation event\narises with probability one. These results add to the understanding of the role\nof bounded confidence in social opinion dynamics, and the possibility of\nfluctuation reveals that bringing in cliques in Deffuant-Weisbuch models have\nfundamentally changed the behavior of such opinion dynamical processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 02:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Different types of uncertainty sets have been proposed that\nmodel uncertainty from various perspectives. Among them, polyhedral uncertainty\nsets are widely used due to their simplicity and flexible structure to model\nthe underlying uncertainty. However, the conventional polyhedral uncertainty\nsets present certain disadvantages; some are too conservative while others lead\nto computationally expensive RO models. This paper proposes a systematic\napproach to develop data-driven polyhedral uncertainty sets that mitigate these\ndrawbacks. The proposed uncertainty sets are polytopes induced by a given set\nof scenarios, capture correlation information between uncertain parameters, and\nallow for direct trade-offs between tractability and conservativeness issue of\nconventional polyhedral uncertainty sets. To develop these uncertainty sets, we\nuse principal component analysis (PCA) to transform the correlated scenarios\ninto their uncorrelated principal components and to shrink the uncertainty\nspace dimensionality. Thus, decision-makers can use the number of the leading\nprincipal components as a tool to trade-off tractability, conservativeness, and\nrobustness of RO models. We quantify the quality of the lower bound of a static\nRO problem with a scenario-induced uncertainty set by deriving a theoretical\nbound on the optimality gap. Additionally, we derive probabilistic guarantees\nfor the performance of the proposed scenario-induced uncertainty sets by\ndeveloping explicit lower bounds on the number of scenarios. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed uncertainty sets to\ntrade-off tractability, robustness, and conservativeness by examining a range\nof knapsack and power grid problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 06:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Under certain assumptions it allows scientists to explain\nphenomena, predict, and make decisions. In the large sample limit, sound and\ncomplete causal discovery algorithms have been previously introduced, where a\ndirected acyclic graph (DAG), or its equivalence class, representing causal\nrelations is searched. However, in real-world cases, only finite training data\nis available, which limits the power of statistical tests used by these\nalgorithms, leading to errors in the inferred causal model. This is commonly\naddressed by devising a strategy for using as few as possible statistical\ntests. In this paper, we introduce such a strategy in the form of a recursive\nwrapper for existing constraint-based causal discovery algorithms, which\npreserves soundness and completeness. It recursively clusters the observed\nvariables using the normalized min-cut criterion from the outset, and uses a\nbaseline causal discovery algorithm during backtracking for learning local\nsub-graphs. It then combines them and ensures completeness. By an ablation\nstudy, using synthetic data, and by common real-world benchmarks, we\ndemonstrate that our approach requires significantly fewer statistical tests,\nlearns more accurate graphs, and requires shorter run-times than the baseline\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 09:24:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

This concept has been adopted by Time-Sensitive Networking\n(TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet). An appealing property of\ninterleaved shaping is that, when an interleaved shaper is appended to a FIFO\nsystem, it does not increase the worst-case delay of the system. Based on this\n\"shaping-for-free\" property, an approach has been introduced to deliver bounded\nend-to-end latency. Specifically, at each output link of a node, class-based\naggregate scheduling is used together with one interleaved shaper per-input\nlink and per-class, and the interleaved shaper re-shapes every flow to its\ninitial traffic constraint. In this paper, we investigate other properties of\ninterleaved LRQ shapers, particularly as stand-alone elements. In addition,\nunder per-flow setting, we also investigate per-flow LRQ based flow aggregation\nand derive its properties. The analysis focuses directly on the timing of\noperations, such as shaping and scheduling, in the network. This timing based\nmethod can be found in the Guaranteed Rate (GR) server model and more generally\nthe max-plus branch of network calculus. With the derived properties, we not\nonly show that an improved end-to-end latency bound can be obtained for the\ncurrent approach, but also demonstrate with two examples that new approaches\nmay be devised. End-to-end delay bounds for the three approaches are derived\nand compared. As a highlight, the two new approaches do not require different\nnode architectures in allocating (shaping / scheduling) queues, which implies\nthat they can be readily adapted for use in TSN and DetNet. This together with\nthe derived properties of LRQ shed new insights on providing the TSN / DetNet\nqualities of service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 10:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

To overcome\nthis, the recent popular network pruning is an effective method to reduce the\nredundancy of the models. However, the ranking of filters according to their\n\"importance\" on different pruning criteria may be inconsistent. One filter\ncould be important according to a certain criterion, while it is unnecessary\naccording to another one, which indicates that each criterion is only a partial\nview of the comprehensive \"importance\". From this motivation, we propose a\nnovel framework to integrate the existing filter pruning criteria by exploring\nthe criteria diversity. The proposed framework contains two stages: Criteria\nClustering and Filters Importance Calibration. First, we condense the pruning\ncriteria via layerwise clustering based on the rank of \"importance\" score.\nSecond, within each cluster, we propose a calibration factor to adjust their\nsignificance for each selected blending candidates and search for the optimal\nblending criterion via Evolutionary Algorithm.

A popular\ntheory for explaining why SGD works well in practice is that the algorithm has\nan implicit regularization that biases its output towards a good solution.\nPerhaps the theoretically most well understood learning setting for SGD is that\nof Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO), where it is well known that SGD learns\nat a rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of samples. In this\npaper, we consider the problem of SCO and explore the role of implicit\nregularization, batch size and multiple epochs for SGD. Our main contributions\nare threefold:\n  (a) We show that for any regularizer, there is an SCO problem for which\nRegularized Empirical Risk Minimzation fails to learn. This automatically rules\nout any implicit regularization based explanation for the success of SGD.\n  (b) We provide a separation between SGD and learning via Gradient Descent on\nempirical loss (GD) in terms of sample complexity.

The\nUGKWP is an appropriate method for the capturing of the multiscale transport\nmechanism in the particle phase through its coupled wave-particle formulation.\nIn the regime with intensive particle collision, the evolution of solid\nparticle will be followed by the analytic wave with quasi-equilibrium\ndistribution; while in the rarefied regime the non-equilibrium particle phase\nwill be captured through particle tracking and collision, which plays a\ndecisive role in recovering particle trajectory crossing behavior.

The obtained simple formulas in cylindrical and spherical coordinates\nallow us to quickly find the external and central magnetic field of rotating\nbodies on the rotation axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 13:07:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

As one of its\napplications, we derive here the final detected intensity signal arising from a\nprototypical laser interferometric gravitational wave (GW) Michelson-Morley\ndetector, comoving with transverse traceless (TT) observers, valid for both\nlong and short GW wavelengths. One of our main results is the presentation of\nthe integrated null geodesic parametric equations exchanged between two TT\nobservers in terms of explicitly observable quantities and the profile of the\nplane GW packet. This allows us to revisit the derivation of the consequential\nradar distance and Doppler shift, taking the opportunity to discuss some\nrelated subtle conceptual issues and how they might affect the interferometric\nprocess. Another achievement is the calculation of the electric field in each\narm up to the detection event, for any relative orientations of the arms and\nthe GW direction. The main quantitative result is the new expression for the\nfinal interference pattern, for normal GW incidence, which turns out to have\nthree contributions: (i) the well-known traditional one due to the difference\nin optical paths, and two new ones due to (ii) the Doppler effect, and (iii)\nthe divergence of the laser beams. The quantitative relevance of the last two\ncontributions is compared to the traditional one and shown to be negligible\nwithin the geometrical optics regime of light. Although in general further\ncontributions from the non-parallel transport of the polarization vector are\nexpected, again in the case of GW normal incidence, such a vector is indeed\nparallel transported, and those contributions are absent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 13:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-27"}
