To achieve the best results on a broad spectrum\nof scattering conditions, individual \"expert\" networks need to be trained for\neach condition. However, the expert's performance sharply degrades when the\ntesting condition differs from the training. An alternative brute-force\napproach is to train a \"generalist\" network using data from diverse scattering\nconditions. It generally requires a larger network to encapsulate the diversity\nin the data and a sufficiently large training set to avoid overfitting. Here,\nwe propose an adaptive learning framework, termed dynamic synthesis network\n(DSN), which dynamically adjusts the model weights and adapts to different\nscattering conditions. The adaptability is achieved by a novel \"mixture of\nexperts\" architecture that enables dynamically synthesizing a network by\nblending multiple experts using a gating network. We demonstrate the DSN in\nholographic 3D particle imaging for a variety of scattering conditions. We show\nin simulation that our DSN provides generalization across a continuum of\nscattering conditions. In addition, we show that by training the DSN entirely\non simulated data, the network can generalize to experiments and achieve robust\n3D descattering. We expect the same concept can find many other applications,\nsuch as denoising and imaging in scattering media. Broadly, our dynamic\nsynthesis framework opens up a new paradigm for designing highly adaptive deep\nlearning and computational imaging techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 17:36:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 02:40:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

Weak values of\nproduct observables (commuting) or higher moments of an observable are\ninformationally important in the sense that they are useful to resolve some\nparadoxes, realize strange quantum effects, reconstruct density matrices, etc.\nIn this work, we show that it is possible to access the higher moment weak\nvalues of an observable using weak values of that observable with pairwise\northogonal post-selections. Although the higher moment weak values of an\nobservable are inaccessible with Gaussian pointer states, our method allows any\npointer state. We have calculated product weak values in a bipartite system for\nany given pure and mixed pre selected states. Such product weak values can be\nobtained using only the measurements of local weak values (which are defined as\nsingle system weak values in a multi-partite system). As an application, we use\nhigher moment weak values and product weak values to reconstruct unknown\nquantum states of single and bipartite systems, respectively. Further, we give\na necessary separability criteria for finite dimensional systems using product\nweak values and certain class of entangled states violate this inequality by\ncleverly choosing the product observables and the post selections.

D 104, 082004 (2021)","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.104.082004","report-no":"LIGO-P2000334-v9","categories":"gr-qc astro-ph.HE","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","abstract":"  We report on an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves in the\nfrequency band 20-2000\\,Hz and with a frequency time derivative in the range of\n$[-1.0, +0.1]\\times10^{-8}$\\,Hz/s. Such a signal could be produced by a nearby,\nspinning and slightly non-axisymmetric isolated neutron star in our galaxy.\nThis search uses the LIGO data from the first six months of Advanced LIGO's and\nAdvanced Virgo's third observational run, O3. No periodic gravitational wave\nsignals are observed, and 95\\%\\ confidence-level (CL) frequentist upper limits\nare placed on their strengths. The lowest upper limits on worst-case (linearly\npolarized) strain amplitude $h_0$ are $~1.7\\times10^{-25}$ near 200\\,Hz.

NS allows network operators\n(NOs) to divide the available network resources into multiple logical NSs for\nproviding dedicated virtual networks tailored to the specific service/business\nrequirements. MEC enables NOs to provide diverse ultra-low latency services for\nsupporting the needs of different industry verticals by moving computing\nfacilities to the network edge. NS can be constructed by instantiating a set of\nvirtual network functions (VNFs) on top of MEC cloud servers for provisioning\ndiverse latency-sensitive communication services (e.g., autonomous driving and\naugmented reality) on demand at a lesser cost and time. However, VNFs, MEC\ncloud servers, and communication links are subject to failures due to software\nbugs, misconfiguration, overloading, hardware faults, cyber attacks, power\noutage, and natural/man-made disaster. Failure of a critical network component\ndisrupts services abruptly and leads to users' dissatisfaction, which may\nresult in revenue loss for the NOs. In this paper, we present a novel approach\nbased on multi-connectivity in 5G networks to tackle this problem and our\nproposed approach is resilient against i) failure of VNFs, ii) failure of local\nservers within MEC, iii) failure of communication links, and iv) failure of an\nentire MEC cloud facility in regional level.

Incorporated with these designs and a hierarchical structure, CSWin\nTransformer demonstrates competitive performance on common vision tasks.\nSpecifically, it achieves 85.4\\% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any\nextra training data or label, 53.9 box AP and 46.4 mask AP on the COCO\ndetection task, and 52.2 mIOU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task,\nsurpassing previous state-of-the-art Swin Transformer backbone by +1.2, +2.0,\n+1.4, and +2.0 respectively under the similar FLOPs setting. By further\npretraining on the larger dataset ImageNet-21K, we achieve 87.5% Top-1 accuracy\non ImageNet-1K and high segmentation performance on ADE20K with 55.7 mIoU.

We propose a novel statistical method\ncapable of disentangling the 4-top signal from the dominant backgrounds in the\nsame-sign dilepton channel, while simultaneously correcting for possible MC\nimperfections in modelling of the most relevant discriminating observables --\nthe jet multiplicity distributions. A Bayesian mixture of multinomials is used\nto model the light-jet and $b$-jet multiplicities under the assumption of their\nconditional independence. The signal and background distributions generated\nfrom a deliberately mistuned MC simulator are used as model priors.

For instance, they provide realizations of\ndiscrete time crystals, where the discrete time translation symmetry of the\nperiodic Hamiltonian is spontaneously broken by a subharmonic response of the\nsystem. However, the continuous presence of an external periodic driving is\nrequired within the current Floquet paradigm. We propose here the concept of\nspontaneous many-body Floquet state. This is a state that, in the absence of\nexternal periodic driving, self-oscillates like in the presence of a periodic\nHamiltonian, this behavior being spontaneously induced by many-body\ninteractions. In addition, its quantum fluctuations are described by regular\nFloquet theory. Furthermore, it is also a time crystal, presenting long-range\ntime-periodic order. However, this crystalline behavior is very different to\nthat of conventional Floquet discrete time crystals: here, there is no external\nperiodic driving, energy is conserved, and the nature of the spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking is continuous instead of discrete. We demonstrate that\nspontaneous many-body Floquet states can emerge in a variety of canonical\nmany-body problems, ranging from interacting fermions to Bose-Hubbard models.\nWe specifically show that a spontaneous many-body Floquet state is a universal\nintrinsic state of a one-dimensional flowing atom condensate, both subsonic and\nsupersonic, resulting from a dynamical phase transition and robust against\nexternal perturbations and quantum fluctuations, proposing also realistic\nexperimental scenarios for its observation.

Suppose we are given a sequence of $n$ points $(s_1,s_2,\\ldots,\ns_n)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where point $s_i$ is presented in step~$i$ for\n$i=1,\\ldots, n$. The objective of an online algorithm is to maintain a\ngeometric $t$-spanner on $S_i=\\{s_1,\\ldots, s_i\\}$ for each step~$i$.\n  First, we establish a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log n / \\log\n\\varepsilon^{-1})$ for the competitive ratio of any online\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-spanner algorithm, for a sequence of $n$ points in\n1-dimension. We show that this bound is tight, and there is an online algorithm\nthat can maintain a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-spanner with competitive ratio\n$O(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log n / \\log \\varepsilon^{-1})$. Next, we design online\nalgorithms for sequences of points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, for any constant $d\\ge\n2$, under the $L_2$ norm. We show that previously known incremental algorithms\nachieve a competitive ratio $O(\\varepsilon^{-(d+1)}\\log n)$. However, if the\nalgorithm is allowed to use additional points (Steiner points), then it is\npossible to substantially improve the competitive ratio in terms of\n$\\varepsilon$. We describe an online Steiner $(1+\\varepsilon)$-spanner\nalgorithm with competitive ratio $O(\\varepsilon^{(1-d)/2} \\log n)$. As a\ncounterpart, we show that the dependence on $n$ cannot be eliminated in\ndimensions $d \\ge 2$. In particular, we prove that any online spanner algorithm\nfor a sequence of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ under the $L_2$ norm has\ncompetitive ratio $\\Omega(f(n))$, where $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\n\\infty}f(n)=\\infty$.

However, extracting IBIs from noisy signals is\nchallenging since the morphology of the signal is distorted in the presence of\nthe noise. Electrocardiogram (ECG) of a person in heavy motion is highly\ncorrupted with noise, known as motion-artifact, and IBI extracted from it is\ninaccurate. As a part of remote health monitoring and wearable system\ndevelopment, denoising ECG signals and estimating IBIs correctly from them have\nbecome an emerging topic among signal-processing researchers. Apart from\nconventional methods, deep-learning techniques have been successfully used in\nsignal denoising recently, and diagnosis process has become easier, leading to\naccuracy levels that were previously unachievable. We propose a deep-learning\napproach leveraging tiramisu autoencoder model to suppress motion-artifact\nnoise and make the R-peaks of the ECG signal prominent even in the presence of\nhigh-intensity motion. After denoising, IBIs are estimated more accurately\nexpediting diagnosis tasks. Results illustrate that our method enables IBI\nestimation from noisy ECG signals with SNR up to -30dB with average root mean\nsquare error (RMSE) of 13 milliseconds for estimated IBIs. At this noise level,\nour error percentage remains below 8% and outperforms other state of the art\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 18:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-05"}

However, current\n3D-printed IMRT methods suffer from complex modulation patterns leading to long\ndelivery times, excess filament usage, and inaccurate compensator fabrication.\nIn this work, we have developed a total variation regularization (TVR) approach\nto address these issues.\n  Methods: TVR-IMRT, a technique designed to minimize the intensity difference\nbetween neighboring beamlets, was used to optimize the beamlet intensity map,\nwhich was then converted to corresponding compensator thicknesses in\ncopper-doped PLA filament.

One way of\nprioritizing species is to consider their \"evolutionary distinctiveness\", i.e.\ntheir relative evolutionary isolation on a phylogenetic tree. Several\nevolutionary isolation metrics or phylogenetic diversity indices have been\nintroduced in the literature, among them the so-called Fair Proportion index\n(also known as the \"evolutionary distinctiveness\" score). This index apportions\nthe total diversity of a tree among all leaves, thereby providing a simple\nprioritization criterion for conservation.\n  Here, we focus on the prioritization order obtained from the Fair Proportion\nindex and analyze the effects of species extinction on this ranking. More\nprecisely, we analyze the extent to which the ranking order may change when\nsome species go extinct and the Fair Proportion index is re-computed for the\nremaining taxa. We show that for each phylogenetic tree, there are edge lengths\nsuch that the extinction of one leaf per cherry completely reverses the\nranking. Moreover, we show that even if only the lowest ranked species goes\nextinct, the ranking order may drastically change. We end by analyzing the\neffects of these two extinction scenarios (extinction of the lowest ranked\nspecies and extinction of one leaf per cherry) for a collection of empirical\nand simulated trees. In both cases, we can observe significant changes in the\nprioritization orders, highlighting the empirical relevance of our theoretical\nfindings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 21:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-05"}

An example of a\nconceptual model is a description developed using the Unified Modeling Language\n(UML). UML uses a model multiplicity formulation approach, wherein a number of\nmodels are used to represent alternative views. By contrast, a model\nsingularity approach uses only a single integrated model. Each of these styles\nof modeling has its strengths and weaknesses. This paper introduces a partial\nsolution to the issue of multiplicity vs. singularity in modeling by adopting\nUML use cases and class models into the conceptual thinging machine (TM) model.\nTo apply use cases, we adopt the observation that a use-case diagram is a\ndescription that shows the internal structure of the part of the system\nrepresented by the use case in addition to being useful to people outside of\nthe system. Additionally, the UML class diagram is recast in TM representation.\nAccordingly, we develop a TMUML model that embraces the TM specification of the\nUML class diagram and the internal structure extracted from the UML use case.\nTMUML modeling introduces some of the advantages that have made UML a popular\nmodeling language to TM modeling. At the same time, this approach supplies UML\nwith partial model singularity. The paper details experimentation with TMUML\nusing examples from the literature.

Clearance of the hypnozoite reservoir through drug treatment (radical\ncure) has been proposed as a potential tool for the elimination of P. vivax\nmalaria. Here, we introduce a stochastic, within-host model to jointly\ncharacterise hypnozoite and infection dynamics for an individual in a general\ntransmission setting, allowing for radical cure. We begin by extending an\nexisting activation-clearance model for a single hypnozoite, adapted to both\nshort- and long-latency strains, to include drug treatment. We then embed this\nactivation-clearance model in an epidemiological framework accounting for\nrepeated mosquito inoculation and the administration of radical cure. By\nconstructing an open network of infinite server queues, we derive analytic\nexpressions for several quantities of epidemiological significance, including\nthe size of the hypnozoite reservoir; the relative contribution of relapses to\nthe infection burden; the distribution of multiple infections; the cumulative\nnumber of recurrences over time, and the time to first recurrence following\ndrug treatment. By deriving, rather than assuming parameteric forms, we\ncharacterise the transient dynamics of the hypnozoite reservoir following\nradical cure more accurately than previous approaches. To yield\npopulation-level insights, our analytic within-host distributions can be\nembedded in multiscale models.

Given this property, one may be tempted to surmise that a collection\nof neural nets is capable of learning any SCM by training on data generated by\nthat SCM. In this paper, we show this is not the case by disentangling the\nnotions of expressivity and learnability. Specifically, we show that the causal\nhierarchy theorem (Thm. 1, Bareinboim et al., 2020), which describes the limits\nof what can be learned from data, still holds for neural models.

The results\ndemonstrate that crystal defects, such as dislocations, are instrumental in\ninitiating the process of phase separation in strained metastable layers.\nMatrix regions, close to the dislocations, show clear signs of compositional\ndegradation only after a relatively short time from disrupting the local\nequilibrium.

The cross-view matching task is extremely\nchallenging due to drastic appearance and geometry differences across views.\nUnlike existing methods that predominantly fall back on CNN, here we devise a\nnovel evolving geo-localization Transformer (EgoTR) that utilizes the\nproperties of self-attention in Transformer to model global dependencies, thus\nsignificantly decreasing visual ambiguities in cross-view geo-localization. We\nalso exploit the positional encoding of Transformer to help the EgoTR\nunderstand and correspond geometric configurations between ground and aerial\nimages. Compared to state-of-the-art methods that impose strong assumption on\ngeometry knowledge, the EgoTR flexibly learns the positional embeddings through\nthe training objective and hence becomes more practical in many real-world\nscenarios. Although Transformer is well suited to our task, its vanilla\nself-attention mechanism independently interacts within image patches in each\nlayer, which overlooks correlations between layers. Instead, this paper propose\na simple yet effective self-cross attention mechanism to improve the quality of\nlearned representations. The self-cross attention models global dependencies\nbetween adjacent layers, which relates between image patches while modeling how\nfeatures evolve in the previous layer. As a result, the proposed self-cross\nattention leads to more stable training, improves the generalization ability\nand encourages representations to keep evolving as the network goes deeper.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our EgoTR performs favorably against\nstate-of-the-art methods on standard, fine-grained and cross-dataset cross-view\ngeo-localization tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 05:33:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2021 02:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

Although a\nsession can usually reflect a user's current preference, a local shift of the\nuser's intention within the session may still exist. Specifically, the\ninteractions that take place in the early positions within a session generally\nindicate the user's initial intention, while later interactions are more likely\nto represent the latest intention. Such positional information has been rarely\nconsidered in existing methods, which restricts their ability to capture the\nsignificance of interactions at different positions. To thoroughly exploit the\npositional information within a session, a theoretical framework is developed\nin this paper to provide an in-depth analysis of the positional information. We\nformally define the properties of forward-awareness and backward-awareness to\nevaluate the ability of positional encoding schemes in capturing the initial\nand the latest intention. According to our analysis, existing positional\nencoding schemes are generally forward-aware only, which can hardly represent\nthe dynamics of the intention in a session. To enhance the positional encoding\nscheme for the session-based recommendation, a dual positional encoding (DPE)\nis proposed to account for both forward-awareness and backward-awareness.

Raising the magnetic field strength above a threshold, the\nparticles can go beyond the traditional synchronous-rotation and\nasynchronous-oscillation modes, and into a scenario of large-area circular\nmotion. This results in peculiar retrograde locomotion related to the\nmagnetization maxima of the microparticle. Our finding suggests the important\nrole of the microparticle's magnetic morphology in the controlled transport of\nmicroparticles and developing smart micro-actuators and micro-robot devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 06:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

The edge weights of the collaborative\ngraph reflect the importance of each predictor.

In this paper, we thus investigate the\nflow-rate fairness of video conferencing congestion control at the example of\nZoom and influences of deploying AQM. We find that Zoom is slow to react to\nbandwidth changes and uses two to three times the bandwidth of TCP in\nlow-bandwidth scenarios. Moreover, also when competing with delay aware\ncongestion control such as BBR, we see high queuing delays. AQM reduces these\nqueuing delays and can equalize the bandwidth use when used with flow-queuing.\nHowever, it then introduces high packet loss for Zoom, leaving the question how\ndelay and loss affect Zoom's QoE. We hence show a preliminary user study in the\nappendix which indicates that the QoE is at least not improved and should be\nstudied further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 08:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-05"}

The scheme offers computations like addition, multiplication,\nand division to be performed directly on secret shared data (the cipher text\nversion of the data).

The drawback with the proposed scheme is that it is not\nperfectly secure.

A newly\nemerging method from the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), namely\nReinforcement Learning (RL), offers promise in finding optimal solutions while\naccommodating more realistic problem features. Unlike analytical-based models,\nRL treats the problem as a black-box simulation environment mitigating against\nthe problem of oversimplifying reality. As such, assumptions on stock keeping\npolicy can be relaxed and a higher number of problem variables can be\naccommodated. While RL has been popular in other domains, its applications in\nsafety stock optimisation remain scarce. In this paper, we investigate three RL\nmethods, namely, Q-Learning, Temporal Difference Advantage Actor-Critic and\nMulti-agent Temporal Difference Advantage Actor-Critic for optimising safety\nstock in a linear chain of independent agents. We find that RL can\nsimultaneously optimise both safety stock level and order quantity parameters\nof an inventory policy, unlike classical safety stock optimisation models where\nonly safety stock level is optimised while order quantity is predetermined\nbased on simple rules. This allows RL to model more complex supply chain\nprocurement behaviour.

We theoretically study a simple\nmodel for such bath, where two particles are coupled via a sinusoidal\npotential. This model, which is an extension of the famous Prandtl Tomlinson\nmodel, has been found to reproduce some aspects of recent experiments, such as\nshear-thinning and position oscillations [J. Chem. Phys. {\\bf 154}, 184904\n(2021)]. Analyzing this model in detail, we show that the predicted behavior of\nposition oscillations agrees qualitatively with experimentally observed trends;\n(i) oscillations appear only in a certain regime of velocity and trap stiffness\nof the confining potential, and (ii), the amplitude and frequency of\noscillations increase with driving velocity, the latter in a linear fashion.\nIncreasing the potential barrier height of the model yields a rupture\ntransition as a function of driving velocity, where the system abruptly changes\nfrom a mildly driven state to a strongly driven state. The frequency of\noscillations scales as $(v_0-v_0^*)^{1/2}$ near the rupture velocity $v_0^*$,\nfound for infinite trap stiffness. Investigating the (micro-)viscosity for\ndifferent parameter ranges, we note that position oscillations leave their\nsignature by an additional (mild) plateau in the flow curves, suggesting that\noscillations influence the micro-viscosity. For a time-modulated driving, the\nmean friction force of the driven particle shows a pronounced resonance\nbehavior, i.e, it changes strongly as a function of driving frequency. The\nmodel has two known limits: For infinite trap stiffness, it can be mapped to\ndiffusion in a tilted periodic potential. For infinite bath friction, the\noriginal Prandtl Tomlinson model is recovered. We find that the flow curve of\nthe model (roughly) crosses over between these two limiting cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 10:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

The sphere packing density maximization problem is\nknown to have a solution among well-rounded lattices, of which the integer\nlattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ is the simplest example. The integer lattice is also an\nexample of a generic well-rounded lattice, i.e., a well-rounded lattice with a\nminimal kissing number. However, the integer lattice has the worst density\namong well-rounded lattices. In this paper, the problem of constructing\nexplicit generic well-rounded lattices with dense sphere packings is\nconsidered. To this end, so-called tame lattices recently introduced by Damir\net al. are utilized. Tame lattices came to be as a generalization of the ring\nof integers of certain abelian number fields.

Firstly, they always assume image noise obeys\nan independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian or Laplacian\ndistribution, which largely underestimates the complexity of real noise.\nSecondly, previous commonly-used kernel priors (e.g., normalization, sparsity)\nare not effective enough to guarantee a rational kernel solution, and thus\ndegenerates the performance of subsequent SISR task. To address the above\nissues, this paper proposes a model-based blind SISR method under the\nprobabilistic framework, which elaborately models image degradation from the\nperspectives of noise and blur kernel. Specifically, instead of the traditional\ni.i.d. noise assumption, a patch-based non-i.i.d. noise model is proposed to\ntackle the complicated real noise, expecting to increase the degrees of freedom\nof the model for noise representation. As for the blur kernel, we novelly\nconstruct a concise yet effective kernel generator, and plug it into the\nproposed blind SISR method as an explicit kernel prior (EKP).

Comparison\nof the experimental data and theory demonstrates that the nonlinearity of the\nphotocurrent is caused by the interplay of two mechanisms, i.e. by direct\ninter-band optical transitions and Drude-like absorption. Both photocurrents\nsaturate at high intensities, but have different intensity dependencies and\nsaturation intensities. The total photocurrent shows a complex sign-alternating\nintensity dependence. The functional behaviour of the saturation intensities\nand amplitudes of both kinds of photogalvanic currents depending on gate\nvoltages, temperature, radiation frequency and polarization is in a good\nagreement with the developed theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 12:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

We\nconsider this change in the age--$\\Sigma$ relation in the context of the\nredshift evolution of the star-forming and quiescent populations in the\nmass--size plane, and find our results can be explained as a consequence of\ngalaxies forming more compactly at higher redshifts, and remaining compact\nthroughout their evolution. Furthermore, galaxies appear to quench at a\ncharacteristic surface density that decreases with decreasing redshift. The\n$z\\sim 0$ age--$\\Sigma$ relation is therefore a result of building up the\nquiescent and star-forming populations with galaxies that formed at a range of\nredshifts and so a range of surface densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 13:03:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 08:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

However, multiple reasons, such as\nvariations caused by magnification factors and class imbalance, make it a\nchallenging task where conventional methods that learn from image-label\ndatasets perform unsatisfactorily in many cases. We observe that tumours of the\nsame class often share common morphological patterns. To exploit this fact, we\npropose an approach that learns similarity-based multi-scale embeddings (SMSE)\nfor magnification-independent histopathological image classification. In\nparticular, a pair loss and a triplet loss are leveraged to learn\nsimilarity-based embeddings from image pairs or image triplets. The learned\nembeddings provide accurate measurements of similarities between images, which\nare regarded as a more effective form of representation for histopathological\nmorphology than normal image features. Furthermore, in order to ensure the\ngenerated models are magnification-independent, images acquired at different\nmagnification factors are simultaneously fed to networks during training for\nlearning multi-scale embeddings. In addition to the SMSE, to eliminate the\nimpact of class imbalance, instead of using the hard sample mining strategy\nthat intuitively discards some easy samples, we introduce a new reinforced\nfocal loss to simultaneously punish hard misclassified samples while\nsuppressing easy well-classified samples. Experimental results show that the\nSMSE improves the performance for histopathological image classification tasks\nfor both breast and liver cancers by a large margin compared to previous\nmethods. In particular, the SMSE achieves the best performance on the BreakHis\nbenchmark with an improvement ranging from 5% to 18% compared to previous\nmethods using traditional features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 13:18:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 07:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

The first model was proposed by Niessen et al. This model works in\nthe single-vortex approximation and provides qualitative explanation of the\neffect, but in most cases it gives an overestimated guiding angle. The\nstochastic model explains the experimentally observed effect of decreasing the\nguiding angle, the so-called slipping effect, by the influence of thermal\nfluctuations. However, the performed estimates show that thermal fluctuations\nshould not be so significant. An alternative guiding model is the anisotropic\npinning model. This model works in the critical state approximation, and the\nslipping effect is the result of the combined action of anisotropic pinning and\nvortex interaction. The predictions of all three models are verified by the\nexample of a superconducting Nb-Ti tape containing about 6 vol. % {/alpha}-Ti,\nwhich acts as strong pinning centers. Cutting samples at different angles to\nrolling allows one to control the direction of the driving force. It was found\nthat when the standard criterion of the electric field is reached, the guiding\nangle varies significantly at different places along the sample, which is\nexplained by the plastic mode of the vortex matter motion. In this case, the\nanisotropic pinning model semi-quantitatively predicts the direction angle\naveraged over the sample length. With an increase in the driving force, the\nvortex matter motion passes into an elastic mode, and the guiding angle becomes\nuniform along the sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 13:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-05"}

Conventional resource allocation algorithms for\nthe NBIoT systems are particularly designed for terrestrial infrastructures,\nwhere devices are under the coverage of a specific base station and the whole\nsystem varies very slowly in time. The existing methods in the literature\ncannot be applied over LEO satellite-based NB-IoT systems for several reasons.\nFirst, with the movement of the LEO satellite, the corresponding channel\nparameters for each user will quickly change over time. Delaying the scheduling\nof a certain user would result in a resource allocation based on outdated\nparameters. Second, the differential Doppler shift, which is a typical\nimpairment in communications over LEO, directly depends on the relative\ndistance among users. Scheduling at the same radio frame users that overcome a\ncertain distance would violate the differential Doppler limit supported by the\nNB-IoT standard. Third, the propagation delay over a LEO satellite channel is\naround 4-16 times higher compared to a terrestrial system, imposing the need\nfor message exchange minimization between the users and the base station.

How these complexities\narise, and which structures are formed in which type of systems, is still\npoorly understood. Particularly, there is a lack of studies investigating the\nstructure formation in eccentric systems. We aim to improve our understanding\nof the wind morphology of eccentric AGB binary systems by investigating the\nmechanism responsible for the different small-scale structures and global\nmorphologies that arise in a polytropic wind with different velocities. Using\nthe smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code Phantom, we generate nine\ndifferent high-resolution, 3D simulations of an AGB star with a solar-mass\ncompanion with various wind velocity and eccentricity combinations. The models\nassume a polytropic gas, with no additional cooling. We conclude that for\nmodels with a high wind velocity, the short interaction with the companion\nresults in a regular spiral morphology, that is flattened. In the case of a\nlower wind velocity, the stronger interaction results in the formation of a\nhigh-energy region and bow-shock structure that can shape the wind into an\nirregular morphology if instabilities arise. High-eccentricity models show a\ncomplex, phase-dependent interaction leading to wind structures that are\nirregular in three dimensions.

The evolution of the field state\nis ruled by the quantum optical master equation, which is known to have an\nexact analytic solution. Starting from a pure input state, we employ two\nindicators of how different the initial and evolved states are, namely, the\nfidelity of evolution and the Hilbert-Schmidt distance of evolution. The former\nwas introduced by del Campo {\\em et al.} who derived a time-independent speed\nlimit for the evolution of a Markovian open system.

It turns\nout that the associate quantum speed limit time built with the Hilbert-Schmidt\nmetric is tighter than the fidelity-based one. As apposite applications, we\ninvestigate the damping of the coherent and Fock states by using the\ncharacteristic functions of the corresponding evolved states.

Comparison of time-series models revealed that feed-forward\ndilated convolutions with residual and skip connections outperformed all\nRNN-based models in performance, training time, and training stability. The\nexperiments also indicate that data augmentation improves model robustness in\nsimulated packet loss or sensor dropout scenarios. In particular, signal- and\nsensor-dropout-based augmentation strategies provided considerable boosts to\nperformance without negatively affecting the baseline performance.

For meeting H2 demand, direct H2 imports are more attractive than\nindirect routes using CH4, MeOH or NH3 imports and subsequent decomposition to\nH2 because of high capital investment costs and energetic losses.

This limitation arises because a task's entire support set, which can\ncontain up to 1000 images, must be processed before an optimization step can be\ntaken. Harnessing the performance gains offered by large images thus requires\neither parallelizing the meta-learner across multiple GPUs, which may not be\navailable, or trade-offs between task and image size when memory constraints\napply. We improve on both options by proposing LITE, a general and memory\nefficient episodic training scheme that enables meta-training on large tasks\ncomposed of large images on a single GPU. We achieve this by observing that the\ngradients for a task can be decomposed into a sum of gradients over the task's\ntraining images. This enables us to perform a forward pass on a task's entire\ntraining set but realize significant memory savings by back-propagating only a\nrandom subset of these images which we show is an unbiased approximation of the\nfull gradient. We use LITE to train meta-learners and demonstrate new\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on the real-world ORBIT benchmark and 3 of the 4\nparts of the challenging VTAB+MD benchmark relative to leading meta-learners.\nLITE also enables meta-learners to be competitive with transfer learning\napproaches but at a fraction of the test-time computational cost, thus serving\nas a counterpoint to the recent narrative that transfer learning is all you\nneed for few-shot classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 14:37:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 16:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

The\ninformation is measured by non-probabilistic uncertainty of uncertain\nvariables, the non-stochastic counterparts of random variables. For $X$ that is\nrelated to released data $Y$, the non-stochastic brute-force leakage is\nmeasured by the complexity of exhaustively checking all the possibilities of\nthe private attribute $U$ of $X$ by an adversary. The complexity refers to the\nnumber of trials to successfully guess $U$. Maximizing this leakage over all\npossible private attributes $U$ gives rise to the maximal (i.e., worst-case)\nnon-stochastic brute-force guessing leakage. This is proved to be fully\ndetermined by the minimal non-stochastic uncertainty of $X$ given $Y$, which\nalso determines the worst-case attribute $U$ indicating the highest privacy\nrisk if $Y$ is disclosed. The maximal non-stochastic brute-force guessing\nleakage is shown to be proportional to the non-stochastic identifiability of\n$X$ given $Y$ and upper bounds the existing maximin information. The latter\nquantifies the information leakage when an adversary must perfectly guess $U$\nin one-shot via $Y$. Experiments are used to demonstrate the tradeoff between\nthe maximal non-stochastic brute-force guessing leakage and the data utility\n(measured by the maximum quantization error) and to illustrate the relationship\nbetween maximin information and stochastic one-shot maximal leakage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 14:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-05"}

A matrix rank based\nnecessary and sufficient condition is derived for the global identifiability of\nsubsystem interactions, which leads to several conclusions about NDS structure\nidentifiability when there is some a priori information. This matrix also gives\nan explicit description for the set of subsystem interactions that can not be\ndistinguished from experiment data only. In addition, under a well-posedness\nassumption, a necessary and sufficient condition is obtained for the\nreconstructibility of subsystem interactions from an NDS descriptor form model.\nThis condition can be verified with each subsystem separately and is therefore\nattractive in the analysis and synthesis of a large-scale NDS.

Second,\ntraining requires an oracle stopping criterion as during the optimization the\nperformance degrades after reaching an optimum value. To address these\nchallenges we introduce a frequency-band correspondence measure to characterize\nthe spectral bias of the deep image prior, where low-frequency image signals\nare learned faster and better than high-frequency counterparts.

Deep learning techniques have been favored for high-dimensional\nproblems but face difficulties when the solution is not smooth, thus have so\nfar been mainly used for viscous hyperbolic system that admits only smooth\nsolutions. We alleviate this difficulty by setting up the loss function using\ndiscrete shock capturing schemes--the discontinous Galerkin method as an\nexample--since the solutions are smooth in the discrete space. The convergence\nof D2GM is established via the Lax equivalence theorem kind of argument. The\nhigh-dimensional random space is handled by the Monte-Carlo method. Such a\nsetup makes the D2GM approximate high-dimensional functions over the random\nspace with satisfactory accuracy at reasonable cost.

While\nimportant progress has been made in plasma-based electron acceleration,\npositron acceleration in plasma has been scarcely studied and a fully\nself-consistent and optimal scenario has not yet been identified. For high\nenergy physics applications where an electron-positron collider would be\ndesired, the ability to accelerate positrons in plasma wakefields is however\nparamount. Here we show that the preservation of beam quality can be\ncompromised in a plasma wakefield loaded with a positron beam, and a trade-off\nbetween energy efficiency and beam quality needs to be found.

In these questions the\nrobot demonstrates a few different behaviors and asks the human for their\nfavorite. But how should robots choose which questions to ask? Today's robots\noptimize for informative questions that actively probe the human's preferences\nas efficiently as possible. But while informative questions make sense from the\nrobot's perspective, human onlookers often find them arbitrary and misleading.\nIn this paper we formalize active preference-based learning from the human's\nperspective. We hypothesize that -- from the human's point-of-view -- the\nrobot's questions reveal what the robot has and has not learned. Our insight\nenables robots to use questions to make their learning process transparent to\nthe human operator. We develop and test a model that robots can leverage to\nrelate the questions they ask to the information these questions reveal. We\nthen introduce a trade-off between informative and revealing questions that\nconsiders both human and robot perspectives: a robot that optimizes for this\ntrade-off actively gathers information from the human while simultaneously\nkeeping the human up to date with what it has learned.

The\ncounty retrofitted all 3,693 county-owned high pressure sodium (HPS) street\nlamps to full cutoff LEDs. This number is about 60% of the County's total\noutdoor street and area lights. About 80% of the newly installed lights were\n3000K in color temperature and 20% were 4000K. The 4000K LEDs were used to meet\nWashington State Department of Transportation guidelines. To measure sky\nbrightness, we used the NPS night sky camera system before the retrofit started\nin 2018 and after its completion in 2019.

Our measurements show that\nthe post-retrofit skyglow became brighter and extended higher in the sky, but\nupward radiance, as measured by the day-night band radiometer, decreased. These\ndivergent results are likely explained by a substantial increase in light\nemitted at wavelengths shorter than 500 nm, and a relative decrease in zenith\nlight emission due to better shielded luminaires. These results also\ndemonstrate that earlier models relating VIIRS day-night band data to skyglow\nwill, at a minimum, require substantial revision to account for the different\ncharacteristics of solid state luminaires.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 23:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

Inspired by the visual-aware\nrecommendation, in this paper, we propose a contextual bandit algorithm, where\nthe convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to learn the reward function\nalong with an upper confidence bound (UCB) for exploration.

We then analyze local extremes statistics for 8 mountainous\nlandscapes worldwide with diverse hydroclimatic forcings and geologic histories\nusing 24 Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and compare them with complex terrain\nof the Erythraeum Chaos region on Mars. The results reveal that the spherical\ncovariance structure captures the observed spatial correlation in these cases\nwith the peak frequency distribution agreeing well with the elevation frequency\ndistribution. The ratio of the pit-over-peak (POP) count is linked to the\ndegree to which the pit and peak frequency distributions match, and carries the\nmark of landscape aging. The relationship between the geomorphic development\nstage (quantified by the reduced fatness of the slope-distribution tail) and\nthe deviation of POP values from unity in old mountainous landscapes confirms\nthat the evolution towards smoother topographies is atypically accompanied by\nreduced pit counts typical of organized valley and ridge patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 22:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

In\nparticular, metamaterials with either negative permeability or permittivity\nallow creating deeply subwavelength resonant structures with relatively high\nscattering crosssections. However, the equivalence principle allows replacing\nvolumetric structures with properly designed curved impedance surfaces,\nensuring the same electromagnetic properties. Here, we examine this statement\nfrom a practical standpoint, considering two structures, having a dipolar\nelectric resonance at the same frequency. The first realization is based on\narrays of inductively loaded electric dipoles printed on stacked circuit boards\n(a volumetric metamaterial), while the second structure utilizes a 4-wire\nspiral on a spherical surface (surface impedance realization). An intermediate\nconclusion is that the surface implementation tends to outperform the\nvolumetric counterparts in the scenario when a single resonance is involved.\nHowever, in the case where multiple resonances are overlapping and lossy\nmaterials are involved, volumetric realization can have an advantage. The\ndiscussed structures are of significant importance to the field of electrically\nsmall antennas, superdirective antennas, and superscatterers, which find use in\nwireless communications and radar applications, to name just a few.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 19:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

We implement\nultra-small metamaterial filters (Meta-filters) by exploiting a subwavelength\n(sub-lambda guiding mechanism in evanescent hollow waveguides, which are loaded\nby small resonators. In particular, we use composite pin-pipe waveguides\n(CPPWs) built from a hollow metallic pipe loaded by a set of resonant pins,\nwhich are spaced by deep subwavelength distances. We demonstrate that in such\nstructures, multiple resonant scattering nucleates a sub-lambda mode with a\ncustomizable bandwidth below the induced hybridization bandgap (HBG) of the\nLRM. The sub-lambda guided mode and the HBG, respectively, induce pass- and\nrejection- bands in a finite-length CPPW, creating a filter whose main\nproperties are largely decoupled from the specific arrangement of the resonant\ninclusions. To guarantee compatibility with existing technologies, we propose a\nunique subwavelength method to match the small CPPW filters to standard\nwaveguide interfaces, which we call a meta-port. Finally, we build and test a\nfamily of low- and high-order ultra-compact aluminum CPPW filters in the\nKu-band (10-18GHz). Our measurements demonstrate the customizability of the\nbandwidth and the robustness of the passband against geometrical scaling. The\n3D-printed prototypes, which are one order of magnitude smaller and lighter\nthan traditional filters and are also compatible with standard waveguide\ninterfaces, may find applications in future satellite systems and 5G\ninfrastructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 08:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

The physical reality\ndescribed by the wave function is subatomic particle moving randomly.\nTherefore, the characteristics of quantum mechanics have a dual nature, one of\nthem is the deterministic nature carried on from classical physics, and the\nother is the probabilistic nature coined by particle's random motion. Based on\nthis model, almost all of open questions in quantum mechanics can be explained\nconsistently, which include the particle-wave duality, the principle of quantum\nsuperposition, the interference pattern of double-slit experiments, and the\nboundary between the classical world and the quantum world. The current quantum\nmechanics is a mixture of matrix mechanics and wave mechanics, which are\nsharply conflicting in principle. Matrix mechanics treats quantum particles as\nclassical particles with fixed relation between the particle's position and its\nmomentum. The matrix mechanics, in fact, belongs to the old quantum theory.\nBoth Born's non-commutative relation and Heisenberg uncertainty relation\noriginate from matrix mechanics. However, in wave mechanics, there is no any\nfixed relation between the particle's position and its momentum, and the\nparticle's position and its momentum belong to immeasurable physical\nquantities. Therefore, there is no need for non-commutative relation and\nuncertainty relation in wave mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 15:29:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 14:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-18"}
