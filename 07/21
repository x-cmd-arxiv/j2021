The initial impetus came from the\nhope of detecting UV radiation from the hot intergalactic medium. The central\nimportance of the FUV background to the physics (heating and ionization) of the\ndiffuse atomic phases motivated the next generation of experiments. The\nconsensus view is that the diffuse FUV emission at high latitudes has three\ncomponents: stellar FUV reflected by dust grains (diffuse Galactic light or\nDGL), FUV from other galaxies and the intergalactic medium (extra-galactic\nbackground light or EBL) and a component of unknown origin (and referred to as\nthe \"offset\" component). During the1980's, there was some discussion that\ndecaying dark matter particles produced FUV radiation. In this paper I\ninvestigate production of FUV photons by conventional sources: line emission\nfrom Galactic Hot Ionized Medium, two-photon emission from the Galactic Warm\nIonized Medium and low-velocity shocks, and Lyman-beta fluorescence of hydrogen\nat several locales in the Solar System (the interplanetary medium, the\nexosphere and the thermosphere of Earth). I conclude that two thirds and\narguably all of the offset component can be explained by the sum of the\nradiation from the processes listed above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 16:00:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 01:26:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 17:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Although there are a number of ways to formulate a valid\ncomposite likelihood in the finite-$p$ setting, there does not seem to exist\nagreement on how to construct composite likelihoods that are comp utationally\nefficient and statistically sound when $p$ is allowed to diverge. This article\nintroduces a method to select sparse composite likelihoods by minimizing a\ncriterion representing the statistical efficiency of the implied estimator plus\nan $L_1$-penalty discouraging the inclusion of too many sub-likelihood terms.\nConditions under which consistent model selection occurs are studied.

Intuitively, problems and challenges can be better handled by managing\nexpectations in software teams. Aim: Our goal is to understand whether the\nexpectations of software developers vary towards diverse stakeholders in\nsoftware teams. Method: We surveyed 181 professional software developers to\nunderstand their expectations from five different stakeholders: (1)\norganizations, (2) managers, (3) peers, (4) new hires, and (5) government and\neducational institutions. The five stakeholders are determined by conducting\nsemi-formal interviews of software developers. We ask open-ended survey\nquestions and analyze the responses using open coding. Results: We observed 18\nmulti-faceted expectations types. While some expectations are more specific to\na stakeholder, other expectations are cross-cutting. For example, developers\nexpect work-benefits from their organizations, but expect the adoption of\nstandard software engineering (SE) practices from their organizations, peers,\nand new hires. Conclusion: Out of the 18 categories, three categories are\nrelated to career growth. This observation supports previous research that\nhappiness cannot be assured by simply offering more money or a promotion. Among\nthe most number of responses, we find expectations from educational\ninstitutions to offer relevant teaching and from governments to improve job\nstability, which indicate the increasingly important roles of these\norganizations to help software developers. This observation can be especially\ntrue during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 16:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

The integration process first converts the structure\nof each source into a typed graph schema, which is then matched to the mediated\nschema. Mapping rules define transformations between the schemata to reconcile\nsemantics. The mapping can be visually validated by experts.

Generic reinforcement learning agents could be\ntrained to behave altruistically towards others by rewarding them for\naltruistic behaviour, i.e., rewarding them for benefiting other agents in a\ngiven situation. Such an approach assumes that other agents' goals are known so\nthat the altruistic agent can cooperate in achieving those goals. However,\nexplicit knowledge of other agents' goals is often difficult to acquire. In the\ncase of human agents, their goals and preferences may be difficult to express\nfully; they might be ambiguous or even contradictory. Thus, it is beneficial to\ndevelop agents that do not depend on external supervision and learn altruistic\nbehaviour in a task-agnostic manner. We propose to act altruistically towards\nother agents by giving them more choice and allowing them to achieve their\ngoals better. Some concrete examples include opening a door for others or\nsafeguarding them to pursue their objectives without interference. We formalize\nthis concept and propose an altruistic agent that learns to increase the\nchoices another agent has by preferring to maximize the number of states that\nthe other agent can reach in its future. We evaluate our approach in three\ndifferent multi-agent environments where another agent's success depends on\naltruistic behaviour.

These equations are classically\nequivalent to General Relativity, yet the Newton constant becomes a constant of\nintegration or a global dynamical degree of freedom. Thus, from the point of\nview of standard quantization, this effective Newton constant is susceptible to\nquantum fluctuations. This is similar to what happens to the cosmological\nconstant in the unimodular gravity where the trace part of the Einstein\nequations is lost in a different way. Using analogy with the\nHenneaux-Teitelboim covariant action for the unimodular gravity, we consider\ndifferent general-covariant actions resulting in these dynamics. This setup\nallows one to formulate the Heisenberg uncertainty relations for the Newton\nconstant and canonically conjugated quantities. Unexpectedly, one of such\ntheories also promotes the Planck's quantum constant to a global degree of\nfreedom, which is subject to quantum fluctuations. Following analogy with the\nunimodular gravity, we discuss non-covariant \"unimatter\" and \"unicurvature\"\ngravities describing the scale-free Einstein equations.

There is an increasing urge to acquire detailed knowledge\nof the deformation field that is effectively present across the sample during\nthese tests; at the same time, there is mounting evidence that the macroscopic\nrheological response depends on the elusive microscopic behavior of the\nmaterial constituents. Here we employ a strain-controlled shear-cell with\ntransparent walls to visualize and quantify the dynamics of tracers embedded in\nvarious cyclically sheared complex fluids, ranging from almost-ideal elastic to\nyield stress fluids. For each sample, we use image correlation processing to\nmeasure the macroscopic deformation field, and echo-Differential Dynamic\nMicroscopy to probe the microscopic irreversible sample dynamics in reciprocal\nspace; finally, we devise a simple scheme to spatially map the rearrangements\nin the sheared sample, once again without tracking the tracers. For the yield\nstress sample, we obtain a wave-vector dependent characterization of\nshear-induced diffusion across the yielding transition, which is accompanied by\na three-order-of-magnitude speed-up of the dynamics and by a transition from\nlocalized, intermittent rearrangements to a more spatially homogeneous and\ntemporally uniform activity. Our tracking free approach is intrinsically\nmulti-scale, can successfully discriminate between different types of dynamics,\nand can be automated to minimize user intervention. Applications are many, as\nit can be translated to other imaging modes, including fluorescence, and can be\nused with sub-resolution tracers and even without tracers, for samples that\nprovide intrinsic optical contrast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 16:42:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 05:26:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 15:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Simulation-based tests are safer than\nin-field operational tests and allow detecting software defects before\ndeployment. However, these tests are very expensive and are too many to be run\nfrequently within limited time constraints. In this paper, we investigate test\ncase prioritization techniques to increase the ability to detect SDC regression\nfaults with virtual tests earlier. Our approach, called SDC-Prioritizer,\nprioritizes virtual tests for SDCs according to static features of the roads we\ndesigned to be used within the driving scenarios. These features can be\ncollected without running the tests, which means that they do not require past\nexecution results. We introduce two evolutionary approaches to prioritize the\ntest cases using diversity metrics (black-box heuristics) computed on these\nstatic features. These two approaches, called SO-SDC-Prioritizer and\nMO-SDC-Prioritizer, use single-objective and multi-objective genetic\nalgorithms, respectively, to find trade-offs between executing the less\nexpensive tests and the most diverse test cases earlier. Our empirical study\nconducted in the SDC domain shows that MO-SDC-Prioritizer significantly\nimproves the ability to detect safety-critical failures at the same level of\nexecution time compared to baselines: random and greedy-based test case\norderings. Besides, our study indicates that multi-objective meta-heuristics\noutperform single-objective approaches when prioritizing simulation-based tests\nfor SDCs.

In winter, however, the eddy\nflux itself acts to accelerate and decelerate the zonal flow in the Asian and\nEast Pacific regions, respectively. In a zonal mean sense, the residual of\nthese two is then balanced by the mean meridional flux. These features are\nqualitatively captured by the CMIP6 suite of models in their control runs. With\nwarming, the CMIP6 ensemble shows that the flux budget changes in a\nquantitative manner, in both the summer and winter seasons. Apart from the mean\nmeridional flux which is affected by the projected weakening of the Hadley\nCells, there are significant changes in eddy fluxes too. Notably, stationary\nwave fluxes are affected in the Asian and East Pacific regions during the\nsummer and winter seasons, respectively. In the wintertime, extratropical wave\nactivity penetrating into the East Pacific almost shuts off due to a weakening\nof the prevalent westerlies in the warming simulations. Whereas, in summer,\neddy fluxes in the Asian region are displaced upward and changes are observed\nin the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Specifically, rotational flow\naround the Asian summer anticyclone weakens in the upper troposphere while\nstrengthening in the lower stratosphere. Concomitantly, eddy flux convergence\nover the equatorial Indian Ocean decreases in the former and increases (by a\nlarger amount) in the latter. In fact, strengthening of summertime tropical and\nsubtropical stationary waves in the lower stratosphere with warming is not\nrestricted to the Asian sector but is observed over all longitudes.\nEffectively, the magnitude of all terms in the upper tropospheric momentum flux\nbudget decreases with warming, and an ensemble mean continues to yield a\nmarginally westward annual and zonal mean equatorial zonal flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 17:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

One way robots can provide this assistance\nis shared autonomy. Within shared autonomy, both the human and robot maintain\ncontrol over the robot's motion: as the robot becomes confident it understands\nwhat the human wants, it increasingly intervenes to automate the task. But how\ndoes the robot know what tasks the human may want to perform in the first\nplace? Today's shared autonomy approaches often rely on prior knowledge: for\nexample, the robot must know the set of possible human goals a priori. In the\nlong-term, however, this prior knowledge will inevitably break down -- sooner\nor later the human will reach for a goal that the robot did not expect. In this\npaper we propose a learning approach to shared autonomy that takes advantage of\nrepeated interactions. Learning to assist humans would be impossible if they\nperformed completely different tasks at every interaction: but our insight is\nthat users living with physical disabilities repeat important tasks on a daily\nbasis (e.g., opening the fridge, making coffee, and having dinner). We\nintroduce an algorithm that exploits these repeated interactions to recognize\nthe human's task, replicate similar demonstrations, and return control when\nunsure. As the human repeatedly works with this robot, our approach continually\nlearns to assist tasks that were never specified beforehand: these tasks\ninclude both discrete goals (e.g., reaching a cup) and continuous skills (e.g.,\nopening a drawer). Across simulations and an in-person user study, we\ndemonstrate that robots leveraging our approach match existing shared autonomy\nmethods for known goals, and outperform imitation learning baselines on new\ntasks.

In particular, at temperatures just below the Curie\ntemperature, polarized states may be sustainable as the mobile species is\ndriven in a controlled way over the energy barrier that governs ionic\nconduction, resulting in unique control of the polarization. This possibility\nwas recently demonstrated in CuInP2S6, a layered ferroelectric ionic conductor\nin which Cu ions cause both ferroelectricity and ionic conduction. Here, we\nshow that the commonly used approach to calculate the polarization of evolving\natomic configurations in ferroelectrics using the modern theory of\npolarization, namely concerted (synchronous) migration of the displacing ions,\nis not well suited to describe the polarization evolution as the Cu ions cross\nthe van der Waals gaps. We introduce an asynchronous Cu-migration scheme, which\nreflects the physical process by which Cu ions migrate, resolves the\ndifficulties, and describes the polarization evolution both for normal\nferroelectric switching and for transitions across the van der Waals gaps,\nproviding a single framework to discuss ferroelectric ionic conductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 17:39:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 03:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-04"}

Such\nelasticity means that virtual machines over the cloud can be preempted under a\nshort notice (e.g., hours or minutes) if a high-priority job appears; on the\nother hand, new virtual machines may become available over time to compensate\nthe computing resources. Coded Storage Elastic Computing (CSEC) introduced by\nYang et al. in 2018 is an effective and efficient approach to overcome the\nelasticity and it costs relatively less storage and computation load. However,\none of the limitations of the CSEC is that it may only be applied to certain\ntypes of computations (e.g., linear) and may be challenging to be applied to\nmore involved computations because the coded data storage and approximation are\noften needed. Hence, it may be preferred to use uncoded storage by directly\ncopying data into the virtual machines. In addition, based on our own\nmeasurement, virtual machines on Amazon EC2 clusters often have heterogeneous\ncomputation speed even if they have exactly the same configurations (e.g., CPU,\nRAM, I/O cost). In this paper, we introduce a new optimization framework on\nUncoded Storage Elastic Computing (USEC) systems with heterogeneous computing\nspeed to minimize the overall computation time.

The farthest NLAGN in our sample is M1513$-$2524 ($z_{em}=3.132$),\nand the largest (size$\\sim$330 kpc) is M0909$-$3133 ($z_{em}=0.884$). We\ndiscuss in detail 110 AGN at $1.9 < z < 3.5$. Despite representing the radio\nloudest quasars (median $R$=3685), their Eddington ratios are similar to the\nSDSS quasars having lower $R$. We detect 4 CIV BALQSOs, all among AGN with\nleast $R$, and highest black hole masses and Eddington ratios. The BAL\ndetection rate ($4^{+3}_{-2}$%) is consistent with that seen in extremely\npowerful ($L_{1.4GHz}>10^{25}$ WHz$^{-1}$) quasars. Using optical light-curves,\nradio polarization and $\\gamma$-ray detections, we identify 7 high-probability\nBL Lacs. We also summarize the full MALS footprint to search for HI 21-cm and\nOH 18-cm lines at $z<2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 18:17:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 12:27:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 08:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

The goal of this work is to test\nunder what shock conditions the abundances of gas-phase SO and SO$_2$ increase\nin an accretion shock at the disk-envelope interface. Detailed shock models\nincluding gas dynamics are computed using the Paris-Durham shock code for\nnon-magnetized J-type accretion shocks in typical inner envelope conditions.\nThe effect of pre-shock density, shock velocity, and strength of the\nultraviolet (UV) radiation field on the abundance of warm SO and SO$_2$ is\nexplored. Warm gas-phase chemistry is efficient in forming SO under most J-type\nshock conditions considered. In lower-velocity (~3 km/s) shocks, the abundance\nof SO is increased through subsequent reactions starting from thermally\ndesorbed CH$_4$ toward H$_2$CO and finally SO. In higher velocity (>4 km/s)\nshocks, both SO and SO$_2$ are formed through reactions of OH and atomic S. The\nstrength of the UV radiation field is crucial for SO and in particular SO$_2$\nformation through the photodissociation of H$_2$O. Thermal desorption of SO and\nSO$_2$ ice is only relevant in high-velocity (>5 km/s) shocks at high densities\n($>10^7$ cm$^{-3}$).

To this end, the\ntask-aware compression problem is formulated as finding the optimal source\ncoder that maximizes the asymptotic error performance of the hypothesis test on\nthe server side under a rate constraint. A new source coding strategy based on\na greedy optimization procedure is proposed and it is shown that that the\nproposed compression scheme outperforms universal fixed-length single-shot\ncoding scheme for a range of rate constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 21:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

To characterise\nthe viscoelastic behaviour of these soft materials, one can analyse the\nmicroscopic dynamics of colloidal tracers diffusing through the host fluid and\ngenerating local deformations and stresses. This technique, referred to as\nmicrorheology, links the bulk rheology of fluids to the microscopic dynamics at\nthe particle scale. If tracers are subjected to external forces, rather than\nfreely diffusing, it is called active microrheology. Motivated by the impact of\nmicrorheology in providing information on local structure in complex systems\nsuch as colloidal glasses, active matter or biological systems, we have\nextended the dynamic Monte Carlo (DMC) technique to investigate active\nmicrorheology in colloids. The original DMC framework, able to accurately\ndescribe the Brownian dynamics of colloids at equilibrium, is here reconsidered\nand expanded to describe the effects of an external force pulling a tracer\nembedded in isotropic colloidal suspensions at different densities. To this\nend, we studied the dynamics of a spherical tracer dragged by a constant\nexternal force through a bath of spherical and rod-like particles of comparable\nsize.

We study BCF on two real-world robotics\ntasks involving navigation in a vast and long-horizon environment, and a\ncomplex reaching task that involves manipulability maximisation. For both these\ndomains, simple handcrafted controllers exist that can solve the task at hand\nin a risk-averse manner but do not necessarily exhibit the optimal solution\ngiven limitations in analytical modelling, controller miscalibration and task\nvariation. As exploration is naturally guided by the prior in the early stages\nof training, BCF accelerates learning, while substantially improving beyond the\nperformance of the control prior, as the policy gains more experience.

For such quantum applications, highly\nefficient trapping of the electron in a specific moving quantum dot (QD) of a\nSAW train plays a key role. Probabilistic transport over multiple moving minima\nwould cause uncertainty in synchronisation that is detrimental for coherence of\nentangled flying electrons and in-flight quantum operations. It is thus of\ncentral importance to identify the device parameters enabling electron\ntransport within a single SAW minimum. A detailed experimental investigation of\nthis aspect is so far missing. Here we fill this gap by demonstrating\ntime-of-flight measurements for a single electron that is transported via a SAW\ntrain between distant stationary QDs. Our measurements reveal the in-flight\ndistribution of the electron within the moving acousto-electric quantum dots of\nthe SAW train. Increasing the acousto-electric amplitude, we observe the\nthreshold necessary to confine the flying electron at a specific, deliberately\nchosen SAW minimum. Investigating the effect of a barrier along the transport\nchannel, we also benchmark the robustness of SAW-driven electron transport\nagainst stationary potential variations.

Typically, branch predictors are leveraged to\ntrigger mis-speculation in transient execution attacks. In this work, we\ndemonstrate a new class of speculation-based attack that targets branch\nprediction unit (BPU). We find that speculative resolution of conditional\nbranches (i.e., in nested speculation) alter the states of pattern history\ntable (PHT) in modern processors, which are not restored after the\ncorresponding branches are later squashed. Such characteristic allows attackers\nto exploit BPU as the secret transmitting medium in transient execution\nattacks. To evaluate the discovered vulnerability, we build a novel attack\nframework, BranchSpectre, that enables exfiltration of unintended secrets\nthrough observing speculative PHT updates (in the form of covert and side\nchannels). We further investigate PHT collision mechanism in the history-based\npredictor as well as the branch prediction mode transitions in Intel\nprocessors. Built upon such knowledge, we implement an ultra high-speed covert\nchannel (BranchSpectre-cc) as well as two side channels (i.e., BranchSpectre-v1\nand BranchSpectre-v2) that merely rely on BPU for mis-speculation trigger and\nsecret inference in the speculative domain. Notably, BranchSpectre side\nchannels can take advantage of much simpler code patterns than the ones used in\nSpectre attacks.

Recently, substantial\nattempts have been made on several video datasets with associated question\nanswering (QA) on a large scale. However, existing evaluation metrics for video\nquestion answering (VideoQA) do not provide meaningful analysis. To make\nprogress, we argue that a well-made framework, established on the way humans\nunderstand, is required to explain and evaluate the performance of\nunderstanding in detail. Then we propose a top-down evaluation system for\nVideoQA, based on the cognitive process of humans and story elements: Cognitive\nModules for Evaluation (CogME). CogME is composed of three cognitive modules:\ntargets, contents, and thinking. The interaction among the modules in the\nunderstanding procedure can be expressed in one sentence as follows: \"I\nunderstand the CONTENT of the TARGET through a way of THINKING.\" Each module\nhas sub-components derived from the story elements. We can specify the required\naspects of understanding by annotating the sub-components to individual\nquestions. CogME thus provides a framework for an elaborated specification of\nVideoQA datasets. To examine the suitability of a VideoQA dataset for\nvalidating video understanding intelligence, we evaluated the baseline model of\nthe DramaQA dataset by applying CogME. The evaluation reveals that story\nelements are unevenly reflected in the existing dataset, and the model based on\nthe dataset may cause biased predictions. Although this study has only been\nable to grasp a narrow range of stories, we expect that it offers the first\nstep in considering the cognitive process of humans on the video understanding\nintelligence of humans and AI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 02:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

Due to the non-standard hardware and diverse software,\nembedded devices present unique challenges to security analysts for the\naccurate analysis of firmware binaries. The diversity in hardware components\nand tight coupling between firmware and hardware makes it hard to perform\ndynamic analysis, which must have the ability to execute firmware code in\nvirtualized environments. However, emulating the large expanse of hardware\nperipherals makes analysts have to frequently modify the emulator for executing\nvarious firmware code in different virtualized environments, greatly limiting\nthe ability of security analysis.\n  In this work, we explore the problem of firmware re-hosting related to the\nreal-time operating system (RTOS). Specifically, developers create a Board\nSupport Package (BSP) and develop device drivers to make that RTOS run on their\nplatform. By providing high-level replacements for BSP routines and device\ndrivers, we can make the minimal modification of the firmware that is to be\nmigrated from its original hardware environment into a virtualized one. We show\nthat an approach capable of offering the ability to execute firmware at scale\nthrough patching firmware in an automated manner without modifying the existing\nemulators. Our approach, called static binary-level porting, first identifies\nthe BSP and device drivers in target firmware, then patches the firmware with\npre-built BSP routines and drivers that can be adapted to the existing\nemulators. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method on\nmultiple hardware platforms and firmware samples for security analysis.

We discuss the thermoelectric response as a benchmark\nfor the NFL-FL crossover.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 04:19:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 19:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

This\noccurs in collisionless shock ramps in space, and in $\\rm{E \\times B}$\ndischarge devices such as Hall thrusters. ECDI can induce an electron flow\nparallel to the background E field at a speed greatly exceeding predictions by\nclassical collision theory.

The development of ECDI and anomalous\ntransport is often considered fully-kinetic. In this work, however, we\ndemonstrate that a reduced variant of this instability, and more importantly,\nthe associated anomalous transport, can be treated self-consistently in a\ntwo-fluid framework without any collision. By treating electrons and ions on an\nequal footing, the free energy allows the growth of an anomalous electron flow\nparallel to the background E field. We first present linear analyses of the\ninstability in the two-fluid 5- and 10-moment models, and compare them against\nthe fully-kinetic theory. At lower temperatures, the two-fluid fastest-growing\nmode is in good agreement with the kinetic result. Also, by including more\n($>=10$) moments, secondary (and possibly higher) unstable branches can be\nrecovered. The dependence of the instability on various parameters is also\nexplored. We then carry out direct numerical simulations of the cross-field\nsetup using the 5-moment model. The growth of the instability and the anomalous\ntransport is confirmed. Finally, 5-moment and Vlasov simulations using\nidentical parameters in the lower-temperature regime are performed, showing\nreasonable agreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 04:25:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 00:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

It\ncan be solved via the maximum weight matching and edit distances model. We\ndesign several kinds of melody representations and the similarity computation\nmethods according to the music theory. The proposed method can deal with the\nshift, swapping, transposition, and tempo variance problems in music\nplagiarism. It can also effectively pick out the local similar regions from two\nmusical pieces with relatively low global similarity. We collect a new music\nplagiarism dataset from real legally-judged music plagiarism cases and conduct\ndetailed ablation studies. Experimental results prove the excellent performance\nof the proposed algorithm.

This kind of\nnon-uniform excitation cannot be described by the single-mode approximation.\nFurthermore, to study the long-time resonant dynamics beyond the linear\nanalysis, we numerically solve the one-dimensional spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation, finding that the nonresonant hydrodynamic variables also grow at\nwavelengths of even multiples of the resonant one due to the nonlinear effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 07:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

For the sake\nof simplicity, the focus is on an antiplane problem for a half-space for an\nexponential kernel. First, a surface loading in the form of a travelling\nharmonic wave is studied. This provides a counter-example, revealing that\nwithin the framework of Eringen's theory the solution to the differential model\ndoes not satisfy the equation of motion in nonlocal stresses underlying the\nrelated integral formulation. A more general differential setup, starting from\nsingularly perturbed equations expressing the local stresses through the\nnonlocal ones, is then investigated. It is emphasized that the transformation\nof the original integral formulation to the differential one in question is\nonly possible provided that two additional conditions on nonlocal stresses hold\non the surface. As a result, the formulated problem subject to three boundary\nconditions appears to be ill-posed. Next, the asymptotic solution of the\nsingularly perturbed problem, subject to a prescribed stress on the boundary,\ntogether with only one of the aforementioned extra conditions, is obtained at a\nsmall internal size. Three-term expansion is obtained, leading to a boundary\nvalue problem in local stresses over interior domain. The associated\ndifferential equations are identical to those proposed by Eringen, however, the\nderived effective boundary condition incorporates the effect of a nonlocal\nboundary layer which has previously been ignored. Moreover, the calculated\nnonlocal correction to the classical antiplane problem for an elastic\nhalf-space, coming from the boundary conditions is by order of magnitude\ngreater than that appearing in the equations of motion. Finally, it is shown\nthat the proposed effective condition supports an antiplane surface wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 08:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

In this paper, based on\nfirst-principles calculations, we performed a comprehensive study on the phonon\ntransport properties of 2D GaX (X = N, P, and As) with planar or buckled\nhoneycomb structures. The thermal conductivity of GaP (1.52 Wm-1K-1) is found\nunexpectedly ultra-low, which is in sharp contrast to GaN and GaAs despite\ntheir similar honeycomb geometry structure. Based on PJTE theory, GaP and GaAs\nstabilize in buckling structure, different from the planar structure of GaN.\nCompared to GaN and GaAs, strong phonon-phonon scattering is found in GaP due\nto the strongest phonon anharmonicity. Given electronic structures, deep\ninsight is gained into the phonon transport that the delocalization of\nelectrons in GaP is restricted due to the buckling structure. Thus, non-bonding\nlone pair electrons of P atoms induce nonlinear electrostatic forces upon\nthermal agitation, leading to increased phonon anharmonicity in the lattice,\nthus reducing thermal conductivity.

In the limit of zero mass, its\nparity-time symmetry enforces the Dirac fermion in the momentum space, which is\ncomposed of two Weyl fermions with opposite chirality, to be non-chiral.\nInspired by the flavor symmetry in particle physics, we theoretically propose a\nmassless Dirac-like equation yet linking two Weyl fields with the identical\nchirality by assuming SU(2) isospin symmetry, independent of the space-time\nrotation exchanging the two fields. Dramatically, such symmetry is hidden in\ncertain solid-state spin-1/2 systems with negligible spin-orbit coupling, where\nthe spin degree of freedom is decoupled with the lattice. Therefore, the\nexistence of the corresponding quasiparticle, dubbed as flavor Weyl fermion,\ncannot be explained by the conventional (magnetic) space group framework. The\nfour-fold degenerate flavor Weyl fermion manifests linear dispersion and a\nChern number of 2, leading to a robust network of topologically protected Fermi\narcs throughout the Brillouin zone.

There are newly discovered GCs in the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf\ngalaxy, that can be used as probes of the accretion event onto the Milky Way\n(MW). Our main aim is to characterize the Sgr GC system by measuring its main\nphysical parameters. We build the optical and near-IR color-magnitude diagrams\n(CMDs) for 21 new Sgr GCs using the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea Extended\nSurvey (VVVX) near-IR database combined with the Gaia EDR3 optical database. We\nderive metallicities and ages for all targets, using the isochrone-fitting\nmethod and the RGB-slope and metallicity relation. The total luminosities are\ncalculated both in the near-IR and in the optical. We construct the metallicity\ndistribution (MD), the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF), and the\nage-metallicity relation for the Sgr GC system. We find 17 metal-rich GCs with\n-0.9<[Fe/H]<-0.3, 4 metal-poor GCs with -2.0<[Fe/H]<-1.1 in the new Sgr GC\nsample. Even though our age estimates are rough, we find that the metal-poor\nGCs are consistent with an old population with an average age of ~13 Gyr, while\nthe metal-rich GCs show a wider age range, between 6-8 Gyr and 10-13 Gyr. We\ncompare the MD and the GCLF for the Sgr GC system with those of the MW, M31 and\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC) galaxies. We conclude that the majority of the\nmetal-rich GCs are located within the main body of Sgr galaxy. We confirm that\nthe GCLF is not a universal distribution, since the Sgr GCLF peaks at fainter\nluminosities than the GCLFs of the MW, M31 and LMC. The MD shows a\ndouble-peaked distribution, and we note that the metal-rich population looks\nlike the MW bulge GCs. We compared our results with the literature concluding\nthat the Sgr progenitor could have been a reasonably large galaxy able to\nretain the SNe ejecta, thus enriching its ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 10:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

We thus obtain a highly\nefficient parallel skyline algorithm named SkyCell, taking advantage of the\nparallelization power of graphics processing units. Experimental results\nconfirm the effectiveness and efficiency of SkyCell -- it outperforms\nstate-of-the-art algorithms consistently and by up to over two orders of\nmagnitude in the computation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 10:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

Reed and Seymour showed in 2004 that Hadwiger's\nconjecture is true for line graphs. We investigate this conjecture on the\nclosely related class of total graphs. The total graph of $G$, denoted by\n$T(G)$, is defined on the vertex set $V(G)\\sqcup E(G)$ with $c_1,c_2\\in\nV(G)\\sqcup E(G)$ adjacent whenever $c_1$ and $c_2$ are adjacent to or incident\non each other in $G$. We first show that there exists a constant $C$ such that,\nif the connectivity of $G$ is at least $C$, then Hadwiger's conjecture is true\nfor $T(G)$. The total chromatic number $\\chi\"(G)$ of a graph $G$ is defined to\nbe equal to the chromatic number of its total graph. That is,\n$\\chi\"(G)=\\chi(T(G))$. Another well-known conjecture in graph theory, the total\ncoloring conjecture or TCC, states that for every graph $G$,\n$\\chi\"(G)\\leq\\Delta(G)+2$, where $\\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of $G$. We\nshow that if a weaker version of the total coloring conjecture (weak TCC)\nnamely, $\\chi\"(G)\\leq\\Delta(G)+3$, is true for a class of graphs $\\mathcal{F}$\nthat is closed under the operation of taking subgraphs, then Hadwiger's\nconjecture is true for the class of total graphs of graphs in $\\mathcal{F}$.\nThis motivated us to look for classes of graphs that satisfy weak TCC. It may\nbe noted that a complete proof of TCC for even 4-colorable graphs (in fact even\nfor planar graphs) has remained elusive even after decades of effort; but weak\nTCC can be proved easily for 4-colorable graphs. We noticed that in spite of\nthe interest in studying $\\chi\"(G)$ in terms of $\\chi(G)$ right from the\ninitial days, weak TCC is not proven to be true for $k$-colorable graphs even\nfor $k=5$. In the second half of the paper, we make a contribution to the\nliterature on total coloring by proving that $\\chi\"(G)\\leq\\Delta(G)+3$ for\nevery 5-colorable graph $G$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 10:24:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2021 19:44:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 10:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Within this scope, MarsExplorer, an openai-gym compatible\nenvironment tailored to exploration/coverage of unknown areas, is presented.\nMarsExplorer translates the original robotics problem into a Reinforcement\nLearning setup that various off-the-shelf algorithms can tackle. Any learned\npolicy can be straightforwardly applied to a robotic platform without an\nelaborate simulation model of the robot's dynamics to apply a different\nlearning/adaptation phase. One of its core features is the controllable\nmulti-dimensional procedural generation of terrains, which is the key for\nproducing policies with strong generalization capabilities. Four different\nstate-of-the-art RL algorithms (A3C, PPO, Rainbow, and SAC) are trained on the\nMarsExplorer environment, and a proper evaluation of their results compared to\nthe average human-level performance is reported. In the follow-up experimental\nanalysis, the effect of the multi-dimensional difficulty setting on the\nlearning capabilities of the best-performing algorithm (PPO) is analyzed. A\nmilestone result is the generation of an exploration policy that follows the\nHilbert curve without providing this information to the environment or\nrewarding directly or indirectly Hilbert-curve-like trajectories. The\nexperimental analysis is concluded by evaluating PPO learned policy algorithm\nside-by-side with frontier-based exploration strategies. A study on the\nperformance curves revealed that PPO-based policy was capable of performing\nadaptive-to-the-unknown-terrain sweeping without leaving expensive-to-revisit\nareas uncovered, underlying the capability of RL-based methodologies to tackle\nexploration tasks efficiently.

In this work, we\nprovide galaxy cluster candidates in the $AKARI$ NEP field with the minimum\nrequisites based only on coordinates and photometric redshift (photo-$z$) of\ngalaxies. We used galaxies detected in 5 optical bands ($g$, $r$, $i$, $z$, and\n$Y$) by the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), assisted with $u$-band from\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) MegaPrime/MegaCam, and IRAC1 and IRAC2\nbands from the $Spitzer$ space telescope for photo-$z$ estimation. We\ncalculated the local density around every galaxy using the 10$^{th}$-nearest\nneighbourhood. Cluster candidates were determined by applying the\nfriends-of-friends algorithm to over-densities. 88 cluster candidates\ncontaining 4390 member galaxies below redshift 1.1 in 5.4 deg$^2$ have been\ndetected. The reliability of our method was examined through false detection\ntests, redshift uncertainty tests, and applications on the COSMOS data, giving\nfalse detection rates of 0.01 to 0.05 and recovery rate of 0.9 at high\nrichness. 3 X-ray clusters previously observed by $ROSAT$ and $Chandra$ were\nrecovered. The cluster galaxies show higher stellar mass and lower star\nformation rate (SFR) compared to the field galaxies in two-sample Z-tests.\nThese cluster candidates are useful for environmental studies of galaxy\nevolution and future astronomical surveys in the NEP, where $AKARI$ has\nperformed unique 9-band mid-infrared photometry for tens of thousands of\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 11:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

A multi-period optimal PSO under\nuncertainty is formulated using the chance-constrained optimization (CCO)\nmodeling paradigm, where the constraints include the nonlinear energy storage\nand AC power flow models. Based on the emerging scenario optimization method\nwhich does not rely on pre-known probability distribution functions, this paper\ndevelops a novel solution method for this challenging CCO problem. The proposed\nmeth-od is computationally effective for mainly two reasons. First, the\noriginal AC power flow constraints are approximated by a set of\nlearning-assisted quadratic convex inequalities based on a generalized least\nabsolute shrinkage and selection operator. Second, considering the physical\npatterns of data and motived by learning-based sampling, the strategic sampling\nmethod is developed to significantly reduce the required number of scenarios\nthrough different sampling strategies. The simulation results on IEEE standard\nsystems indicate that 1) the proposed strategic sampling significantly improves\nthe computational efficiency of the scenario-based approach for solving the\nchance-constrained optimal PSO problem, 2) the data-driven convex approximation\nof power flow can be promising alternatives of nonlinear and nonconvex AC power\nflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 11:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

Similarly to other\nclassical and well consolidated approaches, our method compares the relative\nedge density of the subgraphs induced by each class with the corresponding\nexpected relative edge density under a null model. The novelty of our approach\nconsists in prescribing an endogenous null model, namely, the sample space of\nthe null model is built on the input network itself. This allows us to give\nexact explicit expression for the z-score of the relative edge density of each\nclass as well as other related statistics. The z-scores directly quantify the\nstatistical significance of the observed homophily via Tchebycheff inequality.\nThe expression of each z-score is entered by the network structure through\nbasic combinatorial invariant such as the number of subgraphs with two spanning\nedges. Each z-score is computed in O(n + m) time for a network with n nodes and\nm edges. This leads to an overall efficient computational method for assesing\nhomophily. We complement the analysis of homophily/heterophily by considering\nz-scores of the number of isolated nodes in the subgraphs induced by each\nclass, that are computed in O(nm) time.

The generalization of these concepts to open quantum\nsystems described by a Markovian master equation of Lindblad type turns out to\nbe non-trivial: On the one hand, already for a two-level system two different\nphases can be distinguished, where the effective time-independent Floquet\ngenerator (describing the stroboscopic evolution) is either again Markovian and\nof Lindblad type or not.

Among them, the\nauxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (AC-GAN) has been widely\nused, but suffers from the problem of low intra-class diversity of the\ngenerated samples. The fundamental reason pointed out in this paper is that the\nclassifier of AC-GAN is generator-agnostic, which therefore cannot provide\ninformative guidance for the generator to approach the joint distribution,\nresulting in a minimization of the conditional entropy that decreases the\nintra-class diversity. Motivated by this understanding, we propose a novel\nconditional GAN with an auxiliary discriminative classifier (ADC-GAN) to\nresolve the above problem. Specifically, the proposed auxiliary discriminative\nclassifier becomes generator-aware by recognizing the class-labels of the real\ndata and the generated data discriminatively. Our theoretical analysis reveals\nthat the generator can faithfully learn the joint distribution even without the\noriginal discriminator, making the proposed ADC-GAN robust to the value of the\ncoefficient hyperparameter and the selection of the GAN loss, and stable during\ntraining.

Random graph models provide estimates for\nhow often certain subgraphs appear, which in turn can be tested against\nreal-world networks. These subgraph counts, however, crucially depend on the\nassumed degree distribution. Fitting a degree distribution to network data is\nchallenging, in particular for scale-free networks with power-law degrees. In\nthis paper we develop robust subgraph counts that do not depend on the entire\ndegree distribution, but only on the mean and mean absolute deviation (MAD),\nsummary statistics that are easy to obtain for most real-world networks. By\nsolving an optimization problem, we provide tight (the sharpest possible)\nbounds for the subgraph counts, for all possible subgraphs, and for all\nnetworks with degree distributions that share the same mean and MAD. We\nidentify the extremal random graph that attains the tight bounds as the graph\nwith a specific three-point degree distribution. We leverage the bounds to\nobtain robust scaling laws for how the numbers of subgraphs grow as function of\nthe network size. The scaling laws indicate that sparse power-law networks are\nnot the most extreme networks in terms of subgraph counts, but dense power-law\nnetworks are.

The planner provides each agent with a randomized recommendation\nthat may alter their beliefs and their action selection. We develop a novel\nrecommendation mechanism that views the planner's recommendation as a form of\ninstrumental variable (IV) that only affects an agents' action selection, but\nnot the observed rewards. We construct such IVs by carefully mapping the\nhistory -- the interactions between the planner and the previous agents -- to a\nrandom recommendation. Even though the initial agents may be completely\nnon-compliant, our mechanism can incentivize compliance over time, thereby\nenabling the estimation of the treatment effect of each treatment, and\nminimizing the cumulative regret of the planner whose goal is to identify the\noptimal treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:10:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 04:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-29"}

We show that Zak's phase can be divided in two\nterms: a global phase required to make the Bloch wave periodic in the Brillouin\nzone and an internal phase which measures the relative delay of the different\nFourier terms within the Brillouin zone. While the former phase is dependent on\nthe origin of coordinates of the unit cell, the latter is independent of it, so\nthat it can be interpreted as an internal property of the band itself. We show\nthat this internal phase is always zero for a symmetric crystal while it can\ntake any value when this symmetry is broken, showing therefore that it can be\ninterpreted as a measure of the assymetry of the band. Since for a symmetric\ncrystal Zak's phase is entirely determined by the global part, we show that\nthis can be easily calculated by means of the parity of the Fourier terms at\nthe center and edge of the Brillouin zone, being therefore unnecessary the\nintegration of the modes through the unit cell and the entire Brillouin zone.\nWe provide numerical examples analyzing the internal part for both electronic\nand classical waves (acoustic or photonic). We analyze the weakest electronic\npotential capable of presenting asymmetry, as well as the double-Dirac delta\npotential, and in both examples it is found that the internal phase varies\ncontinuously as a function of a symmetry-control parameter, but it is zero when\nthe crystal is symmetric. For classical waves, the layered material is\nanalyzed.

While most recent DRL-based methods have focused on\nmaximizing the throughput or minimizing the average travel time of the\nvehicles, the fairness of the traffic signal controllers has often been\nneglected.

This approach is used to analyze the behavior of flux reconstruction\n(FR) discretization, including the influence of polynomial order and\npenalization parameter on numerical errors and stability. Through a\nsemi-discrete analysis, we find that the inclusion of IBM adds additional\ndissipation without changing significantly the dispersion of the original\nnumerical discretization. This agrees with the physical intuition that in this\ntype of approach, the solid wall is modelled as a porous medium with vanishing\nviscosity. From a stability point view, the selection of penalty parameter can\nbe analyzed based on a fully-discrete analysis, which leads to practical\nguidelines on the selection of penalization parameter. Numerical experiments\nindicate that the penalization term needs to be increased to damp oscillations\ninside the solid (i.e. porous region), which leads to undesirable time step\nrestrictions. As an alternative, we propose to include a second-order term in\nthe solid for the no-slip wall boundary condition. Results show that by adding\na second-order term we improve the overall accuracy with relaxed time step\nrestriction. This indicates that the optimal value of the penalization\nparameter and the second-order damping can be carefully chosen to obtain a more\naccurate scheme. Finally, the approximated relationship between these two\nparameters is obtained and used as a guideline to select the optimum penalty\nterms in a Navier-Stokes solver, to simulate flow past a cylinder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 15:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

Using\nnonlinear optimization together with energy bisection, we have found that the\nminimal energy threshold for obtaining spatially-patterned turbulence scales\nwith $Re^{-8.5}$ for $Re>1000$. The minimal seed is constituted by a localized\nspot-like structure surrounded by a low-amplitude large-scale quadrupolar\nstructure filling the whole domain. This minimal-energy perturbation of the\nlaminar flow has dominant wavenumbers equal to $0.15$ and $4$ in the streamwise\nand spanwise directions, respectively, and is characterized by a more marked\nspatial localization when the Reynolds number increases. At $Re \\lesssim 1200$,\nthe minimal seed evolves in time creating an isolated oblique band.

A similar evolution is found also at low\n$Re$ for non-minimal optimal perturbations. This highlights two different\nmechanisms of formation of turbulent bands in channel flow, depending on the\nReynolds number and initial energy of the perturbation.

It is entirely\nresponsible for the metabolism of photoreceptors, which each of us feels every\nday and senses when its deficits begin. Optical selection of choroid and\nchoriocapillaris by currently used imaging techniques such as indocyanine\nangiography, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy or optical coherence tomography\n(OCT) is limited by insufficient lateral resolution, depth of penetration and\nthe presence of strong light scattering effects. Here we report a\nSpatio-Temporal Optical Coherence Tomography (STOC-T) that maintains\nmicroscopic quality of in vivo reconstructions of anatomical layers when\nimaging chorioretinal cross-sections in a coronal anatomic plane. STOC-T\nperforms high definition volumetric imaging in all projections, enabling\nreconstruction of anatomical details of the retinal and choroidal layers with\nunprecedented quality by using an extra phase randomization for low spatial\ncoherence.

This inspires\nus to replace \"scatterplots of points\" with \"scatterplots of curves\" to\nsimultaneously visualize relationships across an entire dataset. Since spaces\nof curves are infinite dimensional, scatterplots of curves avoid the \"lossy\"\nnature of scatterplots of points. In particular, if two points are close in a\nscatterplot of points derived from high-dimensional data, it does not generally\nfollow that the two associated data points are close in the data space.\nStandard Andrews plots provide scatterplots of curves that perfectly preserve\nEuclidean distances, but simultaneous visualization of these graphs over an\nentire dataset produces visual clutter because graphs of functions generally\noverlap in 2D. We mitigate this visual clutter issue by constructing\ncomputationally inexpensive 3D extensions of Andrews plots. First, we construct\noptimally smooth 3D Andrews plots by considering linear isometries from\nEuclidean data spaces to spaces of planar parametric curves. We rigorously\nparametrize the linear isometries that produce (on average) optimally smooth\ncurves over a given dataset. This parameterization of optimal isometries\nreveals many degrees of freedom, and (using recent results on generalized Gauss\nsums) we identify a particular member of this set which admits an asymptotic\n\"tour\" property that avoids certain local degeneracies as well. Finally, we\nconstruct unit-length 3D curves (filaments) by numerically solving\nFrenet-Serret systems given data from these 3D Andrews plots.

Recent observations suggest that some X-ray\npulsating ULXs have Be-type donors, and some of them occupy the same region as\nBe-type high-mass X-ray binaries (Be-HMXBs) on the Corbet diagram, which\nreveals the relation between spin and orbital periods.

We show that this\ngenerative approach exhibits promising results in language grounding without\npre-specifying visual categories under low resource settings. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that this approach is generalizable to multilingual, highly varied\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 20:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

Emotion uncertainty has been\npreviously interpreted as inter-rater disagreement among multiple annotators.\nIn this paper, we consider a more common and challenging scenario: modeling\nemotion uncertainty when only single emotion labels are available. From a\nBayesian perspective, we propose to use deep ensembles to capture uncertainty\nfor multiple emotion descriptors, i.e., action units, discrete expression\nlabels and continuous descriptors. We further apply iterative\nself-distillation. Iterative distillation over multiple generations\nsignificantly improves performance in both emotion recognition and uncertainty\nestimation.

To\nachieve this goal, we propose a transformer-based network, called SignLookup.\nWe employ 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract spatio-temporal\nrepresentations from video clips. To solve the temporal scale discrepancies\nbetween the query and the target videos, we construct multiple queries from a\nsingle video clip using different frame-level strides. Self-attention is\napplied across these query clips to simulate a continuous scale space. We also\nutilize another self-attention module on the target video to learn the\ncontextual within the sequence. Finally a mutual-attention is used to match the\ntemporal scales to localize the query within the target sequence. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can not only reliably\nidentify isolated signs in continuous videos, regardless of the signers'\nappearance, but can also generalize to different sign languages.
