Nevertheless, most of existing designs directly employ\nself-attention over a 2D feature map to obtain the attention matrix based on\npairs of isolated queries and keys at each spatial location, but leave the rich\ncontexts among neighbor keys under-exploited. In this work, we design a novel\nTransformer-style module, i.e., Contextual Transformer (CoT) block, for visual\nrecognition. Such design fully capitalizes on the contextual information among\ninput keys to guide the learning of dynamic attention matrix and thus\nstrengthens the capacity of visual representation. Technically, CoT block first\ncontextually encodes input keys via a $3\\times3$ convolution, leading to a\nstatic contextual representation of inputs. We further concatenate the encoded\nkeys with input queries to learn the dynamic multi-head attention matrix\nthrough two consecutive $1\\times1$ convolutions. The learnt attention matrix is\nmultiplied by input values to achieve the dynamic contextual representation of\ninputs. The fusion of the static and dynamic contextual representations are\nfinally taken as outputs. Our CoT block is appealing in the view that it can\nreadily replace each $3\\times3$ convolution in ResNet architectures, yielding a\nTransformer-style backbone named as Contextual Transformer Networks (CoTNet).\nThrough extensive experiments over a wide range of applications (e.g., image\nrecognition, object detection and instance segmentation), we validate the\nsuperiority of CoTNet as a stronger backbone.

While a\nlinear utility score is one of the most widely used approach in BRA, it is\nrecognised that it can result in counter-intuitive decisions, for example,\nrecommending a treatment with extremely low benefits or high risks.

Nevertheless, the current bounds are still plagued by\nlarge experimental uncertainties, but will be improved with more precise\nmeasurements from Belle II as well as the proposed Tera-Z and STCF facilities.\nAssuming further that the non-standard scalar and tensor interactions originate\nfrom a weakly-coupled heavy new physics well above the electroweak scale, the\n$SU(2)_L$ invariance of the resulting SMEFT Lagrangian would indicate that very\nstrong limits on $\\mathrm{Im}[\\hat{\\epsilon}_S]$ and\n$\\mathrm{Im}[\\hat{\\epsilon}_T]$ could also be obtained from the neutron\nelectric dipole moment and the $D^0-\\bar{D}^0$ mixing. With the bounds from\nthese processes taken into account, it is then found that, unless there exist\nextraordinary cancellations between the new physics contributions, neither the\nscalar nor the tensor interaction can produce any significant effects on the\n$CP$ asymmetries in the processes considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 16:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

The free-slip wall imposes a mirror symmetry, which impedes\ncertain instabilities and at sufficiently large Reynolds numbers leads to the\nformation of a half-tiara of vortices. Impact against a no-slip wall results in\nthe process where a secondary vortex ring is formed after the ejection of the\nresulting boundary layer.

Gravitational waves (GWs) are produced at frequencies between 3\nnHz and 50 mHz for reheating temperatures between 150 MeV and 3x10^5 GeV,\nrespectively. At and below the peak frequency, the stress spectrum is always\nfound to be that of white noise. This implies a linear increase of GW energy\nper logarithmic wavenumber interval, instead of a cubic one, as previously\nthought. Both in the helical and nonhelical cases, the GW spectrum is followed\nby a sharp drop for frequencies above the respective peak frequency. In this\nmagnetogenesis scenario, the presence of a helical term extends the peak of the\nGW spectrum and therefore also the position of the aforementioned drop toward\nlarger frequencies compared to the case without helicity. This might make a\ndifference in it being detectable with space interferometers. The efficiency of\nGW production is found to be almost the same as in the nonhelical case, and\nindependent of the reheating temperature, provided the electromagnetic energy\nat the end of reheating is fixed to be a certain fraction of the radiation\nenergy density. Also, contrary to the case without helicity, the electric\nenergy is now less than the magnetic energy during reheating. The fractional\ncircular polarization is found to be nearly hundred per cent in a certain range\nbelow the peak frequency range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 17:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

These simulations\ntrack the motion of particles representing real atmospheric atoms and/or\nmolecules subject to collisions, the object's gravity, and external influences.\nBecause particles can end up in very large ballistic orbits, upper boundary\nconditions (UBC) are typically used to limit the domain size thereby reducing\nthe time for the atmosphere to reach steady-state. In the absence of a clear\naltitude at which all molecules are removed, such as a Hill sphere, an often\nused condition is to choose an altitude at which collisions become infrequent\nso that particles on escape trajectories are removed. The remainder are then\neither specularly reflected back into the simulation domain or their ballistic\ntrajectories are calculated analytically or explicitly tracked so they\neventually re-enter the domain. Here we examine the effect of the choice of the\nUBC on the escape rate and the structure of the atmosphere near the nominal\nexobase in the convenient and frequently used 1D spherically symmetric\napproximation. Using Callisto as the example body, we show that the commonly\nused specular reflection UBC can lead to significant uncertainties when\nsimulating a species with a lifetime comparable to or longer than a dynamical\ntime scale, such as an overestimation of escape rates and an inflated\nexosphere. Therefore, although specular reflection is convenient, the molecular\nlifetimes and body's dynamical time scales need to be considered even when\nimplementing the convenient 1D spherically symmetric simulations in order to\naccurately estimate the escape rate and the density and temperature structure\nin the transition regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 17:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

In the setting of non-smooth spaces with\nRicci curvature lower bounds (more precisely RCD(K,N) metric measure spaces):\n  - we develop an intrinsic theory of Laplacian bounds in viscosity sense and\nin a pointwise, heat flow related, sense, showing their equivalence also with\nLaplacian bounds in distributional sense;\n  - relying on these tools, we establish a PDE principle relating lower Ricci\ncurvature bounds to the preservation of Laplacian lower bounds under the\nevolution via the $p$-Hopf-Lax semigroup, for general exponents\n$p\\in[1,\\infty)$. This principle admits a broad range of applications, going\nmuch beyond the topic of the present paper;\n  - we prove sharp Laplacian bounds on the distance function from a set\n(locally) minimizing the perimeter with a flexible technique, not involving any\nregularity theory; this corresponds to vanishing mean curvature in the smooth\nsetting and encodes also information about the second variation of the area;\n  - we initiate a regularity theory for boundaries of sets (locally) minimizing\nthe perimeter, obtaining sharp dimension estimates for their singular sets,\nquantitative estimates of independent interest even in the smooth setting and\ntopological regularity away from the singular set.\n  The class of RCD(K,N) metric measure spaces includes as remarkable\nsub-classes: measured Gromov-Hausdorff limits of smooth manifolds with lower\nRicci curvature bounds and finite dimensional Alexandrov spaces with lower\nsectional curvature bounds.

This paper goes\nbeyond voice identity and presents a neural architecture that allows the\nmanipulation of voice attributes (e.g., gender and age). Leveraging the latest\nadvances on adversarial learning of structured speech representation, a novel\nstructured neural network is proposed in which multiple auto-encoders are used\nto encode speech as a set of idealistically independent linguistic and\nextra-linguistic representations, which are learned adversariarly and can be\nmanipulated during VC.

A common application is in numerical weather prediction where a\nprevious forecast and atmospheric observations are used to obtain the initial\nconditions for a numerical weather forecast. In four-dimensional variational\ndata assimilation (4D-Var), the problem is formulated as a nonlinear\nleast-squares problem, usually solved using a variant of the classical\nGauss-Newton (GN) method. However, we show that GN may not converge if poorly\ninitialised.

The\ndifficulties GN encounters may lead to inaccurate initial state conditions for\nsubsequent forecasts. To overcome this, we apply two convergent GN variants\n(line search and regularisation) to the long time-window 4D-Var problem and\ninvestigate the cases where they locate a more accurate estimate compared to GN\nwithin a given budget of computational time and cost. We show that these\nmethods are able to improve the estimate of the initial state, which may lead\nto a more accurate forecast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 17:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

The ratio\nbetween the maximum and the minimum flux spectra of 2MASS J22081363+2921215\nshows a weak wavelength dependence and a potential enhanced variability\namplitude in the alkali lines.

Regarding the\nbehaviour of the other $s$-process elements like yttrium, zirconium, lanthanum,\nand cerium, there is general disagreement in the literature. In this work we\nexpand upon our previous analysis of a sample of five young open clusters\n(IC2391, IC2602, IC4665, NGC2516, and NGC2547) and one star-forming region\n(NGC2264), with the aim of determining abundances of different neutron-capture\nelements, mainly CuI, SrI, SrII, YII, ZrII, BaII, LaII, and CeII. We analysed\nhigh-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of 23 solar-type stars observed\nwithin the \\textit{Gaia}-ESO survey. We find that our clusters have solar\n[Cu/Fe] within the uncertainties, while we confirm the super-solar [Ba/Fe]\nvalues (from +0.22 to +0.64 dex). Our analysis also points to mildly enhanced\n[Y/Fe] values (from 0 and +0.3 dex). For the other $s$-process elements we find\nthat [X/Fe] ratios are solar at all ages. It is not possible to reconcile the\nanomalous behaviour of Ba and Y at young ages with standard stellar yields and\nGalactic chemical evolution model predictions. Thus, we explore different\npossible scenarios related to the behaviour of spectral lines, from the\nsensitivity to the presence of magnetic fields to the first ionisation\npotential effect. We also investigate the possibility that they may arise from\nalterations of the structure of the stellar photosphere due to higher levels of\nactivity in such young stars. We are still unable to explain these\nenhancements, but we suggest that other elements (i.e. La) might be more\nreliable tracer of the $s$-process at young ages and encourage further\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

The analysis is in terms of the Kraus operators that\ndevelop over the course of a continuous isotropic measurement. The Kraus\noperators represent elements of the Lie group $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$, a\ncomplex version of the usual unitary operators that represent elements of\n$\\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Consequently, the associated POVM elements represent points\nin the 3-hyperboloid $\\mathrm{SU}(2)\\backslash\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$. Three\nequivalent stochastic techniques, path integral, diffusion (Fokker-Planck)\nequation, and stochastic differential equations, are applied to show that the\nPOVM quickly limits to the SCS POVM. We apply two basic mathematical tools to\nthe Kraus operators, the Maurer-Cartan form, modified for stochastic\napplications, and the Cartan decomposition associated with the symmetric pair\n$\\mathrm{SU}(2)\\subset\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$. Informed by these tools, the\nthree stochastic techniques are applied directly to the Kraus operators in a\nrepresentation independent, and thus geometric, way (independent of any\nspectral information about the spin components).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 2021 21:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

These observations\nsuggest that these shells may be produced by isotropic stellar wind feedback\nfrom young main-sequence stars. However, the driving mechanism for these shells\nremains uncertain because the momentum injected by winds is too low to explain\ntheir sizes and dynamics due to their low mass-loss rates. However, these\nstudies neglect how the wind kinetic energy is transferred to the ISM and\ninstead assume it is instantly lost via radiation, suggesting that these shells\nare momentum-driven. Intermediate-mass stars have fast ($v_w \\gtrsim 1000$\nkm/s) stellar winds and therefore the energy injected by winds should produce\nenergy-driven adiabatic wind bubbles that are larger than momentum-driven wind\nbubbles. Here, we explore if energy-driven wind feedback can produce the\nobserved shells by performing a series of 3D magneto-hydrodynamic simulations\nof wind feedback from intermediate-mass and high-mass stars that are placed in\na magnetized, turbulent molecular cloud. We find that, for the high-mass stars\nmodeled, energy-driven wind feedback produces $\\sim$pc scale wind bubbles in\nmolecular clouds that agree with the observed shell sizes but winds from\nintermediate-mass stars can not produce similar shells because of their lower\nmass-loss rates and velocities. Therefore, such shells must be driven by other\nfeedback processes inherent to low- and intermediate-mass star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 18:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

Aberrations that\nchange over time can mimic the line centroid motion of a Doppler shift,\nintroducing radial velocity (RV) uncertainty that increases time-series\nvariability. Even when instrument drifts are tracked using a precise wavelength\ncalibration source, barycentric motion of the Earth leads to a wavelength shift\nof stellar light causing a translation of the spectrum across the focal plane\narray by many pixels. The wavelength shift allows absorption lines to\nexperience different optical propagation paths and aberrations over observing\nepochs. We use physical optics propagation simulations to study the impact of\naberrations on precise Doppler measurements made by diffraction-limited,\nhigh-resolution spectrographs. We quantify the uncertainties that\ncross-correlation techniques introduce in the presence of aberrations and\nbarycentric RV shifts.

Because of all these adverse features, the free-space\noptical (FSO) channel is more difficult to study than a stable fiber-based\nlink. For the same reasons, only recently it has been possible to establish the\nultimate performances achievable in quantum communications via free-space\nchannels, together with practical rates for continuous variable (CV) quantum\nkey distribution (QKD). Differently from previous literature, mainly focused on\nthe regime of weak turbulence, this work considers the FSO channel in the more\nchallenging regime of moderate-to-strong turbulence, where effects of beam\nwidening and breaking are more important than beam wandering. This regime may\noccur in long-distance free-space links on the ground, in uplink to\nhigh-altitude platform systems (HAPS) and, more interestingly, in downlink from\nnear-horizon satellites.

The conditions required for NH3 to accumulate in the\natmosphere are, however, stringent. NH3's high water solubility and high\nbio-useability likely prevent NH3 from accumulating in the atmosphere to\ndetectable levels unless life is a net source of NH3 and produces enough NH3 to\nsaturate the surface sinks. Only then can NH3 accumulate in the atmosphere with\na reasonable surface production flux.\n  For the highly favorable planetary scenario of terrestrial planets with\nH2-dominated atmospheres orbiting M dwarf stars (M5V), we find a minimum of\nabout 5 ppm column-averaged mixing ratio is needed for NH3 to be detectable\nwith JWST, considering a 10 ppm JWST systematic noise floor. When the surface\nis saturated with NH3 (i.e., there are no NH3-removal reactions on the\nsurface), the required biological surface flux to reach 5 ppm is on the order\nof 10^10 molecules cm-2 s-1, comparable to the terrestrial biological\nproduction of CH4. However, when the surface is unsaturated with NH3, due to\nadditional sinks present on the surface, life would have to produce NH3 at\nsurface flux levels on the order of 10^15 molecules cm-2 s-1 (approx. 4.5x10^6\nTg year-1). This value is roughly 20,000 times greater than the biological\nproduction of NH3 on Earth and about 10,000 times greater than Earth's CH4\nbiological production.\n  Volatile amines have similar solubilities and reactivities to NH3 and hence\nshare NH3's weaknesses and strengths as a biosignature. Finally, to establish\nNH3 as a biosignature gas, we must rule out mini-Neptunes with deep\natmospheres, where temperatures and pressures are high enough for NH3's\natmospheric production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 18:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

Dynamical external control of nuclear state population has\nproven so far very challenging, despite ground-breaking incentives for a clean\nand efficient energy storage solution. Here, we describe a protocol to achieve\nthe external control of the isomeric nuclear decay by using electrons whose\nwavefunction has been especially designed and reshaped on demand. Recombination\nof these electrons into the atomic shell around the isomer can lead to the\ncontrolled release of the stored nuclear energy. On the example of $^{93m}$Mo,\nwe show that the use of tailored electron vortex beams increases the depletion\nby four orders of magnitude compared to the spontaneous nuclear decay of the\nisomer. Furthermore, specific orbitals can sustain an enhancement of the\nrecombination cross section for vortex electron beams by as much as six orders\nof magnitude, providing a handle for manipulating the capture mechanism. These\nfindings open new prospects for controlling the interplay between atomic and\nnuclear degrees of freedom, with potential energy-related and high-energy\nradiation sources applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 19:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

However, U-Net applies\nskip connections to merge semantically different low- and high-level\nconvolutional features, resulting in not only blurred feature maps, but also\nover- and under-segmented target regions. To address these limitations, we\npropose a simple, yet effective end-to-end depthwise encoder-decoder fully\nconvolutional network architecture, called Sharp U-Net, for binary and\nmulti-class biomedical image segmentation. The key rationale of Sharp U-Net is\nthat instead of applying a plain skip connection, a depthwise convolution of\nthe encoder feature map with a sharpening kernel filter is employed prior to\nmerging the encoder and decoder features, thereby producing a sharpened\nintermediate feature map of the same size as the encoder map. Using this\nsharpening filter layer, we are able to not only fuse semantically less\ndissimilar features, but also to smooth out artifacts throughout the network\nlayers during the early stages of training. Our extensive experiments on six\ndatasets show that the proposed Sharp U-Net model consistently outperforms or\nmatches the recent state-of-the-art baselines in both binary and multi-class\nsegmentation tasks, while adding no extra learnable parameters.

The main challenge in adversarial attacks is to preserve low frequency\nimage content while minimally changing the most meaningful high frequency\ncontent. To address this, we formulate an optimization problem using time-scale\n(wavelet) representations as a dual space in three steps. First, we project\noriginal images into orthonormal sub-spaces for low and high scales via wavelet\ncoefficients.

Given a\ncollection of candidate GPS models, the outcome-adjusted balance measure\nimputes all baseline covariates by matching on each candidate model, and\nselects the model that minimizes a weighted sum of absolute mean differences\nbetween the imputed and original values of the covariates. The weights are\ndefined to leverage the covariate-outcome relationship, so that GPS models\nwithout optimal variable selection are penalized. Under appropriate\nassumptions, we show that the outcome-adjusted balance measure consistently\nselects the optimal GPS model, so that the resulting GPS matching estimator is\nasymptotically normal and efficient. We compare its finite sample performance\nwith existing measures in a simulation study. We illustrate an application of\nthe proposed methodology in the analysis of the Tutoring data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 21:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

In these settings,\nparticipants (workers) may not trust each other fully; for instance, a set of\ncompetitors may collaboratively train a machine learning model to detect fraud.\nThe workers provide local gradients that a central server uses to update a\nglobal model. This global model can be corrupted when Byzantine workers send\nmalicious gradients, which necessitates robust methods for aggregating\ngradients that mitigate the adverse effects of Byzantine inputs. Existing\nrobust aggregation algorithms are often computationally expensive and only\neffective under strict assumptions. In this paper, we introduce LayerwisE\nGradient AggregatTiOn (LEGATO), an aggregation algorithm that is, by contrast,\nscalable and generalizable. Informed by a study of layer-specific responses of\ngradients to Byzantine attacks, LEGATO employs a dynamic gradient reweighing\nscheme that is novel in its treatment of gradients based on layer-specific\nrobustness. We show that LEGATO is more computationally efficient than multiple\nstate-of-the-art techniques and more generally robust across a variety of\nattack settings in practice.

We propose a novel Binary Extended Gaussian Image (BEGI), which\nrepresents the point cloud surface normals of both object and robot fingers as\nsignals on a 2-sphere. Spherical harmonics are then used to estimate the\ncorrelation between fingers and object BEGIs. The resulting spectral\ncorrelation density function provides a similarity measure of gripper and\nobject surface normals.

First, cryogenic preamplification\nis implemented prior to transmission. Second, at the receiver side, a cryogenic\nloop antenna is placed inside the output port of the waveguide and coupled to\nan LC harmonic oscillator located outside the waveguide. The loop antenna\nconverts quantum microwave fields (which contain both signal and noise photons)\nto a quantum voltage across the coupled LC harmonic oscillator. The loop\nantenna detector at the receiver is designed to extensively suppress the\ninduced photons across the LC oscillator.

Therefore, it is necessary to devise systems to\nprevent accidents in advance and respond proactively, using potential risky\nsituations as one of the surrogate safety measurements. This study introduces a\nnew concept of a pedestrian safety system that combines the field and the\ncentralized processes. The system can warn of upcoming risks immediately in the\nfield and improve the safety of risk frequent areas by assessing the safety\nlevels of roads without actual collisions. In particular, this study focuses on\nthe latter by introducing a new analytical framework for a crosswalk safety\nassessment with behaviors of vehicle/pedestrian and environmental features. We\nobtain these behavioral features from actual traffic video footage in the city\nwith complete automatic processing. The proposed framework mainly analyzes\nthese behaviors in multidimensional perspectives by constructing a data cube\nstructure, which combines the LSTM based predictive collision risk estimation\nmodel and the on line analytical processing operations. From the PCR estimation\nmodel, we categorize the severity of risks as four levels and apply the\nproposed framework to assess the crosswalk safety with behavioral features. Our\nanalytic experiments are based on two scenarios, and the various descriptive\nresults are harvested the movement patterns of vehicles and pedestrians by road\nenvironment and the relationships between risk levels and car speeds. Thus, the\nproposed framework can support decision makers by providing valuable\ninformation to improve pedestrian safety for future accidents, and it can help\nus better understand their behaviors near crosswalks proactively. In order to\nconfirm the feasibility and applicability of the proposed framework, we\nimplement and apply it to actual operating CCTVs in Osan City, Korea.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 23:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

The combo probe-the combined\nsonic-hotfilm anemometer developed and tested over the last decade-has\ndemonstrated its ability to overcome this hurdle. The old-er generation had a\nlimited wind alignment range of 120 degrees and the in-situ calibration\nprocedure was human decision based.

Last-Mile\nTransportation Systems (LMTS), which have recently emerged, provide on-demand\nshared transportation. In this paper, we investigate the fleet sizing and\nallocation problem for the on-demand LMTS. Specifically, we consider the\nperspective of a last-mile service provider who wants to determine the number\nof servicing vehicles to allocate to multiple last-mile service regions in a\nparticular city. In each service region, passengers demanding last-mile\nservices arrive in batches, and allocated vehicles deliver passengers to their\nfinal destinations. The passenger demand (i.e., the size of each batch of\npassengers) is random and hard to predict in advance, especially with limited\ndata during the planning process.

For a robot to interact\neffectively and autonomously with humans, the coupling between techniques for\nhuman activity recognition, based on sensing information, and robot behaviour\nselection, based on decision-making mechanisms, is of paramount importance.\nHowever, most approaches to date consist of deterministic associations between\nthe recognised activities and the robot behaviours, neglecting the uncertainty\ninherent to sequential predictions in real-time applications. In this paper, we\naddress this gap by presenting a neurorobotics approach based on computational\nmodels that resemble neurophysiological aspects of living beings. This\nneurorobotics approach was compared to a non-bioinspired, heuristics-based\napproach. To evaluate both approaches, a robot simulation is developed, in\nwhich a mobile robot has to accomplish tasks according to the activity being\nperformed by the inhabitant of an intelligent home. The outcomes of each\napproach were evaluated according to the number of correct outcomes provided by\nthe robot. Results revealed that the neurorobotics approach is advantageous,\nespecially considering the computational models based on more complex animals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 01:25:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 20:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Existing color-guided depth map super-resolution\nmethods usually necessitate an extra branch to extract high-frequency detail\ninformation from RGB image to guide the low-resolution depth map\nreconstruction. However, because there are still some differences between the\ntwo modalities, direct information transmission in the feature dimension or\nedge map dimension cannot achieve satisfactory result, and may even trigger\ntexture copying in areas where the structures of the RGB-D pair are\ninconsistent. Inspired by the multi-task learning, we propose a joint learning\nnetwork of depth map super-resolution (DSR) and monocular depth estimation\n(MDE) without introducing additional supervision labels. For the interaction of\ntwo subnetworks, we adopt a differentiated guidance strategy and design two\nbridges correspondingly. One is the high-frequency attention bridge (HABdg)\ndesigned for the feature encoding process, which learns the high-frequency\ninformation of the MDE task to guide the DSR task. The other is the content\nguidance bridge (CGBdg) designed for the depth map reconstruction process,\nwhich provides the content guidance learned from DSR task for MDE task. The\nentire network architecture is highly portable and can provide a paradigm for\nassociating the DSR and MDE tasks.

It does not require the target\nspeakers to be experts in expressing all styles and to collect corresponding\nrecordings for model training. However, the performances of existing style\ntransfer methods are still far behind real application needs. The root causes\nare mainly twofold. Firstly, the style embedding extracted from single\nreference speech can hardly provide fine-grained and appropriate prosody\ninformation for arbitrary text to synthesize. Secondly, in these models the\ncontent/text, prosody, and speaker timbre are usually highly entangled, it's\ntherefore not realistic to expect a satisfied result when freely combining\nthese components, such as to transfer speaking style between speakers. In this\npaper, we propose a cross-speaker style transfer text-to-speech (TTS) model\nwith explicit prosody bottleneck.

A common performance requirement\nin these mission-critical edge services is the near real-time latency of online\nobject detection on edge devices. However, even with well-trained DNN object\ndetectors, the online detection quality at edge may deteriorate for a number of\nreasons, such as limited capacity to run DNN object detection models on\nheterogeneous edge devices, and detection quality degradation due to random\nframe dropping when the detection processing rate is significantly slower than\nthe incoming video frame rate. This paper addresses these problems by\nexploiting multi-model multi-device detection parallelism for fast object\ndetection in edge systems with heterogeneous edge devices. First, we analyze\nthe performance bottleneck of running a well-trained DNN model at edge for real\ntime online object detection. We use the offline detection as a reference\nmodel, and examine the root cause by analyzing the mismatch among the incoming\nvideo streaming rate, video processing rate for object detection, and output\nrate for real time detection visualization of video streaming.

To successfully deploy\nhybrid perovskites, we must understand the nature of the different types of\ndefects, assess their potentially varied roles in device performance, and\nunderstand how they respond to passivation strategies. Here, by correlating\nphotoemission and synchrotron-based scanning probe X-ray microscopies, we\nunveil three different types of defect clusters in state-of-the-art triple\ncation mixed halide perovskite thin films. Incorporating ultrafast\ntime-resolution into our photoemission measurements, we show that defect\nclusters originating at grain boundaries are the most detrimental for\nphotocarrier trapping, while lead iodide defect clusters are relatively benign.\nHexagonal polytype defect clusters are only mildly detrimental individually,\nbut can have a significant impact overall if abundant in occurrence. We also\nshow that passivating defects with oxygen in the presence of light, a\npreviously used approach to improve efficiency, has a varied impact on the\ndifferent types of defects. Even with just mild oxygen treatment, the grain\nboundary defects are completely healed, while the lead iodide defects begin to\nshow signs of chemical alteration. Our findings highlight the need for\nmulti-pronged strategies tailored to selectively address the detrimental impact\nof the different defect types in hybrid perovskite solar cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 03:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

When coupled to the spin of an optically-active electron, nuclear\nspins can be rapidly polarized, controlled and read via lasers and\nradiofrequency fields. Possessing coherence times of several milliseconds at\nroom temperature, nuclear spins hosted by a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond\nare thus intriguing systems to observe how classical physical rotation at\nquantum timescales affects a quantum system. Unlocking this potential is\nhampered by precise and inflexible constraints on magnetic field strength and\nalignment in order to optically induce nuclear polarization, which restricts\nthe scope for further study and applications. In this work, we demonstrate\noptical nuclear spin polarization and rapid quantum control of nuclear spins in\na diamond physically rotating at $1\\,$kHz, faster than the nuclear spin\ncoherence time. Free from the need to maintain strict field alignment, we are\nable to measure and control nuclear spins in hitherto inaccessible regimes,\nsuch as in the presence of a large, time-varying magnetic field that makes an\nangle of more than $100^\\circ$ to the nitrogen-lattice vacancy axis. The field\ninduces spin mixing between the electron and nuclear states of the qubits,\ndecoupling them from oscillating rf fields. We are able to demonstrate that\ncoherent spin state control is possible at any point of the rotation, and even\nfor up to six rotation periods.

Existing approaches generally\npredict the dialogue state at every turn from scratch. However, the\noverwhelming majority of the slots in each turn should simply inherit the slot\nvalues from the previous turn. Therefore, the mechanism of treating slots\nequally in each turn not only is inefficient but also may lead to additional\nerrors because of the redundant slot value generation. To address this problem,\nwe devise the two-stage DSS-DST which consists of the Dual Slot Selector based\non the current turn dialogue, and the Slot Value Generator based on the\ndialogue history. The Dual Slot Selector determines each slot whether to update\nslot value or to inherit the slot value from the previous turn from two\naspects: (1) if there is a strong relationship between it and the current turn\ndialogue utterances; (2) if a slot value with high reliability can be obtained\nfor it through the current turn dialogue. The slots selected to be updated are\npermitted to enter the Slot Value Generator to update values by a hybrid\nmethod, while the other slots directly inherit the values from the previous\nturn.

The PVR\nsuite of tasks is based on reasoning about indirection, a hallmark of human\nintelligence, where a first stage (task) contains instructions for solving a\nsecond stage (task). In PVR, this is done by having one part of the task input\nact as a pointer, giving instructions on a different input location, which\nforms the output.

In this work, we argue that the features\nextracted from the pretrained extractor, e.g., I3D, are not the\nWS-TALtask-specific features, thus the feature re-calibration is needed for\nreducing the task-irrelevant information redundancy. Therefore, we propose a\ncross-modal consensus network (CO2-Net) to tackle this problem. In CO2-Net, we\nmainly introduce two identical proposed cross-modal consensus modules (CCM)\nthat design a cross-modal attention mechanism to filter out the task-irrelevant\ninformation redundancy using the global information from the main modality and\nthe cross-modal local information of the auxiliary modality. Moreover, we treat\nthe attention weights derived from each CCMas the pseudo targets of the\nattention weights derived from another CCM to maintain the consistency between\nthe predictions derived from two CCMs, forming a mutual learning manner.\nFinally, we conduct extensive experiments on two common used temporal action\nlocalization datasets, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2, to verify our method and\nachieve the state-of-the-art results.

Self-supervised\nlearning has emerged as a promising direction to alleviate the supervision\nbottleneck, but existing work focuses on leveraging co-occurrences in unlabeled\ndata for task-agnostic representation learning, as exemplified by masked\nlanguage model pretraining. In this chapter, we explore task-specific\nself-supervision, which leverages domain knowledge to automatically annotate\nnoisy training examples for end applications, either by introducing labeling\nfunctions for annotating individual instances, or by imposing constraints over\ninterdependent label decisions. We first present deep probabilistic logic(DPL),\nwhich offers a unifying framework for task-specific self-supervision by\ncomposing probabilistic logic with deep learning. DPL represents unknown labels\nas latent variables and incorporates diverse self-supervision using\nprobabilistic logic to train a deep neural network end-to-end using variational\nEM. Next, we present self-supervised self-supervision(S4), which adds to DPL\nthe capability to learn new self-supervision automatically. Starting from an\ninitial seed self-supervision, S4 iteratively uses the deep neural network to\npropose new self supervision. These are either added directly (a form of\nstructured self-training) or verified by a human expert (as in feature-based\nactive learning). Experiments on real-world applications such as biomedical\nmachine reading and various text classification tasks show that task-specific\nself-supervision can effectively leverage domain expertise and often match the\naccuracy of supervised methods with a tiny fraction of human effort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 04:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

Consequently, there is a need to have mechanisms in place to\ndetect cyber security attacks in a timely manner. A variety of Network\nIntrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have been proposed and can be categorized\ninto signature-based NIDS and anomaly-based NIDS. The signature-based NIDS,\nwhich identify the misuse through scanning the activity signature against the\nlist of known attack activities, are criticized for their inability to identify\nnew attacks (never-before-seen attacks). Among anomaly-based NIDS, which\ndeclare a connection anomalous if it expresses deviation from a trained model,\nthe unsupervised learning algorithms circumvent this issue since they have the\nability to identify new attacks. In this study, we use an unsupervised learning\nalgorithm based on principal component analysis to detect cyber attacks.

In the monitoring phase, our approach first identifies\nthe affected dimensions and then calculates an anomaly score by aggregating\nacross only those components that are affected by the anomalies.

This problem was recently formulated as a chance-constrained\noptimization, and the chance constraint was converted to a stronger constraint\nwith statistical moments. Such a conversion reduces the feasible set and\nsometimes leads to an over-conservative design. To address this fundamental\nchallenge, this paper proposes a carefully designed polynomial function, called\noptimal polynomial kinship function, to bound the chance constraint more\naccurately. We modify existing kinship functions via relaxing the independence\nand convexity requirements, which fits our more general uncertainty modeling\nand tightens the bounding functions. The proposed method enables a global\noptimum search for the design variables via polynomial optimization.

Moreover, only the joint\ncontrollability is required, which allows the multi-input system to be\nuncontrollable for every single agent or even all its neighbors. In particular,\nonly one-time information exchange is necessary at every control step, which\nsignificantly reduces the communication consumption.

The\nfirst issue is that the self-attention mechanism learns sign video\nrepresentation in a frame-wise manner, neglecting the temporal semantic\nstructure of sign gestures. Secondly, the attention mechanism with absolute\nposition encoding is direction and distance unaware, thus limiting its ability.\nTo address these issues, we propose a new model architecture, namely PiSLTRc,\nwith two distinctive characteristics: (i) content-aware and position-aware\nconvolution layers.

In particular, DDoS attacks remain a significant threat to network\nservice availability even after more than two decades. These attacks have been\nwell studied under the assumption that malicious traffic originates from a\nsingle attack profile. Based on this premise, malicious traffic characteristics\nare assumed to be considerably different from legitimate traffic. Consequently,\nonline filtering methods are designed to learn network traffic distributions\nadaptively and rank requests according to their attack likelihood. During an\nattack, requests rated as malicious are precipitously dropped by the filters.\nIn this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on the effects of data\npoisoning attacks on online DDoS filtering; introduce one such attack method,\nand propose practical protective countermeasures for these attacks. We\ninvestigate an adverse scenario where the attacker is \"crafty\", switching\nprofiles during attacks and generating erratic attack traffic that is\never-shifting. This elusive attacker generates malicious requests by\nmanipulating and shifting traffic distribution to poison the training data and\ncorrupt the filters. To this end, we present a generative model MimicShift,\ncapable of controlling traffic generation while retaining the originating\ntraffic's intrinsic properties.

Detection of excess noise at the edge is a smoking gun for the\npresence of upstream modes.

Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem\nby trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead\nof the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting\nmight make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely\nimbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a\nnovel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP),\nwhich always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all\nintervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably\nintroduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose\nanother criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects\nthe best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during\ninference, making the overall expected discretization error of an image nearly\nnegligible.

The size of\nthe literature is estimated to have reached 50,000 documents. At the highest\nlevel of aggregation, four major divisions of the literature are differentiated\nthrough these analyses, namely (i) network analysis and traffic flow, (ii)\neconomics of transportation and logistics, (iii) travel behaviour, and (iv)\nroad safety. Influential and emerging authors of each division are identified.\nTemporal trends in transportation research are also investigated via document\nco-citation analysis. This analysis identifies various major streams of\ntransportation research while determining their approximate time of emergence\nand duration of activity. It documents topics that have been most trendy at any\nperiod of time during the last fifty years. Three clusters associated with the\ntravel behaviour division (collectively embodying topics of land-use, active\ntransportation, residential self-selection, traveller experience/satisfaction,\nsocial exclusion and transport/spatial equity), one cluster of statistical\nmodelling of road accidents, and a cluster of network modelling linked\npredominantly to the notion of macroscopic fundamental diagram demonstrate\ncharacteristics of being current hot topics of the field. Three smaller\nclusters linked predominantly to electric mobility and autonomous/automated\nvehicles show characteristics of being emerging hot topics. A cluster labelled\nshared mobility is the youngest emerging cluster. Influential articles within\neach cluster of references are identified. Additional outcomes are the\ndetermination the influential outsiders of the transportation field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 07:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

The presence of the trap ensures that the position of\nthe particle eventually reaches a steady state where it is bounded within a\ncircular region of radius $v_0/\\mu$, centered at the minimum of the trap. Due\nto the interplay between the rotational diffusion constant $D_R$, reversal rate\n$\\gamma$, and the trap strength $\\mu$, the steady state distribution shows four\ndifferent types of shapes, which we refer to as active-I & II, and passive-I &\nII phases. In the active-I phase, the weight of the distribution is\nconcentrated along an annular region close to the circular boundary, whereas in\nactive-II, an additional central diverging peak appears giving rise to a\nMexican hat-like shape of the distribution. The passive-I is marked by a single\nBoltzmann-like centrally peaked distribution in the large $D_R$ limit. On the\nother hand, while the passive-II phase also shows a single central peak, it is\ndistinguished from passive-I by a non-Boltzmann like divergence near the\norigin. We characterize these phases by calculating the exact analytical forms\nof the distributions in various limiting cases.

For instance, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) based\npulling experiments report anomaly low values which are also inconsistent with\nmagnetic tweezers experiments. To understand this, we investigate the role of\ncoupling between microscopic force probe and intrinsic elasticity of\npolyethylene glycol chain in AFM-based experiments.

Recently, the double descent phenomena has\nbeen proposed to reconcile this observation with theory, suggesting that the\ntest error has a second descent when the model becomes sufficiently\noverparameterized, as the model size itself acts as an implicit regularizer. In\nthis paper we add to the growing body of work in this space, providing a\ncareful study of learning dynamics as a function of model size for the least\nsquares scenario. We show an excess risk bound for the gradient descent\nsolution of the least squares objective. The bound depends on the smallest\nnon-zero eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the input features, via a\nfunctional form that has the double descent behavior. This gives a new\nperspective on the double descent curves reported in the literature. Our\nanalysis of the excess risk allows to decouple the effect of optimization and\ngeneralization error. In particular, we find that in case of noiseless\nregression, double descent is explained solely by optimization-related\nquantities, which was missed in studies focusing on the Moore-Penrose\npseudoinverse solution. We believe that our derivation provides an alternative\nview compared to existing work, shedding some light on a possible cause of this\nphenomena, at least in the considered least squares setting. We empirically\nexplore if our predictions hold for neural networks, in particular whether the\ncovariance of intermediary hidden activations has a similar behavior as the one\npredicted by our derivations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 09:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

We develop our proposal fusing results of the\nenvironment's interpretations achieved of YoloV3 and a Bayesian filter. To\ndemonstrate our proposal's performance, we asses it through a benchmark dataset\nand real-world data obtained from an autonomous platform. We compared the\nresults achieved with another approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 09:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

First, within a historical context, a general\nabsence of, and clear need for, tangible output that is dynamically\ninstantiated by the grain-generating process itself is identified. Second, to\nfill this gap, a concrete general approach is proposed based on the careful\nconstruction of non-vibratory and vibratory force pulses, in a one-to-one\nrelationship with sonic grains. An informal pilot psychophysics experiment\ninitiating the approach was conducted, which took into account the two main\ncases for applying forces to the human skin: perpendicular, and lateral.\nInitial results indicate that the force pulse approach can enable perceivably\nmultidimensional, tangible display of the ongoing grain-generating process.\nMoreover, it was found that this can be made to meaningfully happen (in real\ntime) in the same timescale of basic sonic grain generation. This is not a\ntrivial property, and provides an important and positive fundament for further\ndeveloping this type of enhanced display. It also leads to the exciting\nprospect of making arbitrary sonic grains actual physical manipulanda.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 10:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

One application is to speed up the\nparallel decomposition of graphs into strongly connected components (SCC\ndecomposition), which is a fundamental step for analyzing graphs. We observe\nthat graph trimming is essentially a kind of arc-consistency problem, and AC-3,\nAC-4, and AC-6 are the most relevant arc-consistency algorithms for application\nto graph trimming. The existing parallel graph trimming methods require\nworst-case $\\mathcal O(nm)$ time and worst-case $\\mathcal O(n)$ space for\ngraphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.

The classic MITM attack consumes a lot of time mainly in\nthree aspects: construct the lookup table, query data and find a match.\nTherefore, parallel Grover search processors are used to reduce the time of\nconstructing the lookup table.

It is\nimportant to capture the fine-grained gloss-level details, since there is no\nexplicit alignment between sign video frames and the corresponding glosses.\nAmong the past works, one promising way is to adopt a one-dimensional\nconvolutional network (1D-CNN) to temporally fuse the sequential frames.\nHowever, CNNs are agnostic to similarity or dissimilarity, and thus are unable\nto capture local consistent semantics within temporally neighboring frames. To\naddress the issue, we propose to adaptively fuse local features via temporal\nsimilarity for this task. Specifically, we devise a Multi-scale Local-Temporal\nSimilarity Fusion Network (mLTSF-Net) as follows: 1) In terms of a specific\nvideo frame, we firstly select its similar neighbours with multi-scale\nreceptive regions to accommodate different lengths of glosses. 2) To ensure\ntemporal consistency, we then use position-aware convolution to temporally\nconvolve each scale of selected frames. 3) To obtain a local-temporally\nenhanced frame-wise representation, we finally fuse the results of different\nscales using a content-dependent aggregator.

To control the\nCOVID-19 pandemic outbreak, it is necessary to understand how the virus is\ntransmitted to a susceptible individual and eventually spread in the community.\nThe primary transmission pathway of COVID-19 is human-to-human transmission\nthrough infectious droplets. However, a recent study by Greenhalgh et al.\n(Lancet: 397:1603-1605, 2021) demonstrates 10 scientific reasons behind the\nairborne transmission of SARS-COV-2. In the present study, we introduce a novel\nmathematical model of COVID-19 that considers the transmission of free viruses\nin the air besides the transmission of direct contact with an infected person.\nThe basic reproduction number of the epidemic model is calculated using the\nnext-generation operator method and observed that it depends on both the\ntransmission rate of direct contact and free virus contact. The local and\nglobal stability of disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is well established.\nAnalytically it is found that there is a forward bifurcation between the DFE\nand an endemic equilibrium using central manifold theory. Next, we used the\nnonlinear least-squares technique to identify the best-fitted parameter values\nin the model from the observed COVID-19 mortality data of two major districts\nof India. Using estimated parameters for Bangalore urban and Chennai, different\ncontrol scenarios for mitigation of the disease are investigated. Results\nindicate that when a vaccine crisis is there, the public health authorities\nshould prefer to vaccinate the susceptible people compared to the recovered\npersons who are now healthy. Along with face mask use, treatment of\nhospitalized patients and vaccination of susceptibles, immigration should be\nallowed in a supervised manner so that economy of the overall society remains\nhealthy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 12:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

A prototype model realizing this scenario contains just three gauge\nsinglet superfields needed for the type I seesaw mechanism. Masses of the other\ntwo neutrinos are determined by the $U(1)$ breaking scale which too can be\naround the electroweak scale. Light neutrinos obtain their masses in this\nscenario through (a) mixing with the RH neutrinos (type I seesaw), (b) mixing\nwith neutralinos ($R$-parity breaking), (c) indirectly through mixing of the RH\nneutrinos with neutralinos, and (d) radiative corrections. All these\ncontributions are described by the same set of a small number of underlying\nparameters and provide a very constrained and predictive framework for the\nneutrino masses which is investigated in detail for various choices of $U(1)$\nsymmetries.

Recent work has shown that it is possible to train\ndenoisers on a single noisy image. These models adapt to the features of the\ntest image, but their performance is limited by the small amount of information\nused to train them. Here we propose \"GainTuning\", in which CNN models\npre-trained on large datasets are adaptively and selectively adjusted for\nindividual test images. To avoid overfitting, GainTuning optimizes a single\nmultiplicative scaling parameter (the \"Gain\") of each channel in the\nconvolutional layers of the CNN.

These\nadaptive improvements are even more substantial for test images differing\nsystematically from the training data, either in noise level or image type. We\nillustrate the potential of adaptive denoising in a scientific application, in\nwhich a CNN is trained on synthetic data, and tested on real\ntransmission-electron-microscope images.

Here an existing HMM analysis\npipeline is generalized to track rotational phase and frequency simultaneously,\nby modeling the intra-step rotational evolution according to a phase-wrapped\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process, and by calculating the emission probability using a\nphase-sensitive version of the Bayesian matched filter known as the\n$\\mathcal{B}$-statistic. The generalized algorithm tracks signals from isolated\nand binary sources with characteristic wave strain $h_0 \\geq 1.3\\times\n10^{-26}$ in Gaussian noise with amplitude spectral density $4\\times\n10^{-24}\\,{\\rm Hz^{-1/2}}$, for a simulated observation composed of $N_T=37$\ndata segments, each $T_{\\rm drift}=10\\,{\\rm days}$ long, the typical duration\nof a search for the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) Sco X$-$1 with the Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO).

This filtering encodes information about the target's bearing\nrelative to the main response axis. For any given projector and transmit\nwaveform spectrum, there exists an optimal angle of operation which maximizes\nthe Fisher Information (FI) of the target bearing estimate. Previous\ninvestigations into this phenomena show that for narrowband (i.e, high $Q$)\nLinear Frequency Modulated (LFM) waveforms, the angle of maximum FI is solely\ndetermined by its center frequency $f_c$. Steering the region of maximum\nbearing estimation precision is then achieved by appropriate selection of the\nLFM waveform's center frequency $f_c$. This fine bearing estimation is\naccomplished without steering the projector's main response axis. In addition\nto LFM waveforms, a wide variety of other active sonar waveform types exist\nthat possess distinct spectral characteristics. These other waveforms possess\ndifferent Ambiguity Function (AF) shapes from the LFM and are typically\nutilized to suite the range-Doppler resolution requirements of the active sonar\nsystem. This paper investigates the transmit waveform impact on off-axis\nbearing estimation performance and the spectral filtering impact on the\nwaveform's AF shape. High $Q$ waveforms perform similarly to the LFM for\noff-axis bearing estimation while the transducer's spectral filtering perturbs\nthe waveform's AF shape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 13:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

Preventing the conflict among urban aircraft is crucial to UAM traffic\nsafety, which is a key in enabling large scale UAM operation. Pre-flight\nconflict-free path planning can provide a strategic layer in the maintenance of\nsafety performance, thus becomes an important element in UAM. This paper aims\nat tackling conflict-free path planning problem for UAM operation with a\nconsideration of four-dimensional airspace management. In the first place, we\nintroduced and extended a four-dimensional airspace management concept,\nAirMatrix. On the basis of AirMatrix, we formulated the shortest flight time\npath planning problem considering resolution of conflicts with both static and\ndynamic obstacles. A Conflict-Free A-Star algorithm was developed for planning\nfour-dimensional paths based on first-come-first-served scheme. The algorithm\ncontains a novel design of heuristic function as well as a conflict detection\nand resolution strategy. Numerical experiment was carried out in Jurong East\narea in Singapore, and the results show that the algorithm can generate paths\nresolving a significant number of potential conflicts in airspace utilization,\nwith acceptable computational time and flight delay.

The reasons for this are use of inappropriate\nperformance metrics, lack of comparison to a baseline conventional design, and\nlack of a performance metric that combines signal-to-noise ratio and\nresolution. In this work we present a metric that will allow comparison of\ndifferent types of flat lenses, even if their first order optical parameters\nare not the same.

We build the results on the stationary phase lemmas. Chapters 5, 6\nand 7 covers main results in $\\Psi$DOs and the proofs are heavily built on the\nresults in Chapter 4. Some aspects of the semi-classical analysis are similar\nto that of microlocal analysis. In Chapter 8 we finally introduce the notion of\nwavefront, and Chapter 9 focuses on the propagation of singularities of\nsolution of partial differential equations. Important results are circulated by\nblack boxes and some key steps are marked in red color. Exercises are provided\nat the end of each chapter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

While much progress in\nthis field has been in single image-based mesh estimation, there has been a\nrecent uptick in efforts to infer mesh dynamics from video given its role in\nalleviating issues such as depth ambiguity and occlusions. However, a key\nlimitation of existing work is the assumption that all the observed motion\ndynamics can be modeled using one dynamical/recurrent model. While this may\nwork well in cases with relatively simplistic dynamics, inference with\nin-the-wild videos presents many challenges. In particular, it is typically the\ncase that different body parts of a person undergo different dynamics in the\nvideo, e.g., legs may move in a way that may be dynamically different from\nhands (e.g., a person dancing). To address these issues, we present a new\nmethod for video mesh recovery that divides the human mesh into several local\nparts following the standard skeletal model.

To elucidate the degeneracy problem explicitly, we examine\nDebye random media, which are entirely defined by a purely exponentially\ndecaying two-point correlation function $S_2(r)$. In this work, we consider\nthree different classes of Debye random media. First, we generate the \"most\nprobable\" class using the Yeong-Torquato construction algorithm [Yeong and\nTorquato, Phys. Rev. E, 57, 495 (1998)]. A second class of Debye random media\nis obtained by demonstrating that the corresponding two-point correlation\nfunctions are effectively realized in the first three space dimensions by\ncertain models of overlapping, polydisperse spheres. A third class is obtained\nby using the Yeong-Torquato algorithm to construct Debye random media that are\nconstrained to have an unusual prescribed pore-size probability density\nfunction. We structurally discriminate these three classes of Debye random\nmedia from one another by ascertaining their other statistical descriptors,\nincluding the pore-size, surface correlation, chord-length probability density,\nand lineal-path functions. We also compare and contrast the percolation\nthresholds as well as the diffusion and fluid transport properties of these\ndegenerate Debye random media. We find that these three classes of Debye random\nmedia are generally distinguished by the aforementioned descriptors and their\nmicrostructures are also visually distinct from one another. Our work further\nconfirms the well-known fact that scattering information is insufficient to\ndetermine the effective physical properties of two-phase media. Additionally,\nour findings demonstrate the importance of the other two-point descriptors\nconsidered here in the design of materials with a spectrum of physical\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:44:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 17:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-15"}

To facilitate this issue, this paper proposes a novel\nadversarial scoring network (ASNet) to gradually bridge the gap across domains\nfrom coarse to fine granularity. In specific, at the coarse-grained stage, we\ndesign a dual-discriminator strategy to adapt source domain to be close to the\ntargets from the perspectives of both global and local feature space via\nadversarial learning. The distributions between two domains can thus be aligned\nroughly. At the fine-grained stage, we explore the transferability of source\ncharacteristics by scoring how similar the source samples are to target ones\nfrom multiple levels based on generative probability derived from coarse stage.\nGuided by these hierarchical scores, the transferable source features are\nproperly selected to enhance the knowledge transfer during the adaptation\nprocess. With the coarse-to-fine design, the generalization bottleneck induced\nfrom the domain discrepancy can be effectively alleviated. Three sets of\nmigration experiments show that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art\ncounting performance compared with major unsupervised methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

We address the impact of the scalar product\nchoice, founding it on the physical energy scales of the problem. The article\nis organized in three parts: basics, applications and heuristic proposals. In\nthe first part, we revisit the energy scalar product used in the hyperboloidal\napproach to QNMs, extending previous effective analyses and placing them on\nsolid spacetime basis. The second part focuses on applications of the scalar\nproduct in the QNM problem: i) we demonstrate that the QNM instability is not\nan artifact of previous spectral numerical schemes, by implementing a finite\nelements calculation from a weak formulation; ii) using Keldysh's theorem, we\nprovide QNM resonant expansions for the gravitational waveform, with explicit\nexpressions of the expansion coefficients; iii) we propose the notion of\n\"epsilon-dual QNM expansions\" to exploit BH QNM instability in BH spectroscopy,\nexploiting both non-perturbed and perturbed QNMs, the former informing on large\nscales and the latter probing small scales.

Neutral competition can be represented by an unbiased\nrandom drift process in which the states of vertices (e.g., opinions,\ngenotypes, or species) in a network are updated by repeatedly selecting two\nconnected vertices. One of these vertices copies the state of the selected\nneighbor. Such updates are repeated until all vertices are in the same\n\"consensus\" state. There is no unique rule for selecting the vertex pair to be\nupdated. Real-world processes comprise three limiting factors that can\ninfluence the selected edge and the direction of spread: (1) the rate at which\na vertex sends a state to its neighbors, (2) the rate at which a state is\nreceived by a neighbor, and (3) the rate at which a state can be exchanged\nthrough a connecting edge. We investigate how these three limitations influence\nneutral competition in networks with two communities generated by a stochastic\nblock model. By using Monte Carlo simulations, we show how the community\nstructure and update rule determine the states' success probabilities and the\ntime until a consensus is reached. We present a heterogeneous mean-field theory\nthat agrees well with the Monte Carlo simulations. The effectiveness of the\nheterogeneous mean-field theory implies that quantitative predictions about the\nconsensus are possible even if empirical data (e.g., from ecological fieldwork\nor observations of social interactions) do not allow a complete reconstruction\nof all edges in the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 15:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

This result is in contrast with what happens in\nthe case of General Relativity where staticity in a neighbourhood of spatial\ninfinity and the smoothness of the field at future and past null infinities are\nmuch more closely related.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 15:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

In each of the Stokes' and Couette cases, both\ncosine and sine oscillations of the plate are considered. It is assumed that\nthe fluids are immiscible, and that the flat interface between the fluids\nremains flat for all times. Solutions to the initial-boundary value problems\nare obtained using the Laplace transform method. Steady periodic and transient\nvelocity fields are explicitly presented. Transient and steady-state shear\nstresses at the boundaries of the flows are calculated. The results derived in\nthis paper retrieve previously known results for corresponding single-layer\nflows. Further, illustrative example of each of the Stokes' problem and the\nCouette flow is presented and discussed. Again, the results obtained could also\nbe applicable to a problem of heat conduction in a composite solid with\nsinusoidal temperature variation on the surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 15:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

The\nemotion component process model (CPM) by Scherer (2005) is an interesting\napproach to explain emotion communication. It states that emotions are a\ncoordinated process of various subcomponents, in reaction to an event, namely\nthe subjective feeling, the cognitive appraisal, the expression, a\nphysiological bodily reaction, and a motivational action tendency. We\nhypothesize that these components are associated with linguistic realizations:\nan emotion can be expressed by describing a physiological bodily reaction (\"he\nwas trembling\"), or the expression (\"she smiled\"), etc. We annotate existing\nliterature and Twitter emotion corpora with emotion component classes and find\nthat emotions on Twitter are predominantly expressed by event descriptions or\nsubjective reports of the feeling, while in literature, authors prefer to\ndescribe what characters do, and leave the interpretation to the reader. We\nfurther include the CPM in a multitask learning model and find that this\nsupports the emotion categorization.

Recent years\nhave witnessed significant interest in applying log-structured merge tree\n(LSM-tree) as an alternative to B-tree. The current consensus is that, compared\nwith B-tree, LSM-tree has distinct advantages in terms of storage space\nefficiency and write amplification. This paper argues that one should revisit\nthis belief upon the arrival of storage hardware with built-in transparent\ncompression. Advanced storage appliances~(e.g., all-flash array) and emerging\ncomputational storage drives perform hardware-based lossless data compression,\ntransparent to OS and user applications. Beyond straightforwardly reducing the\nphysical storage cost difference between B-tree and LSM-tree, such modern\nstorage hardware brings new opportunities to innovate B-tree implementation in\norder to largely reduce its write amplification. As the first step to explore\nthe potential, this paper presents three simple design techniques (i.e.,\ndeterministic page shadowing, localized page modification logging, and sparse\nredo logging) that can leverage such modern storage hardware to significantly\nreduce the B-tree write amplification. We implemented these design techniques\nand carried out experiments on a commercial storage drive with built-in\ntransparent compression. The results show that the proposed design techniques\ncan reduce the B-tree write amplification by over 10x. Compared with RocksDB (a\npopular key-value store built upon LSM-tree), the implemented B-tree can\nachieve similar or even smaller write amplification and physical storage space\nusage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 00:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

OoD data leads to the over-confidence problem in model\npredictions, making the existing XAI approaches unreliable. To our best\nknowledge, the OoD data problem in perturbation-based XAI algorithms has not\nbeen adequately addressed in the literature. In this work, we address this OoD\ndata problem by designing an additional module quantifying the affinity between\nthe perturbed data and the original dataset distribution, which is integrated\ninto the process of aggregation. Our solution is shown to be compatible with\nthe most popular perturbation-based XAI algorithms, such as RISE, OCCLUSION,\nand LIME. Experiments have confirmed that our methods demonstrate a significant\nimprovement in general cases using both computational and cognitive metrics.\nEspecially in the case of degradation, our proposed approach demonstrates\noutstanding performance comparing to baselines. Besides, our solution also\nresolves a fundamental problem with the faithfulness indicator, a commonly used\nevaluation metric of XAI algorithms that appears to be sensitive to the OoD\nissue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 08:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

However,\nstandard CML methods learn fixed user and item representations, which fails to\ncapture the complex interests of users. Existing extensions of CML also either\nignore the heterogeneity of user-item relations, i.e. that a user can\nsimultaneously like very different items, or the latent item-item relations,\ni.e. that a user's preference for an item depends, not only on its intrinsic\ncharacteristics, but also on items they previously interacted with. In this\npaper, we present a hierarchical CML model that jointly captures latent\nuser-item and item-item relations from implicit data. Our approach is inspired\nby translation mechanisms from knowledge graph embedding and leverages\nmemory-based attention networks. We empirically show the relevance of this\njoint relational modeling, by outperforming existing CML models on\nrecommendation tasks on several real-world datasets. Our experiments also\nemphasize the limits of current CML relational models on very sparse datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 17:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

IoT-enabled infrastructures have naturally a multi-layer system\narchitecture with an overlaid or underlaid device network and its coexisting\ninfrastructure network. The connectivity between different components in these\ntwo heterogeneous interdependent networks plays an important role in delivering\nreal-time information and ensuring a high-level situational awareness. However,\nIoT-enabled infrastructures face cyber threats due to the wireless nature of\ncommunications. Therefore, maintaining network connectivity in the presence of\nadversaries is a critical task for infrastructure network operators. In this\npaper, we establish a three-player three-stage dynamic game-theoretic framework\nincluding two network operators and one attacker to capture the secure design\nof multi-layer interdependent infrastructure networks by allocating limited\nresources. We use subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPE) to characterize the\nstrategies of players with sequential moves. In addition, we assess the\nefficiency of the equilibrium network by comparing with its team optimal\nsolution counterparts in which two network operators can coordinate. We further\ndesign a scalable algorithm to guide the construction of the equilibrium\nIoT-enabled infrastructure networks. Finally, we use case studies on the\nemerging paradigm of the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) to corroborate\nthe obtained results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 21:05:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

How can ambiguity be\nconsciously designed in virtual worlds? What are the design principles for game\ndesigners? Ambiguity arises from discontinuity and decontextualization, from\nthe deliberate omission of facts, and from the skillful superimposition of\ncontradictory codes. An ontology of interactive media explains the elusive\nvisual poetry and image perception. The five basic elements of media are\npresented. The model shows the key correlations of user, content, and\ntechnology in image perception. An overview of utopian representation as a\ncross-media phenomenon places game design in an interdisciplinary context. Six\nselected computer-generated illustrations show how the above design criteria\ncan be successfully applied to the design of virtual worlds. The ambiguous\nutopia of an image exists only in a brief, irretrievable moment of our own\nperception. But this moment is valuable for designing real visions for a better\nfuture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 12:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}
