Moreover, a coverage mechanism is used to avoid repetition of\nwords in the generated summary. First, we show that training the model on a\nnews summary dataset and using zero-shot learning to test it on the meeting\ndataset proves to produce better results than training it on the AMI meeting\ndataset.

However, training complex deep learning models often\nrequires accessing large amounts of data, which can easily exceed the capacity\nof local disks. Prior research often overlooks this training data problem by\nimplicitly assuming that data is available locally or via low latency\nnetwork-based data storage. Such implicit assumptions often do not hold in a\ncloud-based training environment, where deep learning practitioners create and\ntear down dedicated GPU clusters on demand, or do not have the luxury of local\nstorage, such as in serverless workloads. In this work, we investigate the\nperformance of distributed training that leverages training data residing\nentirely inside cloud storage buckets. These buckets promise low storage costs,\nbut come with inherent bandwidth limitations that make them seem unsuitable for\nan efficient training solution. To account for these bandwidth limitations, we\npropose the use of two classical techniques, namely caching and pre-fetching,\nto mitigate the training performance degradation. We implement a prototype,\nDELI, based on the popular deep learning framework PyTorch by building on its\ndata loading abstractions. We then evaluate the training performance of two\ndeep learning workloads using Google Cloud's NVIDIA K80 GPU servers and show\nthat we can reduce the time that the training loop is waiting for data by\n85.6%-93.5% compared to loading directly from a storage bucket - thus achieving\ncomparable performance to loading data directly from disk - while only storing\na fraction of the data locally at a time. In addition, DELI has the potential\nof lowering the cost of running a training workload, especially on models with\nlong per-epoch training times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 17:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

Under general assumptions, we establish a\nscaling theory for the global quantum Fisher information of the joint system\nand environment state at dissipative critical points. We derive universal\nscaling laws featuring transient and long-time behavior governed by the\nunderlying critical exponents. Importantly, such scaling laws exceed the\nstandard quantum limit and can in principle saturate the Heisenberg limit.

We identify 15 additional density and bending waves in Saturn's C ring\ndriven by the planet's internal normal mode oscillations. Taking advantage of a\nhighly accurate absolute radius scale for the rings, we are able to detect\nweak, high-wavenumber (up to m=14) waves with km-scale radial wavelengths. From\na systematic scan of the entire C ring, we report the discovery and\nidentification of 11 new Outer Lindblad Resonances (OLRs), two counterpart\ninner Lindblad resonances (ILRs), and two new Outer Vertical Resonances (OVRs).\nThe close agreement of the observed resonance locations and wave rotation rates\nwith the predictions of models of Saturn's interior suggests that all of the\nnew waves are driven by Saturnian f-mode oscillations. As classified by their\nspherical harmonic shapes, the modes in question range in azimuthal wavenumber\nfrom m=8 to 14, with associated resonance orders l-m ranging from 0 to 8, where\nl is the overall angular wavenumber of the mode. Our suite of detections for\nl-m=4 is now complete from m=8 to m=14. Curiously, detections with l-m=2 are\nless common. These newly-identified non-sectoral waves sample latitudinal as\nwell as radial structure within the planet and may thus provide valuable\nconstraints on Saturn's differential rotation. Allowing for the fact that the\ntwo ILR-type waves appear to be due to the same normal modes as two of the\nOLR-type waves, the 13 additional modes identified here bring to 34 the number\nof distinct f-modes suitable for constraining interior models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 18:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

In this paper, we consider the question: how\nshould reviewers be divided between phases or conditions in order to maximize\ntotal assignment similarity? We make several contributions towards answering\nthis question. First, we prove that when the set of papers requiring additional\nreview is unknown, a simplified variant of this problem is NP-hard. Second, we\nempirically show that across several datasets pertaining to real conference\ndata, dividing reviewers between phases/conditions uniformly at random allows\nan assignment that is nearly as good as the oracle optimal assignment. This\nuniformly random choice is practical for both the two-phase and conference\nexperiment design settings. Third, we provide explanations of this phenomenon\nby providing theoretical bounds on the suboptimality of this random strategy\nunder certain natural conditions. From these easily-interpretable conditions,\nwe provide actionable insights to conference program chairs about whether a\nrandom reviewer split is suitable for their conference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 19:29:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

Generally, the\npresence of CRTs in the Hamiltonian prevents one to achieve an analytical\nsolution. Moreover, as we will show in the present work, using the perturbation\ntheory, analytical solvable Hamiltonians can be successfully obtained.\nAccording to our calculations, the contribution of CRTs within the ordinary\nHamiltonian is equivalent to the replacement of the constant detuning with a\nspecific intensity dependent detuning in the first order, and the constant atom\nfield coupling with a particular intensity dependent (f deformed) coupling in\nthe second order of the associated perturbation parameter. Moreover, noticing\nthat according to the initial expression of the Hamiltonian, each mode of the\nfield interacts only with a specific pair of the allowed transitions of each\ntype of the three-level atom, it is surprisingly observed that via applying the\nmentioned approach, the obtained intensity dependent coupling functions depend\non both modes of the field, f(na,nb). In this way, it is seen that the CRTs are\nremoved with the price of arriving at some intermixed intensity dependent atom\nfield coupling functions of the two modes of the field. In this way, the\nobtained final Hamiltonians are analytically solvable. At last, by determining\nthe time evolution of the atom field wave function, we study the effects of\nCRTs on a few nonclassical properties of the state of the system, including the\natomic population inversion and photon statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 19:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

We introduce this survey by\npresenting the first measurement of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at high\nredshift in overdense environments via grism spectroscopy. From the completed\nMAMMOTH-Grism observations in the field of the BOSS1244 protocluster at\n$z=2.24\\pm0.02$, We secure a sample of 36 protocluster member galaxies at\n$z\\sim2.24$, showing strong nebular emission lines ([O III], H$\\beta$ and [O\nII]) in their G141 spectra.

One prominent\nexample is Sidorenko's conjecture. For a fixed collection of graphs\n$\\mathcal{U}=\\{H_1,\\dots,H_m\\}$, the exponent vectors of valid pure binomial\ninequalities in graphs of $\\mathcal{U}$ form a convex cone. We compute this\ncone for several families of graphs including complete graphs, even cycles,\nstars and paths; the latter is the most interesting and intricate case that we\ncompute. In all of these cases, we observe a tantalizing polyhedrality\nphenomenon: the cone of valid pure binomial inequalities is actually rational\npolyhedral, and therefore all valid pure binomial inequalities can be generated\nfrom the finite collection of exponent vectors of the extreme rays. Using the\nwork of Kopparty and Rossman, we show that the cone of valid inequalities is\nindeed rational polyhedral when all graphs $H_i$ are series-parallel and\nchordal, and we conjecture that polyhedrality holds for any finite collection\n$\\mathcal{U}$. We demonstrate that the polyhedrality phenomenon also occurs in\nmatroids and simplicial complexes. Our description of the inequalities for\npaths involves a generalization of the Erd\\H{o}s-Simonovits conjecture recently\nproved in its original form by Sa\\u{g}lam and a new family of inequalities not\nobserved previously.

In particular, we introduce\nthree different variants of SCDM (referred to as SCDM-M, SCDM-L, and SCDM-G)\nthat can be used in conjunction with the standard AO basis sets. The SCDM-M and\nSCDM-L variants are based on the Mulliken and L{\\\"o}wdin representations of the\ndensity matrix, and are tantamount to selecting a well-conditioned set of\nprojected atomic orbitals (PAOs) and projected (symmetrically-) orthogonalized\natomic orbitals (POAOs), respectively, as proto-LMOs. The SCDM-G variant\nleverages a real-space (grid) representation of the wavefunction to select a\nset of well-conditioned proto-LMOs. A detailed comparative analysis reveals\nthat the LMOs generated by these three SCDM variants are robust, comparable in\norbital locality to those produced with the iterative Boys or Pipek-Mezey (PM)\nlocalization schemes, and are agnostic towards any single orbital locality\nmetric. Although all three SCDM variants are based on the density matrix, we\nfind that the character of the generated LMOs can differ significantly between\nSCDM-M, SCDM-L, and SCDM-G.

The success of its coronagraph\ninstrument ECLIPS (Extreme Coronagraph for Living Planetary Systems) depends on\nthe ability to stabilize the wavefront from a large segmented mirror such that\noptical path differences are limited to tens of picometers RMS during an\nexposure time of a few hours. In order to relax the constraints on the\nmechanical stability, ECLIPS will be equipped with a wavefront sensing and\ncontrol (WS&C) architecture to correct wavefront errors up to temporal\nfrequencies >~1 Hz. These errors may be dominated by spacecraft structural\ndynamics exciting vibrations at the segmented primary mirror.

SINA is based on existing decentralized infrastructure, which\navoids creating a dependency of the market participants on an overpowering\nservice provider. The core element of the technical solution is an open-source\nmodule integrated in the private clouds of the manufacturers, energy suppliers\nand service providers. The architecture addresses problems of data ownership,\nprivacy and data security avoiding central administrative structures. It\nmanages data access and transfer in a decentralized and distributed system.\nSINA uses a blockchain and smart contracts to make sure that the pieces of\ninformation about which data are accessed, by whom they are accessed, how they\nare processed, and which monetary transactions take place are immutably stored\nand made available.

The separate regression modules allow us to take full advantage of\ntheir state-of-the-art performances without compromising the original accuracy\nand reliability in practice. We develop three different integration modules\nthat trade off between latency and accuracy. All of them are capable of\nproviding simple yet effective solutions to unify the separate outputs into\nseamless whole-body pose estimation results. We quantitatively and\nqualitatively demonstrate that our modularized system outperforms both the\noptimization-based and end-to-end methods of estimating whole-body pose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 23:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

Different from most existing schemes that rely on either\nradar-centric half-duplex (HD) pulsed transmission with information embedding\nthat suffers from extremely low communication rate, or communication-centric\nwaveform that suffers from degraded sensing performance, we propose a novel\nfull-duplex (FD) ISAC scheme that utilizes the waiting time of conventional\npulsed radars to transmit dedicated communication signals.

An SSD is a suitable\ncandidate for data versioning because it can preserve previous versions without\nadditional copying, and provide high security with a very small trusted\ncomputing base (TCB). However, the versioning SSDs studied so far commonly use\na full disk versioning method that preserves all file versions in a batch. This\npaper demonstrates that SSDs, which provide full disk versioning, can be\nexposed to data tampering attacks when the retention time of data is less than\nthe malware's dwell time. To deal with this threat, we propose SGX-SSD, a\npolicy-based per-file versioning SSD to keep a deeper history for only the\nimportant files of users. However, since the SSD isn't aware of a file\nsemantic, and the versioning policy information should be securely received\nfrom the untrusted host computer, implementing the per-file versioning in SSD\nis a huge challenge.

Consider the parabolic equation with heterogeneous\ndiffusion parameter, the flow rates vary significantly in different regions due\nto the high-contrast features of the diffusivity.

Recently,\ndeep convolutional neural networks (D-CNNs) have shown remarkable performance\nin interpreting CXR in adults. However, there is a lack of evidence indicating\nthat D-CNNs can recognize accurately multiple lung pathologies from pediatric\nCXR scans. In particular, the development of diagnostic models for the\ndetection of pediatric chest diseases faces significant challenges such as (i)\nlack of physician-annotated datasets and (ii) class imbalance problems. In this\npaper, we retrospectively collect a large dataset of 5,017 pediatric CXR scans,\nfor which each is manually labeled by an experienced radiologist for the\npresence of 10 common pathologies. A D-CNN model is then trained on 3,550\nannotated scans to classify multiple pediatric lung pathologies automatically.\nTo address the high-class imbalance issue, we propose to modify and apply\n\"Distribution-Balanced loss\" for training D-CNNs which reshapes the standard\nBinary-Cross Entropy loss (BCE) to efficiently learn harder samples by\ndown-weighting the loss assigned to the majority classes. On an independent\ntest set of 777 studies, the proposed approach yields an area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.709 (95% CI, 0.690-0.729).

Moreover, our ablation studies validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed loss function compared to other standard losses,\ne.g., BCE and Focal Loss, for this learning task. Overall, we demonstrate the\npotential of D-CNNs in interpreting pediatric CXRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 08:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-29"}

This challenge raises the need for an automated and\nefficient approach to classifying body parts from X-ray scans. Unfortunately,\nto the best of our knowledge, there is no open tool or framework for this task\nto date. To fill this lack, we introduce a DICOM Imaging Router that deploys\ndeep CNNs for categorizing unknown DICOM X-ray images into five anatomical\ngroups: abdominal, adult chest, pediatric chest, spine, and others. To this\nend, a large-scale X-ray dataset consisting of 16,093 images has been collected\nand manually classified. We then trained a set of state-of-the-art deep CNNs\nusing a training set of 11,263 images.

However, these high-dimensional features and high-order\nadjacency information are usually heterogeneous and held by different data\nholders in practice. Given such vertical data partition (e.g., one data holder\nwill only own either the node features or edge information), different data\nholders have to develop efficient joint training protocols rather than directly\ntransfer data to each other due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we focus on\nthe edge privacy, and consider a training scenario where Bob with node features\nwill first send training node features to Alice who owns the adjacency\ninformation. Alice will then train a graph neural network (GNN) with the joint\ninformation and release an inference API. During inference, Bob is able to\nprovide test node features and query the API to obtain the predictions for test\nnodes. Under this setting, we first propose a privacy attack LinkTeller via\ninfluence analysis to infer the private edge information held by Alice via\ndesigning adversarial queries for Bob. We then empirically show that LinkTeller\nis able to recover a significant amount of private edges, outperforming\nexisting baselines. To further evaluate the privacy leakage, we adapt an\nexisting algorithm for differentially private graph convolutional network (DP\nGCN) training and propose a new DP GCN mechanism LapGraph. We show that these\nDP GCN mechanisms are not always resilient against LinkTeller empirically under\nmild privacy guarantees ($\\varepsilon>5$).

Most GZS3\nmethods adopt a generative approach that synthesizes visual features of unseen\nclasses from corresponding semantic ones (e.g., word2vec) to train novel\nclassifiers for both seen and unseen classes. Although generative methods show\ndecent performance, they have two limitations: (1) the visual features are\nbiased towards seen classes; (2) the classifier should be retrained whenever\nnovel unseen classes appear. We propose a discriminative approach to address\nthese limitations in a unified framework. To this end, we leverage visual and\nsemantic encoders to learn a joint embedding space, where the semantic encoder\ntransforms semantic features to semantic prototypes that act as centers for\nvisual features of corresponding classes. Specifically, we introduce\nboundary-aware regression (BAR) and semantic consistency (SC) losses to learn\ndiscriminative features. Our approach to exploiting the joint embedding space,\ntogether with BAR and SC terms, alleviates the seen bias problem. At test time,\nwe avoid the retraining process by exploiting semantic prototypes as a\nnearest-neighbor (NN) classifier. To further alleviate the bias problem, we\nalso propose an inference technique, dubbed Apollonius calibration (AC), that\nmodulates the decision boundary of the NN classifier to the Apollonius circle\nadaptively.

Automatic labeling of\nthe vertebral discs in MRI data is a difficult task because of the similarity\nbetween discs and bone area, the variability in the geometry of the spine and\nsurrounding tissues across individuals, and the variability across scans\n(manufacturers, pulse sequence, image contrast, resolution and artefacts). In\nprevious studies, vertebral disc labeling is often done after a disc detection\nstep and mostly fails when the localization algorithm misses discs or has false\npositive detection. In this work, we aim to mitigate this problem by\nreformulating the semantic vertebral disc labeling using the pose estimation\ntechnique. To do so, we propose a stacked hourglass network with multi-level\nattention mechanism to jointly learn intervertebral disc position and their\nskeleton structure. The proposed deep learning model takes into account the\nstrength of semantic segmentation and pose estimation technique to handle the\nmissing area and false positive detection.

To close this gap, Quantum Error\nCorrection (QEC) encodes logical qubits and distributes information using\nseveral physical qubits. By periodically executing a syndrome extraction\ncircuit on the logical qubits, information about errors (called syndrome) is\nextracted while running programs. A decoder uses these syndromes to identify\nand correct errors in real time, which is required to use feedback implemented\nin quantum algorithms. Unfortunately, software decoders are slow and hardware\ndecoders are fast but less accurate. Thus, almost all QEC studies so far have\nrelied on offline decoding.\n  To enable real-time decoding in near-term QEC, we propose LILLIPUT-- a\nLightweight Low Latency Look-Up Table decoder. LILLIPUT consists of two parts--\nFirst, it translates syndromes into error detection events that index into a\nLook-Up Table (LUT) whose entry provides the error information in real-time.\nSecond, it programs the LUTs with error assignments for all possible error\nevents by running a software decoder offline. LILLIPUT tolerates an error on\nany operation in the quantum hardware, including gates and measurement, and the\nnumber of tolerated errors grows with the size of the code. It needs <7% logic\non off-the-shelf FPGAs that allows it to be easily integrated alongside the\ncontrol and readout circuits in existing systems. LILLIPUT incurs a latency of\nfew nanoseconds and enables real-time decoding. We also propose Compressed LUTs\n(CLUTs) to reduce the memory needed by LILLIPUT. By exploiting the fact that\nnot all error events are equally likely and only storing data for the most\nprobable error events, CLUTs reduce the memory needed by up-to 107x (from 148\nMB to 1.38 MB) without degrading accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 15:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

The\nfourth-order equation of motion corresponds to the same Lagrangian function in\nproper time as in special relativity except for an additional spin energy term.\nThe total motion can be decomposed into a sum of a local spin motion about a\npoint and a global motion of this point, called the spin center. The global\nmotion is sub-luminal and obeys Newton's second law in proper time, the time\nfor a clock fixed at the spin center, while the total motion occurs at the\nspeed of light c, consistent with the eigenvalues of Dirac's velocity operators\nhaving magnitude c. The local spin motion corresponds to Schr\\\"odinger's\nzitterbewegung and is a perpetual motion, which for a free electron has a\ncircular path in the spin-center frame. In an electro-magnetic field, this spin\nmotion generates magnetic and electric dipole energies through the Lorentz\nforce on the electron's point charge. The corresponding electric dipole energy\nis consistent with the spin-orbit coupling term in the corrected Pauli\nnon-relativistic Hamiltonian but the magnetic dipole energy is one half of that\nin Dirac's theory. By defining a spin tensor as the angular momentum of the\nelectron's total motion about its spin center, the fundamental equations of\nmotion can be re-written in an identical form to those of the Barut-Zanghi\nelectron theory. These equations of motion can then be expressed using\noperators applied to a state function of proper time satisfying a\nDirac-Schr\\\"odinger spinor equation. The operators produce dynamic variables\nwithout any probability implications. For the free electron, the state function\nsatisfies Dirac's relativistic wave equation when the Lorentz transformation is\napplied to express proper time in terms of an observer's space-time\ncoordinates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 02:45:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 01:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}
