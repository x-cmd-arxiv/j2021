By providing a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of\nuniversal trees, they have highlighted a barrier that must be overcome by all\nexisting approaches to attain polynomial runtime. This is due to the existence\nof worst case instances which force these algorithms to explore a large portion\nof the tree.\n  As an attempt to overcome this barrier, we propose a strategy iteration\nframework which can be applied on any universal tree. It is at least as fast as\nits value iteration counterparts, while allowing one to take bigger leaps in\nthe universal tree. Value iteration - asymptotically the fastest known\nalgorithm for parity games - is a repeated application of operators associated\nwith arcs in the game graph to obtain the least fixed point. Our main technical\ncontribution is an efficient method for computing the least fixed point of\noperators associated with arcs in a strategy subgraph.

To achieve high accuracy, DNN models have\nbecome increasingly deep with hundreds or even thousands of operator layers,\nleading to high memory and computational requirements for inference. Operator\nfusion (or kernel/layer fusion) is key optimization in many state-of-the-art\nDNN execution frameworks, such as TensorFlow, TVM, and MNN. However, these\nframeworks usually adopt fusion approaches based on certain patterns that are\ntoo restrictive to cover the diversity of operators and layer connections.\nPolyhedral-based loop fusion techniques, on the other hand, work on a low-level\nview of the computation without operator-level information, and can also miss\npotential fusion opportunities. To address this challenge, this paper proposes\na novel and extensive loop fusion framework called DNNFusion. The basic idea of\nthis work is to work at an operator view of DNNs, but expand fusion\nopportunities by developing a classification of both individual operators and\ntheir combinations. In addition, DNNFusion includes 1) a novel\nmathematical-property-based graph rewriting framework to reduce evaluation\ncosts and facilitate subsequent operator fusion, 2) an integrated fusion plan\ngeneration that leverages the high-level analysis and accurate light-weight\nprofiling, and 3) additional optimizations during fusion code generation.\nDNNFusion is extensively evaluated on 15 DNN models with varied types of tasks,\nmodel sizes, and layer counts. The evaluation results demonstrate that\nDNNFusion finds up to 8.8x higher fusion opportunities, outperforms four\nstate-of-the-art DNN execution frameworks with 9.3x speedup.

This data-labeling process can be both\nlabor and cost intensive. To achieve desirable predictive performance, a\ntrained model is typically applied into a domain where the data distribution is\nsimilar to the training dataset. However, for many agricultural machine\nlearning problems, training datasets are collected at a specific location,\nduring a specific period in time of the growing season. Since agricultural\nsystems exhibit substantial variability in terms of crop type, cultivar,\nmanagement, seasonal growth dynamics, lighting condition, sensor type, etc, a\nmodel trained from one dataset often does not generalize well across domains.\nTo enable more data efficient and generalizable neural network models in\nagriculture, we propose a method that generates photorealistic agricultural\nimages from a synthetic 3D crop model domain into real world crop domains.

A crucial shortcoming of state-of-the-art computing solutions is\nthat they ignore the robot's operating environment heterogeneity and make\nstatic, worst-case assumptions. As this heterogeneity impacts the system's\ncomputing payload, an optimal system must dynamically capture these changes in\nthe environment and adjust its computational resources accordingly. This paper\nintroduces RoboRun, a mobile-robot runtime that dynamically exploits the\ncompute-environment synergy to improve performance and energy. We implement\nRoboRun in the Robot Operating System (ROS) and evaluate it on autonomous\ndrones.

We use data from a fully\nremote labour market - an online labour platform - to show that remote work is\npolarised along three dimensions. First, countries are globally divided: North\nAmerican, European, and South Asian remote workers attract most jobs, while\nmany Global South countries participate only marginally. Secondly, remote jobs\nare pulled to urban regions; rural areas fall behind. Thirdly, remote work is\npolarised along the skill axis: workers with in-demand skills attract\nprofitable jobs, while others face intense competition and obtain low wages.\nThe findings suggest that remote work is shaped by agglomerative forces, which\nare deepening the gap between urban and rural areas.

These network systems integrated with neurons and\nsynapses provide computational efficiency by mimicking the human brain. It is\ndesired to incorporate the biological neuronal dynamics, including complex\nspiking patterns which represent diverse brain activities within the neural\nnetworks. Earlier hardware realization of neurons was (1) area intensive\nbecause of large capacitors in the circuit design, (2) neuronal spiking\npatterns were demonstrated with clocked neurons at the device level. To achieve\nmore realistic biological neuron spiking behavior, emerging memristive devices\nare considered promising alternatives. In this paper, we propose, PrMnO3(PMO)\n-RRAM device-based neuron. The voltage-controlled electrothermal timescales of\nthe compact PMO RRAM device replace the electrical timescales of charging a\nlarge capacitor. The electrothermal timescale is used to implement an\nintegration block with multiple voltage-controlled timescales coupled with a\nrefractory block to generate biological neuronal dynamics. Here, first, a\nVerilog-A implementation of the thermal device model is demonstrated, which\ncaptures the current-temperature dynamics of the PMO device. Second, a driving\ncircuitry is designed to mimic different spiking patterns of cortical neurons,\nincluding Intrinsic bursting (IB) and Chattering (CH). Third, a neuron circuit\nmodel is simulated, which includes the PMO RRAM device model and the driving\ncircuitry to demonstrate the asynchronous neuron behavior. Finally, a\nhardware-software hybrid analysis is done in which the PMO RRAM device is\nexperimentally characterized to mimic neuron spiking dynamics. The work\npresents a realizable and more biologically comparable hardware-efficient\nsolution for large-scale SNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 17:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

Implicit Monte Carlo\n(IMC) techniques for modeling radiative transfer have existed from the 1970s.\nWhen they are used for optically thick problems, however, the basic algorithm\nsuffers from \"teleportation\" errors, where the photons propagate faster than\nthe exact physical behavior, due to the absorption-blackbody emission\nprocesses. One possible solution is to use semianalog Monte Carlo, in its new\nimplicit form (ISMC), which uses two kinds of particles, photons and discrete\nmaterial particles. This algorithm yields excellent teleportation-free results,\nbut it also produces noisier solutions (relative to classic IMC), due to its\ndiscrete nature.

However, recent technological advances have led to a major\nrevolution in behavioral measurement.

For a perfect fluid source, it is known that\nfinding a new solution from an existing solution requires solving a Bernoulli\nequation, if the density profile is kept the same. In this paper, we consider\nmaps between static (an)isotropic fluid spheres with the same (arbitrary)\ndensity profile and present solution-generating techniques to find new\nsolutions from existing ones. The maps, in general, require solving an\nassociated Riccati equation, which, unlike the Bernoulli equation, cannot be\nsolved by quadrature. In any case, it can be shown that the output solution is\nnot, in general, regular for a given regular input solution. However, if\npressure anisotropy is kept the same, the new solution is both regular and can\nbe found by solving a Bernoulli equation. We give a few examples where the\ngeneralized TOV equation, under algebraic constraints, can be converted into a\nBernoulli equation and thus, solved exactly. We discuss the physical\nsignificance of these Bernoulli equations. Since the density profile remains\nthe same in our approach, the spatial line element is identical for all\nsolutions, which facilitates direct comparison between various equilibrium\nconfigurations using fluid variables as functions of the radial coordinate.\nFinally, combining with the previous study on generation algorithms, we show\nhow this study leads us to a new three-parameter family of exact solutions that\nsatisfy all desirable physical conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 19:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Therefore, the search for protocols that improve either throughput\nor security (or both) continues. Bitcoin always selects the longest chain\n(i.e., the one with most work). Forks may occur when two miners extend the same\nblock simultaneously, and the frequency of forks depends on how fast blocks are\npropagated in the network. In the GHOST protocol, used by Ethereum, all blocks\ninvolved in the fork contribute to the security. However, the greedy chain\nselection rule of GHOST does not consider the full information available in the\nblock tree, which has led to some concerns about its security.\n  This paper introduces a new family of protocols, called Medium, which takes\nthe structure of the whole block tree into account, by weighting blocks\ndifferently according to their depths. Bitcoin and GHOST result as special\ncases. This protocol leads to new insights about the security of Bitcoin and\nGHOST and paves the way for developing network- and application-specific\nprotocols, in which the influence of forks on the chain-selection process can\nbe controlled. It is shown that almost all protocols in this family achieve\nstrictly greater throughput than Bitcoin (at the same security level) and\nresist attacks that can be mounted against GHOST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 19:49:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

However, most active\nstructures currently lack the capability to achieve multiple, different target\nstates with a single input actuation or require a tedious material programming\nstep. Furthermore, the systematic design and fabrication of active structures\nis still a challenge as many structures are designed by hand in a trial and\nerror process and thus are limited by engineers' knowledge and experience. In\nthis work, a computational design and fabrication framework is proposed to\ngenerate structures with multiple target states for one input actuation that\ndon't require a separate training step. A material dithering scheme based on\nmulti-material 3D printing is combined with locally applied copper coil heating\nelements and sequential heating patterns to control the thermo-mechanical\nproperties of the structures and switch between the different deformation\nmodes. A novel topology optimization approach based on power diagrams is used\nto encode the different target states in the structure while ensuring the\nfabricability of the structures and the compatibility with the drop-in heating\nelements. The versatility of the proposed framework is demonstrated for four\ndifferent example structures from engineering and computer graphics. The\nnumerical and experimental results show that the optimization framework can\nproduce structures that show the desired motion, but experimental accuracy is\nlimited by current fabrication methods. The generality of the proposed method\nmakes it suitable for the development of structures for applications in many\ndifferent fields from aerospace to robotics to animated fabrication in computer\ngraphics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 21:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Although such a large spin-orbit misalignment\nangle naturally points toward a dynamical origin, the measured neutron\nstar-black hole merger rate exceeds theoretical predictions of the dynamical\nformation channel. In the canonical isolated binary formation scenario, the\nimmediate progenitor of GW200115 is likely to be a binary consisting of a black\nhole and a helium star, with the latter forming a neutron star during a\nsupernova explosion. Since the black hole is generally expected to spin along\nthe pre-supernova binary orbital angular momentum axis, a large neutron star\nnatal kick is required to produce the observed misalignment angle.

Even in the absence of quenched disorder, the threshold force that\nmust be applied to translate the driven skyrmion is finite due to elastic\ninteractions with other skyrmions. The depinning threshold increases as the\nstrength of the quenched disorder is raised.

The depinning threshold increases monotonically with skyrmion\ndensity in the absence of quenched disorder, but when pinning is present, the\ndepinning threshold changes nonmonotonically with skyrmion density and there\nare reentrant pinned phases due to a competition between pinning induced by the\nquenched disorder and that produced by the elastic interactions of the skyrmion\nlattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 22:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Economical prediction tools often model these wavepackets in the\nfrequency-domain using stability modes of the mean flow. The use of simplifying\nchoices, such as parabolized equations and azimuthal decomposition, provide\nefficient methods but can impose constraints on rate of streamwise variation of\nthe mean state or geometric complexity. The current investigation develops a\ntime-domain linearized Navier-Stokes-based approach predicated on the mean\nbasic state for two goals: i) to obtain the radiated shallow-angle noise field,\nincluding that from imperfectly expanded jets containing shock trains, and ii)\nto estimate noise control trends with actuator frequency. A previously\ndeveloped implicit linearization technique repurposing native non-linear\nNavier-Stokes code capabilities avoids any additional constraints on nozzle\ngeometry, while its time-domain nature facilitates control analysis through\ntransient pulse response. Two other integral components of the method are the\nsifting of linearized perturbations to isolate the acoustic component with\nDoak's Momentum Potential Theory, and subsequently Dynamic Mode Decomposition\nto analyze the response in different spectral ranges.

Therefore, the implication inferred by the authors i.e. all\nmeasures of absolute treatment effect are of little value compared with the\nrelative measure of the hazard ratio, is not of general validity and hence both\nabsolute and relative measures should continue to be used when appraising\nclinical evidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 01:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

In this study, we discuss two counterintuitive\nbehaviors of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). First, we evaluated the size\nof the receptive field. Previous studies have attempted to increase or control\nthe size of the receptive field. However, we observed that the size of the\nreceptive field does not describe the classification accuracy. The size of the\nreceptive field would be inappropriate for representing superiority in\nperformance because it reflects only depth or kernel size and does not reflect\nother factors such as width or cardinality. Second, using the effective\nreceptive field, we examined the pixels contributing to the output.\nIntuitively, each pixel is expected to equally contribute to the final output.\nHowever, we found that there exist pixels in a partially dead state with little\ncontribution to the output. We reveal that the reason for this lies in the\narchitecture of CNN and discuss solutions to reduce the phenomenon.\nInterestingly, for general classification tasks, the existence of dead pixels\nimproves the training of CNNs. However, in a task that captures small\nperturbation, dead pixels degrade the performance. Therefore, the existence of\nthese dead pixels should be understood and considered in practical applications\nof CNN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 01:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

However, state-of-the-art finite element\nmodeling (FEM) demands considerable computational time in the computation,\nlimiting its application in real-time TBI risk monitoring. To accelerate,\nmachine learning head models (MLHMs) were developed, and the model accuracy was\nfound to decrease when the training/test datasets were from different head\nimpacts types. However, the size of dataset for specific impact types may not\nbe enough for model training. To address the computational cost of FEM, the\nlimited strain rate prediction, and the generalizability of MLHMs to on-field\ndatasets, we propose data fusion and transfer learning to develop a series of\nMLHMs to predict the maximum principal strain (MPS) and maximum principal\nstrain rate (MPSR).

The\nMLHMs developed with transfer learning are significantly more accurate in\nestimating MPS and MPSR than other models, with a mean absolute error (MAE)\nsmaller than 0.03 in predicting MPS and smaller than 7 (1/s) in predicting MPSR\non all impact datasets. The MLHMs can be applied to various head impact types\nfor rapidly and accurately calculating brain strain and strain rate.

However, few user-item interactions\ncan be collected for new users, which results in a null space for their\ninterests, i.e., the cold-start dilemma. In this paper, a two-tower framework,\nnamely, the model-agnostic interest learning (MAIL) framework, is proposed to\naddress the cold-start recommendation (CSR) problem for recommender systems. In\nMAIL, one unique tower is constructed to tackle the CSR from a zero-shot view,\nand the other tower focuses on the general ranking task. Specifically, the\nzero-shot tower first performs cross-modal reconstruction with dual\nauto-encoders to obtain virtual behavior data from highly aligned hidden\nfeatures for new users; and the ranking tower can then output recommendations\nfor users based on the completed data by the zero-shot tower. Practically, the\nranking tower in MAIL is model-agnostic and can be implemented with any\nembedding-based deep models. Based on the co-training of the two towers, the\nMAIL presents an end-to-end method for recommender systems that shows an\nincremental performance improvement. The proposed method has been successfully\ndeployed on the live recommendation system of NetEase Cloud Music to achieve a\nclick-through rate improvement of 13% to 15% for millions of users. Offline\nexperiments on real-world datasets also show its superior performance in CSR.\nOur code is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 02:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

If the target\nis occluded from the sensor, detecting and grasping such objects become very\nchallenging. For example, when multiple robot arms cooperate in a single\nworkplace, occlusions will be created under the robot arm itself and hide\nobjects underneath. While occlusions can be greatly reduced by installing\nmultiple sensors, the increase in sensor costs cannot be ignored. Moreover, the\nsensor placements must be rearranged every time the robot operation routine and\nlayout change.\n  To diminish occlusions, we propose the first robot vision system with\ntilt-type mirror reflection sensing. By instantly tilting the sensor itself, we\nobtain two sensing results with different views: conventional direct\nline-of-sight sensing and non-line-of-sight sensing via mirror reflections. Our\nproposed system removes occlusions adaptively by detecting the occlusions in\nthe scene and dynamically configuring the sensor tilt angle to sense the\ndetected occluded area. Thus, sensor rearrangements are not required even after\nchanges in robot operation or layout. Since the required hardware is the\ntilt-unit and a commercially available mirror, the cost increase is marginal.\nThrough experiments, we show that our system can achieve a similar detection\naccuracy as systems with multiple sensors, regardless of the single-sensor\nimplementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 03:27:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Variants of this method have\nbeen used as regularization mechanisms to achieve SOTA results on NLP\nbenchmarks, and they have been found to be useful for transfer learning and\ncontinual learning. We search for the reasons for the effectiveness of AT by\ncontrasting vanilla and adversarially fine-tuned BERT models. We identify\npartial preservation of BERT's syntactic abilities during fine-tuning as the\nkey to the success of AT. We observe that adversarially fine-tuned models\nremain more faithful to BERT's language modeling behavior and are more\nsensitive to the word order. As concrete examples of syntactic abilities, an\nadversarially fine-tuned model could have an advantage of up to 38% on anaphora\nagreement and up to 11% on dependency parsing. Our analysis demonstrates that\nvanilla fine-tuning oversimplifies the sentence representation by focusing\nheavily on a small subset of words.

Although prior works that\nexplore lip reading have obtained salient achievements, they are all trained in\na non-simultaneous manner where the predictions are generated requiring access\nto the full video. To breakthrough this constraint, we study the task of\nsimultaneous lip reading and devise SimulLR, a simultaneous lip Reading\ntransducer with attention-guided adaptive memory from three aspects: (1) To\naddress the challenge of monotonic alignments while considering the syntactic\nstructure of the generated sentences under simultaneous setting, we build a\ntransducer-based model and design several effective training strategies\nincluding CTC pre-training, model warm-up and curriculum learning to promote\nthe training of the lip reading transducer. (2) To learn better spatio-temporal\nrepresentations for simultaneous encoder, we construct a truncated 3D\nconvolution and time-restricted self-attention layer to perform the\nframe-to-frame interaction within a video segment containing fixed number of\nframes. (3) The history information is always limited due to the storage in\nreal-time scenarios, especially for massive video data. Therefore, we devise a\nnovel attention-guided adaptive memory to organize semantic information of\nhistory segments and enhance the visual representations with acceptable\ncomputation-aware latency. The experiments show that the SimulLR achieves the\ntranslation speedup 9.10$\\times$ compared with the state-of-the-art\nnon-simultaneous methods, and also obtains competitive results, which indicates\nthe effectiveness of our proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 05:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

In this paper, a new method of this kind is proposed in which the\nwell-sliced metadynamics approach (WSMTD) is united with Replica Exchange with\nSolute Tempering (REST2) method. WSMTD employs a divide-and-conquer strategy\nwherein high-dimensional slices of a free energy surface are independently\nsampled and combined. The method enables one to accomplish a controlled\nexploration of the CV-space with a restraining bias as in umbrella sampling\n(US), and enhance-sampling of one or more orthogonal CVs using a metadynamics\n(MTD) like bias. The new hybrid method proposed here enables boosting the\nsampling of more slow degrees of freedom in WSMTD simulations, without the need\nto specify associated CVs, through a replica exchange scheme within the\nframework of REST2. The high-dimensional slices of the probability\ndistributions of CVs computed from the united WSMTD and REST2 simulations are\nsubsequently combined using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) to\nobtain the free energy surface.

Online\n3D-BPP can be naturally formulated as Markov Decision Process (MDP). We adopt\ndeep reinforcement learning, in particular, the on-policy actor-critic\nframework, to solve this MDP with constrained action space. To learn a\npractically feasible packing policy, we propose three critical designs. First,\nwe propose an online analysis of packing stability based on a novel stacking\ntree. It attains a high analysis accuracy while reducing the computational\ncomplexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \\log N)$, making it especially suited for RL\ntraining. Second, we propose a decoupled packing policy learning for different\ndimensions of placement which enables high-resolution spatial discretization\nand hence high packing precision.

Here, we introduce a formal game-theoretic model of engagement with\nnews stories that captures the strategic interplay between (mis)information\nconsumers and producers. A key insight from the model is that observed patterns\nof engagement do not necessarily reflect the preferences of consumers. This is\nbecause producers seeking to promote misinformation can use strategies that\nlead moderately inattentive readers to engage more with false stories than true\nones -- even when readers prefer more accurate over less accurate information.\nWe then empirically test people's preferences for accuracy in the news. In\nthree studies, we find that people strongly prefer to click and share news they\nperceive as more accurate -- both in a general population sample, and in a\nsample of users recruited through Twitter who had actually shared links to\nmisinformation sites online. Despite this preference for accurate news -- and\nconsistent with the predictions of our model -- we find markedly different\nengagement patterns for articles from misinformation versus mainstream news\nsites. Using 1,000 headlines from 20 misinformation and 20 mainstream news\nsites, we compare Facebook engagement data with 20,000 accuracy ratings\ncollected in a survey experiment. Engagement with a headline is negatively\ncorrelated with perceived accuracy for misinformation sites, but positively\ncorrelated with perceived accuracy for mainstream sites. Taken together, these\ntheoretical and empirical results suggest that consumer preferences cannot be\nstraightforwardly inferred from empirical patterns of engagement. Rather,\nunderstanding people's preferences requires that we account for the strategic\ninterplay between consumers and producers of news.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 08:55:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 16:33:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 15:38:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 22:00:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 16:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

To facilitate research addressing this problem, we propose a\nnew testbed that requires an agent to reason about physical scenarios and take\nan action appropriately.

By having\nsuch a design, we evaluate two distinct levels of generalization, namely the\nlocal generalization and the broad generalization. We conduct an extensive\nevaluation with human players, learning agents with varying input types and\narchitectures, and heuristic agents with different strategies. Inspired by how\nhuman IQ is calculated, we define the physical reasoning quotient (Phy-Q score)\nthat reflects the physical reasoning intelligence of an agent using the\nphysical scenarios we considered. Our evaluation shows that 1) all agents are\nfar below human performance, and 2) learning agents, even with good local\ngeneralization ability, struggle to learn the underlying physical reasoning\nrules and fail to generalize broadly.

The use of\nmultiple reference images together with attention-based sampling is\ndemonstrated to achieve significantly improved performance over\nstate-of-the-art reference super-resolution approaches on multiple benchmark\ndatasets. Reference super-resolution approaches have recently been proposed to\novercome the ill-posed problem of image super-resolution by providing\nadditional information from a high-resolution reference image.

A novel hierarchical attention-based sampling approach is\nintroduced to learn the similarity between low-resolution image features and\nmultiple reference images based on a perceptual loss. Ablation demonstrates the\ncontribution of both multi-reference and hierarchical attention-based sampling\nto overall performance.

The ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission\nwill search for terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars.\nBecause of telemetry limitations, PLATO targets need to be pre-selected. Aims.\nIn this paper, we present an all sky catalogue that will be fundamental to\nselecting the best PLATO fields and the most promising target stars, deriving\ntheir basic parameters, analysing the instrumental performances, and then\nplaning and optimising follow-up observations. This catalogue also represents a\nvaluable resource for the general definition of stellar samples optimised for\nthe search of transiting planets. Methods. We used Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2)\nastrometry and photometry and 3D maps of the local interstellar medium to\nisolate FGK (V$\\leq$13) and M (V$\\leq$16) dwarfs and subgiant stars. Results.\nWe present the first public release of the all-sky PLATO Input Catalogue\n(asPIC1.1) containing a total of 2 675 539 stars including 2 378 177 FGK dwarfs\nand subgiants and 297 362 M dwarfs.

We derived the reddening\nof our targets and developed an algorithm to estimate stellar fundamental\nparameters (Teff, radius, mass) from astrometric and photometric measurements.\nConclusions. We show that the overall (internal+external) uncertainties on the\nstellar parameter determined in the present study are $\\sim$230 K (4%) for the\neffective temperatures, $\\sim$0.1 R$_{\\odot}$ (9%) for the stellar radii, and\n$\\sim$0.1 M$_{\\odot}$ (11%) for the stellar mass.

The three-body nature of\ndeuteron-target potential is treated within adiabatic distorted wave\napproximation (ADWA) which relies on dominant contribution from the components\nof the three-body deuteron-target wave function with small $n$-$p$ separations.\nThis results in a simple prescription for treating the explicit\nenergy-dependence of two-body optical potentials in a three-body system\nrequiring nucleon optical potentials to be evaluated at a shifted energy with\nrespect to the standard value of half the deuteron incident energy. In\naddition, the ADWA allows for leading-order multiple scattering effects to be\nestimated, which leads to a simple renormalization of the adiabatic potential's\nimaginary part by the factor of two.

Most channel\npruning methods recover the prediction accuracy by re-training the pruned model\nfrom the remaining parameters or random initialization. This re-training\nprocess is heavily dependent on the sufficiency of computational resources,\ntraining data, and human interference(tuning the training strategy). In this\npaper, a highly efficient pruning method is proposed to significantly reduce\nthe cost of pruning DCNN.

We account for these two\nkey pieces of information to investigate whether single star models can\nreproduce the observed properties of sigma Ori E and provide new estimates for\nits metallicity, mass, and age. We compute rotating stellar models accounting\nfor wind magnetic braking and magnetic quenching of the mass loss.

No solution is\nobtained with the present models for a metallicity Z=0.014. The initial\nrotation of the models fitting sigma Ori E is not much constrained and can be\nanywhere in the range studied in the present work. Because of its very young\nage, models predict no observable changes of the surface abundances due to\nrotational mixing. The simultaneous high surface rotation and high surface\nmagnetic field of sigma Ori E may simply be a consequence of its young age.\nThis young age implies that the processes responsible for producing the\nchemical inhomogeneities that are observed at its surface should be rapid.

To overcome such weakness, we define the hybrid class\n$\\mathbb{H_{NC}}$ of Horn Non-Clausal (Horn-NC) formulas, by adequately lifting\nthe Horn pattern to NC form, and argue that $\\mathbb{H_{NC}}$, along with\nfuture Horn-NC algorithms, shall increase non-clausal efficiency just as the\nHorn class has increased clausal efficiency. Secondly, we: (i) give the\ncompact, inductive definition of $\\mathbb{H_{NC}}$; (ii) prove that\nsyntactically $\\mathbb{H_{NC}}$ subsumes the Horn class but semantically both\nclasses are equivalent, and (iii) characterize the non-clausal formulas\nbelonging to $\\mathbb{H_{NC}}$. Thirdly, we define the Non-Clausal\nUnit-Resolution calculus, $UR_{NC}$, and prove that it checks the\nsatisfiability of $\\mathbb{H_{NC}}$ in polynomial time. This fact, to our\nknowledge, makes $\\mathbb{H_{NC}}$ the first characterized polynomial class in\nNC reasoning. Finally, we prove that $\\mathbb{H_{NC}}$ is linearly\nrecognizable, and also that it is both strictly succincter and exponentially\nricher than the Horn class. We discuss that in NC automated reasoning, e.g.\nsatisfiability solving, theorem proving, logic programming, etc., can directly\nbenefit from $\\mathbb{H_{NC}}$ and $UR_{NC}$ and that, as a by-product of its\nproved properties, $\\mathbb{H_{NC}}$ arises as a new alternative to analyze\nHorn functions and implication systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 10:55:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2021 14:03:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 12:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach, named Discriminative Semantic Feature\nPyramid Network with Guided Anchoring (DSFP-GA), which can address these\nchallenges via aggregating the semantic information and generating different\naspect ratio anchor boxes. More specifically, our approach mainly consists of\nDiscriminative Semantic Feature Pyramid (DSFP) and Guided Anchoring (GA).\nConsidering that low-level feature maps that are used to detect small logo\nobjects lack semantic information, we propose the DSFP, which can enrich more\ndiscriminative semantic features of low-level feature maps and can achieve\nbetter performance on small logo objects. Furthermore, preset anchor boxes are\nless efficient for detecting large aspect ratio logo objects. We therefore\nintegrate the GA into our method to generate large aspect ratio anchor boxes to\nmitigate this issue. Extensive experimental results on four benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DSFP-GA.

The joint\nbeamforming design is formulated into a nonconvex worst-case robust programming\nto minimize the transmit power subject to single-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nrequirements.

Originally thought to affect only inexperienced,\nlow-achieving students, recent investigations show how math anxiety is vastly\ndiffused even among high-performing learners. This review of data-informed\nstudies outlines math anxiety as a complex system that: (i) cripples\nwell-being, self-confidence and information processing on both conscious and\nsubconscious levels, (ii) can be transmitted by social interactions, like a\npathogen, and worsened by distorted perceptions, (iii) affects roughly 20% of\nstudents in 63 out of 64 worldwide educational systems but correlates weakly\nwith academic performance, and (iv) poses a concrete threat to students'\nwell-being, computational literacy and career prospects in science. These\npatterns underline the crucial need to go beyond performance for estimating\nmath anxiety. Recent advances with network psychometrics and cognitive network\nscience provide ideal frameworks for detecting, interpreting and intervening\nupon such clinical condition. Merging education research, psychology and data\nscience, the approaches reviewed here reconstruct psychological constructs as\ncomplex systems, represented either as multivariate correlation models (e.g.\ngraph exploratory analysis) or as cognitive networks of semantic/emotional\nassociations (e.g. free association networks or forma mentis networks). Not\nonly can these interconnected networks detect otherwise hidden levels of math\nanxiety but - more crucially - they can unveil the specific layout of\ninteracting factors, e.g. key sources and targets, behind math anxiety in a\ngiven cohort. As discussed here, these network approaches open concrete ways\nfor unveiling students' perceptions, emotions and mental well-being, and can\nenable future powerful data-informed interventions untangling math anxiety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 12:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Proper analysis of such data needs to consider not only\ndependencies on-sight but also dependencies in and in-between variables as a\nfunction of spatial separation. Spatial Blind Source Separation (SBSS) is a\nrecently developed unsupervised statistical tool that deals with such data by\nassuming that the observable data is formed by a linear latent variable model.\nIn SBSS the latent variable is assumed to be constituted by weakly stationary\nrandom fields which are uncorrelated. Such a model is appealing as further\nanalysis can be carried out on the marginal distributions of the latent\nvariables, interpretations are straightforward as the model is assumed to be\nlinear, and not all components of the latent field might be of interest which\nacts as a form of dimension reduction. The weakly stationarity assumption of\nSBSS implies that the mean of the data is constant for all sample locations,\nwhich might be too restricting in practical applications. Therefore, an\nadaptation of SBSS that uses scatter matrices based on differences was recently\nsuggested in the literature.

However, directly solving the\nhigh-dimensional embedding problem is not feasible due to the large number of\nvariables and the fact that the embedding problem is highly nonlinear. We\novercome the challenges with two novel ideas. First, instead of taking all\nvertices as variables, we embed only the saddle vertices, which greatly reduces\nthe problem complexity. We then compute a local embedding for each non-saddle\nvertex. Second, to reduce the large approximation error resulting from the\npurely Euclidean embedding, we propose a cascaded optimization approach that\nrepeatedly introduces additional embedding coordinates with a non-Euclidean\nfunction to reduce the approximation residual. Using the precomputation data,\nour approach can determine the geodesic distance between any two vertices in\nnear-constant time.

Of them, the second harmonic\nis usually the strongest and the one to which the receiver is tuned. This\nfrequency difference distinguishes the tag reflection from environmental\nclutter, which remains at the uplink (transmitter to tag) frequency. However,\nthe passive nature of HR tags severely limits the reflected power, and\ntherefore the range of the downlink (tag to receiver) path. We propose to\nincrease the range and/or signal to noise ratio (SNR) by novel restructuring at\nthe physical and signal levels. For this, we accompany the original transmitter\nwith auxiliary transmitters able to send simple tones that are synchronized to\narrive at the tag in phase, and we design the receiver to detect an\nintermodulation component. The resulting range and SNR are much greater than\nthose of the original, conventional HR system, and greater even than if the\noriginal system were to transmit with power equal to the aggregate power of our\nnew system. Achieving mutually coherent, i.e., in phase, arrival of the tones\nat the tag is the focus of the present paper. We provide a system framework\nthat models the tag and the uplink and downlink, then present the adaptive\nphase coherence algorithm and analyze the probabilistic growth of the output\nsignal power. We also account for the effects of frequency shifts due to\ntransmitter mobility and the frequency offset errors in the transmitter local\noscillators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 14:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

It is well known that an increase of fibrinogen concentration, an\naggregation-inducing protein for erythrocytes, leads to an increase of the\nsedimentation rate of erythrocytes, which is generally explained through the\nformation and faster settling of large disjoint aggregates. However, many\naspects of erythrocyte sedimentation conform well with the collapse of a\ncolloidal gel rather than with the sedimentation of disjoint aggregates. Using\nexperiments and cell-level numerical simulations, we systematically investigate\nthe dependence of ESR on fibrinogen concentration and its relation to the\nmicrostructure of the gel-like erythrocyte suspension.

This\ngeometrical change in the network structure occurs due to anisotropic shape and\ndeformability of erythrocytes and leads to an increased gel permeability and\nfaster sedimentation.

This\nis problematic as many niche domains rely on small text corpora, which\nnaturally restricts the amount of synthetic data that can be generated.

All but one of them\nproduce explosions driven by neutrino heating (more likely for low mass\nprogenitors up to 8 solar masses) and non-spherical flows or by\nmagnetorotational stresses (more frequent above 26 solar masses). In most of\nthem and for the one non-exploding model, ongoing accretion leads to black-hole\nformation. Rapid rotation makes a subsequent collapsar activity plausible.\nModels not forming black holes show proto-magnetar driven jets. Conditions for\nthe formation of nickel are more favourable in magneto-rotationally driven\nmodels, though our rough estimates fall short of the requirements for extremely\nbright events if these are powered by radioactive decay. However, approximate\nlight curves of our models suggest that a proto-magnetar or black hole\nspin-down may fuel luminous transients (with peak luminosities ~ 10^{43...44}\nerg).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 14:17:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 13:32:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

Using an analysis-by-synthesis approach, we design a novel GAN\narchitecture to synthesize a multiple-instance depth image with independent\ncontrol over each instance. InSeGAN takes in a set of code vectors (e.g.,\nrandom noise vectors), each encoding the 3D pose of an object that is\nrepresented by a learned implicit object template. The generator has two\ndistinct modules. The first module, the instance feature generator, uses each\nencoded pose to transform the implicit template into a feature map\nrepresentation of each object instance. The second module, the depth image\nrenderer, aggregates all of the single-instance feature maps output by the\nfirst module and generates a multiple-instance depth image. A discriminator\ndistinguishes the generated multiple-instance depth images from the\ndistribution of true depth images. To use our model for instance segmentation,\nwe propose an instance pose encoder that learns to take in a generated depth\nimage and reproduce the pose code vectors for all of the object instances. To\nevaluate our approach, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, \"Insta-10\",\nconsisting of 100,000 depth images, each with 5 instances of an object from one\nof 10 classes. Our experiments on Insta-10, as well as on real-world noisy\ndepth images, show that InSeGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, often\noutperforming prior methods by large margins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 14:18:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 17:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-31"}

In the context of\nstructured light, the spatial pattern is distorted in amplitude and phase,\noften arising from optical imperfections, element misalignment, or even from\ndynamic processes due to propagation through perturbing media such as living\ntissue, free-space, underwater and optical fibre. Here we show that the\npolarisation inhomogeneity that defines vectorial structured light is immune to\nall such perturbations, provided they are unitary. By way of example, we study\nthe robustness of vector vortex beams to tilted lenses and atmospheric\nturbulence, both highly asymmetric aberrations, demonstrating that the\ninhomogeneous nature of the polarisation remains unaltered from the near-field\nto far-field, even as the structure itself changes. The unitary nature of the\nchannel allows us to undo this change through a simple lossless operation,\ntailoring light that appears robust in all its spatial structure regardless of\nthe medium. Our insight highlights the overlooked role of measurement in\ndescribing classical vectorial light fields, in doing so resolving prior\ncontradictory reports on the robustness of vector beams in complex media.

We here study theoretically a\none-dimensional zig-zag ladder system of such spin-orbit coupled Rydberg atoms\nat half filling. The second-order hopping is shown to be associated with an\neffective gauge field, which in mean-field approximation is static and\nhomogeneous. Beyond the mean-field level the gauge potential attains a\ntransverse quantum component whose amplitude is dynamical and linked to density\nmodulations.

They consist of an\nencoder and a decoder, which provide a straightforward way to map n-dimensional\ndata in input space to a lower m-dimensional representation space and back. The\ndecoder itself defines an m-dimensional manifold in input space. Inspired by\nmanifold learning, we show that the decoder can be trained on its own by\nlearning the representations of the training samples along with the decoder\nweights using gradient descent. A sum-of-squares loss then corresponds to\noptimizing the manifold to have the smallest Euclidean distance to the training\nsamples, and similarly for other loss functions. We derive expressions for the\nnumber of samples needed to specify the encoder and decoder and show that the\ndecoder generally requires much less training samples to be well-specified\ncompared to the encoder.

We evaluated the light yield by cooling the gas from room\ntemperature (300K) to 263K. As a result, the light yield of $\\mathrm{CF_{4}}$\nwas found to increase by $(41.0\\pm4.0_{\\rm stat.}\\pm6.6_{\\rm syst.})\\%$ and the\nenergy resolution was also found to improve at low temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 15:35:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 09:19:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 07:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

Inline with the trustworthy ML goal, a useful\ninput to potentially aid robustness evaluation is feature-based explanations of\nmodel predictions. In this paper, we present a novel approach called EG-Booster\nthat leverages techniques from explainable ML to guide adversarial example\ncrafting for improved robustness evaluation of ML models before deploying them\nin security-critical settings. The key insight in EG-Booster is the use of\nfeature-based explanations of model predictions to guide adversarial example\ncrafting by adding consequential perturbations likely to result in model\nevasion and avoiding non-consequential ones unlikely to contribute to evasion.\nEG-Booster is agnostic to model architecture, threat model, and supports\ndiverse distance metrics used previously in the literature. We evaluate\nEG-Booster using image classification benchmark datasets, MNIST and CIFAR10.\nOur findings suggest that EG-Booster significantly improves evasion rate of\nstate-of-the-art attacks while performing less number of perturbations. Through\nextensive experiments that covers four white-box and three black-box attacks,\nwe demonstrate the effectiveness of EG-Booster against two undefended neural\nnetworks trained on MNIST and CIFAR10, and another adversarially-trained ResNet\nmodel trained on CIFAR10.

The prefactor of the logarithm (effective\ncentral charge) varies continuously with the defect strength. The energy\ndispersion is also obtained and sharp features in the von Neumann entanglement\nentropy are observed when bands cross.

Additionally, in this situation, the presence\nof the bond defect makes the effective central charge becomes smaller than the\nnumber of gapless modes times the effective central charge of hamiltonians with\none gapless mode.

However, a systematic control solution to tackle such varying\ndynamical behaviour is still missing. In this work, two control solutions are\nproposed to solve two specific problems in aerial transportation of payload, as\nmentioned below. In the first work, we explore the tracking control problem for\na six degrees-of-freedom quadrotor carrying different unknown payloads. Due to\nthe state-dependent nature of the uncertainties caused by variation in the\ndynamics, the state-of-the-art adaptive control solutions would be ineffective\nagainst these uncertainties that can be completely unknown and possibly\nunbounded a priori. In addition, external disturbances such as wind while\nfollowing a trajectory in all three positions and attitude angles. Hence, an\nadaptive control solution for quadrotors is proposed, which does not require\nany a priori knowledge of the parameters of quadrotor dynamics and external\ndisturbances. The second work is focused on the interchanging dynamic behaviour\nof a quadrotor while loading and unloading different payloads during vertical\noperations. The control problem to maintain the desired altitude is formulated\nvia a switched dynamical framework to capture the interchanging dynamics of the\nquadrotor during such vertical operations, and a robust adaptive control\nsolution is proposed to tackle such dynamics when it is unknown.

Using the reconstruction\ntechnique, and in addition by employing suitable boundary conditions, we\ndetermine the form of F(R) for the entire possible range of the cosmic time.\nThe form of F(R) seems to unify a non-singular bounce with a dark energy epoch,\nin particular, from a non-singular bounce to a deceleration epoch and from a\ndeceleration epoch to a late time acceleration era. It is important to mention\nthat the bouncing scenario in the present context is an asymmetric bounce, in\nparticular, the Hubble radius monotonically increases and asymptotically\ndiverges at the late contracting era, while it seems to decrease with time at\nthe present epoch. Such evolution of the Hubble radius leads to the primordial\nperturbation modes generate at the deep contracting era when all the\nperturbation modes lie within the horizon.

Connexive logics emerged\nfrom the intuition that conditionals of the form \"If $\\sim A$, then $A$\",\nshould not hold, since the conditional's antecedent $\\sim A$ contradicts its\nconsequent $A$. Our approach covers this intuition by observing that for an\nevent A the only coherent probability assessment on the conditional event\n$A|\\overline{A}$ is $p(A|\\overline{A})=0$. Moreover, connexive logics aim to\ncapture the intuition that conditionals should express some \"connection\"\nbetween the antecedent and the consequent or, in terms of inferences, validity\nshould require some connection between the premise set and the conclusion. This\nintuition is covered by a number of principles, a selection of which we analyze\nin our contribution. We present two approaches to connexivity within\ncoherence-based probability logic.

While\nminimal representations can produce behavioral outputs like locomotion or\nsimple decision-making, more elaborate internal representations might offer a\nricher variety of behaviors. We propose that these issues can be addressed with\na computational approach we call meta-brain models. Meta-brain models are\nembodied hybrid models that include layered components featuring varying\ndegrees of representational complexity. We will propose combinations of layers\ncomposed using specialized types of models. Rather than using a generic black\nbox approach to unify each component, this relationship mimics systems like the\nneocortical-thalamic system relationship of the mammalian brain, which utilizes\nboth feedforward and feedback connectivity to facilitate functional\ncommunication. Importantly, the relationship between layers can be made\nanatomically explicit. This allows for structural specificity that can be\nincorporated into the model's function in interesting ways. We will propose\nseveral types of layers that might be functionally integrated into agents that\nperform unique types of tasks, from agents that simultaneously perform\nmorphogenesis and perception, to agents that undergo morphogenesis and the\nacquisition of conceptual representations simultaneously. Our approach to\nmeta-brain models involves creating models with different degrees of\nrepresentational complexity, creating a layered meta-architecture that mimics\nthe structural and functional heterogeneity of biological brains, and an\ninput/output methodology flexible enough to accommodate cognitive functions,\nsocial interactions, and adaptive behaviors more generally. We will conclude by\nproposing next steps in the development of this flexible and open-source\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 05:20:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 06:38:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 21:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

It is of interest to\nidentify the item name in the other forms of text using a named entity tagger.\nHowever, the title of an item and its description are syntactically different\n(but semantically similar) in that the title is not necessarily a well formed\nsentence while the description is made up of well formed sentences. In this\nwork, we use a triplet loss to contrast the embeddings of the item title with\nthe description to establish a proof of concept. We find that using the triplet\nloss in a multi-task NER algorithm improves both the precision and recall by a\nsmall percentage. While the improvement is small, we think it is a step in the\nright direction of using various forms of text in a multi-task algorithm. In\naddition to precision and recall, the multi task triplet loss method is also\nfound to significantly improve the exact match accuracy i.e. the accuracy of\ntagging the entire set of tokens in the text with correct tags.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 01:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

Those\ngenerative models can learn protein representations that are often more\ninformative of protein structure and function than hand-engineered features.\nFurthermore, they can be used to quickly propose millions of novel proteins\nthat resemble the native counterparts in terms of expression level, stability,\nor other attributes. The protein design process can further be guided by\ndiscriminative oracles to select candidates with the highest probability of\nhaving the desired properties.

In big cities with complex\nroad network topology, a huge number of costly RSUs must be deployed to collect\ndata gathered by all moving vehicles. In this respect, several research works\nfocusing on RSUs deployment have been proposed. The thriving challenge would be\nto (i) reduce the deployment cost by minimizing as far as possible the number\nof used RSUs; and (ii) to maximize the coverage ratio. In this thesis, we\nintroduce a spatio-temporal RSU deployment framework including three methods\nnamely SPaCov/SPaCov+, HeSPic and MIP. SPaCov starts by mining frequent\nmobility patterns of moving vehicles from their trajectories then it computes\nthe best RSU locations that cover the extracted patterns. Nonetheless, SPaCov+\nextracts the frequent mobility patterns as well as the rare ones to enhance the\ncoverage ratio. HeSiC is a budget-constrained spatio-temporal coverage method\nthat aims to maximize the coverage ratio subject to a budget constraint, which\nis defined in terms of RSUs number. MIP is a spatio-temporal coverage method\nthat aims to finding representative transactions from the sequential database\nand computing coverage. Performed simulations highlight the efficiency and the\neffectiveness of the proposed RSU deployment framework in terms of coverage\nratio, deployment cost, network latency and overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 12:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}
