In this work, we\npropose X-modaler -- a versatile and high-performance codebase that\nencapsulates the state-of-the-art cross-modal analytics into several\ngeneral-purpose stages (e.g., pre-processing, encoder, cross-modal interaction,\ndecoder, and decode strategy).

Meanwhile, since the effective modular\ndesigns in several stages (e.g., cross-modal interaction) are shared across\ndifferent vision-language tasks, X-modaler can be simply extended to power\nstartup prototypes for other tasks in cross-modal analytics, including visual\nquestion answering, visual commonsense reasoning, and cross-modal retrieval.\nX-modaler is an Apache-licensed codebase, and its source codes, sample projects\nand pre-trained models are available on-line:\nhttps://github.com/YehLi/xmodaler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 16:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

These equivalent forms provide different physical\nperspectives and numerical conveniences. Temperature equilibration and\ncontinuity across the material interfaces are achieved with the instantaneous\nthermal relaxation. Temperature equilibrium is maintained during the heat\nconduction process. The proposed models are proved to respect the\nthermodynamical laws. For numerical solution, the model is split into a\nhyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) system and parabolic PDE\nsystems.

At present, the academic research of fingerprint\ngender characteristics is generally at the level of understanding, while the\nstandardization research is quite limited. In this work, we propose a more\nrobust method, Dense Dilated Convolution ResNet (DDC-ResNet) to extract valid\ngender information from fingerprints. By replacing the normal convolution\noperations with the atrous convolution in the backbone, prior knowledge is\nprovided to keep the edge details and the global reception field can be\nextended. We explored the results in 3 ways: 1) The efficiency of the\nDDC-ResNet. 6 typical methods of automatic feature extraction coupling with 9\nmainstream classifiers are evaluated in our dataset with fair implementation\ndetails. Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of our approach\noutperforms other combinations in terms of average accuracy and separate-gender\naccuracy. It reaches 96.5% for average and 0.9752 (males)/0.9548 (females) for\nseparate-gender accuracy. 2) The effect of fingers. It is found that the best\nperformance of classifying gender with separate fingers is achieved by the\nright ring finger. 3) The effect of specific features. Based on the\nobservations of the concentrations of fingerprints visualized by our approach,\nit can be inferred that loops and whorls (level 1), bifurcations (level 2), as\nwell as line shapes (level 3) are connected with gender.

However,\nits performance is still inferior compared with LiDAR-based detection\nalgorithms. To detect and localize accurate 3D bounding boxes, LiDAR-based\nmodels can encode accurate object boundaries and surface normal directions from\nLiDAR point clouds. However, the detection results of stereo-based detectors\nare easily affected by the erroneous depth features due to the limitation of\nstereo matching. To solve the problem, we propose LIGA-Stereo (LiDAR Geometry\nAware Stereo Detector) to learn stereo-based 3D detectors under the guidance of\nhigh-level geometry-aware representations of LiDAR-based detection models. In\naddition, we found existing voxel-based stereo detectors failed to learn\nsemantic features effectively from indirect 3D supervisions. We attach an\nauxiliary 2D detection head to provide direct 2D semantic supervisions.\nExperiment results show that the above two strategies improved the geometric\nand semantic representation capabilities.

Leveraging and refining the K-function representation of quantum\nstates in the coherent basis, we develop a theoretical model amenable to\nnumerical optimization and, as specific examples, design quantum frequency\nprocessor circuits for the production of Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat states, exploring\nthe performance tradeoffs for several combinations of ancilla modes and circuit\ndepth. Our scheme provides a valuable general framework for producing complex\nquantum states in frequency bins, paving the way for single-spatial-mode,\nfiber-optic-compatible non-Gaussian resource states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 17:58:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 20:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

In this work, we probe the limits of planetesimal\nformation when the external source of pressure bump reinforcement is extremely\nweak. We conduct simulations of radially elongated shearing boxes to capture\nthe entire bump, which is generated and maintained over some timescale $t_{\\rm\nreinf}$ by a Newtonian relaxation scheme.

We reduced the strength of\nreinforcement by up to a factor of 100 and the location and initial masses of\nplanetesimals were essentially unaffected. However, we do find that strong\nreinforcement causes much faster pebble drift compared to the the standard\npebble drift rates. The resulting larger pebble flux enhances the planetesimal\ngrowth rate by pebble accretion. We hypothesize that to sustain the bump, our\ncode has to extract angular momentum (the strength of this negative torque\ndepends on $t_{\\rm reinf}$), and some of this torque is transferred to the\nparticles, causing them to drift faster for a stronger torque (i.e., smaller\n$t_{\\rm reinf}$).

One such class consists\nof foliated field theories which, roughly, are built by coupling together\nfields supported on the leaves of foliations of spacetime. Another approach,\nwhich we refer to as exotic field theory, focuses on constructing Lagrangians\nconsistent with special symmetries (like subsystem symmetries) that are\nadjacent to fracton physics. A third framework is that of infinite-component\nChern-Simons theories, which attempts to generalize the role of conventional\nChern-Simons theory in describing (2+1)D Abelian topological order to fractonic\norder in (3+1)D. The study of these theories is ongoing, and many of their\nproperties remain to be understood.\n  Historically, it has been fruitful to study QFTs by embedding them into\nstring theory. One way this can be done is via D-branes, extended objects whose\ndynamics can, at low energies, be described in terms of conventional quantum\nfield theory. QFTs that can be realized in this way can then be analyzed using\nthe rich mathematical and physical structure of string theory. In this paper,\nwe show that foliated field theories, exotic field theories, and\ninfinite-component Chern-Simons theories can all be realized on the\nworld-volumes of branes. We hope that these constructions will ultimately yield\nvaluable insights into the physics of these interesting field theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 18:02:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2021 20:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

For computational tractability in real large-scale settings, such plans\nare typically computed by solving deterministic and cyclic formulations. An\nimportant input is the periodic demand, i.e., the demand that is expected to\nrepeat in each period of the planning horizon. Motivated by the discrepancy\nbetween time series forecasts of demand in each period and the periodic demand,\nLaage et al. (2021) recently introduced the Periodic Demand Estimation (PDE)\nproblem and showed that it has a high value. However, they made strong\nassumptions on the solution space so that the problem could be solved by\nenumeration. In this paper we significantly extend their work. We propose a new\nPDE formulation that relaxes the strong assumptions on the solution space. We\nsolve large instances of this formulation with a two-step heuristic. The first\nstep reduces the dimension of the feasible space by performing clustering of\ncommodities based on instance-specific information about demand and supply\ninteractions. The formulation along with the first step allow to solve the\nproblem in a second step by either metaheuristics or the state-of-the-art\nblack-box optimization solver NOMAD.

Because the apparatus has an enormous number of degrees of\nfreedom relative to the measured system, even a very tiny difference between\nthe apparatus states that are correlated with the orthogonal states of the\nmeasured system can be sufficient to account for the perceived deviation from\nstrict conservation of the quantity in question.

The temperature\ncoefficient of resistivity (TCR) is small (2 ppm/K). The Hall coefficient is\npositive while the Seebeck coefficients is negative. This is interpreted as\narising from an electronic structure where the Fermi level passes through band\nstates having both holes and electrons as indicated by band structure\ncalculations. The HEA structure appears stable for annealing in vacuum, while\nannealing in an oxygen containing atmosphere causes the surface to oxidize and\ngrow a Cr-rich oxide on the surface. This is then accompanied by demixing of\nthe HEA solid solution and a decrease in residual resistance of the film.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 20:15:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 07:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

The resulting nonlinear magnon interactions separate into\ntwo-magnon intra- and interband scattering processes.

In addition,\nwe study the effect of magnon interactions on the polarization of magnon modes.\nWe find that although the noninteracting eigenmodes in the uniaxial case are\ncircularly polarized, but in the presence of nonlinear thermal interactions the\nlocal U(1) symmetry of the Hamiltonian is broken. The attractive nonlinear\ninteractions squeeze the low-energy magnon modes and make them elliptical. In\nthe biaxial case, on the other hand, the bare eigenmodes of low energy magnons\nare elliptically polarized but thermal nonlinear interactions squeeze them\nfurther.

In this work we focus on the limiting distributions of\none-dimensional RWCRE in the regime where the fluctuations of the corresponding\n(static) RWRE is given by a $s$-stable random variable with $s\\in(1,2)$. In\nthis regime, due to the two extreme cases (resampling every step and never\nresampling, respectively), a crossover from Gaussian to stable limits for\nsufficiently regular cooling sequence was previously conjectured. Our first\nresult answers affirmatively this conjecture by making clear critical exponent,\nnorming sequences and limiting laws associated with the crossover which\ndemonstrates a change from Gaussian to $s$-stable limits, passing at\ncriticality through a certain generalized tempered stable distribution.

MGs have a simple atomic structure and\nbelong to the category of moderately fragile glasses that undergo pronounced\nslowdown of bulk dynamics with cooling close to the glass transition\ntemperature (Tg). We observe that DS exhibits a much more moderate slowdown\ncompared to DV when approaching Tg, and DS/DV at Tg varies by two orders of\nmagnitude among the MGs investigated.

Fragility, a measure of the\nslowdown of bulk dynamics close to Tg, also correlates to DS/DV, with more\nfragile systems having larger surface enhancement of mobility. The deviations\nobserved in the fragility and DS over DV relationship are shown to be\ncorrelated to the extent of segregation or depletion of the mobile element at\nthe surface.

The thermal contact resistance of composites with\ngraphene fillers of 1200-nm lateral dimensions was also smaller than that of\ncomposites with graphene fillers of 400-nm lateral dimensions. The effects of\nthe filler loading fraction and the filler size on the thermal conductivity of\nthe composites were rationalized within the Kanari model. The obtained results\nare important for optimization of graphene fillers for applications in thermal\ninterface materials for heat removal from high-power-density electronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 22:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

The first step gives rise to plain\noperads, i.e. operads without symmetries. The permutation axiom in a symmetric\noperad, however, is an additional structure resulting from permutation of\nvariables, independent of the structure of a monoid. Even though we can apply\nthe $+$-construction to symmetric operads, there is the possibility of\nintroducing a completely different kind of permutations on the higher levels by\nagain permuting variables without regard to the structure on the previous\nlevels. Defining and investigating these structures is the main purpose of this\npaper. The structures obtained in this way is what I call $n$-actads.

The purpose of this article is\nto comprehensively develop and investigate the finite-sample performance of NIE\nand MP estimators via the product method. With four common data types, we\npropose closed-form interval estimators via the theory of estimating equations\nand multivariate delta method, and evaluate its empirical performance relative\nto the bootstrap approach. In addition, we have observed that the rare outcome\nassumption is frequently invoked to approximate the NIE and MP with a binary\noutcome, although this approximation may lead to non-negligible bias when the\noutcome is common. We therefore introduce the exact expressions for NIE and MP\nwith a binary outcome without the rare outcome assumption and compare its\nperformance with the approximate estimators.

This problem is exacerbated in the context of Low Earth Orbit\n(LEO) satellite CV-QKD, in which the satellite flyover time is constrained to\nbe less than a few minutes. A potential solution to this problem is massive\nparallelisation of the classical reconciliation process in which a large-code\nblock is subdivided into many shorter blocks for individual decoding. However,\nthe penalty of this procedure on the important final secured key rate is\nnon-trivial to determine and hitherto has not been formally analysed.

Yet, origami robots still require bulky,\nrigid components or electronics for actuation and control to accomplish tasks\nwith reliability, programmability, ability to output substantial force, and\ndurability, restricting their full potential. Here, we present a printable\nself-sustained compliant oscillator that generates periodic actuation using\nonly constant electrical power, without discrete components or electronic\ncontrol hardware. This oscillator is robust (9 out of 10 prototypes worked\nsuccessfully on the first try), configurable (with tunable periods from 3 s to\n12 s), powerful (can overcome hydrodynamic resistance to consistently propel a\nswimmer at ~1.6 body lengths/min), and long-lasting (~10^3 cycles); it enables\ndriving macroscale devices with prescribed autonomous behaviors, e.g.\nlocomotion and sequencing. This oscillator is also fully functional underwater\nand in high magnetic fields. Our analytical model characterizes essential\nparameters of the oscillation period, enabling programmable design of the\noscillator. The printable oscillator can be integrated into origami-inspired\nsystems seamlessly and monolithically, allowing rapid design and prototyping;\nthe resulting integrated devices are lightweight, low-cost, compliant,\nelectronic-free, and nonmagnetic, enabling practical applications in extreme\nareas. We demonstrate the functionalities of the oscillator with: (i)\nautonomous gliding of a printable swimmer, (ii) LED flashing, and (iii) fluid\nstirring. This work paves the way for realizing fully printable autonomous\nrobots with a high integration of actuation and control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 02:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

Firstly, a Svar class with JSON like data structure is designed to hold\neverything exists in C++, including basic values, functions or user defined\nclasses and objects. Secondly, arguments are auto cast to and from Svar\nefficiently with compile time pointers, references and shared\\_ptr detection.\nThirdly, classes and functions are binded with string names to support\nreflection, this means all functions and classes in a shared library can be\nexported to a Svar object, which also calls a Svar module. The Svar modules can\nbe accessed by different languages and this paper demonstrates how to import\nand use a Svar module in Python and Node.js. Moreover, the Svar modules or even\na python module can also be imported by C++ at runtime, which makes C++ easier\nto compile and use since headers are not required anymore. We compare the\nperformance of Svar with two state-of-the-art binding tool for Python and\nNode.js, and the result demonstrates that Svar is efficient, elegant and\ngeneral. The core of this project is one single tiny modern C++ header with\nless than 5000 lines code without extra dependency. To help developers using\nSvar, all the source codes related are public available on\nhttp://github.com/zdzhaoyong/Svar, including documentations and benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 03:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

Moreover, by leveraging large-scale\nweakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance\nwith less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a\nnovel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the\nstrongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data\nfor training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be\ndynamically adapted by the feedback of the student's performance on\nstrongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak\nlabels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled\nquery-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values\nfrom queries into canonical forms from products.

This control of access is important as there is now a need\nfor collaborative resource sharing between multiple organizations over open\nenvironments like the internet. Although there are multiple access control\nmodels that are being widely used, these models are providing access control\nwithin a closed environment i.e. within the organization using it. These models\nhave restricted capabilities in providing access control in open environments.\nAttribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) has emerged as a powerful access control\nmodel to bring fine-grained authorization to organizations that possess\nsensitive data and resources and want to collaborate over open environments. In\nan ABAC system, access to resources that an organization possess can be\ncontrolled by applying policies on attributes of the users. These policies are\nconditions that need to be satisfied by the requester in order to gain access\nto the resource. In this paper, we provide an introduction to ABAC and by\ncarrying forward the architecture of ABAC, we propose a Decentralized Policy\nInformation Point (PIP) model. Our model proposes the decentralization of PIP,\nwhich is an entity of the ABAC model that allows the storage and query of user\nattributes and enforces fine-grained access control for controlling the access\nof sensitive resources over multiple domains.

Our model can be used for\ncollaborative resource sharing over the internet.

All the frames in each video are manually annotated to\na high-quality instance-level lane annotation, and a set of frame-level and\nvideo-level metrics are included for quantitative performance evaluation.\nMoreover, we propose a new baseline model, named multi-level memory aggregation\nnetwork (MMA-Net), for video instance lane detection. In our approach, the\nrepresentation of current frame is enhanced by attentively aggregating both\nlocal and global memory features from other frames. Experiments on the new\ncollected dataset show that the proposed MMA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art\nlane detection methods and video object segmentation methods. We release our\ndataset and code at https://github.com/yujun0-0/MMA-Net.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 03:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

The idea behind this proposed method is first\nto regard the collected input data of a state-space model as a part of a\nperiodic signal sequence, and then transform the state-space model with input\nand output into a model without input by augmenting the state-space model with\nthe input model (which is a periodic signal model), and afterwards use merely\nthe output information to identify a state-space model up to a similarity\ntransformation, and finally derive the state-space model in physical\ncoordinates by using a unique similarity transformation.

Most existing network pruning methods require laborious human\nefforts and prohibitive computation resources, especially when the constraints\nare changed. This practically limits the application of model compression when\nthe model needs to be deployed on a wide range of devices. Besides, existing\nmethods are still challenged by the missing theoretical guidance. In this paper\nwe propose an information theory-inspired strategy for automatic model\ncompression. The principle behind our method is the information bottleneck\ntheory, i.e., the hidden representation should compress information with each\nother. We thus introduce the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion\n(nHSIC) on network activations as a stable and generalized indicator of layer\nimportance. When a certain resource constraint is given, we integrate the HSIC\nindicator with the constraint to transform the architecture search problem into\na linear programming problem with quadratic constraints. Such a problem is\neasily solved by a convex optimization method with a few seconds. We also\nprovide a rigorous proof to reveal that optimizing the normalized HSIC\nsimultaneously minimizes the mutual information between different layers.\nWithout any search process, our method achieves better compression tradeoffs\ncomparing to the state-of-the-art compression algorithms. For instance, with\nResNet-50, we achieve a 45.3%-FLOPs reduction, with a 75.75 top-1 accuracy on\nImageNet.

Since user interactions come with bias, an important\nfocus of research in this field lies in developing methods to correct for the\nbias of interactions. Inverse propensity scoring (IPS) is a popular method\nsuitable for correcting position bias. Affine correction (AC) is a\ngeneralization of IPS that corrects for position bias and trust bias. IPS and\nAC provably remove bias, conditioned on an accurate estimation of the bias\nparameters. Estimating the bias parameters, in turn, requires an accurate\nestimation of the relevance probabilities. This cyclic dependency introduces\npractical limitations in terms of sensitivity, convergence and efficiency.\n  We propose a new correction method for position and trust bias in CLTR in\nwhich, unlike the existing methods, the correction does not rely on relevance\nestimation.

One approach to control the size of neural networks is\nretrospectively reducing the number of parameters, so-called neural network\npruning. Available research on the impact of neural network pruning on the\nadversarial robustness is fragmentary and often does not adhere to established\nprinciples of robustness evaluation. We close this gap by evaluating the\nrobustness of pruned models against L-0, L-2 and L-infinity attacks for a wide\nrange of attack strengths, several architectures, data sets, pruning methods,\nand compression rates. Our results confirm that neural network pruning and\nadversarial robustness are not mutually exclusive.

The\nDQPM description of quarks and gluons is based on partonic propagators with\ncomplex selfenergies where the real part of the selfenergies is related to the\nquasiparticle mass and the imaginary part to a finite width of their spectral\nfunctions. In DQPM the determination of complex selfenergies for the partonic\ndegrees of freedom at zero and finite $\\mu_B$ has been performed by adjusting\nthe entropy density to the lQCD data. The temperature-dependent effective\ncoupling (squared) $g^2(T/T_c)$, as well as the parton effective masses and\nwidths are based on this adjustment.

Inspired by\nthe early works on indoor modeling, we leverage the structural regularities\nexhibited in indoor scenes, to train a better depth network. Specifically, we\nadopt two extra supervisory signals for self-supervised training: 1) the\nManhattan normal constraint and 2) the co-planar constraint. The Manhattan\nnormal constraint enforces the major surfaces (the floor, ceiling, and walls)\nto be aligned with dominant directions. The co-planar constraint states that\nthe 3D points be well fitted by a plane if they are located within the same\nplanar region. To generate the supervisory signals, we adopt two components to\nclassify the major surface normal into dominant directions and detect the\nplanar regions on the fly during training. As the predicted depth becomes more\naccurate after more training epochs, the supervisory signals also improve and\nin turn feedback to obtain a better depth model. Through extensive experiments\non indoor benchmark datasets, the results show that our network outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Recently, the evolved SNR G107.0+9.0 with a\ndiameter of about 3~deg or 75~pc up to 100~pc in size was optically detected\nwith an indication of faint associated radio emission. This SNR requires a\ndetailed radio study. We aim to search for radio emission from SNR G107.0+9.0\nby analysing new data from the Effelsberg 100-m and the Urumqi 25-m radio\ntelescopes in addition to available radio surveys. Radio SNRs outside of the\nGalactic plane, where confusion is rare, must be very faint if they have not\nbeen identified so far. Guided by the H$\\alpha$ emission of G107.0+9.0, we\nseparated its radio emission from the Galactic large-scale emission. Radio\nemission from SNR G107.0+9.0 is detected between 22~MHz and 4.8~GHz with a\nsteep non-thermal spectrum, which confirms G107.0+9.0 as an SNR. Its surface\nbrightness is among the lowest known for Galactic SNRs. Polarised emission is\nclearly detected at 1.4~GHz but is fainter at 4.8~GHz. We interpret the\npolarised emission as being caused by a Faraday screen associated with\nG107.0+9.0 and its surroundings. Its ordered magnetic field along the line of\nsight is below 1~$\\mu$G. At 4.8~GHz, we identified a depolarised filament along\nthe western periphery of G107.0+9.0 with a magnetic field strength along the\nline of sight $B{_{||}} \\sim 15~\\mu$G, which requires magnetic field\ncompression.

A pressing example is the observation of glacial\nisostatic adjustment (GIA) which constrains the Earth's response to ice\nunloading, and hence, contributions of ice-covered regions such as Antarctica\nto global sea level rise following ice mass loss. We focus on horizontal GPS\nvelocities which typically contain a large component of plate rotation and a\nsmaller local component primarily relating to GIA. Incomplete separation of\nthese components introduces significant bias into estimates of GIA motion\nvectors. We present the results of a series of tests based on the motions of\nGPS stations from East Antarctica: 1) signal separation for sets of synthetic\ndata that replicate the geometric character of non-separable, and separable,\nGIA-like horizontal velocities; and 2) signal separation for real GPS station\ndata with an appraisal of uncertainties. For both synthetic and real motions,\nwe compare results where the stations are unweighted, and where each station is\nareal-weighted using a metric representing the inverse of the spatial density\nof neighbouring stations. From the synthetic tests, we show that a GIA-like\nsignal is recoverable from the plate rotation signal providing it has geometric\nvariability across East Antarctica. We also show that areal-weighting has a\nvery significant effect on the ability to recover a GIA-like signal with\ngeometric variability, and hence on separating the plate rotation and local\ncomponents. For the real data, assuming a rigid Antarctic plate, fitted plate\nrotation parameters compare well with other studies in the literature.

Our work is inspired by the state-of-the-art method DeepSDF\nthat learns and analyzes the 3D shape as the iso-surface of its shell and this\nmethod has shown promising results especially in the 3D shape reconstruction\nand compression domain. In this paper, we consider the degeneration problem of\nreconstruction coming from the capacity decrease of the DeepSDF model, which\napproximates the SDF with a neural network and a single latent code. We propose\nLocal Geometry Code Learning (LGCL), a model that improves the original DeepSDF\nresults by learning from a local shape geometry of the full 3D shape. We add an\nextra graph neural network to split the single transmittable latent code into a\nset of local latent codes distributed on the 3D shape. Mentioned latent codes\nare used to approximate the SDF in their local regions, which will alleviate\nthe complexity of the approximation compared to the original DeepSDF.\nFurthermore, we introduce a new geometric loss function to facilitate the\ntraining of these local latent codes. Note that other local shape adjusting\nmethods use the 3D voxel representation, which in turn is a problem highly\ndifficult to solve or even is insolvable. In contrast, our architecture is\nbased on graph processing implicitly and performs the learning regression\nprocess directly in the latent code space, thus make the proposed architecture\nmore flexible and also simple for realization. Our experiments on 3D shape\nreconstruction demonstrate that our LGCL method can keep more details with a\nsignificantly smaller size of the SDF decoder and outperforms considerably the\noriginal DeepSDF method under the most important quantitative metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 09:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

In particular,\nthe decay of the autocorrelation function (ACF) of light curves is presumed to\nbe linked to spot/active-region lifetimes, given that some coherence of the\nsignal is expected throughout their lifetime. In the literature, an exponential\ndecay has been adopted to describe the ACF. Here, we investigate the relation\nbetween the ACF and the active-region lifetimes. For this purpose, we produce\nartificial light curves of rotating spotted stars with different observation,\nstellar, and spot properties. We find that a linear decay and respective\ntimescale better represent the ACF than the exponential decay. We therefore\nadopt a linear decay. The spot/active-region timescale inferred from the ACF is\nstrongly restricted by the observation length of the light curves. For 1-year\nlight curves our results are consistent with no correlation between the\ninferred and the input timescales. The ACF decay is also significantly affected\nby differential rotation and spot evolution: strong differential rotation and\nfast spot evolution contribute to a more severe underestimation of the\nactive-region lifetimes. Nevertheless, in both circumstances the observed\ntimescale is still correlated with the input lifetimes. Therefore, our analysis\nsuggests that the ACF decay can be used to obtain a lower limit of the\nactive-region lifetimes for relatively long-term observations. However,\nstrategies to avoid or flag targets with fast active-region evolution or\ndisplaying stable beating patterns associated with differential rotation should\nbe employed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 10:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

Prior approaches are typically\ndegradation-specific and employ the same processing across different images and\ndifferent pixels within. However, we hypothesize that such spatially rigid\nprocessing is suboptimal for simultaneously restoring the degraded pixels as\nwell as reconstructing the clean regions of the image. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose SPAIR, a network design that harnesses\ndistortion-localization information and dynamically adjusts computation to\ndifficult regions in the image. SPAIR comprises of two components, (1) a\nlocalization network that identifies degraded pixels, and (2) a restoration\nnetwork that exploits knowledge from the localization network in filter and\nfeature domain to selectively and adaptively restore degraded pixels. Our key\nidea is to exploit the non-uniformity of heavy degradations in spatial-domain\nand suitably embed this knowledge within distortion-guided modules performing\nsparse normalization, feature extraction and attention. Our architecture is\nagnostic to physical formation model and generalizes across several types of\nspatially-varying degradations.

Currently, in a new clinical application, finding the optimal\nradiomics method out of the wide range of available options has to be done\nmanually through a heuristic trial-and-error process. In this study we propose\na framework for automatically optimizing the construction of radiomics\nworkflows per application. To this end, we formulate radiomics as a modular\nworkflow and include a large collection of common algorithms for each\ncomponent. To optimize the workflow per application, we employ automated\nmachine learning using a random search and ensembling. We evaluate our method\nin twelve different clinical applications, resulting in the following area\nunder the curves: 1) liposarcoma (0.83); 2) desmoid-type fibromatosis (0.82);\n3) primary liver tumors (0.80); 4) gastrointestinal stromal tumors (0.77); 5)\ncolorectal liver metastases (0.61); 6) melanoma metastases (0.45); 7)\nhepatocellular carcinoma (0.75); 8) mesenteric fibrosis (0.80); 9) prostate\ncancer (0.72); 10) glioma (0.71); 11) Alzheimer's disease (0.87); and 12) head\nand neck cancer (0.84).

Concluding, our method fully automatically optimizes the\nconstruction of radiomics workflows, thereby streamlining the search for\nradiomics biomarkers in new applications.

We\nexplore this possibility under two primary considerations. The first is when\nthe standard point-source and point-lens approximation applies. In this\nscenario, dividing the observed light curve by the best-fitted microlensing\nmodel leads to residuals that result in pulsational features with improved\nuncertainties. The second is for transit events (single lens) or caustic\ncrossing (binary lens). The point-source approximation breaks down, and\nresiduals relative to a simple best-fitted microlensing model display more\ncomplex behavior.

The\nsystem comprises multiple agents in this problem, each with a set of local data\npoints and an associated local cost function. The agents are connected to a\nserver, and there is no inter-agent communication. The agents' goal is to learn\na parameter vector that optimizes the aggregate of their local costs without\nrevealing their local data points. In principle, the agents can solve this\nproblem by collaborating with the server using the traditional distributed\ngradient-descent method. However, when the aggregate cost is ill-conditioned,\nthe gradient-descent method (i) requires a large number of iterations to\nconverge, and (ii) is highly unstable against process noise. We propose an\niterative pre-conditioning technique to mitigate the deleterious effects of the\ncost function's conditioning on the convergence rate of distributed\ngradient-descent. Unlike the conventional pre-conditioning techniques, the\npre-conditioner matrix in our proposed technique updates iteratively to\nfacilitate implementation on the distributed network. In the distributed\nsetting, we provably show that the proposed algorithm converges linearly with\nan improved rate of convergence than the traditional and adaptive\ngradient-descent methods. Additionally, for the special case when the minimizer\nof the aggregate cost is unique, our algorithm converges superlinearly. We\ndemonstrate our algorithm's superior performance compared to prominent\ndistributed algorithms for solving real logistic regression problems and\nemulating neural network training via a noisy quadratic model, thereby\nsignifying the proposed algorithm's efficiency for distributively solving\nnon-convex optimization. Moreover, we empirically show that the proposed\nalgorithm results in faster training without compromising the generalization\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 13:19:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

Hence, it is crucial for the control microarchitecture to\nissue quantum operations to the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) in time. As in\nclassical microarchitecture, parallelism in quantum programs needs to be\nexploited for speedup. However, three challenges emerge in the quantum\nscenario: 1) the quantum feedback control can introduce significant pipeline\nstall latency; 2) timing control is required for all quantum operations; 3) QPU\nrequires a deterministic operation supply to prevent the accumulation of\nquantum errors.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel control microarchitecture design to exploit\nCircuit Level Parallelism (CLP) and Quantum Operation Level Parallelism (QOLP).\nFirstly, we develop a Multiprocessor architecture to exploit CLP, which\nsupports dynamic scheduling of different sub-circuits. This architecture can\nhandle parallel feedback control and minimize the potential overhead that\ndisrupts the timing control. Secondly, we propose a Quantum Superscalar\napproach that exploits QOLP by efficiently executing massive quantum\ninstructions in parallel. Both methods issue quantum operations to QPU\ndeterministically. In the benchmark test of a Shor syndrome measurement, a\nsix-core implementation of our proposal achieves up to 2.59$\\times$ speedup\ncompared with a single core. For various canonical quantum computing\nalgorithms, our superscalar approach achieves an average of 4.04$\\times$\nimprovement over a baseline design.

In both\ncases, the control packets are generated by solving sparsity-promoting\noptimization problems. One is based upon an l2-constrained l0 optimization\nproblem. Such problem is relaxed by an l1-l2 optimization problem in the other\nsparse PPC setting. We utilize effective solving methods for the latter\noptimization problems.

Solutions like\nAdressSanitizer (ASan) and Softbound/CETS have proven that the latter approach\nis very promising, being able to achieve memory safety without requiring manual\nsource code adaptions, albeit suffering substantial performance and memory\noverheads. While performance overhead can be seen as a flexible constraint,\nextensive memory overheads can be prohibitive for the use of such solutions in\nmemory-constrained environments.

These distortions are caused by microlensing from the stars in\nthe lensing galaxy, which produce differential magnification of spatially and\nkinematically separated parts of the broad line region (BLR). The\nquasi-simultaneous visible and near-infrared spectroscopy of the lensed quasar\nQ2237+0305 reveals strong microlensing-induced line deformations in the\nhigh-ionization CIV $\\lambda$ 1549 \\AA and the low-ionization H$\\alpha$\nemission lines. We use this effect to constrain the BLR size, geometry, and\nkinematics in Q2237+0305. For this purpose, we modeled the deformation of the\nemission lines for three representative BLR models: a Keplerian disk, an\nequatorial wind, and a biconical polar wind. We considered various inclinations\nwith respect to the line of sight. We find that the observed microlensing\neffect, characterized by a set of four indices, can only be reproduced by a\nsubsample of the considered BLR models. The microlensing analysis favors a\nKeplerian disk model for the regions emitting the CIV and the H$\\alpha$\nemission lines. A polar wind model remains possible for the CIV BLR, although\nit is less likely. The equatorial wind model is totally excluded. A preferred\ninclination of the BLR of 40$\\deg$ is found, in agreement with expectations for\na type 1 AGN and past constraints on the accretion disk inclination. The\nhalf-light radius of the BLR is $ r_{\\rm 1/2} \\simeq$ 47$\\pm$19 light-days,\nwith no significant difference between the CIV and H$\\alpha$ BLRs. The size of\nthe CIV BLR agrees with the radius-luminosity relation derived from\nreverberation mapping, while the size of the Balmer line BLR is one order of\nmagnitude smaller, possibly revealing different quasar properties at high\nluminosities and high accretion rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 14:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

Calculations are performed self-consistently with relativistic\npoint-coupling interactions DD-PC1 and DD-PCX. In the charge-exchange channel,\nthe pairing interaction can be split into isovector ($T = 1$) and isoscalar ($T\n= 0$) parts. For the isovector component, the same separable form of the Gogny\nD1S pairing interaction is used both for the ground-state calculation as well\nas for the residual interaction, while the strength of the isoscalar pairing in\nthe residual interaction is determined by comparison with experimental data on\nGamow-Teller resonance (GTR) and Isobaric analog resonance (IAR) centroid\nenergy differences in even-even tin isotopes. The temperature effects are\nintroduced by treating Bogoliubov quasiparticles within a grand-canonical\nensemble. Thus, unlike the conventional formulation of the quasiparticle\nrandom-phase approximation (QRPA) based on the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)\nbasis, our model is formulated within the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB)\nquasiparticle basis. Implementing a relativistic point-coupling interaction and\na separable pairing force allows for the reduction of complicated two-body\nresidual interaction matrix elements, which considerably decreases the\ndimension of the problem in the coordinate space. The main advantage of this\nmethod is to avoid the diagonalization of a large QRPA matrix, especially at\nfinite temperature where the size of configuration space is significantly\nincreased.

One of the main complications in studying temporal motifs is the\nlarge number of motifs that can be built even with a limited number of vertices\nor edges. As a consequence, since in many applications motifs are employed for\nexploratory analyses, the user needs to iteratively select and analyze several\nmotifs that represent different aspects of the network, resulting in an\ninefficient, time-consuming process. This problem is exacerbated in large\nnetworks, where the analysis of even a single motif is computationally\ndemanding. As a solution, in this work we propose and study the problem of\nsimultaneously counting the number of occurrences of multiple temporal motifs,\nall corresponding to the same (static) topology (e.g., a triangle). Given that\nfor large temporal networks computing the exact counts is unfeasible, we\npropose odeN, a sampling-based algorithm that provides an accurate\napproximation of all the counts of the motifs. We provide analytical bounds on\nthe number of samples required by odeN to compute rigorous, probabilistic,\nrelative approximations. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that odeN\nenables the approximation of the counts of motifs in temporal networks in a\nfraction of the time needed by state-of-the-art methods, and that it also\nreports more accurate approximations than such methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 15:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

On the other hand, it has been also shown that\nperformance of the kernel algorithms depends on the degree of the kernel-target\nalignment. However, the kernel-target alignment for kernel learning based on\nthe tree ensembles has not been investigated and filling this gap is the main\ngoal of our work.\n  Using the eigenanalysis of the kernel matrix, we demonstrate that for\ncontinuous targets good performance of the tree-based kernel learning is\nassociated with strong kernel-target alignment. Moreover, we show that well\nperforming tree ensemble based kernels are characterized by strong target\naligned components that are expressed through scalar products between the\neigenvectors of the kernel matrix and the target. This suggests that when tree\nensemble based kernel learning is successful, relevant information for the\nsupervised problem is concentrated near lower dimensional manifold spanned by\nthe target aligned components.

In these problems, closure relations are required for the\nmacroscopic problem in the form of constitutive relations. However, forming\nexplicit closures for nonlinear and hysteretic processes remains challenging.\nInstead, we provide a framework for learning constitutive mappings given\nmicroscale data generated according to micro and macro transitions governed by\ntwo-scale homogenisation rules. The resulting data-driven model is then coupled\nto a macroscale simulator leading to a hybrid ML-physics-based modelling\napproach. Accordingly, we apply the multiscale framework within the context of\ntransient phenomena in dual-porosity geomaterials. In these materials, the\ninter-porosity flow is a complex time-dependent function making its adoption\nwithin flow simulators challenging. We explore nonlinear feedforward\nautoregressive ML strategies for the constitutive modelling of this sequential\nproblem.

For\nsuch a large collisional mean free path, the resistive dissipation can also\nplay a key role in hot accretion flows. In this paper, we study the dynamics of\nresistive hot accretion flows in the presence of anisotropic pressure. We\npresent a set of self-similar solutions where the flow variables are assumed to\nbe a function only of radius. Our results show that the radial and rotational\nvelocities and the sound speed increase considerably with the strength of\nanisotropic pressure. The increase in infall velocity and in sound speed are\nmore significant if the resistive dissipation is taken into account. We find\nthat such changes depend on the field strength. Our results indicate that the\nresistive heating is $10\\%$ of the heating by the work done by anisotropic\npressure when the strength of anisotropic pressure is 0.1. This value becomes\nhigher when the strength of anisotropic pressure reduces. The increase in disk\ntemperature can lead to heating and acceleration of the electrons in such\nflows.

We built our QNT by defining pure quantum number operators\n($q$-numbers) of a Hilbert space that generate classical numbers ($c$-numbers)\nbelonging to discrete Euclidean spaces. To start with this formalism, we define\na 2-component natural $q$-number $\\textbf{N}$, such that $\\mathbf{N}^{2} \\equiv\nN_{1}^{2} + N_{2}^{2}$, satisfying a Heisenberg-Dirac algebra, which allows to\ngenerate a set of natural $c$-numbers $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. A probabilistic\ninterpretation of QNT is then inferred from this representation. Furthermore,\nwe define a 3-component integer $q$-number $\\textbf{Z}$, such that\n$\\mathbf{Z}^{2} \\equiv Z_{1}^{2} + Z_{2}^{2} + Z_{3}^{2}$ and obeys a Lie\nalgebra structure. The eigenvalues of each $\\textbf{Z}$ component generate a\nset of classical integers $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\cup \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{Z}^{*}$,\n$\\mathbb{Z}^{*} = \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, albeit all components do not\ngenerate $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ simultaneously. We interpret the eigenvectors of the\n$q$-numbers as `$q$-number state vectors' (QNSV), which form multidimensional\northonormal basis sets useful to describe state-vector superpositions defined\nhere as qu$n$its. To interconnect QNSV of different dimensions, associated to\nthe same $c$-number, we propose a quantum mapping operation to relate distinct\nHilbert subspaces, and its structure can generate a subset $W \\subseteq\n\\mathbb{Q}^{*}$, the field of non-zero rationals. In the present description,\nQNT is related to quantum computing theory and allows dealing with nontrivial\ncomputations in high dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 17:26:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

This paper introduces a digital twin approach for adaptive\ntraffic signal control (ATSC) to improve a traveler's driving experience by\nreducing and redistributing waiting time at an intersection. While an ATSC\ncombined with a connected vehicle concept can reduce waiting time at an\nintersection and improve travel time in a signalized corridor, it is nearly\nimpossible to reduce traffic delay for congested traffic conditions. To remedy\nthis defect of the traditional ATCS with connected vehicle data, we have\ndeveloped a digital twin-based ATSC (DT-based ATSC) that considers the waiting\ntime of approaching vehicles towards a subject intersection along with the\nwaiting time of those vehicles at the immediate upstream intersection. We\nconducted a case study using a microscopic traffic simulation, Simulation of\nUrban Mobility (SUMO), by developing a digital replica of a roadway network\nwith signalized intersections in an urban setting where vehicle and traffic\nsignal data were collected in real-time. Our analyses reveal that the DT-based\nATSC outperforms the connected vehicle-based baseline ATSC in terms of average\ncumulative waiting time, distribution of drivers' waiting time, and level of\nservices for each approach for different traffic demands and therefore\ndemonstrates our method's superior efficacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 11:33:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 11:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

However, they visualize state changes as either slope or\ndifference of bars, which has been proved less effective for quantitative\ncomparison. Also, both visual designs suffer from visual clutter issues with an\nincreasing number of data items. In this paper, we propose Intercept Graph, a\nnovel visual design to facilitate effective interactive comparison of state\nchanges. Specifically, a radial design is proposed to visualize the starting\nand ending states of each data item and the line segment length explicitly\nencodes the \"state change\". By interactively adjusting the radius of the inner\ncircular axis, Intercept Graph can smoothly filter the large state changes and\nmagnify the difference between similar state changes, mitigating the visual\nclutter issues and enhancing the effective comparison of state changes. We\nconducted a case study through comparing Intercept Graph with slope graphs and\ngrouped bar charts on real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nIntercept Graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 08:10:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

To test this claim, two recent peer\nreviewed papers both conducted a meta-analysis on a similar set of randomized\ncontrolled trials data, applying the same classical statistical approach.\nAlthough the statistical results were similar, one of the papers (Bryant et al,\n2021) concluded that ivermectin was effective for reducing Covid-19 deaths,\nwhile the other (Roman et al, 2021) concluded that there was insufficient\nquality of evidence to support the conclusion Ivermectin was effective. This\npaper applies a Bayesian approach, to a subset of the same trial data, to test\nseveral causal hypotheses linking Covid-19 severity and ivermectin to mortality\nand produce an alternative analysis to the classical approach. Applying diverse\nalternative analysis methods which reach the same conclusions should increase\noverall confidence in the result. We show that there is strong evidence to\nsupport a causal link between ivermectin, Covid-19 severity and mortality, and:\ni) for severe Covid-19 there is a 90.7% probability the risk ratio favours\nivermectin; ii) for mild/moderate Covid-19 there is an 84.1% probability the\nrisk ratio favours ivermectin. To address concerns expressed about the veracity\nof some of the studies we evaluate the sensitivity of the conclusions to any\nsingle study by removing one study at a time. In the worst case, where\n(Elgazzar 2020) is removed, the results remain robust, for both severe and mild\nto moderate Covid-19. The paper also highlights advantages of using Bayesian\nmethods over classical statistical methods for meta-analysis. All studies\nincluded in the analysis were prior to data on the delta variant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 20:12:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 15:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

The solution is an expansion in vector spherical harmonics and given\nas a sum of a particular solution, proportional to pressure gradient exhibiting\npower-law spatial dependence, and a solution of vector Helmholtz equation\ndecaying exponentially in far field, the decomposition originally introduced by\nLamb. The solution can be applied to construct the transient exterior flow\ninduced by an arbitrary velocity distribution at the spherical boundary, such\nas arising in the squirmer model of a microswimmer. It can be used to construct\nsolutions for transient flows driven by initial conditions, unbounded flows\ndriven by volume forces or disturbance to the unsteady flow due to a stationary\nspherical particle. The long-time behavior of solution is controlled by the\nflow component corresponding to average (or collective) motion of the boundary.\nThis conclusion is illustrated by the study of decay of transversal wave in the\npresence of a fixed sphere. We further show that the general representation\nreduces to the well-known solutions for unsteady flow around a sphere\nundergoing oscillatory rigid-body (translation and rotation) motion. The\nproposed solution representation provides an explicit form of the velocity\npotential far from an oscillating body (\"generalized\" Darcy's law) and high-\nand low-frequency expansions. The leading-order high-frequency expansion yields\nthe well-known ideal (inviscid) flow approximation, and the leading-order\nlow-frequency expansion yields the steady Stokes equations. We derive the\nhigher-order corrections to these approximations and discuss d'Alembert\nparadox. Continuation of the general solution to imaginary frequency yields the\ngeneral solution of the Brinkman equations describing viscous flow in porous\nmedium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 14:56:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 22:17:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 16:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}
