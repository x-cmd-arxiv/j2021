The\ntheoretical foundation including mathematical model and the optimality\nconditions for solving the optimal control has been established by Hu and Wu in\na series of work. The scalar being mixed is purely advected by the flow and the\ncontrol is exerted tangentially on the domain boundary through the Navier slip\nconditions. The control design is motivated by the physical observations that\nthe moving or rotating walls accelerate mixing.\n  A gradient descent-based optimization algorithm is designed. A critical\nproblem is the computation of the Gateaux derivative or the gradient of the\ncost functional. Two methods are proposed: one is based on the Variational\nFormula (VF) and one utilizes Algorithmic Differentiation (AD). The convergence\nof the algorithm is studied and various designs of boundary control using\ncosine and sine functions with time segmentation are computed.\n  The algorithm has a first order convergence rate and the VF method is more\nefficient by taking only one third of the time as the AD method when the\ndimension of control basis is large. The numerical implementations show that\nthe boundary control produces similar mixing results as internal mixings in the\nexisting literature. The mixing effect becomes better when more diverse basis\ncontrol functions and more time segmentation are utilized. It is shown that the\nmixing decay rate in time follows power rules, approximately.

One such factor is virtual\nmovement. Movement, whether physical or virtual, can be represented in\ndifferent forms. One way to represent and store it is with a temporally\nannotated point sequence. Because a sequence is memory-consuming, it is often\npreferable to save it in a compressed form.

Characterization can be considered the\ncomplement to modeling by helping guide assumptions about generative processes\nand their representation in the data. Dimensionality reduction (DR) is a\nfrequently implemented type of characterization designed to mitigate the \"curse\nof dimensionality\" on high-D signals. For decades, Principal Component (PC) and\nEmpirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis has been used as a linear,\ninvertible approach to DR and ST analysis.

Starting with a synthetic example and progressing to global,\nregional, and field scale ST datasets spanning roughly 5 orders of magnitude in\nspace and 2 in time, we show these three DR approaches can yield complementary\ninformation about ST manifold topology. Compared to the relatively diffuse TFS\nproduced by PCs/EOFs, the nonlinear approaches yield more compact manifolds\nwith decreased ambiguity in temporal endmembers (LE) and/or in spatiotemporal\nclustering (t-SNE). These properties are compensated by the greater\ninterpretability, significantly lower computational demand and diminished\nsensitivity to spatial aliasing for PCs/EOFs than LE or t-SNE.

The\nobjective is to determine how the microscale vortices influence convection heat\ntransfer in turbulent flow inside porous media. The microscale temperature\ndistribution is analyzed using flow visualization in 2D using streamlines and\nin 3D using Q structures. The pertinent observations are supplemented with the\ncomparison of surface skin friction and heat transfer using: (1) surface skin\nfriction lines and (2) joint PDF of pressure and skin friction coefficients,\nalong with the Nusselt number. The microscale flow phenomena observed are\ncorroborated with the features of the frequency spectra of the drag coefficient\nand macroscale Nusselt number. The Large Eddy Simulation technique is used to\ninvestigate the flow field inside a periodic porous medium. The Reynolds\nnumbers of the flow are 300 and 500. The porous medium consists of solid\nobstacles in the shape of square and circular cylinders. Two distinct flow\nregimes are represented by using the porosities of 0.50 and 0.87.

To\nminimize this impact, policy makers undertake containment measures that\nhowever, when carried out disproportionately to the actual threat, as a result\nif errorneous threat assessment, cause undesirable long-term socio-economic\ncomplications.

This study looks at the concrete\nsoftware architecture as a relevant factor for successfully achieving\ncontinuous delivery goals. Objective: This study aims to understand how the\ndesign of software architectures impacts the continuous deployment of their\nsoftware product. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review to\nidentify proper evidence regarding the research objective. We analyzed the\nselected sources adopting a synthesis and analysis approach based on Grounded\nTheory. Results: We selected 14 primary sources. Through our analysis process,\nwe developed a theory that explains the phenomenon of Architecting for\nContinuous Deployment. The theory describes three other phenomena that support\nArchitecting for Continuous Deployment: Supporting Operations, Continuous\nEvolution, and Improving Deployability. Furthermore, the theory comprises the\nfollowing elements: contexts, actions and interactions, quality attributes,\nprinciples, and effects. We instantiated these elements and identified their\ninterrelationships. The theory is supported by providing bi-directional\ntraceability from the selected sources to the elements and vice-versa.\nConclusions: Developing adequate architecture plays a crucial role in enabling\ncontinuous delivery. Supporting operations becomes vital to increase the\ndeployability and monitorability of software architecture. These two outcomes\nrequire that developers accept responsibility for maintaining the operations.\nThe continuous evolution of the architecture is essential, but it must consider\nbalanced management of technical debt.

It is found that with low power the\ndroplet vibrates at low frequency (O[100 Hz]) when driven by high-frequency\nultrasound (O[1 MHz] and above). To study the mechanism of the energy transfer\nthat spans these vastly different timescales, we measure the droplet's\ninterfacial response to 6.6~MHz ultrasound excitation using high-speed digital\nholography. We show that the onset of low-frequency capillary waves is driven\nby feedback interplay between the acoustic radiation pressure distribution and\nthe droplet surface. These dynamics are mediated by the Young-Laplace boundary\nbetween the droplet interior and ambient environment. Numerical simulations are\nperformed via global optimization against the rigorously defined interfacial\nphysics.

For low power acoustic excitation, the\nsimulations reveal a stable oscillatory feedback that induces capillary wave\nformation.

However, few research efforts to consider $(H, r, u)$\nmultiaccess combination network problem where each $u$ users are connected to a\nunique set of $r$ relays. A naive strategy to obtain a coded caching scheme for\n$(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is by $u$ times repeated\napplication of a coded caching scheme for a traditional $(H, r)$ combination\nnetwork. Obviously, the transmission load for each relay of this trivial scheme\nis exactly $u$ times that of the original scheme, which implies that as the\nnumber of users multiplies, the transmission load for each relay will also\nmultiply. Therefore, it is very meaningful to design a coded caching scheme for\n$(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network with lower transmission load for\neach relay. In this paper, by directly applying the well known coding method\n(proposed by Zewail and Yener) for $(H, r)$ combination network, a coded\ncaching scheme (ZY scheme) for $(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is\nobtained. However, the subpacketization of this scheme has exponential order\nwith the number of users, which leads to a high implementation complexity. In\norder to reduce the subpacketization, a direct construction of a coded caching\nscheme for $(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is proposed by means of\nCombinational Design Theory, where the parameter $u$ must be a combinatorial\nnumber. For arbitrary parameter $u$, a hybrid construction of a coded caching\nscheme for $(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is proposed based on our\ndirect construction. Theoretical and numerical analysis show that our last two\nschemes have smaller transmission load for each relay compared with the trivial\nscheme, and have much lower subpacketization compared with ZY scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2021 01:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

In the present work, we perform micromagnetic simulations to\ninvestigate the electric field-induced strain mediated magnetization switching\nin artificial spin ice (ASI) based multiferroic system, which is proposed to\nhave a significant decrease in Joule heating losses compared to electric\ncurrent based methods. As the piezo electric strain-based system cannot switch\nthe magnetization by $180^\\circ$ in ferromagnets, we propose an ASI\nmultiferroic system consisting of the peanut-shaped nanomagnets on\nferroelectric substrate with the angle between the easy axis and hard axis of\nmagnetization less than $90^\\circ$.

A lot of theories and algorithms have been developed to model such\nnetworks (e.g., balance theory).

Signed bipartite\nnetworks are different from classical signed networks, which contain two\ndifferent node sets and signed links between two node sets. Signed bipartite\nnetworks can be commonly found in many fields including business, politics, and\nacademics, but have been less studied. In this work, we firstly define the\nsigned relationship of the same set of nodes and provide a new perspective for\nanalyzing signed bipartite networks. Then we do some comprehensive analysis of\nbalance theory from two perspectives on several real-world datasets.\nSpecifically, in the peer review dataset, we find that the ratio of balanced\nisomorphism in signed bipartite networks increased after rebuttal phases.\nGuided by these two perspectives, we propose a novel Signed Bipartite Graph\nNeural Networks (SBGNNs) to learn node embeddings for signed bipartite\nnetworks.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for accurate and\nefficient classification of in-place gestures. Our key idea is to treat several\nconsecutive frames as a \"point cloud\".

However, the ranking correlation\nbetween the architectures' predicted accuracy and their actual capability is\nincorrect, which causes the existing NAS methods' dilemma. We attribute this\nranking correlation problem to the supernet training consistency shift,\nincluding feature shift and parameter shift. Feature shift is identified as\ndynamic input distributions of a hidden layer due to random path sampling. The\ninput distribution dynamic affects the loss descent and finally affects\narchitecture ranking. Parameter shift is identified as contradictory parameter\nupdates for a shared layer lay in different paths in different training steps.\nThe rapidly-changing parameter could not preserve architecture ranking. We\naddress these two shifts simultaneously using a nontrivial supernet-Pi model,\ncalled Pi-NAS. Specifically, we employ a supernet-Pi model that contains\ncross-path learning to reduce the feature consistency shift between different\npaths. Meanwhile, we adopt a novel nontrivial mean teacher containing negative\nsamples to overcome parameter shift and model collision. Furthermore, our\nPi-NAS runs in an unsupervised manner, which can search for more transferable\narchitectures. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and a wide range of downstream\ntasks (e.g., COCO 2017, ADE20K, and Cityscapes) demonstrate the effectiveness\nand universality of our Pi-NAS compared to supervised NAS.

Such PDEs are referred to as curl-free or curl-preserving\nrespectively. In this paper we catalogue a class of DG-like schemes for such\nPDEs. To retain the globally curl-free or curl-preserving constraints, the\ncomponents of the vector field, as well as their higher moments, have to be\ncollocated at the edges of the mesh. They are updated by using potentials that\nare collocated at the vertices of the mesh. The resulting schemes : 1) do not\nblow up even after very long integration times, 2) do not need any special\ncleaning treatment, 3) can operate with large explicit timesteps, 4) do not\nrequire the solution of an elliptic system and 5) can be extended to higher\norders using DG-like methods. The methods rely on a special curl-preserving\nreconstruction and they also rely on multidimensional upwinding. The Galerkin\nprojection, so crucial to the design of a DG method, is now carried out in the\nedges of the mesh and yields a weak form update that uses potentials that are\nobtained at the vertices of the mesh with the help of a multidimensional\nRiemann solver.

Secondly, for the same reason, they have\ninadequate access to HIV testing treatment and care. Not only because of their\nrefugee status but also because of the poor capacity of the host country to\nprovide services.

In particular, confining fluids of anisotropic particles in\nnanopores provides the opportunity to control their phase behaviour and\nstabilise a spectrum of morphologies that cannot form in the bulk.

In the experiment, we use three phase masks which are realized by\nmetasurfaces, the measured results show well consistency with the simulation.\nResults in this paper have great potential to improve the performance of OCT\nrelated applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2021 12:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Adversarial training with\nfirst-order attacks has been one of the most effective defenses against\nadversarial perturbations to this day. The majority of the adversarial training\napproaches focus on iteratively perturbing each pixel with the gradient of the\nloss function with respect to the input image. However, the adversarial\ntraining with gradient-based attacks lacks diversity and does not generalize\nwell to natural images and various attacks. This study presents a robust\ntraining algorithm where the adversarial perturbations are automatically\nsynthesized from a random vector using a generator network. The classifier is\ntrained with cross-entropy loss regularized with the optimal transport distance\nbetween the representations of the natural and synthesized adversarial samples.\nUnlike prevailing generative defenses, the proposed one-step attack generation\nframework synthesizes diverse perturbations without utilizing gradient of the\nclassifier's loss.

In this paper, we use a data justice lens to study Rythu\nBharosa, a social welfare scheme targeting farmers in the Andhra Pradesh state\nof India. While coverage of the scheme in terms of number of recipients is\nreportedly high, our fieldwork revealed three forms of data justice to be\nmonitored for intended recipients. A first form is design-related, as\nmismatches of recipients with their registered biometric credentials and bank\naccount details are associated to denial of subsidies. A second form is\ninformational, as users who do not receive subsidies are often not informed of\nthe reason why it is so, or of the grievance redressal processes available to\nthem. To these dimensions our data add a structural one, centred on the\nconditionality of subsidy to approval by landowners, which forces tenant\nfarmers to request a type of landowner consent that reproduces existing\npatterns of class and caste subordination. Identifying such data justice\nissues, the paper adds to problematisations of digital social welfare systems,\ncontributing a structural dimension to studies of data justice in digital\nsocial protection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2021 14:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

Ayurveda, the traditional Indian medicinal systemenrooted in the\nVedic literature and considered as a schema for the holistic management of\nhealth, characterizes various neurological diseases disorders (NDDs) and\nprescribes several herbs, formulations, and bio-cleansing regimes for their\ncare and cure. In this work, we examined neuro-phytoregulatory potential of\n34,472 phytochemicals among 3,038 herbs (including their varieties) mentioned\nin Ayurveda using network pharmacology approach and found that 45% of these\nAyurvedic phytochemicals (APCs) have regulatory associations with 1,643\napproved protein targets.

The study further suggests that the actions of Ayurvedic herbs in\nmanaging NDDs were majorly via regulating signalling processes, like, G-protein\nsignaling, acetylcholine signaling, chemokine signaling pathway and GnRH\nsignaling. A high confidence network specific to 219 pharmaceutically relevant\nneuro-phytoregulators (NPRs) from 1,197 Ayurvedic herbs against 102 approved\nprotein-targets involved in NDDs was developed and analyzed for gaining\nmechanistic insights.

Conventional approaches to tuning (e.g. using normalized estimation\nerror squared and covariance minimization) compute empirical measures of filter\nperformance and the parameter are selected manually or selected using some kind\nof optimization algorithm to maximize these measures of performance. However,\nthere are two challenges with this approach. First, in theory, many of these\nmeasures do not guarantee a unique solution due to observability issues.\nSecond, in practice, empirically computed statistical quantities can be very\nnoisy due to a finite number of samples. We propose a method to overcome these\nlimitations. Our method has two main parts to it. The first is to ensure that\nthe tuning problem has a single unique solution. We achieve this by\nsimultaneously tuning the filter over multiple different prediction intervals.\nAlthough this yields a unique solution, practical issues (such as sampling\nnoise) mean that it cannot be directly applied. Therefore, we use Bayesian\nOptimization.

Traditionally, popular\nregularization methods have been the penalized Variational approaches. In\nrecent years, the classical regularized-reconstruction approaches have been\noutclassed by the (deep-learning-based) learned reconstruction algorithms.\nHowever, unlike the traditional regularization methods, the theoretical\nunderpinnings, such as stability and regularization, have been insufficient for\nsuch learned reconstruction algorithms. Hence, the results obtained from such\nalgorithms, though empirically outstanding, can't always be completely trusted,\nas they may contain certain instabilities or (hallucinated) features arising\nfrom the learned process. In fact, it has been shown that such learning\nalgorithms are very susceptible to small (adversarial) noises in the data and\ncan lead to severe instabilities in the recovered solution, which can be quite\ndifferent than the inherent instabilities of the ill-posed (inverse) problem.\nWhereas, the classical regularization methods can handle such (adversarial)\nnoises very well and can produce stable recovery. Here, we try to present\ncertain regularization methods to stabilize such (unstable) learned\nreconstruction methods and recover a regularized solution, even in the presence\nof adversarial noises. For this, we need to extend the classical notion of\nregularization and incorporate it in the learned reconstruction algorithms.
