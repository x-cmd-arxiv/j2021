It is shown that the constrained acceleration/deceleration of the\nfollowing ACCs are likely to cause speed overshoot to compensate for an extra\nlarge/small spacing. Additionally, we find that the constrained deceleration\nlimits can also jeopardize safety, as the limited braking power produces extra\nsmall spacing or even crashes. The findings are validated through experiments\non real cars. The paper suggests that the ACC parameter space should be\nextended to include the acceleration/deceleration limits considering their\nsignificant role exposed here. Through numerical simulations of ACC platoons,\nwe show i) a marginal string stable ACC is preferable due to the smaller total\nqueue length and the shorter duration in congestion; ii) congestion waves in a\nmixed ACC platoon largely depend on the sequence of vehicles provided different\nacceleration/deceleration limits, and iii) the safety hazard caused by the\nconstrained deceleration limits is more significant in mixed ACC platoons when\nstring unstable ACCs exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 16:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

The\ndivisor methods provide a way of solving this problem by defining a notion of\nproportionality guided by some rounding rule. Motivated by recent challenges in\nthe context of electoral apportionment, we consider the question of how to\nallocate the seats of a parliament under parity constraints between candidate\ntypes (e.g. equal number of men and women elected) while at the same time\nsatisfying party proportionality.\n  We consider two different approaches for this problem. The first mechanism,\nthat follows a greedy approach, corresponds to a recent mechanism used in the\nChilean Constitutional Convention 2021 election. We analyze this mechanism from\na theoretical point of view. The second mechanism follows the idea of\nbiproportionality introduced by Balinski and Demange [Math. Program. 1989,\nMath. Oper.

In contrast with the classic biproportional method by\nBalinski and Demange, this mechanism is ruled by two levels of proportionality:\nProportionality is satisfied at the level of parties by means of a divisor\nmethod, and then biproportionality is used to decide the number of candidates\nallocated to each type and party. We provide a theoretical analysis of this\nmechanism, making progress on the theoretical understanding of methods with two\nlevels of proportionality. A typical benchmark used in the context of\ntwo-dimensional apportionment is the fair share (a.k.a matrix scaling), which\ncorresponds to an ideal fractional biproportional solution.

In particular, this work focuses on\nestimating the forward reachable set of \\textit{neural feedback loops}\n(closed-loop systems with NN controllers). Recent work provides bounds on these\nreachable sets, but the computationally tractable approaches yield overly\nconservative bounds (thus cannot be used to verify useful properties), and the\nmethods that yield tighter bounds are too intensive for online computation.\nThis work bridges the gap by formulating a convex optimization problem for the\nreachability analysis of closed-loop systems with NN controllers. While the\nsolutions are less tight than previous (semidefinite program-based) methods,\nthey are substantially faster to compute, and some of those computational time\nsavings can be used to refine the bounds through new input set partitioning\ntechniques, which is shown to dramatically reduce the tightness gap.

We therefore distinguish two types\nof violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law: a \"trivial\" one, independent of the\njunction dynamics and arising from the breakdown of the Fermi-liquid picture in\nthe wire, and a junction-related counterpart, arising from multi-particle\nscattering processes at the junction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 16:20:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 06:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 12:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

The objective of this work is to\ndevelop measures of functional cortico-muscular coupling that have improved\nsensitivity and are capable of detecting both linear and non-linear\ninteractions. Methods: A multiscale wavelet transfer entropy (TE) methodology\nis proposed. The methodology relies on a dyadic stationary wavelet transform to\ndecompose electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals into\nfunctional bands of neural oscillations. Then, it applies TE analysis based on\na range of embedding delay vectors to detect and quantify intra- and\ncross-frequency band cortico-muscular coupling at different time scales.\nResults: Our experiments with neurophysiological signals substantiate the\npotential of the developed methodologies for detecting and quantifying\ninformation flow between EEG and EMG signals for subjects with and without\nsignificant CMC or GC, including non-linear cross-frequency interactions, and\ninteractions across different temporal scales. The obtained results are in\nagreement with the underlying sensorimotor neurophysiology.

Despite the fact that at the\ncore of training a SVM there is a \\textit{simple} convex optimization problem,\nthe presence of kernel matrices is responsible for dramatic performance\nreduction, making SVMs unworkably slow for large problems.

However, not all images have the same importance towards\nimproved performance and robustness. In fetal brain MRI, abnormalities\nexacerbate the variability of the developing brain anatomy compared to\nnon-pathological cases. A small number of abnormal cases, as is typically\navailable in clinical datasets used for training, are unlikely to fairly\nrepresent the rich variability of abnormal developing brains. This leads\nmachine learning systems trained by maximizing the average performance to be\nbiased toward non-pathological cases. This problem was recently referred to as\nhidden stratification. To be suited for clinical use, automatic segmentation\nmethods need to reliably achieve high-quality segmentation outcomes also for\npathological cases. In this paper, we show that the state-of-the-art deep\nlearning pipeline nnU-Net has difficulties to generalize to unseen abnormal\ncases. To mitigate this problem, we propose to train a deep neural network to\nminimize a percentile of the distribution of per-volume loss over the dataset.\nWe show that this can be achieved by using Distributionally Robust Optimization\n(DRO). DRO automatically reweights the training samples with lower performance,\nencouraging nnU-Net to perform more consistently on all cases.

The disintegration process is controlled by\nits rate $Q = \\alpha \\mathcal{H} \\rho_{\\rm ddm}$, where $\\alpha$ is a\n(constant) dimensionless parameter quantifying the strength of the\ndisintegration mechanism and $\\mathcal{H}$ is the conformal Hubble rate in the\nspatially flat Friedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker universe and $\\rho_{\\rm\nddm}$ is the energy density of the disintegrating cold dark matter. We\nconstrain this model with the latest 2018 Planck temperature and polarization\ndata, showing that there is no evidence for $\\alpha \\neq 0$ and that it cannot\nsolve the $H_0$ tension below $3\\sigma$, clashing with the result obtained by\nanalyzing the Planck 2015 temperature data. We also investigate two possible\nextensions of the model in which the dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w\n\\neq -1$. In this case it is possible to combine Planck data with the SH0ES\nmeasurement, and we demonstrate that in both these models the $H_0$ tension is\nresolved at the $1\\sigma$ level, but the condition $w \\neq -1$ exacerbates the\n$S_8$ tension. We also demonstrate that the addition of intermediate-redshift\ndata (from the Pantheon supernova type Ia dataset and baryon acoustic\noscillations) weakens the effectiveness of all these models to address the\n$H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 17:22:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 17:36:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 16:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

These\nstochastic gravitational waves are expected to carry the imprints of primordial\nnon-Gaussianities. The scalar bispectrum that is typically produced in models\nof inflation leading to significant secondary GWs is non-trivial and highly\nscale dependent. In this work, we present a method to account for such general\nscale dependent scalar bispectrum arising from inflationary models in the\ncalculation of the spectral density of secondary GWs. Using this method, we\ncompute the contributions arising from the scalar bispectrum to the amplitude\nof secondary GWs in two specific models of inflation driven by the canonical\nscalar field. We find that these non-Gaussian contributions can be highly model\ndependent and have to be consistently taken into account while estimating the\ntotal amplitude of the secondary GWs. Beyond the models considered, we\nemphasize that the method discussed is robust, free from assumptions about the\nshape of the bispectrum and generalizes earlier approaches adopted in the\nliterature.

Efficient implementations for evaluating\nsatisfiability of S5 formulas commonly rely on Skolemisation to convert them\ninto propositional logic formulas, essentially by introducing copies of\npropositional atoms for each set of interpretations (possible worlds). This\napproach is simple, but often results into large formulas that are too\ndifficult to process, and therefore more parsimonious constructions are\nrequired. In this work, we propose to use Answer Set Programming for\nimplementing such constructions, and in particular for identifying the\npropositional atoms that are relevant in every world by means of a reachability\nrelation. The proposed encodings are designed to take advantage of other\nproperties such as entailment relations of subformulas rooted by modal\noperators.

During COVID-19, most workers were\naffected and many liberal welfare states introduced new temporary wage\nsubsidies to protected workers' earnings and employment (OECD, 2021). New wage\nsubsidies marked a departure from the structure of traditional income support\npayments and required reform. This paper uses simulated datasets to assess the\nstructure and incentives of the Irish COVID-19 wage subsidy scheme (CWS) under\nfive designs. We use a nowcasting approach to update 2017 microdata, producing\na near real time picture of the labour market at the peak of the crisis. Using\nmicrosimulation modelling, we assess the impact of different designs on income\nreplacement, work incentives and income inequality. Our findings suggest that\npro rata designs support middle earners more and flat rate designs support low\nearners more. We find evidence for strong work disincentives under all designs,\nthough flat rate designs perform better. Disincentives are primarily driven by\ngenerous unemployment payments and work related costs. The impact of design on\nincome inequality depends on the generosity of payments. Earnings related pro\nrata designs were associated to higher market earnings inequality. The\ndifference in inequality levels falls once benefits, taxes and work related\ncosts are considered. In our discussion, we turn to transaction costs, the\nrationale for reform and reintegration of CWS. We find some support for the\nclaim that design changes were motivated by political considerations. We\nsuggest that establishing permanent wage subsidies based on sectorial turnover\nrules could offer enhanced protection to middle-and high-earners and reduce\nuncertainty, the need for reform, and the risk of politically motivated\ndesigns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 17:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

However, with caches remaining volatile,\nautomatic cache evictions can reorder updates to memory, potentially leaving\npersistent memory in an inconsistent state upon a system crash. Flush and fence\ninstructions can be used to force ordering among updates, but are expensive.\nThis has motivated significant work studying how to write correct and efficient\npersistent programs for NVRAM.\n  In this paper, we present FliT, a C++ library that facilitates writing\nefficient persistent code. Using the library's default mode makes any\nlinearizable data structure durable with minimal changes to the code. FliT\navoids many redundant flush instructions by using a novel algorithm to track\ndirty cache lines. The FliT library also allows for extra optimizations, but\nachieves good performance even in its default setting.\n  To describe the FliT library's capabilities and guarantees, we define a\npersistent programming interface, called the P-V Interface, which FliT\nimplements. The P-V Interface captures the expected behavior of code in which\nsome instructions' effects are persisted and some are not. We show that the\ninterface captures the desired semantics of many practical algorithms in the\nliterature.\n  We apply the FliT library to four different persistent data structures, and\nshow that across several workloads, persistence implementations, and data\nstructure sizes, the FliT library always improves operation throughput, by at\nleast $2.1\\times$ over a naive implementation in all but one workload.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 17:39:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 01:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

Sci. Comput., 38 (2016)]. We incorporate a sequence of key stability\ntechniques and provide many improvements in the algorithm design. Various\nstability risks in the original algorithm are analyzed, including potential\nexponential norm growth, cancellations, loss of accuracy with clustered\neigenvalues or intermediate eigenvalues, etc. In the dividing stage, we give a\nnew structured low-rank update strategy with balancing that eliminates the\nexponential norm growth and also minimizes the ranks of low-rank updates. In\nthe conquering stage with low-rank updated eigenvalue solution, the original\nalgorithm directly uses the regular fast multipole method (FMM) to accelerate\nfunction evaluations, which has the risks of cancellation, division by zero,\nand slow convergence. Here, we design a triangular FMM to avoid cancellation.\nFurthermore, when there are clustered intermediate eigenvalues or when updates\nto existing eigenvalues are very small, we design a novel local shifting\nstrategy to integrate FMM accelerations into the solution of shifted secular\nequations so as to achieve both the efficiency and the reliability. We also\nprovide several improvements or clarifications on some structures and\ntechniques that are missing or unclear in the previous work. The resulting\nSuperDC eigensolver has significantly better stability while keeping the nearly\nlinear complexity for finding the entire eigenvalue decomposition. In a set of\ncomprehensive tests, SuperDC shows dramatically lower runtime and storage, and\nmore stability advantages than the Matlab $\\textsf{eig}$ function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 17:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

Different from\ntraditional adversarial training approaches where adversarial examples are\nutilized from random attacks and may not be representative of all unsafe\nbehaviors, our repair process uses reachability analysis to compute the exact\nunsafe regions and identify sufficiently representative examples to enhance the\nefficacy and efficiency of the adversarial training.\n  The performance of our framework is evaluated on two types of benchmarks\nwithout safe models as references.

We do so by\nrunning two $N$-body simulations, one with and one without massive neutrinos;\nboth with the same phases, and matching their linear power spectrum at a given,\nlow, redshift. This effectively isolates the information encoded in the linear\ninitial conditions from the non-linear cosmic evolution.

Thus any probe based on the CDM\nfield alone will have negligible constraining power beyond that which exists at\nthe linear level over the same range of scales. Consequently, any probe based\non the halo field will contain little information beyond the linear power. We\nfind similar results for the matter field responsible for weak lensing.

Both stellar wind mass loss and\nthree-body dynamics cooperate to destabilise triples, which can lead to a\nvariety of astrophysical exotica. So far our understanding of their evolution\nwas mainly built upon results from extensive binary-single scattering\nexperiments. Starting from generic initial conditions, we evolve an extensive\nset of hierarchical triples using a combination of the triple evolution code\nTRES and an N-body code. We find that the majority of triples preserve their\nhierarchy throughout their evolution, which is in contradiction with the\ncommonly adopted picture that unstable triples always experience a chaotic,\ndemocratic resonant interaction. The duration of the unstable phase is much\nlonger than expected, so that stellar evolution cannot be neglected. Typically\nan unstable triple dissolve into a single star and a binary; sometimes\ndemocratically (the initial hierarchy is lost and the lightest body usually\nescapes), but also in a hierarchical way (the tertiary is ejected in a\nslingshot, independent of its mass). Collisions are common, and mostly involve\nthe two original inner binary components still on the main-sequence. This\ncontradicts the idea that collisions with a giant during democratic encounters\ndominate. Together with collisions in stable triples, we find that triple\nevolution is the dominant mechanism for stellar collisions in the Milky Way.\nFurthermore, our simulations produce runaway and walk-away stars with speeds up\nto several tens km/s, with a maximum of a few 100km/s. We suggest that\ndestabilised triples can alleviate the tension behind the origin of the\nobserved run-away stars. Lastly, we present a promising indicator to make\ngeneral predictions for the fate of a specific triple, based on the initial\ninclination of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 18:05:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 10:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

Modelling these\nsystems requires calculating the metric perturbation due to a point particle\norbiting a Kerr black hole. Currently, the linear perturbation is obtained with\na metric reconstruction procedure that puts it in a \"no-string\" radiation gauge\nwhich is singular on a surface surrounding the central black hole. Calculating\ndynamical quantities in this gauge involves a subtle procedure of \"gauge\ncompletion\" as well as cancellations of very large numbers. The singularities\nin the gauge also lead to pathological field equations at second perturbative\norder. In this paper we re-analyze the point-particle problem in Kerr using the\ncorrector-field reconstruction formalism of Green, Hollands, and Zimmerman\n(GHZ). We clarify the relationship between the GHZ formalism and previous\nreconstruction methods, showing that it provides a simple formula for the\n\"gauge completion\". We then use it to develop a new method of computing the\nmetric in a more regular gauge: a Teukolsky puncture scheme. This scheme should\nameliorate the problem of large cancellations, and by constructing the linear\nmetric perturbation in a sufficiently regular gauge, it should provide a first\nstep toward second-order self-force calculations in Kerr. Our methods are\ndeveloped in generality in Kerr, but we illustrate some key ideas and\ndemonstrate our puncture scheme in the simple setting of a static particle in\nMinkowski spacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 18:06:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 21:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

All three phases are also stable to Z_2-symmetric local\nunitary gates, and the dynamical phase transitions between the phases are in\nthe percolation universality class.

Within the spin glass phase the circuit dynamics can be\ninterpreted as a quantum repetition code, with each stabilizer of the code\nmeasured stochastically at a finite rate, and the decoherences as effective\nbit-flip errors. Motivated by the geometry of the spin glass phase, we devise a\nnovel decoding algorithm for recovering an arbitrary initial qubit state in the\ncode space, assuming knowledge of the history of the measurement outcomes, and\nthe ability of performing local Pauli measurements and gates on the final\nstate.

On the other hand, small online\ncommunities exist in droves and many persist in their smallness over time.\nTurning to the highly popular discussion website Reddit, which is made up of\nhundreds of thousands of communities, we conducted a qualitative interview\nstudy examining how and why people participate in these persistently small\ncommunities, in order to understand why these communities exist when popular\napproaches would assume them to be failures.

It\narises for example in Neurosciences, when the connectivity of neurons should be\ninferred from spike trains that record neurons' individual spiking activity.\nWhile recently some approaches for inferring delayed synaptic connections have\nbeen proposed, they are limited in the types of connectivities and delays they\nare able to handle, or require computation-intensive procedures. This paper\nproposes a faster and more flexible approach for analysing such delayed\ncorrelated activity: a statistical approach for the Analysis of Connectivity in\nspiking Events (ACE), based on the idea of hypothesis testing. It first\ncomputes for any pair of a source and a target neuron the inter-spike delays\nbetween subsequent source- and target-spikes. Then, it derives a null model for\nthe distribution of inter-spike delays for \\emph{uncorrelated}~neurons.\nFinally, it compares the observed distribution of inter-spike delays to this\nnull model and infers pairwise connectivity based on the Pearson's Chi-squared\ntest statistic. Thus, ACE is capable to detect connections with a priori\nunknown, non-discrete (and potentially large) inter-spike delays, which might\nvary between pairs of neurons. Since ACE works incrementally, it has potential\nfor being used in online processing. In our experiments, we visualise the\nadvantages of ACE in varying experimental scenarios (except for one special\ncase) and in a state-of-the-art dataset which has been generated for\nneuro-scientific research under most realistic conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 18:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

FL-MISR is\nextensively evaluated from different aspects and experimental results\ndemonstrate that FL-MISR effectively improves the spatial resolution of CT\nsystems in modulation transfer function (MTF) and visual perception. Comparing\nto a multi-core CPU implementation, FL-MISR achieves a more than 50x speedup on\nan off-the-shelf 4-GPU system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 19:31:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 21:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

In this paper, we present an automatic method to\ngenerate synchronized speech and talking-head videos on the basis of text and a\nsingle face image of an arbitrary person as input. In contrast to previous\ntext-driven talking head generation methods, which can only synthesize the\nvoice of a specific person, the proposed method is capable of synthesizing\nspeech for any person that is inaccessible in the training stage. Specifically,\nthe proposed method decomposes the generation of synchronized speech and\ntalking head videos into two stages, i.e., a text-to-speech (TTS) stage and a\nspeech-driven talking head generation stage. The proposed TTS module is a\nface-conditioned multi-speaker TTS model that gets the speaker identity\ninformation from face images instead of speech, which allows us to synthesize a\npersonalized voice on the basis of the input face image. To generate the\ntalking head videos from the face images, a facial landmark-based method that\ncan predict both lip movements and head rotations is proposed. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate\nsynchronized speech and talking head videos for arbitrary persons and\nnon-persons. Synthesized speech shows consistency with the given face regarding\nto the synthesized voice's timbre and one's appearance in the image, and the\nproposed landmark-based talking head method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nlandmark-based method on generating natural talking head videos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 19:58:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 08:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-29"}

A flurry of observational and theoretical effort has been\ndevoted to the exploitation of these oscillations with the grand hope that\nseismic techniques might be used as probes of the strength and structure of the\ncorona's magnetic field. The commonly accepted viewpoint is that each visible\nloop oscillates as an independent entity and acts as a one-dimensional (1D)\nwave cavity for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink waves. We argue that for many\nevents, this generally accepted model for the wave cavity is fundamentally\nflawed. In particular, the 3D magnetic arcade in which the bright loop resides\nparticipates in the oscillation. Thus, the true wave cavity is larger than the\nindividual loop and inherently multidimensional. We derive the skin depth of\nthe near-field response for an oscillating loop and demonstrate that most loops\nare too close to other magnetic structures to oscillate in isolation. Further,\nwe present a simple model of a loop embedded within an arcade and explore how\nthe eigenmodes of the arcade and the eigenmodes of the loop become coupled. In\nparticular, we discuss how distinguishing between these two types of modes can\nbe difficult when the motions within the arcade are often invisible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 21:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Since embeddings assign a unique integer vector to each node that\nencodes its position in a spanning tree of the overlay, attackers can infer\nnetwork structure from knowledge about assigned vectors.

However, the quadratic\ncomputational cost of self-attention has become a serious problem in practice\napplications. There has been much research on architectures without CNN and\nself-attention in this context. In particular, MLP-Mixer is a simple\narchitecture designed using MLPs and hit an accuracy comparable to the Vision\nTransformer. However, the only inductive bias in this architecture is the\nembedding of tokens. This leaves open the possibility of incorporating a\nnon-convolutional (or non-local) inductive bias into the architecture, so we\nused two simple ideas to incorporate inductive bias into the MLP-Mixer while\ntaking advantage of its ability to capture global correlations. A way is to\ndivide the token-mixing block vertically and horizontally. Another way is to\nmake spatial correlations denser among some channels of token-mixing. With this\napproach, we were able to improve the accuracy of the MLP-Mixer while reducing\nits parameters and computational complexity.

Although advantages of\noverlap weighting have been extensively demonstrated in literature with\ncontinuous and binary outcomes, research on its performance with time-to-event\nor survival outcomes is limited.

According to\nthe two assumptions and the Raychaudhuri equation, we demonstrate that the Wald\nentropy monotonically increases along the future event horizon under the linear\norder approximation of the perturbation. This result indicates that the Wald\nentropy of black holes in the quadric corrected gravity strictly obeys the\nlinearized second law of thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 01:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Therefore, in this work, we investigate\n\\textbf{knowledge-based fake news detection that does not require any external\nknowledge graph.} Specifically, our contributions include: (1) transforming the\nproblem of detecting fake news into a subgraph classification task---entities\nand relations are extracted from each news item to form a single knowledge\ngraph, where a news item is represented by a subgraph. Then a graph neural\nnetwork (GNN) model is trained to classify each subgraph/news item. (2) Further\nimproving the performance of this model through a simple but effective\nmulti-modal technique that combines extracted knowledge, textual content and\nsocial context. Experiments on multiple datasets with thousands of labelled\nnews items demonstrate that our knowledge-based algorithm outperforms existing\ncounterpart methods, and its performance can be further boosted by the\nmulti-modal approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 02:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Here\nwe focus on the temperate planets that have massive H2-dominated atmospheres,\nand trace the chemical reactions and transport following the photodissociation\nof H2O, CH4, NH3, and H2S, with K2-18 b, PH2 b, and Kepler-167 e representing\ntemperate/cold planets around M and G/K stars. We find that NH3 is likely\ndepleted by photodissociation to the cloud deck on planets around G/K stars but\nremains intact in the middle atmosphere of planets around M stars. A common\nphenomenon on temperate planets is that the photodissociation of NH3 in\npresence of CH4 results in HCN as the main photochemical product. The\nphotodissociation of CH4 together with H2O leads to CO and CO2, and the\nsynthesis of hydrocarbon is suppressed. Temperate planets with super-solar\natmospheric metallicity and appreciable internal heat may have additional CO\nand CO2 from the interior and less NH3 and thus less HCN. Our models of K2-18 b\ncan explain the transmission spectrum measured by Hubble, and indicate that\nfuture observations in 0.5-5.0 um would provide the sensitivity to detect the\nequilibrium gases CH4, H2O, and NH3, the photochemical gas HCN, as well as CO2\nin some cases. Temperate and H2-rich exoplanets are thus laboratories of\natmospheric chemistry that operate in regimes not found in the Solar System,\nand spectral characterization of these planets in transit or reflected\nstarlight promises to greatly expand the types of molecules detected in\nexoplanet atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 02:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

The\nfundamental theorem of linear algebra is essential in many fields, such as\nelectrical engineering, computer science, machine learning, and deep learning.\nThis survey is primarily a summary of purpose, significance of important\ntheories behind it.\n  The sole aim of this survey is to give a self-contained introduction to\nconcepts and mathematical tools in theory behind the fundamental theorem of\nlinear algebra and rigorous analysis in order to seamlessly introduce its\nproperties in four subspaces in subsequent sections. However, we clearly\nrealize our inability to cover all the useful and interesting results and given\nthe paucity of scope to present this discussion, e.g., the separated analysis\nof the (orthogonal) projection matrices. We refer the reader to literature in\nthe field of linear algebra for a more detailed introduction to the related\nfields.

However, it remains unknown what\ngives rise to the power laws and how the power-law exponents for area and\nvolume are related to one another. Here, we explore the perspective that\nprecipitation clusters are islands above a convective threshold on a rough\ncolumn-water-vapor (CWV) topography. This perspective is supported by the\nagreement between the precipitation clusters and CWV islands in their frequency\ndistributions as well as fractal dimensions. Power laws exist for CWV islands\nat different thresholds through the CWV topography, suggesting that the\nexistence of power-laws is not specifically related to local precipitation\ndynamics, but is rather a general feature of CWV islands. Furthermore, the\nfrequency distributions and fractal dimensions of the clusters can be\nreproduced when the CWV field is modeled to be self-affine with a roughness\nexponent of 0.3. Self-affine scaling theory relates the statistics of\nprecipitation clusters to the roughness exponent; it also relates the power-law\nslopes for area and volume without involving the roughness exponent. Thus, the\nperspective of precipitation clusters as CWV islands provides a useful\nframework to consider many statistical properties of the precipitation\nclusters, particularly given that CWV is well-observed over a wide range of\nlength scales in the tropics. However, the statistics of CWV islands at the\nconvective threshold imply a smaller roughness than is inferred from the power\nspectrum of the bulk CWV field, and further work is needed to understand the\nscaling of the CWV field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 05:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

It predicts a personalized click probability for each user-item\npair. Recently, researchers have found that the performance of CTR model can be\nimproved greatly by taking user behavior sequence into consideration,\nespecially long-term user behavior sequence. The report on an e-commerce\nwebsite shows that 23\\% of users have more than 1000 clicks during the past 5\nmonths. Though there are numerous works focus on modeling sequential user\nbehaviors, few works can handle long-term user behavior sequence due to the\nstrict inference time constraint in real world system. Two-stage methods are\nproposed to push the limit for better performance. At the first stage, an\nauxiliary task is designed to retrieve the top-$k$ similar items from long-term\nuser behavior sequence. At the second stage, the classical attention mechanism\nis conducted between the candidate item and $k$ items selected in the first\nstage. However, information gap happens between retrieval stage and the main\nCTR task. This goal divergence can greatly diminishing the performance gain of\nlong-term user sequence. In this paper, inspired by Reformer, we propose a\nlocality-sensitive hashing (LSH) method called ETA (End-to-end Target\nAttention) which can greatly reduce the training and inference cost and make\nthe end-to-end training with long-term user behavior sequence possible. Both\noffline and online experiments confirm the effectiveness of our model. We\ndeploy ETA into a large-scale real world E-commerce system and achieve extra\n3.1\\% improvements on GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) compared to a two-stage\nlong user sequence CTR model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 06:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

This\nbiases the detected sample of bursts and can explain the various shapes of\ncumulative energy distributions seen for repeating FRBs. We assume a Gaussian\nshape of the burst spectra and used simulations to demonstrate the above bias\nusing an FRB 121102-like example.

In particular, we\nrecover well-known results on PPA: finite convergence for sharp minima and\nlinear convergence for quadratic growth, even under presence of deterministic\nnoise. Moreover, when a simple Proximal Subgradient Method is recurrently\ncalled as an inner routine for computing each IPPA iterate, novel computational\ncomplexity bounds are obtained for Restarting Inexact PPA.

We consider two different\nsettings for this problem.

In the second setting, called competitive selection problem with\nrecall, agents are allowed to select any of the available items arrived so far.\nFor each of these problems, we describe the game induced by the selection\nproblem as a sequential game with imperfect information and study the set of\nsubgame-perfect Nash equilibrium payoffs.

For the no recall case, we prove that if there are two agents and\ntwo items arriving sequentially over time, both the price of anarchy and price\nof stability are upper bounded by the constant 4/3 for any value distribution.\nEven more, we show that this bound is tight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 08:12:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 14:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

We consider a basic setting where\nthe buyers' valuations are independent and identically distributed and there is\na single unit on sale. It is well-known that this setting is equivalent to the\nso-called i.i.d. prophet inequality, for which optimal guarantees are known and\nevaluate to 0.745 in general (equivalent to a PPM with dynamic prices) and $1 -\n1/e \\approx 0.632$ in the fixed threshold case (equivalent to a fixed price\nPPM). In this paper we consider an additional assumption, namely, that the\nunderlying market is very large. This is modeled by first fixing a valuation\ndistribution F and then making the number of buyers grow large, rather than\nconsidering the worst distribution for each possible market size. In this\nsetting Kennedy and Kertz [Ann. Probab. 1991] breaks the 0.745 fraction\nachievable in general with a dynamic threshold policy. We prove that this large\nmarket benefit continue to hold when using fixed price PPMs, and show that the\nguarantee of 0.632 actually improves to 0.712. We then move to study the case\nof selling k identical units and we prove that the revenue gap of the fixed\nprice PPM approaches $1-1/\\sqrt{ 2k\\pi}$.

Although many image manipulation location\nalgorithms have been proposed, most of them only focus on the RGB images with\ndifferent color spaces, and the frequency information that contains the\npotential tampering clues is often ignored. In this work, a novel end-to-end\ntwo-stream boundary-aware network (abbreviated as TBNet) is proposed for\ngeneric image manipulation localization in which the RGB stream, the frequency\nstream, and the boundary artifact location are explored in a unified framework.\nSpecifically, we first design an adaptive frequency selection module (AFS) to\nadaptively select the appropriate frequency to mine inconsistent statistics and\neliminate the interference of redundant statistics. Then, an adaptive\ncross-attention fusion module (ACF) is proposed to adaptively fuse the RGB\nfeature and the frequency feature. Finally, the boundary artifact location\nnetwork (BAL) is designed to locate the boundary artifacts for which the\nparameters are jointly updated by the outputs of the ACF, and its results are\nfurther fed into the decoder. Thus, the parameters of the RGB stream, the\nfrequency stream, and the boundary artifact location network are jointly\noptimized, and their latent complementary relationships are fully mined. The\nresults of extensive experiments performed on four public benchmarks of the\nimage manipulation localization task, namely, CASIA1.0, COVER, Carvalho, and\nIn-The-Wild, demonstrate that the proposed TBNet can significantly outperform\nstate-of-the-art generic image manipulation localization methods in terms of\nboth MCC and F1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 08:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

We build a census of molecular clouds within 2 kpc from the Sun\nusing literature. We examine the dust-based column density probability\ndistributions (N-PDFs) of the clouds and their relation to star formation\ntraced by young stellar objects (YSOs). We then examine our survey region from\nthe outside, within apertures of varying sizes, and describe how the N-PDFs and\ntheir relation to star formation changes with the size-scale. The N-PDFs of the\nclouds are not well described by any single simple model; use of any single\nmodel may bias the interpretation of the N-PDFs. The top-heaviness of the\nN-PDFs correlates with star formation activity, and the correlation changes\nwith Galactic environment (spiral-/inter-arm regions). We find that the density\ncontrast of clouds may be more intimately linked to star formation than the\ndense gas mass fraction. The aperture-averaged N-PDFs vary with the size-scale\nand are more top-heavy for larger apertures. The top-heaviness of the aperture\nN-PDFs correlates with star formation activity up to roughly 0.5 kpc\nsize-scale, depending on the environment. Our results suggest that the\nrelations between cloud structure and star formation are environment specific\nand best captured by relative quantities (e.g., the density contrast). Finally,\nwe show how the density structures of individual clouds give rise to a\nkpc-scale Kennicutt-Schmidt relationship as a combination of sampling effects\nand blending of different galactic environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 08:54:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 10:40:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 12:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

However, in an actual surveillance environment, a given person\nhas a great probability of changing clothes after a long time span, and they\nalso often take different personal belongings with them.

This study is to re-picture DRT in parallel\nplane channels by introducing dynamics of EIT based on statistical and budget\nanalysis for a series of flow regimes from the onset of DR to EIT. Energy\nconversion between velocity fluctuations and polymers as well as polymeric\npressure redistribution effect are of particular concern, based on which a new\nenergy self-sustaining process (SSP) of DRT is re-pictured.

Moreover, with the proposed energy picture, the newly discovered phenomenon\nthat the streamwise velocity fluctuations lag behind those in wall-normal\ndirection can be well explained.

Its suppression is therefore a key\nstep towards enhancing the fidelity of quantum computation using transmons.\nHere we propose the use of dynamical decoupling to suppress the crosstalk, and\ndemonstrate the success of this scheme through experiments performed on several\nIBM quantum cloud processors.

Notably, in the 2D Brillouin\nzone, chiral symmetry and space-time inversion symmetry can properly define\ntopological invariants as charges characterizing the stability of the nodal\npoints so that the non-zero charges protect these points. Due to the charge\nneutralization, the Nielsen-Ninomiya Theorem requires at least two stable\ntopological points in the entire Brillouin zone. However, additional\ncrystalline symmetries might duplicate the points. In this regard, for the\nwallpaper groups with crystalline symmetries, the minimal number of the nodal\npoints in the Brillouin zone might be more than two.

To address this issue, in this paper we propose an accelerated ENAS\nvia multifidelity evaluation termed MFENAS, where the individual evaluation\ncost is significantly reduced by training the architecture encoded by each\nindividual for only a small number of epochs. The balance between evaluation\ncost and evaluation accuracy is well maintained by suggesting a multi-fidelity\nevaluation, which identifies the potentially good individuals that cannot\nsurvive from previous generations by integrating multiple evaluations under\ndifferent numbers of training epochs.

For instance, Federated Learning is particularly\nvulnerable to data poisoning attacks that may deteriorate its performance and\nintegrity due to its distributed nature and inaccessibility to the raw data. In\naddition, it is extremely difficult to correctly identify malicious clients due\nto the non-Independently and/or Identically Distributed (non-IID) data.

Various data-driven approaches have been introduced to capture\nsubtle and local morphological changes of the brain accompanied by the disease\nprogression. One of the typical approaches for capturing subtle changes is\npatch-level feature representation. However, the predetermined regions to\nextract patches can limit classification performance by interrupting the\nexploration of potential biomarkers. In addition, the existing patch-level\nanalyses have difficulty explaining their decision-making. To address these\nproblems, we propose the BrainBagNet with a position-based gate\n(PG-BrainBagNet), a framework for jointly learning pathological region\nlocalization and AD diagnosis in an end-to-end manner. In advance, as all scans\nare aligned to a template in image processing, the position of brain images can\nbe represented through the 3D Cartesian space shared by the overall MRI scans.\nThe proposed method represents the patch-level response from whole-brain MRI\nscans and discriminative brain-region from position information. Based on the\noutcomes, the patch-level class evidence is calculated, and then the\nimage-level prediction is inferred by a transparent aggregation.

One parameter depends on the\nshifting of the keplerian mass-radius curve from the static one and shows it is\na constant across all EoS. The Z-parameter shows how tidal deformability\ndepends on the quark content of the star and the stiffness of the EoS.

Here, we propose an\nimmunization strategy that immunizes hyperedges with high simultaneous\ninfection probability (SIP). This strategy can be implemented in general\nhypergraphs. We also generalize the edge epidemic importance (EI)-based\nimmunization strategy, which is the state of the art in complex networks.\nHowever, it does not perform as well as the SIP-based method in hypergraphs\ndespite its high computational cost. We also show that immunizing hyperedges\nwith high H-eigenscore effectively contains the epidemics in uniform\nhypergraphs. A high SIP of a hyperedge suggests that the hyperedge is a\n\"hotspot\" of the epidemic process. Therefore, SIP can be used as a centrality\nmeasure to quantify a hyperedge's influence on higher-order dynamics in general\nhypergraphs. The effectiveness of the immunization strategies suggests the\nnecessity of scientific, data-driven, systematic policy-making for epidemic\ncontainment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 10:35:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 13:17:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

To separate security-sensitive operations from software executing\non the main x86 cores, SEV leverages the AMD Secure Processor (AMD-SP). This\npaper introduces a new approach to attack SEV-protected virtual machines (VMs)\nby targeting the AMD-SP. We present a voltage glitching attack that allows an\nattacker to execute custom payloads on the AMD-SPs of all microarchitectures\nthat support SEV currently on the market (Zen 1, Zen 2, and Zen 3). The\npresented methods allow us to deploy a custom SEV firmware on the AMD-SP, which\nenables an adversary to decrypt a VM's memory.

Making sure that all stakeholders\nshare the same vision of a changing system is crucial to the success of any\nproject. Misaligned mental models of stakeholders can lead to conflicting\nrequirements. A promising approach to this problem is the use of video showing\na system vision, so-called vision videos, which help stakeholders to disclose,\ndiscuss, and align their mental models of the future system. However, videos\nhave the drawback of allowing viewers to adopt a passive role, as has been\nshown in research on e-learning. In this role, viewers tend to be inactive,\nunfocused and bored while watching a video. In this paper, we learn and adopt\nfindings from scientific literature in the field of e-learning on how to\nmitigate this passive role while watching vision videos in requirements\nengineering. In this way, we developed concepts that incorporate interactive\nelements into vision videos to help viewers stay focused. These elements\ninclude questions that are asked during the video and ways for viewers to\ndecide what happens next in the video. In a preliminary evaluation with twelve\nparticipants, we found statistically significant differences when comparing the\ninteractive vision videos with their traditional form.

This knowledge is difficult to formulate and balance when\noperational routing decisions have to be made.

These preferences are in the form of\narc probabilities, i.e., the more preferred a route is, the higher is the joint\nprobability.

A message passing\nmechanism is used in the concept module to capture the relations between\nprimitive concepts. Furthermore, to prevent the model from being biased towards\nseen composite concepts and reduce the entanglement between attributes and\nobjects, we propose a blocking mechanism that equalizes the information\navailable to the model for both seen and unseen concepts. Extensive experiments\nand ablation studies on two benchmarks show the efficacy of the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 11:23:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

In the interest\nof a cleaner architecture and implementation with improved code reuse and\nextensibility, the initial application was refactored into Logtalk. This\nrefactoring includes decoupling the Situation Calculus reasoner, Ontology\nAuthoring framework, and Contingent Scaffolding framework into third-party\nlibraries that can be reused in other applications. This extraction was\nachieved by inverting dependencies via Logtalk protocols and categories, which\nare reusable interfaces and components that provide functionally cohesive sets\nof predicate declarations and predicate definitions. In this paper the\narchitectures of two iterations of Whitby are evaluated with respect to the\nmotivations behind the refactor: clean architecture enabling code reuse and\nextensibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 12:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

For this reason, this study defines a vehicle's\nfuture action plan/path and designs a cooperative path-planning model at\nintersections using future path sharing based on the future path information of\nmultiple vehicles.

In total, we identified\n17 diverse test smells. Additionally, we searched for Python-specific test\nsmells by mining frequent code change patterns that can be considered as either\nfixing or introducing test smells. Based on these changes, we proposed our own\ntest smell called Suboptimal assert. To detect all these test smells, we\ndeveloped a tool called PyNose in the form of a plugin to PyCharm, a popular\nPython IDE. Finally, we conducted a large-scale empirical investigation aimed\nat analyzing the prevalence of test smells in Python code. Our results show\nthat 98% of the projects and 84% of the test suites in the studied dataset\ncontain at least one test smell. Our proposed Suboptimal assert smell was\ndetected in as much as 70.6% of the projects, making it a valuable addition to\nthe list.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 12:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

We name the problem as the \"submergence\" of personalization. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a novel module: Personalized COld Start MOdules\n(POSO). Considering from a model architecture perspective, POSO personalizes\nexisting modules by introducing multiple user-group-specialized sub-modules.\nThen, it fuses their outputs by personalized gates, resulting in comprehensive\nrepresentations.

While multi-camera setups are widespread for applications such as\nsurveillance and traffic monitoring, existing trajectory forecasting methods\ntypically focus on single-camera trajectory forecasting (SCTF), limiting their\nuse for such applications. Furthermore, using a single camera limits the\nfield-of-view available, making long-term trajectory forecasting impossible. We\naddress these shortcomings of SCTF by developing an MCTF framework that\nsimultaneously uses all estimated relative object locations from several\nviewpoints and predicts the object's future location in all possible\nviewpoints. Our framework follows a Which-When-Where approach that predicts in\nwhich camera(s) the objects appear and when and where within the camera views\nthey appear.

In this combined theoretical and experimental study, we show that the\ndifferent sidebands exhibit characteristic blinking dynamics that can be\ncontrolled by detuning the laser from the exciton transition. By developing\nanalytical approximations we gain a better understanding of the involved\ninternal dynamics. Our specific SAW approach allows us to reach the ideal\nfrequency range of around 1 GHz that enables simultaneous temporal and spectral\nphonon sideband resolution close to the combined fundamental time-bandwidth\nlimit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 13:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

We also provide some examples about non-identifiable cases in\nsuch mixed kernel GPRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 14:29:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 05:38:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 08:17:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

By means of magnetoconductance and\nphotoresponse techniques, we derived the inelastic electron-phonon scattering\nrate $1/\\tau_{e-ph}$ and determined sound velocities and phonon heat\ncapacities. In the temperature range from 12 to 20~K, the scattering rate\nvaries with temperature as $1/\\tau_{e-ph}\\propto T^{3.45\\pm0.05}$; its value\nextrapolated to 10~K amounts to approximately 16~ps. Making a comparative\nanalysis of our films and other films used in superconducting devices, such as\npolycrystalline granular NbN and amorphous WSi, we found a systematic reduction\nof the sound velocity in all these films by about 50\\% as compared to the\ncorresponding bulk crystalline materials. A corresponding increase in the\nphonon heat capacities in all these films is, however, less than the Debye\nmodel predicts. We attribute these findings to reduced film dimensionality and\nfilm morphology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 14:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

This prevents improving\ntranslation quality through better search, as these idiosyncratic translations\nend up selected by the decoding algorithm, a problem known as the beam search\ncurse. Recently, an approximation to minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding has been\nproposed as an alternative decision rule that would likely not suffer from the\nsame problems. We analyse this approximation and establish that it has no\nequivalent to the beam search curse. We then design approximations that\ndecouple the cost of exploration from the cost of robust estimation of expected\nutility. This allows for much larger hypothesis spaces, which we show to be\nbeneficial. We also show that mode-seeking strategies can aid in constructing\ncompact sets of promising hypotheses and that MBR is effective in identifying\ngood translations in them.

One approach to\nreduce this source of error is to break the gate into parts, known as composite\npulses (CPs), that typically leverage the constancy of the error over time to\nmitigate its impact on gate fidelity. Here we extend this technique to suppress\nsecular drifts in Rabi frequency by regarding them as sums of power-law drifts\nwhose first-order effects on over- or under-rotation of the state vector add\nlinearly. Power-law drifts have the form $t^p$ where $t$ is time and the\nconstant $p$ is its power.

As a result, the previously known $F_1$ sequence, which is one of the\ntwo solutions to the $\\text{PLA}(1)$ criteria and furnishes suppression of both\nlinear secular drift and the first order nonlinear effects, is a sharper noise\nfilter than any of the other $\\text{PLA}(n)$ sequences in the low frequency\nlimit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 14:44:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 01:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

While recent works of pedestrian trajectory prediction successfully\nmodelled the influence of surrounding neighbours based on the relative\ndistances, they are ineffective on multi-class trajectory prediction. This is\nbecause they ignore the impact of the implicit correlations between different\ntypes of road users on the trajectory to be predicted - for example, a nearby\npedestrian has a different level of influence from a nearby car. In this paper,\nwe propose to introduce class information into a graph convolutional neural\nnetwork to better predict the trajectory of an individual. We embed the class\nlabels of the surrounding objects into the label adjacency matrix (LAM), which\nis combined with the velocity-based adjacency matrix (VAM) comprised of the\nobjects' velocity, thereby generating a semantics-guided graph adjacency (SAM).\nSAM effectively models semantic information with trainable parameters to\nautomatically learn the embedded label features that will contribute to the\nfixed velocity-based trajectory. Such information of spatial and temporal\ndependencies is passed to a graph convolutional and temporal convolutional\nnetwork to estimate the predicted trajectory distributions. We further propose\nnew metrics, known as Average2 Displacement Error (aADE) and Average Final\nDisplacement Error (aFDE), that assess network accuracy more accurately. We\ncall our framework Semantics-STGCNN. It consistently shows superior performance\nto the state-of-the-arts in existing and the newly proposed metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 15:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

We show that the\ncurrent security model of Android, which limits security products to run as\nregular apps and prevents them from automatically removing malicious apps opens\na significant window of opportunity for attackers. Such apps warn users about\nthe newly discovered threats, but users do not promptly act on this\ninformation, allowing PHAs to persist on their device for an average of 24 days\nafter they are detected. We also find that while app markets remove PHAs after\nthese become known, there is a significant delay between when PHAs are\nidentified and when they are removed: PHAs persist on Google Play for 77 days\non average and 34 days on third party marketplaces. Finally, we find evidence\nof PHAs migrating to other marketplaces after being removed on the original\none.

The need for smart systems for environmental\nmonitoring and the enhancement of recycling processes is thus greater than\never. Amongst these efforts lies IBM's Wastenet project which aims to improve\nrecycling by using artificial intelligence for waste classification. The work\nreported in this paper builds on this project through the use of transfer\nlearning and data augmentation techniques to ameliorate classification\naccuracy. Starting with a convolutional neural network (CNN), a systematic\napproach is followed for selecting appropriate splitting ratios and for tuning\nmultiple training parameters including learning rate schedulers, layers\nfreezing, batch sizes and loss functions, in the context of the given scenario\nwhich requires classification of waste into different recycling types.

Subsequently, a range of\ndata augmentation techniques are then incorporated into this work including\nflipping, rotation, shearing, zooming, and brightness control. Results show\nthat these augmentation techniques further improve the test accuracy of the\nfinal model to 95.40%. Unlike other work reported in the field, this paper\nprovides full details regarding the training of the model.

In this paper, a state-of-the-art\nreview on cutting-edge solutions to the power allocation optimisation problem\nusing deep learning is provided. It is shown that the use of deep learning\ntechniques to obtain effective solutions to the power allocation problem in\nNOMA is paramount for the future of NOMA-based wireless communication systems.\nFurthermore, several possible research directions based on the use of deep\nlearning in NOMA systems are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 13:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

We demonstrate the use of quantitative metrics and large\namounts of historical data towards decision making goals. This investment\nconcept combines macroeconomic views with characteristics of individual\nsecurities to beat the market returns. The central idea of this theme is to\nidentity securities from a regional perspective that are heavily shorted and\nyet are fundamentally sound with at least a minimum buy rating from a consensus\nof stock analysts covering the securities. We discuss the components of\ncreating such a strategy including the mechanics of constructing the portfolio.\nUsing simulations, in which securities lending data is modeled as geometric\nbrownian motions, we provide a few flavors of creating a ranking of securities\nto identity the ones that are heavily shorted.\n  An investment strategy of this kind will be ideal in market scenarios when a\ndownturn happens due to unexpected extreme events and the markets are\nanticipated to bounce back thereafter. This situation is especially applicable\nto incidents being observed, and relevant proceedings, during the Coronavirus\npandemic in 2020-2021. This strategy is one particular way to overcome a\npotential behavioral bias related to investing, which we term the \"rebound\neffect\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 14:49:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

One promising approach is to learn deep grasping models\nfrom large training datasets of object images and grasp labels. However,\nempirical grasping datasets are typically sparsely labeled (i.e., a small\nnumber of successful grasp labels in each image). The data sparsity issue can\nlead to insufficient supervision and false-negative labels and thus results in\npoor learning results. This paper proposes a Maximum Likelihood Grasp Sampling\nLoss (MLGSL) to tackle the data sparsity issue. The proposed method supposes\nthat successful grasps are stochastically sampled from the predicted grasp\ndistribution and maximizes the observing likelihood. MLGSL is utilized for\ntraining a fully convolutional network that generates thousands of grasps\nsimultaneously. Training results suggest that models based on MLGSL can learn\nto grasp with datasets composing of 2 labels per image. Compared to previous\nworks, which require training datasets of 16 labels per image, MLGSL is 8x more\ndata-efficient. Meanwhile, physical robot experiments demonstrate an equivalent\nperformance at a 90.7% grasp success rate on household objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 04:33:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 18:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}
