For image super-resolution (SR), it learns to predict diverse\nphoto-realistic high-resolution (HR) images from the low-resolution (LR) image\nrather than learning a deterministic mapping. For image rescaling, it achieves\nhigh accuracy by jointly modelling the downscaling and upscaling processes.\nWhile existing approaches employ specialized techniques for these two tasks, we\nset out to unify them in a single formulation. In this paper, we propose the\nhierarchical conditional flow (HCFlow) as a unified framework for image SR and\nimage rescaling. More specifically, HCFlow learns a bijective mapping between\nHR and LR image pairs by modelling the distribution of the LR image and the\nrest high-frequency component simultaneously. In particular, the high-frequency\ncomponent is conditional on the LR image in a hierarchical manner. To further\nenhance the performance, other losses such as perceptual loss and GAN loss are\ncombined with the commonly used negative log-likelihood loss in training.\nExtensive experiments on general image SR, face image SR and image rescaling\nhave demonstrated that the proposed HCFlow achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 16:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-29"}

However, such an assumption is\nrarely applicable for real images whose blur kernels are usually spatially\nvariant due to factors such as object motion and out-of-focus. Hence, existing\nblind SR methods would inevitably give rise to poor performance in real\napplications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a mutual affine\nnetwork (MANet) for spatially variant kernel estimation. Specifically, MANet\nhas two distinctive features. First, it has a moderate receptive field so as to\nkeep the locality of degradation. Second, it involves a new mutual affine\nconvolution (MAConv) layer that enhances feature expressiveness without\nincreasing receptive field, model size and computation burden. This is made\npossible through exploiting channel interdependence, which applies each channel\nsplit with an affine transformation module whose input are the rest channel\nsplits. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real images show that the\nproposed MANet not only performs favorably for both spatially variant and\ninvariant kernel estimation, but also leads to state-of-the-art blind SR\nperformance when combined with non-blind SR methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 16:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

The XRPIX are fabricated with the SOI\ntechnology, which makes it possible to integrate a high-resistivity Si sensor\nand a low-resistivity Si CMOS circuit. The CMOS circuit in each pixel is\nequipped with a trigger function, allowing us to read out outputs only from the\npixels with X-ray signals at the timing of X-ray detection. This function thus\nrealizes high throughput and high time resolution, which enables to employ\nanti-coincidence technique for background rejection. A new series of XRPIX\nnamed XRPIX6E developed with a pinned depleted diode (PDD) structure improves\nspectral performance by suppressing the interference between the sensor and\ncircuit layers. When semiconductor X-ray sensors are used in space, their\nspectral performance is generally degraded owing to the radiation damage caused\nby high-energy protons. Therefore, before using an XRPIX in space, it is\nnecessary to evaluate the extent of degradation of its spectral performance by\nradiation damage. Thus, we performed a proton irradiation experiment for\nXRPIX6E for the first time at HIMAC in the NIRS. We irradiated XRPIX6E with\nhigh-energy protons with a total dose of up to 40 krad, equivalent to 400 years\nof irradiation in orbit.

However, the value satisfies\nthe requirement for FORCE, 300 eV at 6 keV, even after the irradiation. It was\nalso found that the PDD XRPIX has enhanced radiation hardness compared to\nprevious XRPIX devices. In addition, we investigated the degradation of the\nenergy resolution; it was shown that the degradation would be due to increasing\nenergy-independent components, e.g., readout noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 16:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

From this we\nderive several consequences for multi-loop integrals in general, and we\nillustrate them on the example of multi-loop banana integrals. For example, we\nshow how Griffiths transversality, known from the theory of variation of mixed\nHodge structures, leads quite generically to a set of quadratic relations among\nmaximal cut integrals associated to Calabi-Yau motives. These quadratic\nrelations then naturally lead to a compact expression for $l$-loop banana\nintegrals in $D=2$ dimensions in terms of an integral over a period of a\nCalabi-Yau $(l-1)$-fold. This new integral representation generalizes in a\nnatural way the known representations for $l\\le 3$ involving logarithms with\nsquare root arguments and iterated integrals of Eisenstein series. In a second\npart, we show how the results obtained by some of the authors in earlier work\ncan be extended to dimensional regularization. We present a method to obtain\nthe differential equations for banana integrals with an arbitrary number of\nloops in dimensional regularization without the need to solve\nintegration-by-parts relations.

In this paper, we find that some\nhidden units of the network are selective to certain ranges of depth, and thus\nsuch behavior can be served as a way to interpret the internal representations.\nBased on our observations, we quantify the interpretability of a deep MDE\nnetwork by the depth selectivity of its hidden units.

Changing social dynamics around parenting has\nseen fathers increasingly take an active role in parenting. This demands a more\nnuanced approach to understanding how parenting affects both men and women.\nUsing a global survey of 11,226 academic parents, this study investigates the\neffect of parental engagement (Lead, Dual (shared), and Satellite parenting),\nand partner type, on measures of research productivity and impact for men and\nfor women. It also analyzes the effect of different levels of parental leave on\nacademic productivity. Results show that the parenting penalty for men and\nwomen is a function of the level of engagement in parenting activities. Men who\nserve in lead roles suffer similar penalties, but women are more likely to\nserve in lead parenting roles and to be more engaged across time and tasks.\nTaking a period of parental leave is associated with higher levels of\nproductivity, however the productivity advantage is lost for the US-sample at 6\nmonths, and at 12-months for the non-US sample.

The two statistics constrain the average episodic quasar lifetime to\nbe hundreds to thousands of years. Much longer (or shorter) episodic lifetimes\nare strongly disfavored by these observations. This average episodic lifetime\nis broadly consistent with the infall timescale (viscous time) in the standard\naccretion disk model for quasars, suggesting that quasar episodes are governed\nby accretion disk physics rather than by the gas supply on much larger scales.\nCompared with the cumulative quasar lifetime of $\\sim 10^6-10^8\\,$yrs\nconstrained from quasar clustering and massive black hole demographics, our\nresults suggest that there are $\\sim 10^3-10^5$ episodes of quasar accretion\nduring the assembly history of the supermassive black hole.

At the time of selection, even\nsymmetrical variability will result in more quasars with their instantaneous\nfluxes scattered above the flux limit than those scattered below, leading to an\nasymmetry in flux changes over time.

The\ntarget spaces of these theories inherit a curved structure from the group $G$,\nwhich in the case of modular invariant inflation leads to a hyperbolic field\nspace geometry. It is shown that in this class of models the symmetry structure\nleads to both large and small field inflationary trajectories within a single\nmodular inflation model.

Here we review and compare\nsome of the different models used by ecologists and astrobiologists and suggest\nhow they could be integrated into new habitability standards. Such standards\nwill help to improve the comparison and characterization of potentially\nhabitable environments, prioritize target selections, and study correlations\nbetween habitability and biosignatures.

The question has been posed and addressed most prominently in the\ncontext of incidence at large angles from a dielectric medium of high\nrefractive index onto a gain medium of lower refractive index. Here, the\nrelevant sign of the transmitted k-vector determines whether the\nevanescent-like waves within the gain medium exponentially grow or decay away\nfrom the interface.

However, in practical applications, the regions where the\nkinetic effects are critical can be changing, appearing, disappearing and\nmoving in the computational domain.

Insect observations are automatically\nextracted and transmitted with environmental metadata over cellular connection\nto a cloud-based database. The recorded features include wing beat harmonics,\nmelanisation and flight direction. To validate the sensor's capabilities, we\ntested the correlation between daily insect counts from an oil seed rape field\nmeasured with six yellow water traps and six sensors during a 4-week period. A\ncomparison of the methods found a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of\n0.61 and a p-value of 0.0065, with the sensors recording approximately 19 times\nmore insect observations and demonstrating a larger temporal dynamic than\nconventional trapping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 20:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}

A two-orbital pairing\nstate, called $s\\tau_{3}$, with non-trivial matrix structure, was proposed as a\ncandidate able to reconcile the seemingly contradictory properties of these\nSC's. Motivated by the non-trivial orbital structure of the proposed\n$s\\tau_{3}$ state, which has orbital-selective pairing structure, we study\nprototypical Josephson junctions where at least one of the leads is in a SC\nstate of this kind. An analysis of these junctions in the limit of two\ndegenerate orbitals (bands) and with a simple form of junction hybridization\nreveals several remarkable properties. One is the emergence of gapless, purely\nelectron- and hole-like bound states for $s\\tau_{3}-N-s\\tau_{3}$ junctions with\narbitrary global phase difference between the leads, and likewise for\n$s\\tau_{3}-N-I$ junctions. The other is the absence of static Josephson\ncurrents when both leads are SC's. In both of these signatures, $s\\tau_{3}$\njunctions are dramatically different from conventional Josephson junctions. We\nalso find that the gapless bound states are protected by an orbital-exchange\nsymmetry, although the protection is not topological. Junctions which break\nthis symmetry, such as $s\\tau_{3}-N-s$, have gapped Andreev bound states. In\ngeneral, the Josephson effect also re-emerges once the degeneracy of the two\norbitals is lifted. We support these conclusions via analytical and numerical\nresults for the bound states, together with microscopic calculations of the\nJosephson current.

First of all, the\nfuzzy logic controller is designed according to rules so that the systems is\nbasically robust. There are 25 rules for the auto-tuning of each parameter of\nthe PID controller. The FLC (fuzzy logic controller) has two inputs. The first\nis the motor speed error between the reference (setpoint) and the actual speed.\nThe second is the variation of the speed error (derivative of the speed error).\nSecondly the output of the FLC is the parameters of the PID controller which\nare used to control the speed of the DC motor.

The development of ever-brighter x-ray sources has\nfacilitated ever more sensitive x-ray scattering and spectroscopy measurements\nthat are able to probe not just the lattice structure, but also the spectrum of\nelementary excitations in complex materials.

As one of the ways to address the need,\nresearches on various tilting multirotors that can increase maneuverability has\nbeen employed. Unfortunately, existing studies on the tilting multirotors\nrequire considerable amounts of prior information on the complex dynamic model.\nMeanwhile, reinforcement learning on quadrotors has been studied to mitigate\nthis issue. Yet, these are only been applied to standard quadrotors, whose\nsystems are less complex than those of tilting multirotors. In this paper, a\nnovel reinforcement learning-based method is proposed to control a tilting\nmultirotor on real-world applications, which is the first attempt to apply\nreinforcement learning to a tilting multirotor. To do so, we propose a novel\nreward function for a neural network model that takes power efficiency into\naccount. The model is initially trained over a simulated environment and then\nfine-tuned using real-world data in order to overcome the sim-to-real gap\nissue. Furthermore, a novel, efficient state representation with respect to the\ngoal frame that helps the network learn optimal policy better is proposed.

For certain Reynolds numbers the aerodynamic forces exhibit\nintermittent fluctuations caused by changes in the behavior of vortices in the\nairfoil wake.

These\napproaches make use of genetic operators (i.e., mutation and crossover) that\ncreate test variants by adding, altering, and removing statements from existing\ntests. While this encoding schema has been shown to be very effective for\nmany-objective test case generation, the standard crossover operator\n(single-point) only alters the structure of the test cases but not the input\ndata. In this paper, we argue that changing both the test case structure and\nthe input data is necessary to increase the genetic variation and improve the\nsearch process. Hence, we propose a hybrid multi-level crossover (HMX) operator\nthat combines the traditional test-level crossover with data-level\nrecombination. The former evolves and alters the test case structures, while\nthe latter evolves the input data using numeric and string-based\nrecombinational operators. We evaluate our new crossover operator by performing\nan empirical study on more than 100 classes selected from open-source Java\nlibraries for numerical operations and string manipulation. We compare HMX with\nthe single-point crossover that is used in EvoSuite w.r.t structural coverage\nand fault detection capability. Our results show that HMX achieves a\nstatistically significant increase in 30% of the classes up to 19% in\nstructural coverage compared to the single-point crossover.

We construct two special NE realized by a lexicographically safe\n(lexsafe) strategy of one player and a best response of the other. We obtain a\npolynomial algorithm computing these lexsafe NE. This is trivial when game form\n$g$ is given explicitly. Yet, in applications $g$ is frequently realized by an\noracle $\\cO$ such that size of $g$ is exponential in size $|\\cO|$ of $\\cO$.

In this paper, we revisit the application of predictive models by\nthe Chicago Department of Public Health to schedule restaurant inspections and\nprioritize the detection of critical food code violations. We perform the first\nanalysis of the model's fairness to the population served by the restaurants in\nterms of average time to find a critical violation. We find that the model\ntreats inspections unequally based on the sanitarian who conducted the\ninspection and that, in turn, there are geographic disparities in the benefits\nof the model. We examine four alternate methods of model training and two\nalternative ways of scheduling using the model and find that the latter\ngenerate more desirable results. The challenges from this application point to\nimportant directions for future work around fairness with collective entities\nrather than individuals, the use of critical violations as a proxy, and the\ndisconnect between fair classification and fairness in the dynamic scheduling\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 04:17:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 06:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

However at low CAV penetration, the capacity gain will be small because\nthe CAVs that randomly enter the road will be sparsely distributed, diminishing\nthe probability of forming long platoons. Many researchers propose to solve\nthis issue by platoon organization strategies, where the CAVs search for other\nCAVs on the road and change lanes if necessary to form longer platoons.\nHowever, the current literature does not analyze a potential risk of platoon\norganization in disrupting the flow and reducing the capacity by inducing more\nlane changes. In this research, we use driving model of Cooperative Adaptive\nCruise Control (CACC) vehicles and human-driven vehicles that are validated\nwith field experiments and find that platoon organization can indeed drop the\ncapacity with more lane changes. But when the traffic demand is well below\ncapacity, platoon organization forms longer CAV platoons without reducing the\nflow. Based on this finding, we develop the Flow-Aware platoon organization\nstrategy, where the CAVs perform platoon organization conditionally on the\nlocal traffic state, i.e., a low flow and a high speed. We simulate the\nFlow-Aware platoon organization on a realistic freeway network and show that\nthe CAVs successfully form longer platoons, while ensuring a maximal traffic\nflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 04:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}

For instance, if two\nanti-ferromagnetic insulators as LaMnO$_3$ and SrMnO$_3$ are grown in a\n(001)-oriented superlattice, a half-metallic ferromagnet may form, provided\nthat the thickness is sufficiently small to allow tunneling across interfaces.\nIn this article, we employ electronic structure calculations to show that all\nthe layers of a (111)-oriented LaMnO$_3$|SrMnO$_3$ superlattice retain a\nhalf-metallic ferromagnetic character for a much larger thickness than in its\n(001) counterpart. This behavior is shown to be linked to the charge transfer\nacross the interface, favored by the octahedral connectivity between the\nlayers. This also results in a symmetry-induced quenching of the Jahn-Teller\ndistortions, which are replaced by breathing modes. The latter are coupled to\ncharge and spin oscillations, whose components have a pure e g character. Most\ninterestingly, the magnetization reaches its maximum value inside the LaMnO$_3$\nregion and not at the interface, which is fundamentally different from what\nobserved for the (001) orientation. The analysis of the inter-atomic exchange\ncoupling shows that the magnetic order arises from the double-exchange\nmechanism, despite competing interactions inside the SrMnO$_3$ region. Finally,\nthe van Vleck distortions and the spin oscillations are found to be crucially\naffected by the variation of Hund's exchange and charge doping, which allows us\nto speculate that our system behaves as a Hund's metal, creating an interesting\nconnection between manganites and nickelates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 04:55:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 20:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

Near such a\ntransition (or critical point) collective computation is generally thought to\nbe optimized, due to the associated maximal sensitivity to perturbations and\nfast dissemination of information. For biological systems, however, optimality\ndepends on environmental context, making the flexible, context-dependent\nadoption of different distances to a critical point potentially more beneficial\nthan its unique properties. Here, studying escape waves in schooling fish at\ntwo levels of perceived environmental risk, we investigate a) if and how\ndistance to criticality is regulated in response to environmental changes and\nb) how the individual level benefits derived from special properties of the\ncritical point compare to those achieved via regulation of the group's distance\nto it. We find that the observed fish schools are subcritical (not maximally\nresponsive and sensitive to environmental cues), but decrease their distance to\ncriticality with increased perceived risk. Considering an individual's\nhypothetical costs of two detection error types, we find that optimal distance\nto criticality depends on the riskiness and noisiness of the environment, which\nmay explain the observed behavior. Our results highlight the benefit of\nevaluating biological consequences of different distances to criticality for\nindividuals within animal collectives.

In previous studies, the decision-making of lane-changing\nof the human drivers was mainly used to increase the individual's benefit.\nHowever, the lane-changing behavior of these human drivers can sometimes have a\nbad influence on the overall traffic flow. As technology for autonomous\nvehicles develop, lane changing action as well as lane changing decision making\nfall within the control category of autonomous vehicles. However, since many of\nthe current lane-changing decision algorithms of autonomous vehicles are based\non the human driver model, it is hard to know the potential traffic impact of\nsuch lane change. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the decision-making\nof lane change considering traffic flow, and accordingly, we study the lane\nchange control system considering the whole traffic flow. In this research, the\nlane change control system predicts the future traffic situation through the\ncell transition model, one of the most popular macroscopic traffic simulation\nmodels, and determines the change probability of each lane that minimizes the\ntotal time delay through the genetic algorithm. The lane change control system\nthen conveys the change probability to this vehicle. In the macroscopic\nsimulation result, the proposed control system reduced the overall travel time\ndelay. The proposed system is applied to microscopic traffic simulation, the\noversaturated freeway traffic flow algorithm (OFFA), to evaluate the potential\nperformance when it is applied to the actual traffic system. In the traffic\nflow-density, the maximum traffic flow has been shown to be increased, and the\npoints in the congestion area have also been greatly reduced.

A CRN is weakly\nreversible if each of its connected components is strongly connected. Weakly\nreversible networks can be considered as the most important class of reaction\nnetworks. Now, the stoichiometric subspace of a network is the linear span of\nthe reaction vectors (i.e., difference between the product and the reactant\ncomplexes). A decomposition of a CRN is independent (incidence independent) if\nthe direct sum of the stoichiometric subspaces (incidence maps) of the\nsubnetworks equals the stoichiometric subspace (incidence map) of the whole\nnetwork. Decompositions can be used to study relationships between steady\nstates of the whole system (induced from partitioning the reaction set of the\nunderlying network) and those of its subsystems.

The key of\nrecommender systems is to predict how likely users will interact with items\nbased on their historical online behaviors, e.g., clicks, add-to-cart,\npurchases, etc. To exploit these user-item interactions, there are increasing\nefforts on considering the user-item interactions as a user-item bipartite\ngraph and then performing information propagation in the graph via Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs).

In this\nstudy, we investigated the interaction of hydrodynamic shocks with Bonnor-Ebert\nspheres using 3D hydrodynamical simulations with self-gravity. Our simulations\nindicated that the cloud evolution primarily depends on two parameters: the\nshock speed and initial cloud radius. The stronger shock can compress the cloud\nmore efficiently, and when the central region becomes gravitationally unstable,\na shock triggers the cloud contraction. However, if it is excessively strong,\nit shreds the cloud more violently and the cloud is destroyed. From simple\ntheoretical considerations, we derived the condition of triggered gravitational\ncollapse, which agreed with the simulation results. Introducing sink particles,\nwe followed the further evolution after star formation. Since stronger shocks\ntend to shred the cloud material more efficiently, the stronger the shock is,\nthe smaller the final (asymptotic) masses of the stars formed (i.e., sink\nparticles) become. In addition, the shock accelerates the cloud, promoting\nmixing of shock-accelerated interstellar medium gas. As a result, the\nseparation between the sink particles and the shocked cloud center and their\nrelative speed increase over time. We also investigated the effect of cloud\nturbulence on shock-cloud interaction.

Unfortunately, the ground is not\nflat, as it features steep slopes; bumpy roads; or objects, such as curbs,\nflower beds, and so forth. To tackle the problem, this paper presents a novel\nground segmentation method called \\textit{Patchwork}, which is robust for\naddressing the under-segmentation problem and operates at more than 40 Hz. In\nthis paper, a point cloud is encoded into a Concentric Zone Model-based\nrepresentation to assign an appropriate density of cloud points among bins in a\nway that is not computationally complex. This is followed by Region-wise Ground\nPlane Fitting, which is performed to estimate the partial ground for each bin.\nFinally, Ground Likelihood Estimation is introduced to dramatically reduce\nfalse positives. As experimentally verified on SemanticKITTI and rough terrain\ndatasets, our proposed method yields promising performance compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods, showing faster speed compared with existing plane\nfitting--based methods.

During refinement, we introduce an efficient trajectory-aware scheme\nwithin 20 minutes, which jointly encodes the spatial, temporal consistency and\nsemantic cues along the designed trajectory, achieving photo-realistic\nbullet-time viewing experience of human activities. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for convenient interactive\nbullet-time design and photo-realistic human free-viewpoint video generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 07:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}

The\nomnipresence of filamentary structures and their physical connection to\nprestellar cores demand methods that are able to disentangle and extract both\nsources and filaments. It is fundamentally important to test all extraction\nmethods to compare their detection and measurement qualities and fully\nunderstand their capabilities before their scientific applications. A recent\npublication described getsf, the new method for source and filament extraction\nthat employs the separation of the structural components, a successor to\ngetsources, getfilaments, and getimages (collectively referred to as getold).\nThis new paper describes a detailed benchmarking of both getsf and getold using\ntwo multicomponent, multiwavelength benchmarks resembling the Herschel\nobservations of the nearby star-forming regions. Each benchmark consists of\nsimulated images at six Herschel wavelengths and one additional surface density\nimage with a 13 arcsec resolution. The structural components of the benchmarks\ninclude a background cloud, a dense filament, hundreds of starless and\nprotostellar cores, and instrumental noise. Five variants of benchmark images\nof different complexity are used to perform the source and filament extractions\nwith getsf and getold. A formalism for evaluating source detection and\nmeasurement qualities is presented, allowing quantitative comparisons of\nextraction methods in terms of their completeness, reliability, and goodness,\nas well as the detection and measurement accuracies and the overall quality. A\ndetailed analysis shows that getsf has better qualities than getold and that\nthe best choice for source detection is the high-resolution surface density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 08:07:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 20:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

We use multi-band sizes and\nmorphologies to gain an insight on the processes that lead galaxy evolution,\ne.g. gas condensation, star formation, AGN feedback. The 11 DSFGs are very\ncompact in the (sub-)millimeter (median r(ALMA) = 1.15 kpc), while the optical\nemission extends tolarger radii (median r(H)/r(ALMA) = 2.05). CO lines reveal\nthe presence of a rotating disc of molecular gas, but we can not exclude either\nthe presence of interactions and/or molecular outflows. Images at higher\n(spectral and spatial) resolution are needed to disentangle from the possible\nscenarios. Most of the galaxies are caught in the compaction phase, when gas\ncools and falls into galaxy centre, fuelling the dusty burst of star formation\nand the growing nucleus. We expect these DSFGs to be the high-zstar-forming\ncounterparts of massive quiescent galaxies. Some features of CO emission in\nthree galaxies are suggestive of forthcoming/ongoing AGN feedback, that is\nthought to trigger the morphological transition from star-forming disks to\nETGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 08:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

The whole\nacquisition process can be accelerated by having one or more modalities\nunder-sampled in the $k$-space. Recent research has shown that, considering the\nredundancy between different modalities, a target MRI modality under-sampled in\nthe $k$-space can be more efficiently reconstructed with a fully-sampled\nreference MRI modality. However, we find that the performance of the\naforementioned multi-modal reconstruction can be negatively affected by subtle\nspatial misalignment between different modalities, which is actually common in\nclinical practice. In this paper, we improve the quality of multi-modal\nreconstruction by compensating for such spatial misalignment with a spatial\nalignment network. First, our spatial alignment network estimates the\ndisplacement between the fully-sampled reference and the under-sampled target\nimages, and warps the reference image accordingly. Then, the aligned\nfully-sampled reference image joins the multi-modal reconstruction of the\nunder-sampled target image. Also, considering the contrast difference between\nthe target and reference images, we have designed a\ncross-modality-synthesis-based registration loss in combination with the\nreconstruction loss, to jointly train the spatial alignment network and the\nreconstruction network. The experiments on both clinical MRI and multi-coil\n$k$-space raw data demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the\nmulti-modal MRI reconstruction empowered with our spatial alignment network.\nOur code is publicly available at\n\\url{https://github.com/woxuankai/SpatialAlignmentNetwork}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 08:46:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 02:47:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 09:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

The preliminary tests compensate errors in the optical\nsystem and correct a carrying wavefront, reducing the gap between real-life\nexperiments and computational modeling, which improve imaging significantly\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively. These two tests are performed for\nobservation of the laser beam and phase mask along, and might be considered as\na preliminary system calibration. The corrected carrying wavefront is embedded\ninto the proposed iterative Single-shot Super-Resolution Phase Retrieval\n(SSR-PR) algorithm. Improved initial diffraction pattern upsampling, and a\ncombination of sparse and deep learning based filters achieves the\nsuper-resolved reconstructions.

In previous work (Barash et al, \"Bridging the gap...\")\nwe demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing feature models in bridging this\ngap. Whereas ML performance metrics, such as the accuracy or F1-score of a\nclassifier, typically measure the average ML performance, feature models shed\nlight on explainable data slices that are too far from that average, and\ntherefore might indicate unsatisfied requirements.

On the contrary,\nconventional deep learning models lack this capability of preserving previously\nlearned knowledge. When a neural network is fine-tuned to learn new tasks, its\nperformance on previously trained tasks will significantly deteriorate. Many\nrecent works on incremental object detection tackle this problem by introducing\nadvanced regularization. Although these methods have shown promising results,\nthe benefits are often short-lived after the first incremental step. Under\nmulti-step incremental learning, the trade-off between old knowledge preserving\nand new task learning becomes progressively more severe. Thus, the performance\nof regularization-based incremental object detectors gradually decays for\nsubsequent learning steps. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this performance\ndecay on multi-step incremental detection tasks by proposing a dilatable\nincremental object detector (DIODE). For the task-shared parameters, our method\nadaptively penalizes the changes of important weights for previous tasks. At\nthe same time, the structure of the model is dilated or expanded by a limited\nnumber of task-specific parameters to promote new task learning.

In this paper, we propose a 3D tracking method called\n3D-SiamRPN Network to track a single target object by using raw 3D point cloud\ndata. The proposed network consists of two subnetworks. The first subnetwork is\nfeature embedding subnetwork which is used for point cloud feature extraction\nand fusion. In this subnetwork, we first use PointNet++ to extract features of\npoint cloud from template and search branches. Then, to fuse the information of\nfeatures in the two branches and obtain their similarity, we propose two cross\ncorrelation modules, named Pointcloud-wise and Point-wise respectively. The\nsecond subnetwork is region proposal network(RPN), which is used to get the\nfinal 3D bounding box of the target object based on the fusion feature from\ncross correlation modules. In this subnetwork, we utilize the regression and\nclassification branches of a region proposal subnetwork to obtain proposals and\nscores, thus get the final 3D bounding box of the target object. Experimental\nresults on KITTI dataset show that our method has a competitive performance in\nboth Success and Precision compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and could\nrun in real-time at 20.8 FPS.

However, semantic segmentation for off-road,\nunstructured environments is not widely studied. Directly applying existing\nsegmentation networks often results in performance degradation as they cannot\novercome intrinsic problems in such environments, such as illumination changes.\nIn this paper, a built-in memory module for semantic segmentation is proposed\nto overcome these problems. The memory module stores significant\nrepresentations of training images as memory items. In addition to the encoder\nembedding like items together, the proposed memory module is specifically\ndesigned to cluster together instances of the same class even when there are\nsignificant variances in embedded features. Therefore, it makes segmentation\nnetworks better deal with unexpected illumination changes. A triplet loss is\nused in training to minimize redundancy in storing discriminative\nrepresentations of the memory module. The proposed memory module is general so\nthat it can be adopted in a variety of networks. We conduct experiments on the\nRobot Unstructured Ground Driving (RUGD) dataset and RELLIS dataset, which are\ncollected from off-road, unstructured natural environments. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed memory module improves the performance of\nexisting segmentation networks and contributes to capturing unclear objects\nover various off-road, unstructured natural scenes with equivalent\ncomputational cost and network parameters.

Ideally, an IR system would\nmodel relevance from a user-system dualism: the user's view and the system's\nview. User's view judges the relevance based on the activities of \"real users\"\nwhile the system's view focuses on the relevance signals from the system side,\ne.g., from the experts or algorithms, etc. Inspired by the user-system\nrelevance views and the success of pre-trained language models, in this paper\nwe propose a novel ranking framework called Pre-Rank that takes both user's\nview and system's view into consideration, under the pre-training and\nfine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, to model the user's view of relevance,\nPre-Rank pre-trains the initial query-document representations based on\nlarge-scale user activities data such as the click log. To model the system's\nview of relevance, Pre-Rank further fine-tunes the model on expert-labeled\nrelevance data. More importantly, the pre-trained representations, are\nfine-tuned together with handcrafted learning-to-rank features under a wide and\ndeep network architecture. In this way, Pre-Rank can model the relevance by\nincorporating the relevant knowledge and signals from both real search users\nand the IR experts. To verify the effectiveness of Pre-Rank, we showed two\nimplementations by using BERT and SetRank as the underlying ranking model,\nrespectively. Experimental results base on three publicly available benchmarks\nshowed that in both of the implementations, Pre-Rank can respectively\noutperform the underlying ranking models and achieved state-of-the-art\nperformances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 10:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}

So\nfar, random circuits of the 53-qubit Sycamore chip were verified up to 10\ncycles of gates only; the XEB fidelities of deeper circuits were approximated\nwith simplified circuits instead. Here we present a multi-tensor contraction\nalgorithm for speeding up the calculations of XEB for quantum circuits, where\nthe computational cost can be significantly reduced through some form of\nmemoization. As a demonstration, we analyzed the experimental data of the\n53-qubit Sycamore chip and obtained the exact values of the corresponding XEB\nfidelities up to 16 cycles using only moderate computing resources (few GPUs).\nIf the algorithm was implemented on the Summit supercomputer, we estimate that\nfor the supremacy (20 cycles) circuits, it would only cost 7.5 days, which is\nseveral orders of magnitude lower than previously estimated in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 11:15:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 00:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

Based\non the unique flat data of 47 narrow-band filters provided by JPAS-{\\it\nPathfinder}, we analyze the variations of small-scale flats as a function of\nwavelength. We find moderate variations (from about $1.0\\%$ at 390 nm to\n$0.3\\%$ at 890 nm) of small-scale flats among different filters, increasing\ntowards shorter wavelengths. Small-scale flats of two filters close in central\nwavelengths are strongly correlated.

In this\npaper, we propose four algorithmic improvements for a data-driven framework for\nfunctional synthesis: using a dependency-driven multi-classifier to learn\ncandidate function, extracting uniquely defined functions by interpolation,\nvariables retention, and using lexicographic MaxSAT to repair candidates. We\nimplement these improvements in the state-of-the-art framework, called Manthan.\nThe proposed framework is called Manthan2. Manthan2 shows significantly\nimproved runtime performance compared to Manthan. In an extensive experimental\nevaluation on 609 benchmarks, Manthan2 is able to synthesise a Boolean function\nvector for 509 instances compared to 356 instances solved by Manthan--- an\nincrement of 153 instances over the state-of-the-art. To put this into\nperspective, Manthan improved on the prior state-of-the-art by only 76\ninstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 13:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}

A mainstream of DA methods is to align the feature\ndistributions of the two domains. However, the majority of them focus on the\nentire image features where irrelevant semantic information, e.g., the messy\nbackground, is inevitably embedded. Enforcing feature alignments in such case\nwill negatively influence the correct matching of objects and consequently lead\nto the semantically negative transfer due to the confusion of irrelevant\nsemantics. To tackle this issue, we propose Semantic Concentration for Domain\nAdaptation (SCDA), which encourages the model to concentrate on the most\nprincipal features via the pair-wise adversarial alignment of prediction\ndistributions. Specifically, we train the classifier to class-wisely maximize\nthe prediction distribution divergence of each sample pair, which enables the\nmodel to find the region with large differences among the same class of\nsamples. Meanwhile, the feature extractor attempts to minimize that\ndiscrepancy, which suppresses the features of dissimilar regions among the same\nclass of samples and accentuates the features of principal parts. As a general\nmethod, SCDA can be easily integrated into various DA methods as a regularizer\nto further boost their performance. Extensive experiments on the cross-domain\nbenchmarks show the efficacy of SCDA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 13:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}

Through the case study,\nit is found that the proposed method can save the total operation cost of the\nEBTS compared with the deterministic EBTS operation optimization model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 13:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}

Hawking\nradiation appears thermal and eventually leads to the complete disappearance of\na black hole. However, black holes could be formed from a pure quantum state.\nThe transition from such an initial state to the final state of pure Hawking\nradiation cannot be described by unitary time evolution. In this paper, we\npresent an analysis in quantum gravity that shows how boundary conditions in\nthe future prevent a loss of quantum mechanical information from the spacetime.\nIn classical physics, the future boundary of the spacetime in the black hole\ninterior is a singularity. Realistic gravitational collapse results in a BKL\ntype of approach to the singularity. But, solving the Wheeler-DeWitt equation\nreveals that the singularity does not form and can be replaced by specifying a\nfinal state density matrix.

Specifically, the various\nnodal superconducting ground states, dubbed as the topological Dirac\nsuperconductors, are featured by Dirac nodes in the bulk and Majorana arcs on\nthe surface; among the full-gap states, there exist a mirror-symmetry-protected\nsecond-order topological superconductor state favoring helical Majorana hinge\ncones, and different first-order topological superconductor states supporting 4\nsurface Majorana cones. The experimental verification of the different kinds of\nsuperconducting ground states is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 14:43:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2022 15:13:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

However, most of these studies only focus on very\nlocalized parameters such as lumbar spine flexion, while evaluations of\nwhole-body lifting strategies are largely lacking. For this reason, a novel\nindex, the Stoop-Squat-Index, was developed, which describes the proportion\nbetween trunk forward lean and lower extremity joint flexion, with possible\nvalues ranging from 0 (full squat lifting) to 100 (full stoop lifting). To\nenable the interpretation of the index in a real-life setting, normative values\nwere established using motion capture data from 30 healthy pain-free\nindividuals that were collected in the context of a previous study. The results\nshowed mean index values of lower than 30 and higher than 90 for the most\nrelevant phases of the squat and stoop movements, respectively, with mean index\nvalues differing significantly from each other for the full duration of the\nlifting phases. The main advantages of the index are that it is simple to\ncalculate and can not only be derived from motion capture data but also from\nconventional video recordings, which enables large-scale in-field measurements\nwith relatively low expenditure. When used in combination with lumbar spine\nflexion measurements, the index can contribute important information, which is\nnecessary for comprehensively evaluating whole-body lifting strategies and to\nshed more light on the debate over the connection between lifting posture and\nback complaints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 15:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

Response Surface Modeling and\nReduced-Order Modeling are commonly used to eliminate the overhead due to\nComputational Fluid Dynamics, leading to faster iterations. However, a primary\ndrawback of these models is that they can work only on the parametrized\ngeometric features they were trained with. This study evaluates if deep\nlearning models can predict the drag coefficient for an arbitrary input\ngeometry without explicit parameterization. We use two similar data sets based\non the publicly available DrivAer geometry for training. We use a modified\nU-Net architecture that uses Signed Distance Fields to represent the input\ngeometries. Our models outperform the existing models by at least 11% in\nprediction accuracy for the drag coefficient. We achieved this improvement by\ncombining multiple data sets that were created using different\nparameterizations, which is not possible with the methods currently used. We\nhave also shown that it is possible to predict velocity fields and drag\ncoefficient concurrently and that simple data augmentation methods can improve\nthe results. In addition, we have performed an occlusion sensitivity study on\nour models to understand what information is used to make predictions. From the\nocclusion sensitivity study, we showed that the models were able to identify\nthe geometric features and have discovered that the model has learned to\nexploit the global information present in the SDF. In contrast to the currently\noperational method, where design changes are restricted to the initially\ndefined parameters, this study brings surrogate models one step closer to the\nlong-term goal of having a model that can be used for approximate aerodynamic\nevaluation of unseen, arbitrary vehicle shapes, thereby providing complete\ndesign freedom to the vehicle stylists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 15:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

The random averaging\nexactly maps the operator dynamics of the Majorana model and the complex model\nto the imaginary time dynamics of an SU(2) spin and an SU(4) spin respectively,\nwhich become solvable in the large $N$ limit. Furthermore, the symmetry\nstructure drastically reduces the size of the Hilbert space required to\ncalculate the OTOC from exponential to linear in $N$, providing full access to\nthe operator dynamics at all times for large finite $N$. In the case of the\ncomplex model with charge conservation, using this approach, we obtain the OTOC\nwithin each charge sector both numerically at finite $N$ and analytically in\nthe large $N$ limit.

However, current literature on rideshare has allowed only one-modal\ntrips and may be limited in the matching efficiency, especially when there is a\nlarge gap between the supply and demand of mobility. Therefore, the objectives\nof this paper are first to develop a multi-modal matching framework of shared\nmobility with public transportation to maximize the performance of a rideshare\nsystem, and second to evaluate the effect of the public transportation and of\nthe schedule flexibility on the matching efficiency. To fulfill the first\nobjective, a multi-modal matching framework is developed to allow rideshare\nwith both private and public vehicles with detailed design of detour, using\nGenetic Algorithm. Also for the second objective, the effects of public\ntransportation and schedule flexibility are evaluated with a simplified network\nof Sioux Falls. The results show that public transportation helps the match\nrate slightly at a low supply of private vehicle, but this must be evaluated\nfor practical implementation as different cities may bring different results.\nAlso, a larger schedule flexibility helps greatly in increasing match rate even\nat a lower supply level. As well, the planning subject of time schedule is\nbenefited more with larger schedule flexibility, in this paper the drivers, on\nthe matching efficiency. Moreover, a rideshare system with private vehicles\noutperforms a public transportation system, possibly due to the rigid route of\npublic transportation that takes no detour burden.
