The difficulty of\nfinding quality labels for problem instances holds back leveraging supervised\nlearning across combinatorial problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms\nhave recently been adopted to solve this challenge automatically. The\nunderlying principle of this approach is to deploy a graph neural network (GNN)\nfor encoding both the local information of the nodes and the graph-structured\ndata in order to capture the current state of the environment. Then, it is\nfollowed by the actor to learn the problem-specific heuristics on its own and\nmake an informed decision at each state for finally reaching a good solution.\nRecent studies on this subject mainly focus on a family of combinatorial\nproblems on the graph, such as the travel salesman problem, where the proposed\nmodel aims to find an ordering of vertices that optimizes a given objective\nfunction. We use the security-aware phone clone allocation in the cloud as a\nclassical quadratic assignment problem (QAP) to investigate whether or not deep\nRL-based model is generally applicable to solve other classes of such hard\nproblems.

While IV can recover consistent treatment effect estimates, they are\noften noisy. Building upon earlier work in biostatistics (Joffe and Brensinger,\n2003) and relating to an evolving literature in econometrics (including Abadie\net al., 2019; Huntington-Klein, 2020; Borusyak and Hull, 2020), we study how to\nimprove the efficiency of IV estimates by exploiting the predictable variation\nin the strength of the instrument. In the case where both the treatment and\ninstrument are binary and the instrument is independent of baseline covariates,\nwe study weighting each observation according to its estimated compliance (that\nis, its conditional probability of being affected by the instrument), which we\nmotivate from a (constrained) solution of the first-stage prediction problem\nimplicit to IV. The resulting estimator can leverage machine learning to\nestimate compliance as a function of baseline covariates. We derive the\nlarge-sample properties of a specific implementation of a weighted IV estimator\nin the potential outcomes and local average treatment effect (LATE) frameworks,\nand provide tools for inference that remain valid even when the weights are\nestimated nonparametrically. With both theoretical results and a simulation\nstudy, we demonstrate that compliance weighting meaningfully reduces the\nvariance of IV estimates when first-stage heterogeneity is present, and that\nthis improvement often outweighs any difference between the compliance-weighted\nand unweighted IV estimands.

A significant challenge impeding the large-scale use of these\nalloys in high-performance applications is the presence of\nmanufacturing-induced, spatially varying porosity defects. In order to\nunderstand the impacts of these defects on the macro-mechanical properties of\ncast alloys, multiscale simulations are often required. In this paper, we\nintroduce a computationally efficient reduced-order multiscale framework to\nsimulate the behavior of metallic components containing process-induced\nporosity under irreversible nonlinear deformations. In our approach, we start\nwith a data compression scheme that significantly reduces the number of unknown\nmacroscale and microscale variables by agglomerating close-by finite element\nnodes into a limited number of clusters. Then, we use deflation methods to\nproject these variables into a lower-dimensional space where the material\nelastoplastic behaviors are approximated. Finally, we solve for the unknown\nvariables and map them back to the original, high-dimensional space. We call\nour method deflated clustering analysis and by comparing it to direct numerical\nsimulations we demonstrate that it accurately captures macroscale deformations\nand microscopic effective responses. To illustrate the effect of microscale\npores on the macroscopic response of a cast component, we conduct multi-scale\nsimulations with spatially varying local heterogeneities that are modeled with\na microstructure characterization and reconstruction algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 2021 21:58:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 19:58:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 17:35:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 17:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

In this paper, we propose a view-based deep learning\nmodel called Hierarchical View Predictor (HVP) to learn 3D shape features from\nunordered views in an unsupervised manner. To mine highly discriminative\ninformation from unordered views, HVP performs a novel hierarchical view\nprediction over a view pair, and aggregates the knowledge learned from the\npredictions in all view pairs into a global feature. In a view pair, we pose\nhierarchical view prediction as the task of hierarchically predicting a set of\nimage patches in a current view from its complementary set of patches, and in\naddition, completing the current view and its opposite from any one of the two\nsets of patches. Hierarchical prediction, in patches to patches, patches to\nview and view to view, facilitates HVP to effectively learn the structure of 3D\nshapes from the correlation between patches in the same view and the\ncorrelation between a pair of complementary views. In addition, the employed\nimplicit aggregation over all view pairs enables HVP to learn global features\nfrom unordered views.

Specifically, a novel porosity\nsensitivity method is proposed, which integrates the merits of topological\nsensitivity and shape sensitivity. While topological sensitivity approximates\nthe first order change on the quantity of interest when an infinitesimally\nsmall spherical pore is inserted into a dense (no pore) structure, shape\nsensitivity estimates the subsequent change in the quantity when the small pore\nboundary is continuously perturbed to resemble the geometry reconstructed from\ntomography characterization data. In this method, an exterior problem is solved\nto explicitly formulate pore stress and strain fields as functions of shape\nscaling parameters. By neglecting higher order pore-to-pore interaction terms,\nthe influence of multiple pores can be estimated through a linear\napproximation. The proposed method is first studied on a benchmark example to\nestablish the impact of different pore parameters on the estimation accuracy.\nThe method is then applied onto case studies where the pore geometry is either\nfrom tomography reconstruction or computer-generated representations.\nEfficiency and accuracy of the method are finally demonstrated using a\ncommercial 3D application.

Current solutions leverage various differentiable\nrenderers to project the generated 3D point clouds onto a 2D image plane, and\ntrain deep neural networks using the per-pixel difference with 2D ground truth\nimages. However, these solutions are still struggling to fully recover fine\nstructures of 3D shapes, such as thin tubes or planes. To resolve this issue,\nwe propose an unsupervised approach for 3D point cloud generation with fine\nstructures. Specifically, we cast 3D point cloud learning as a 2D projection\nmatching problem. Rather than using entire 2D silhouette images as a regular\npixel supervision, we introduce structure adaptive sampling to randomly sample\n2D points within the silhouettes as an irregular point supervision, which\nalleviates the consistency issue of sampling from different view angles.

This is because oceanless planets are likely to operate under\nstagnant lid convection, and for such planets, dehydration stiffening of the\ndepleted lithospheric mantle would limit the rate of mantle degassing. In\ncontrast, a significant fraction of CO$_2$ would already be degassed during\nmagma ocean solidification. With a strong greenhouse effect, all surface water\nwould exist as vapor, and water oceans may be absent throughout planetary\nevolution. Volatile concentrations in the bulk silicate Earth are close to the\nthreshold amount for ocean formation, so if Venus shared similar\nconcentrations, small differences in solar radiation may explain the divergent\nevolutionary paths of Earth and Venus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 2021 23:38:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 17:36:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 07:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Therefore, we present a descriptor-based\nadversarial de-biasing approach called `Protected Attribute Suppression System\n(PASS)'.

Several deep convolutional neural networks\n(DCNNs) have been designed for this task, whose performance, however, tends to\nbe suppressed by their limited local receptive fields and insufficient global\nreasoning ability. In this paper, we propose a pixel-wise sparse graph\nreasoning (PSGR) module and insert it into a segmentation network to enhance\nthe modeling of long-range dependencies for COVID-19 infected region\nsegmentation in CT images. In the PSGR module, a graph is first constructed by\nprojecting each pixel on a node based on the features produced by the\nsegmentation backbone, and then converted into a sparsely-connected graph by\nkeeping only K strongest connections to each uncertain pixel. The long-range\ninformation reasoning is performed on the sparsely-connected graph to generate\nenhanced features. The advantages of this module are two-fold: (1) the\npixel-wise mapping strategy not only avoids imprecise pixel-to-node projections\nbut also preserves the inherent information of each pixel for global reasoning;\nand (2) the sparsely-connected graph construction results in effective\ninformation retrieval and reduction of the noise propagation.

Recently, variational\ninference-based anomaly analysis has attracted researchers' and developers'\nattention. It aims to model the defect-free distribution so that anomalies can\nbe classified as out-of-distribution samples. Nevertheless, there are two\ndisturbing factors that need us to prioritize: (i) the simplistic prior latent\ndistribution inducing limited expressive capability; (ii) the strong\nprobability distance notion results in collapsed features. In this paper, we\npropose a novel Patch-wise Wasserstein AutoEncoder (P-WAE) architecture to\nalleviate those challenges. In particular, a patch-wise variational inference\nmodel coupled with solving the jigsaw puzzle is designed, which is a simple yet\neffective way to increase the expressiveness of the latent manifold. This makes\nusing the model on high-dimensional practical data possible. In addition, we\nleverage a weaker measure, sliced-Wasserstein distance, to achieve the\nequilibrium between the reconstruction fidelity and generalized\nrepresentations.

Purpose: We present a comparative evaluation of\ndistortion correction methods that use the reversed gradient polarity technique\non spinal cord. We propose novel geometric metrics to measure the alignment of\nthe reconstructed diffusion model with the apparent centerline of the spinal\ncord. Subjects: 95 subjects, among which 29 healthy controls and 66 multiple\nsclerosis patients. Assessment: Geometric distortions were corrected using 4\nstate-of-the-art methods. We measured the alignment of the principal direction\nof diffusion with the apparent centerline of the spine after correction and the\ncorrelation with the reference anatomical image.

Results: As a result of\ndistortion correction, the diffusion directions are better aligned locally with\nthe centerline, in particular at both ends of the acquisition window. The\ncross-correlation with anatomical image is also improved by Hyperelastic\nSusceptibility Artefact Correction (HySCO) and block-matching.

Research has shown that\nthe receptive fields' spectrotemporal plasticity of some neurons in mammals'\nprimary auditory cortex and midbrain makes localization facilities improve\nrecognition performance. Over the past few years, much work has been done to\nlocalize time-frequency information in ASR systems, using the spatial or\ntemporal immutability properties of methods such as HMMs, TDNNs, CNNs, and\nLSTM-RNNs. However, most of these models have large parameter volumes and are\nchallenging to train. For this purpose, we have presented a structure called\nTime-Frequency Convolutional Maxout Neural Network (TFCMNN) in which parallel\ntime-domain and frequency-domain 1D-CMNNs are applied simultaneously and\nindependently to the spectrogram, and then their outputs are concatenated and\napplied jointly to a fully connected Maxout network for classification. To\nimprove the performance of this structure, we have used newly developed methods\nand models such as Dropout, maxout, and weight normalization. Two sets of\nexperiments were designed and implemented on the FARSDAT dataset to evaluate\nthe performance of this model compared to conventional 1D-CMNN models.\nAccording to the experimental results, the average recognition score of TFCMNN\nmodels is about 1.6% higher than the average of conventional 1D-CMNN models. In\naddition, the average training time of the TFCMNN models is about 17 hours\nlower than the average training time of traditional models. Therefore, as\nproven in other sources, time-frequency localization in ASR systems increases\nsystem accuracy and speeds up the training process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 05:46:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 08:32:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 06:56:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 03:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

We argue\nthat agent preferences should be specified stochastically rather than\ndeterministically. Reinforcement learning via inference with stochastic\npreferences naturally describes agent behaviors, does not require introducing\nrewards and exponential weighing of trajectories, and allows to reason about\nagents using the solid foundation of Bayesian statistics. Stochastic\nconditioning, a probabilistic programming paradigm for conditioning models on\ndistributions rather than values, is the formalism behind agents with\nprobabilistic preferences.

Instead, we draw inspiration from the two-way fixed effect\nmodel as a special case of the linear factor model, where a simple\ndifference-in-differences transformation identifies the effect. We show that\nanalogous, albeit more complex, transformations exist in the more general\nlinear factor model, providing a new means to identify the effect in that\nmodel. In fact many such transformations exist, called bridge functions, all\nidentifying the same causal effect estimand.

Nine out of the 13 candidates are EMPGs\nwith an oxygen abundance (O/H) less than ~10% solar value (O/H)_sun, and four\nsources are contaminants of moderately metal-rich galaxies or no emission-line\nobjects. Notably, two out of the nine EMPGs have extremely-low stellar masses\nand oxygen abundances of 5*10^4--7*10^5 M_sun and 2--3% (O/H)_sun,\nrespectively. With a sample of five EMPGs with (Fe/O) measurements, two (three)\nof which are taken from this study (the literature), we confirm that two EMPGs\nwith the lowest (O/H) ratios of ~2% (O/H)_sun show high (Fe/O) ratios of ~0.1,\nclose to the solar abundance ratio. Comparing galaxy chemical enrichment\nmodels, we find that the two EMPGs cannot be explained by a scenario of\nmetal-poor gas accretion/episodic star-formation history due to their low (N/O)\nratios. We conclude that the two EMPGs can be reproduced by an inclusion of\nbright hypernovae and/or hypothetical pair-instability supernovae (SNe)\npreferentially produced in a metal-poor environment.

Unfortunately, the issues of fair comparisons and efficient\nevaluations have hindered the development of ENAS. The current benchmark\narchitecture datasets designed for fair comparisons only provide the datasets,\nnot the ENAS algorithms or the platform to run the algorithms. The existing\nefficient evaluation methods are either not suitable for the population-based\nENAS algorithm or are too complex to use. This paper develops a platform named\nBenchENAS to address these issues.

To achieve efficient evaluation in a common lab environment,\nBenchENAS designs a parallel component and a cache component with high\nmaintainability. Furthermore, BenchENAS is easy to install and highly\nconfigurable and modular, which brings benefits in good usability and easy\nextensibility. The paper conducts efficient comparison experiments on eight\nENAS algorithms with high GPU utilization on this platform.

One such\nvariable is convective blueshift varying temporally, spatially, and between\nspectral lines. We develop a new approach for measuring convective blueshift\nand determine the strength of convective blueshift for 810 stars observed by\nthe HARPS spectrograph, spanning spectral types late-F, G, K, and early-M. We\nderive a model for infering blueshift velocity for lines of any depth in\nlater-type stars of any effective temperature. Using a custom list of spectral\nlines, covering a wide range of absorption depths, we create a model for the\nline-core shift as a function of line depth, commonly known as the third\nsignature of granulation. We utilize an extremely-high-resolution solar\nspectrum (R$\\sim$1$\\,$000$\\,$000) to empirically account for the nonlinear\nnature of the third signature. The solar third signature is then scaled to all\n810 stars. Through this we obtain a measure of the convective blueshift\nrelative to the Sun as a function of stellar effective temperature.

However, these\napproaches neglect that the appearance of rain is often accompanied by low\nlight conditions, which will further degrade the image quality. Therefore, it\nis very indispensable to jointly remove the rain and enhance the light for\nreal-world rain image restoration. In this paper, we aim to address this\nproblem from two aspects. First, we proposed a novel entangled network, namely\nEMNet, which can remove the rain and enhance illumination in one go.\nSpecifically, two encoder-decoder networks interact complementary information\nthrough entanglement structure, and parallel rain removal and illumination\nenhancement. Considering that the encoder-decoder structure is unreliable in\npreserving spatial details, we employ a detail recovery network to restore the\ndesired fine texture. Second, we present a new synthetic dataset, namely\nDarkRain, to boost the development of rain image restoration algorithms in\npractical scenarios. DarkRain not only contains different degrees of rain, but\nalso considers different lighting conditions, and more realistically simulates\nthe rainfall in the real world. EMNet is extensively evaluated on the proposed\nbenchmark and achieves state-of-the-art results. In addition, after a simple\ntransformation, our method outshines existing methods in both rain removal and\nlow-light image enhancement.

However, the origin and implications of this\nuniversality are unclear. Here, assuming contractility and adhesion are crucial\nfor cell shape, characterized via aspect ratio (AR), we develop a mean-field\nanalytical theory for shape variability. We find that a single parameter,\n$\\alpha$, containing all the system-specific details, describes the probability\ndistribution function (PDF) of AR; this leads to a universal relation between\nthe standard deviation and the average of AR. The PDF for the scaled AR is not\nstrictly but almost universal. The functional form is not related to jamming,\ncontrary to common beliefs, but a consequence of a mathematical property. In\naddition, we obtain the scaled area distribution, described by the parameter\n$\\mu$. We show that $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ together can distinguish the effects of\nchanging physical conditions, such as maturation, on different system\nproperties. The theory is verified in simulations of two distinct models of\nepithelial monolayers and agrees well with existing experiments. We demonstrate\nthat in a confluent monolayer, average shape determines both the shape\nvariability and dynamics. Our results imply the cell shape variability is\ninevitable, where a single parameter describes both statics and dynamics and\nprovides a framework to analyze and compare diverse epithelial systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 09:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

We describe the\nacceleration of particles over the AR within the radiation fields (direct\nsolar, reflected (scattered) solar, and thermal radiation) in addition to the\nasteroid's rotation and gravitational field. Mie theory is used because the\nparticles of interest have sizes comparable to thermal wavelengths (~1-100\n{\\mu}m), and thus the geometric approximation is not applicable.

Particularly, unsupervised deep hashing is supported by powerful\ndeep neural networks and has the desirable advantage of label independence. It\nis a promising technique for scalable image retrieval. However, deep models\nintroduce a large number of parameters, which is hard to optimize due to the\nlack of explicit semantic labels and brings considerable training cost. As a\nresult, the retrieval accuracy and training efficiency of existing unsupervised\ndeep hashing are still limited. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we\npropose a simple and efficient \\emph{Lightweight Augmented Graph Network\nHashing} (LAGNH) method with a two-pronged strategy. For one thing, we extract\nthe inner structure of the image as the auxiliary semantics to enhance the\nsemantic supervision of the unsupervised hash learning process. For another, we\ndesign a lightweight network structure with the assistance of the auxiliary\nsemantics, which greatly reduces the number of network parameters that needs to\nbe optimized and thus greatly accelerates the training process. Specifically,\nwe design a cross-modal attention module based on the auxiliary semantic\ninformation to adaptively mitigate the adverse effects in the deep image\nfeatures. Besides, the hash codes are learned by multi-layer message passing\nwithin an adversarial regularized graph convolutional network. Simultaneously,\nthe semantic representation capability of hash codes is further enhanced by\nreconstructing the similarity graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 10:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

We measure the intrinsic alignments\nof luminous red galaxies detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey around a\nsample of voids constructed from those same tracers and with radii in the\nranges: $[20-30; 30-40; 40-50]$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc and in the redshift range\n$z=0.4-0.8$. We present fits to the measurements based on a linear model at\nlarge scales, and on a new model based on the void density profile inside the\nvoid and in its neighbourhood. We constrain the free scaling amplitude of our\nmodel at small scales, finding no significant alignment at $1\\sigma$ for either\nsample. We observe a deviation from the null hypothesis, at large scales, of\n2$\\sigma$ for voids with radii between 20 and 30 $h^{-1}$ Mpc, and 1.5 $\\sigma$\nfor voids with radii between 30 and 40 $h^{-1}$ Mpc and constrain the amplitude\nof the model on these scales. We find no significant deviation at 1$\\sigma$ for\nlarger voids. Our work is a first attempt at detecting intrinsic alignments of\ngalaxy shapes around voids and provides a useful framework for their mitigation\nin future void lensing studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 10:23:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 16:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}

For such problems, many observations are usually gathered by\nmultiple sources, which form the right-hand-sides of the PDE constraint.\nSolving the inverse problem with such massive data sets is computationally\ndemanding, in particular when dealing with large number of model parameters.\nThis paper proposes a novel randomized source sketching method for the\nefficient resolution of multisource PDE constrained optimization problems. We\nfirst formulate the different source-encoding strategies used in seismic\nimaging into a unified framework based on a randomized sketching. To this end,\nthe source dimension of the problem is projected in a smaller domain by a\nsuitably defined projection matrix that gathers the physical sources in\nsuper-sources through a weighted summation. This reduction in the number of\nphysical sources decreases significantly the number of PDE solves while\nsuitable sparsity-promoting regularization can efficiently mitigate the\nfootprint of the cross-talk noise to maintain the convergence speed of the\nalgorithm. We implement the randomized sketching method in an extended\nsearch-space formulation of frequency-domain FWI, which relies on the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Numerical examples carried\nout with a series of well documented 2D benchmarks demonstrate that the\nrandomized sketching algorithm reduces the cost of large-scale problems by at\nleast one order of magnitude compared to the original deterministic algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 11:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

We highlight two key mechanisms responsible for producing the\nsharp-edged dip: i) the reduction of intensity observed in rays that intersect\nthe unstable-photon region, and thus the perfectly absorbing event horizon,\nversus rays that do not (blocking), and ii) the increase of intensity observed\nin rays that travel along extended, horizon-circling paths near the boundary of\nthe unstable-photon region (path-lengthening).

Consequentially, the black-hole shadow is a robust and fairly\nmodel-independent observable for accreting black holes that are in the deep\nsub-Eddington regime, such as low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 12:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Personalized travel planning has many real applications and is\naffected by various factors, such as transportation type, intention destination\nestimation, budget limit and crowdness prediction. Among those factors, users'\nintention destination prediction is an essential task in online travel\nplatforms. The reason is that, the user may be interested in the travel plan\nonly when the plan matches his real intention destination. Therefore, in this\npaper, we focus on predicting users' intention destinations in online travel\nplatforms. In detail, we act as online travel platforms (such as Fliggy and\nAirbnb) to recommend travel plans for users, and the plan consists of various\nvacation items including hotel package, scenic packages and so on. Predicting\nthe actual intention destination in travel planning is challenging. Firstly,\nusers' intention destination is highly related to their travel status (e.g.,\nplanning for a trip or finishing a trip). Secondly, users' actions (e.g.\nclicking, searching) over different product types (e.g. train tickets, visa\napplication) have different indications in destination prediction. Thirdly,\nusers may mostly visit the travel platforms just before public holidays, and\nthus user behaviors in online travel platforms are more sparse, low-frequency\nand long-period. Therefore, we propose a Deep Multi-Sequences fused neural\nNetworks (DMSN) to predict intention destinations from fused multi-behavior\nsequences. Real datasets are used to evaluate the performance of our proposed\nDMSN models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed DMSN models can\nachieve high intention destination prediction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 12:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

I\nshow how condensation of primordial gravitational waves, which are generared at\nthe very early eras immediately after the big bang, can lead to inflation of\nthe so called running vacuum model (RVM) type, without external inflatons. The\nrole of the slow-roll field is played by the KR axion, but it does not drive\ninflation. The non-linearities in the anomaly terms do. Chiral fermionic matter\nexcitations appear at the end of this RVM inflation, as a result of the decay\nof the RVM vacuum, and are held responsible for the cancellation of the\nprimordial gravitational anomalies. Chiral anomalies, however, survive in the\npost-inflationary epochs, and can lead to the generation of a non perturbative\nmass for the KR axion, which could thus play the role of dark matter in this\nUniverse. As a result of the condensed gravitational anomaly, there is a\nLorentz-invariance violating KR axion background, which remains undiluted\nduring the RVM inflation, and can lead to baryogenesis through leptogenesis in\nthe radiation era, in models with sterile right-handed neutrinos.

It\nhas versatile application potentials such as in the area of human-robot\ninteractions, human action tracking for airport security systems, autonomous\ncar navigation, computer gaming to name a few. However, predicting human motion\nbased on past actions is an extremely challenging task due to the difficulties\nin detecting spatial and temporal features correctly. To detect temporal\nfeatures in human poses, we propose an Inception Residual Block(IRB), due to\nits inherent capability of processing multiple kernels to capture salient\nfeatures. Here, we propose to use multiple 1-D Convolution Neural Network (CNN)\nwith different kernel sizes and input sequence lengths and concatenate them to\nget proper embedding. As kernels strides over different receptive fields, they\ndetect smaller and bigger salient features at multiple temporal scales.

Total solar irradiance allows for the use of the Sun as a star for\nstudying observations of stellar light curves from recent space missions. Aims.\nWe aim to study how the mid-range periodicity observed in solar activity\nindices influences the total solar irradiance. Methods. We studied periodic\nvariations of total solar irradiance based on SATIRE-S and SOHO/VIRGO data\nduring solar cycles 23-24 on timescales of Rieger-type periodicity. Then we\ncompared the power spectrum of oscillations in the total solar irradiance to\nthose of sunspot and faculae data to determine their contributions. Results.\nWavelet analyses of TSI data reveal strong peaks at 180 days and 115 days in\ncycle 23, while cycle 24 showed periods of 170 days and 145 days. There are\nseveral periods in the sunspot and faculae data that are not seen in total\nsolar irradiance as they probably cancel each other out through simultaneous\nbrightening (in faculae) and darkening (in sunspots). Rieger-type periodicity\nis probably caused by magneto-Rossby waves in the internal dynamo layer, where\nthe solar cyclic magnetic field is generated. Therefore, the observed periods\nin the total solar irradiance and the wave dispersion relation allow us to\nestimate the dynamo magnetic field strength as 10-15 kG. Conclusions. Total\nsolar irradiance can be used to estimate the magnetic field strength in the\ndynamo layer. This tool can be of importance in estimating the dynamo magnetic\nfield strength of solar-like stars using light curves obtained by space\nmissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 12:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

Here,\nwe report an experimental observation of such population dynamics. We\ndemonstrate that the slower mutants win not only when the two types are\nintermixed at the front but also when they are spatially segregated into\nsectors. The latter was thought to be impossible because previous studies\nfocused exclusively on the global competitions mediated by expansion velocities\nbut overlooked the local competitions at sector boundaries. We developed a\ntheory of sector geometry that accounts for both local and global competitions\nand describes all possible sector shapes. In particular, the theory predicted\nthat a slower, but more competitive, mutant forms a dented V-shaped sector as\nit takes over the expansion front.

In addition, as the interaction between users and items\nincreases and the relationship between items becomes more complicated, the\nembedding method proposed for sequence data is no longer suitable for graphic\ndata in the current real environment.

To this end, we create\na new multi-modal dataset based on text and table datasets from related work\nand compare the retrieval performance of different encoding schemata. We find\nthat dense vector embeddings of transformer models outperform sparse embeddings\non four out of six evaluation datasets. Comparing different dense embedding\nmodels, tri-encoders with one encoder for each question, text and table,\nincrease retrieval performance compared to bi-encoders with one encoder for the\nquestion and one for both text and tables. We release the newly created\nmulti-modal dataset to the community so that it can be used for training and\nevaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 14:02:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 10:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

The\nmain characteristic of this new theoretical framework is the dominance of a\npower-law $f(R)$ gravity term $\\sim R^n$, with $1<n<2$, compared to the\nEinstein-Hilbert term $\\sim R$. In effect, the field equations are controlled\nby the $R^n$ term in contrast to the Einstein-Hilbert canonical scalar theory.\nWe extract the slow-roll field equations and we calculate the slow-roll indices\nof the resulting theory which acquire quite elegant final form, when the\nslow-roll conditions hold true.

Two prior protocols, Wi-SUN Field Area Network\n(Wi-SUN FAN) and IETF 6TiSCH standards, are popularly used that are\nrespectively based on asynchronous Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision\nAvoidance (CSMA/CA) and IEEE 802.15.4 Time Scheduled Channel Hopping (TSCH).\nHowever, the former one with CSMA/CA can be prone to the Hidden Node Problem\n(HNP) that leads to a degradation of reliability, while the latter one with\nTSCH avoids HNP by using synchronously scheduling but requires massive control\nsignalling that degrades the upper-bound of throughput. Accordingly, this paper\ntackles the challenge of how to improve the upper-bound of throughput without\nloss of reliability. To do so, we first present an in-depth evaluation of\nreliability and throughput between the two existing standards via system-level\nsimulation.

This SCG method\neliminates around 99\\% HNP in CSMA/CA, thus greatly improves its reliability\nwith maintaining the relatively high upper-bound of throughput.

However, the encoding density (i.e.,\nhow many binary bits can be encoded into one nucleotide) and error handling are\ntwo major factors intertwined in DNA storage. Considering encoding density,\ntheoretically, one nucleotide can encode two binary bits (upper bound).\nHowever, due to biochemical constraints and other necessary information\nassociated with payload, the encoding densities of various DNA storage systems\nare much less than this upper bound. Additionally, all existing studies of DNA\nencoding schemes are based on static analysis and really lack the awareness of\ndynamically changed digital patterns. Therefore, the gap between the static\nencoding and dynamic binary patterns prevents achieving a higher encoding\ndensity for DNA storage systems.\n  In this paper, we propose a new Digital Pattern-Aware DNA storage system,\ncalled DP-DNA, which can efficiently store digital data in DNA storage with\nhigh encoding density. DP-DNA maintains a set of encoding codes and uses a\ndigital pattern-aware code (DPAC) to analyze the patterns of a binary sequence\nfor a DNA strand and selects an appropriate code for encoding the binary\nsequence to achieve a high encoding density. An additional encoding field is\nadded to the DNA encoding format, which can distinguish the encoding scheme\nused for those DNA strands, and thus we can decode DNA data back to its\noriginal digital data. Moreover, to further improve the encoding density, a\nvariable-length scheme is proposed to increase the feasibility of the coding\nscheme with a high encoding density. Finally, the experimental results indicate\nthat the proposed DP-DNA achieves up to 103.5% higher encoding densities than\nprior work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 15:47:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 18:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

Although the parameter degeneracies inherent in FRB and in\nGW are rather different, we find that more than 10000 FRBs are demanded to\neffectively improve the constraints in the holographic dark energy models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 15:49:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 10:57:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 15:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}

For example, if you want to\nwake up at 6 am because you have an upcoming trip, you have to set the alarm\nmanually. Besides, these systems do not recommend or remind what else to carry,\nsuch as carrying an umbrella during a likely rain. The present work proposes a\nsystem that takes an email as input and returns a recommendation-cumreminder\nlist. As a first step, we parse the emails, recognize the entities using named\nentity recognition (NER). In the second step, information retrieval over the\nweb is done to identify nearby places, climatic conditions, etc. Imperative\nsentences from the reviews of all places are extracted and passed to the object\nextraction module. The main challenge lies in extracting the objects (items) of\ninterest from the review. To solve it, a modified Machine Reading\nComprehension-NER (MRC-NER) model is trained to tag objects of interest by\nformulating annotation rules as a query. The objects so found are recommended\nto the user one day in advance. The final reminder list of objects is pruned by\nour proposed model for tracking objects kept during the \"packing activity.\"\nEventually, when the user leaves for the event/trip, an alert is sent\ncontaining the reminding list items. Our approach achieves superior performance\ncompared to several baselines by as much as 30% on recall and 10% on precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 06:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-16"}

This paper aims to contribute to this emerging\nresearch topic by proposing DisMultiHate, which is a novel framework that\nperformed the classification of multimodal hateful content. Specifically,\nDisMultiHate is designed to disentangle target entities in multimodal memes to\nimprove hateful content classification and explainability. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on two publicly available hateful and offensive memes datasets. Our\nexperiment results show that DisMultiHate is able to outperform\nstate-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal baselines in the hateful meme\nclassification task. Empirical case studies were also conducted to demonstrate\nDisMultiHate's ability to disentangle target entities in memes and ultimately\nshowcase DisMultiHate's explainability of the multimodal hateful content\nclassification task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 06:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-16"}

However, the UWB system still\nfaces several technical challenges in practice, one of which is\nNon-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) signal propagation. Several machine learning\napproaches have been applied for the NLoS component identification. However,\nwhen the data contains a very small amount of NLoS components it becomes very\ndifficult for existing algorithms to classify them.

People often post their life\nexperiences, local news, and events on social media to inform others. Many\nrescue agencies monitor this type of data regularly to identify disasters and\nreduce the risk of lives. However, it is impossible for humans to manually\ncheck the mass amount of data and identify disasters in real-time. For this\npurpose, many research works have been proposed to present words in\nmachine-understandable representations and apply machine learning methods on\nthe word representations to identify the sentiment of a text. The previous\nresearch methods provide a single representation or embedding of a word from a\ngiven document. However, the recent advanced contextual embedding method (BERT)\nconstructs different vectors for the same word in different contexts. BERT\nembeddings have been successfully used in different natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks, yet there is no concrete analysis of how these representations are\nhelpful in disaster-type tweet analysis. In this research work, we explore the\nefficacy of BERT embeddings on predicting disaster from Twitter data and\ncompare these to traditional context-free word embedding methods (GloVe,\nSkip-gram, and FastText). We use both traditional machine learning methods and\ndeep learning methods for this purpose. We provide both quantitative and\nqualitative results for this study. The results show that the BERT embeddings\nhave the best results in disaster prediction task than the traditional word\nembeddings.
