Taking the 2021 TAAC competition as an\nopportunity, we developed a multimodal system to improve the ability of\nstructured analysis of advertising video content. In our framework, we break\ndown the video structuring analysis problem into two tasks, i.e., scene\nsegmentation and multi-modal tagging. In scene segmentation, we build upon a\ntemporal convolution module for temporal modeling to predict whether adjacent\nframes belong to the same scene. In multi-modal tagging, we first compute\nclip-level visual features by aggregating frame-level features with\nNeXt-SoftDBoF. The visual features are further complemented with textual\nfeatures that are derived using a global-local attention mechanism to extract\nuseful information from OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and ASR (Audio\nSpeech Recognition) outputs. Our solution achieved a score of 0.2470 measured\nin consideration of localization and prediction accuracy, ranking fourth in the\n2021 TAAC final leaderboard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 16:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

First, searching feasible\ntrajectories is not trivial because the goal behind the gap is difficult to\nreach. Second, the error tolerance after Sim2Real is low due to the relatively\nhigh speed in comparison to the gap's narrow dimensions. This problem is\naggravated by the intractability of collecting real-world data due to the risk\nof collision damage. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement\nlearning framework that solves this task successfully by addressing both\nproblems. To search for dynamically feasible flight trajectories, we use\ncurriculum learning to guide the agent towards the sparse reward behind the\nobstacle. To tackle the Sim2Real problem, we propose a Sim2Real framework that\ncan transfer control commands to a real quadrotor without using real flight\ndata. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first work that\naccomplishes successful gap traversing task purely using deep reinforcement\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 16:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

However, those approaches neither consider multiple types of\ninter-sentential relationships (e.g., semantic similarity & natural\nconnection), nor model intra-sentential relationships (e.g, semantic &\nsyntactic relationship among words). To address these problems, we propose a\nnovel Multiplex Graph Convolutional Network (Multi-GCN) to jointly model\ndifferent types of relationships among sentences and words.

Almost all methods in the\nliterature solve for the rotations separately, through rotation averaging\nprocess, and use them for solving the positions.

The objective is to maximize the expected\nsum of accepted values.\n  We analyze the performance of static threshold policies, which accept the\nfirst $k$ values exceeding a fixed threshold (or all such values, if fewer than\n$k$ exist). We show that an appropriate threshold guarantees $\\gamma_k = 1 -\ne^{-k}k^k/k!$ times the value of the offline optimal solution. Note that\n$\\gamma_1 = 1-1/e$, and by Stirling's approximation $\\gamma_k \\approx\n1-1/\\sqrt{2 \\pi k}$.

In this article, expanding on the work by Li et al.\n(2018), we generalize the single-component moist pseudoadiabat derivation in\nPierrehumbert (2010) to allow for multiple condensing components of arbitrary\ndiluteness and retained condensate fraction. The introduction of a freely\ntunable retained condensate fraction allows for a flexible, self-consistent\ntreatment of atmospheres with non-dilute condensable components. To test the\npseudoadiabat's capabilities for simulating a diverse range of climates, we\napply the formula to planetary atmospheres with compositions, surface\npressures, and temperatures representing important stages with condensable-rich\natmospheres in the evolution of terrestrial planets: a magma ocean planet in a\nrunaway greenhouse state; a post-impact, late veneer-analogue planet with a\ncomplex atmospheric composition; and an Archean Earth-like planet near the\nouter edge of the classical circumstellar habitable zone.

In particular, we propose a novel Lipschitz\nContinuity Guided Knowledge Distillation framework to faithfully distill\nknowledge by minimizing the distance between two neural networks' Lipschitz\nconstants, which enables teacher networks to better regularize student networks\nand improve the corresponding performance. We derive an explainable\napproximation algorithm with an explicit theoretical derivation to address the\nNP-hard problem of calculating the Lipschitz constant. Experimental results\nhave shown that our method outperforms other benchmarks over several knowledge\ndistillation tasks (e.g., classification, segmentation and object detection) on\nCIFAR-100, ImageNet, and PASCAL VOC datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 20:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

It automatically discovers and\ngroups neurons that detect the same concepts, and describes how such neuron\ngroups interact to form higher-level concepts and the subsequent predictions.\nNeuroCartography introduces two scalable summarization techniques: (1) neuron\nclustering groups neurons based on the semantic similarity of the concepts\ndetected by neurons (e.g., neurons detecting \"dog faces\" of different breeds\nare grouped); and (2) neuron embedding encodes the associations between related\nconcepts based on how often they co-occur (e.g., neurons detecting \"dog face\"\nand \"dog tail\" are placed closer in the embedding space).

Three major applications of\nmachine learning for predicting thermal properties are discussed. First,\nmachine learning is applied to solve the challenges in modeling phonon\ntransport of crystals with defects, in amorphous materials, and at high\ntemperatures. Machine learning is used to build high-fidelity interatomic\npotentials to bridge the gap between first-principles calculations and\nmolecular dynamics simulations. Second, machine learning can be used to study\nthe correlation between thermal conductivity and other properties for\nhigh-throughput materials screening. Finally, machine learning is a powerful\ntool for structural design to achieve target thermal conductance or thermal\nconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 01:13:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 03:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

To alleviate the\nabove discrepancy, we propose scheduled sampling methods based on decoding\nsteps, increasing the selection chance of predicted tokens with the growth of\ndecoding steps. Consequently, we can more realistically simulate the inference\nscene during training, thus better bridging the gap between training and\ninference. Moreover, we investigate scheduled sampling based on both training\nsteps and decoding steps for further improvements. Experimentally, our\napproaches significantly outperform the Transformer baseline and vanilla\nscheduled sampling on three large-scale WMT tasks. Additionally, our approaches\nalso generalize well to the text summarization task on two popular benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 02:41:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 06:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

As\nthe problem is more well-defined than general image style transfer tasks, thus\nit has received interest from both vision and machine learning communities.\nExisting approaches address this problem as a direct image-to-image translation\ntask. In this work, we innovate to explore the generation of font glyphs as 2D\ngraphic objects with the graph as an intermediate representation, so that more\nintrinsic graphic properties of font styles can be captured. Specifically, we\nformulate a cross-modality cycled image-to-image model structure with a graph\nconstructor between an image encoder and an image renderer. The novel graph\nconstructor maps a glyph's latent code to its graph representation that matches\nexpert knowledge, which is trained to help the translation task. Our model\ngenerates improved results than both image-to-image baseline and previous\nstate-of-the-art methods for glyph completion. Furthermore, the graph\nrepresentation output by our model also provides an intuitive interface for\nusers to do local editing and manipulation.

To achieve this, we\npropose Meta Representations for Agents (MRA) that explicitly models the\ngame-common and game-specific strategic knowledge. By representing the policy\nsets with multi-modal latent policies, the game-common strategic knowledge and\ndiverse strategic modes are discovered through an iterative optimization\nprocedure.

However, with the\nconventional passive architecture, IRSs can only adjust the phase of the\nincident signals limiting the achievable beamforming gain. To fully unleash the\npotential of IRSs, in this paper, we consider a more general IRS architecture,\ni.e., active IRSs, which can adapt the phase and amplify the magnitude of the\nreflected incident signal simultaneously with the support of an additional\npower source. To realize green communication in active IRS-assisted multiuser\nsystems, we jointly optimize the reflection matrix at the IRS and the\nbeamforming vector at the base station (BS) for the minimization of the BS\ntransmit power. The resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as an\noptimization problem taking into account the maximum power budget of the active\nIRS and the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the users.

We study the properties of the neutrino-antineutrino\nmode using the linear stability analysis and then perform a numerical\nsimulation to analyze the late-time properties of an oscillating neutrino gas\nwith V-A and (pseudo)scalar interactions. The latter analysis reveals three\nphases of a chaotic, `thermalized' late-time state of neutrinos: along with a\nlow-density phase with the SO(3) symmetry broken by V-A interactions and a\nsymmetric high-density phase, another, (pseudo)scalar-induced phase with a\nbroken rotational symmetry appears.

The driving policy should make safe\ndecisions to handle the dynamic traffic conditions and meet the requirements of\non-board computation. However, most of the current researches focuses on\nsimplified intersections considering only the surrounding vehicles and\nidealized traffic lights. This paper improves the integrated decision and\ncontrol framework and develops a learning-based algorithm to deal with complex\nintersections with mixed traffic flows, which can not only take account of\nrealistic characteristics of traffic lights, but also learn a safe policy under\ndifferent safety constraints. We first consider different velocity models for\ngreen and red lights in the training process and use a finite state machine to\nhandle different modes of light transformation.

The discreteness\nof network structure and the coupling effect between network structure and node\nfeatures bring great challenges to this extremely limited scenario. We first\npropose an optimization-based method to explore the performance upper bound of\nsingle node injection evasion attack. Experimental results show that 100%,\n98.60%, and 94.98% nodes on three public datasets are successfully attacked\neven when only injecting one node with one edge, confirming the feasibility of\nsingle node injection evasion attack. However, such an optimization-based\nmethod needs to be re-optimized for each attack, which is computationally\nunbearable. To solve the dilemma, we further propose a Generalizable Node\nInjection Attack model, namely G-NIA, to improve the attack efficiency while\nensuring the attack performance. Experiments are conducted across three\nwell-known GNNs. Our proposed G-NIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines and is 500 times faster than the optimization-based method when\ninferring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 08:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 09:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

The Datathon was designed to (1)\ndevelop operationalizable data-driven models to address COVID-19 health-policy\nchallenges and (2) build a community of researchers from academia, industry,\nand government and rebuild their trust in the government. Three specific\nchallenges were defined based on their relevance (significance, data\navailability, and potential to anonymize the data): immunization policies,\nspecial needs of the young population, and populations whose rate of compliance\nwith COVID-19 testing is low. The MoH team extracted diverse, reliable,\nup-to-date, and deidentified governmental datasets for each challenge. Secure\nremote-access research environments with relevant data science tools were set\non Amazon Web. The MoH screened the applicants and accepted around 80\nparticipants, teaming them to balance areas of expertise as well as represent\nall sectors of the community. One week following the event, anonymous surveys\nfor participants and mentors were distributed to assess overall usefulness and\npoints for improvement. The 48-hour Datathon and pre-event sessions included 18\nmultidisciplinary teams, mentored by 20 data scientists, 6 epidemiologists, 5\npresentation mentors, and 12 judges. The insights developed by the 3 winning\nteams are currently considered by the MoH as potential data science methods\nrelevant for national policies. The most positive results were increased trust\nin the MoH and greater readiness to work with the government on these or future\nprojects.

We studied the kinematics of the DIB carriers by tracing their\nmedian radial velocities in each field in the local standard of rest ($V_{\\rm\nLSR}$) and into the galactocentric frame ($V_{\\rm GC}$), respectively, as a\nfunction of the Galactic longitudes. Based on the median $V_{\\rm LSR}$ and two\nGalactic rotation models, we obtained valid kinematic distances of the DIB\ncarriers for nine GIBS and ten GES fields.

We demonstrate that the DIB carriers can\nbe located much closer to the observer than the background stars based on the\nfollowing arguments: (i) qualitatively, the carriers occupy in the Galactic\nlongitude$-$velocity diagram typical rotation velocities of stars in the local\nGalactic disk, while the background stars in the GIBS survey are mainly located\nin the Galactic bulge; (ii) quantitatively, all the derived kinematic distances\nof the DIB carriers are smaller than the median distances to background stars\nin each field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 09:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

In particular, we show that Deep Gaussian\nprocesses (DGPs) in the Bayesian representation learning limit have exactly\nmultivariate Gaussian posteriors, and the posterior covariances can be obtained\nby optimizing an interpretable objective combining a log-likelihood to improve\nperformance with a series of KL-divergences which keep the posteriors close to\nthe prior.

Secondly, considering that\nregion-free detectors recognize objects of different scales using multi-scale\nfeature maps, the DSEM encodes both multi-level semantic representations and\nmulti-instance spatial-contextual relationships across different domains.\nFinally, the DSEM is pluggable into different region-free detectors, ultimately\nachieving the densely semantic feature matching via adversarial learning.\nExtensive experiments have been conducted on PASCAL VOC, Clipart, Comic,\nWatercolor, and FoggyCityscape benchmarks, and their results well demonstrate\nthat the proposed approach not only improves the domain adaptability of\nregion-free detectors but also outperforms existing domain adaptive\nregion-based detectors under various domain shift settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 10:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

The size of edge-coloured graphs appearing in\npractice can be enormous both in the number of vertices and colours. The large\nnumber of vertices prevents us from analysing such graphs using explicit SCC\ndetection algorithms, such as Tarjan's, which motivates the use of a symbolic\napproach.

It is difficult to capture cells with strong\nlight. Therefore, the microscopic images of cells tend to have low image\nquality but these images are not good for semantic segmentation. Here we\npropose a method to translate an input image to the images that are easy to\nrecognize by deep learning. The proposed method consists of two deep neural\nnetworks. The first network is the usual training for semantic segmentation,\nand penultimate feature maps of the first network are used as filters to\ntranslate an input image to the images that emphasize each class. This is the\nautomatic preprocessing and translated cell images are easily classified. The\ninput cell image with low quality is translated by the feature maps in the\nfirst network, and the translated images are fed into the second network for\nsemantic segmentation. Since the outputs of the second network are multiple\nsegmentation results, we conduct the weighted ensemble of those segmentation\nimages. Two networks are trained by end-to-end manner, and we do not need to\nprepare images with high quality for the translation. We confirmed that our\nproposed method can translate cell images with low quality to the images that\nare easy to segment, and segmentation accuracy has improved using the weighted\nensemble learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 10:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

We explore the dynamics of shear start-up in\nmonotonic regions of the constitutive curves using two different methodologies:\n(i) the oft-used `frozen-time' linear stability (eigenvalue) analysis, wherein\nwe examine whether infinitesimal perturbations imposed on instantaneous stress\ncomponents (treated as quasi steady states) exhibit exponential growth, and\n(ii) the more mathematically rigorous fundamental-matrix approach that\ncharacterizes the transient growth via a numerical solution of the\ntime-dependent linearized governing equations, wherein the linearized\nperturbations co-evolve with the start-up shear flow. Our results reinforce the\nhitherto understated point that there is no universal connection between the\novershoot and subsequent decay of shear stress in the base state and the\nunstable eigenvalues obtained from the frozen-time stability analysis. It may\ntherefore be difficult to subsume the occurrence of transient shear banding\nduring shear start-up within the ambit of a single model-independent criterion.\nOur work also suggests that the strong transients during shear start-up seen in\nearlier work could well be a consequence of consideration of the limit of small\nsolvent viscosity in the absence of otherwise negligible terms such as fluid\ninertia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 11:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2022 16:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

For a fair and realistic comparison, we\ncarefully tune the hyper-parameters of all methods on each dataset.\nSurprisingly, we find that tuning learning rate, weight decay, and batch size\non a separate validation split results in a highly competitive baseline, which\noutperforms all but one specialized method and performs competitively to the\nremaining one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 11:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

However, current models are stuck in\ncommon predicates, e.g., \"on\" and \"at\", rather than informative ones, e.g.,\n\"standing on\" and \"looking at\", resulting in the loss of precise information\nand overall performance. If a model only uses \"stone on road\" rather than\n\"blocking\" to describe an image, it is easy to misunderstand the scene. We\nargue that this phenomenon is caused by two key imbalances between informative\npredicates and common ones, i.e., semantic space level imbalance and training\nsample level imbalance. To tackle this problem, we propose BA-SGG, a simple yet\neffective SGG framework based on balance adjustment but not the conventional\ndistribution fitting. It integrates two components: Semantic Adjustment (SA)\nand Balanced Predicate Learning (BPL), respectively for adjusting these\nimbalances.

It leads to the new need\nfor secure cloud-based video applications, where the video is encrypted for\nprivacy protection. Despite some methods that have been proposed for encrypted\nvideo moving object detection and tracking, none has robust performance against\ncomplex and dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose an efficient and robust\nprivacy-preserving motion detection and multiple object tracking scheme for\nencrypted surveillance video bitstreams. By analyzing the properties of the\nvideo codec and format-compliant encryption schemes, we propose a new\ncompressed-domain feature to capture motion information in complex surveillance\nscenarios. Based on this feature, we design an adaptive clustering algorithm\nfor moving object segmentation with an accuracy of 4x4 pixels. We then propose\na multiple object tracking scheme that uses Kalman filter estimation and\nadaptive measurement refinement. The proposed scheme does not require video\ndecryption or full decompression and has a very low computation load. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves the best detection\nand tracking performance compared with existing works in the encrypted and\ncompressed domain. Our scheme can be effectively used in complex surveillance\nscenarios with different challenges, such as camera movement/jitter, dynamic\nbackground, and shadows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 11:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

We solve this\npuzzle by showing that the light cluster abundancies in heavy ion reactions\nstay approximately constant from chemical freeze-out to kinetic freeze-out. To\nthis aim we develop an extensive network of coupled reaction rate equations\nincluding stable hadrons and hadronic resonances to describe the temporal\nevolution of the abundancies of light (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei in the late\nhadronic environment of an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision. It is\ndemonstrated that the chemical equilibration of the light nuclei occurs on a\nvery short timescale as a consequence of the strong production and dissociation\nprocesses. However, because of the partial chemical equilibrium of the stable\nhadrons, including the nucleon feeding from $\\Delta$ resonances, the\nabundancies of the light nuclei stay nearly constant during the evolution and\ncooling of the hadronic phase. This solves the longstanding contradiction\nbetween the thermal fits and the late stage coalescence (and the Big Bang\nnucleosynthesis) and explains why the observed light cluster yields are\ncompatible with both a high chemical production temperature and a late state\nemission as modelled by coalescence.

When the central supermassive compact object is a regular and\nhorizonless rotating boson star, a small body could pass through the center and\nfollow novel types of orbits.

The perturbative expression to the local\ncorrelations allows us to calculate an approximation to the single-particle\ndensity of states of low-energy excitations in the presence of small hopping,\nwhich characterizes unambiguously the distinction between the Mott-insulator\nand the Bose-glass phases. We obtain the phase diagram for bounded on-site\ndisorder. It is demonstrated that our analysis is capable of going beyond the\nmean-field theory results for the classification of these different ground\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 12:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

Indeed, it is known that gravitational instantons do break the\nU(1) Peccei-Quinn symmetry and induce the U(1)-violating operators, bringing\nback the strong CP problem to the axion models. This conclusion is, however,\ndependent highly on the structure of the theory around the Planck scale and,\ntherefore, may be evaded if we go beyond the minimal setup.

Horses\nexpress pain through their facial and body behavior, but may hide signs of pain\nfrom unfamiliar human observers. In addition, collecting visual data with\ndetailed annotation of horse behavior and pain state is both cumbersome and not\nscalable. Consequently, a pragmatic equine pain classification system would use\nvideo of the unobserved horse and weak labels. This paper proposes such a\nmethod for equine pain classification by using multi-view surveillance video\nfootage of unobserved horses with induced orthopaedic pain, with temporally\nsparse video level pain labels. To ensure that pain is learned from horse body\nlanguage alone, we first train a self-supervised generative model to\ndisentangle horse pose from its appearance and background before using the\ndisentangled horse pose latent representation for pain classification. To make\nbest use of the pain labels, we develop a novel loss that formulates pain\nclassification as a multi-instance learning problem. Our method achieves pain\nclassification accuracy better than human expert performance with 60% accuracy.\nThe learned latent horse pose representation is shown to be viewpoint\ncovariant, and disentangled from horse appearance. Qualitative analysis of pain\nclassified segments shows correspondence between the pain symptoms identified\nby our model, and equine pain scales used in veterinary practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 14:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

Most published\nresults on deep RL benchmarks compare point estimates of aggregate performance\nsuch as mean and median scores across tasks, ignoring the statistical\nuncertainty implied by the use of a finite number of training runs. Beginning\nwith the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), the shift towards\ncomputationally-demanding benchmarks has led to the practice of evaluating only\na small number of runs per task, exacerbating the statistical uncertainty in\npoint estimates. In this paper, we argue that reliable evaluation in the few\nrun deep RL regime cannot ignore the uncertainty in results without running the\nrisk of slowing down progress in the field. We illustrate this point using a\ncase study on the Atari 100k benchmark, where we find substantial discrepancies\nbetween conclusions drawn from point estimates alone versus a more thorough\nstatistical analysis. With the aim of increasing the field's confidence in\nreported results with a handful of runs, we advocate for reporting interval\nestimates of aggregate performance and propose performance profiles to account\nfor the variability in results, as well as present more robust and efficient\naggregate metrics, such as interquartile mean scores, to achieve small\nuncertainty in results. Using such statistical tools, we scrutinize performance\nevaluations of existing algorithms on other widely used RL benchmarks including\nthe ALE, Procgen, and the DeepMind Control Suite, again revealing discrepancies\nin prior comparisons.

Predictive flood monitoring of road network flooding status\nplays an essential role in community hazard mitigation, preparedness, and\nresponse activities. Existing studies related to the estimation of road\ninundations either lack observed road inundation data for model validations or\nfocus mainly on road inundation exposure assessment based on flood maps. This\nstudy addresses this limitation by using crowdsourced and fine-grained traffic\ndata as an indicator of road inundation, and topographic, hydrologic, and\ntemporal precipitation features as predictor variables. Two tree-based machine\nlearning models (random forest and AdaBoost) were then tested and trained for\npredicting road inundations in the contexts of 2017 Hurricane Harvey and 2019\nTropical Storm Imelda in Harris County, Texas. The findings from Hurricane\nHarvey indicate that precipitation is the most important feature for predicting\nroad inundation susceptibility, and that topographic features are more\nessential than hydrologic features for predicting road inundations in both\nstorm cases. The random forest and AdaBoost models had relatively high AUC\nscores (0.860 and 0.810 for Harvey respectively and 0.790 and 0.720 for Imelda\nrespectively) with the random forest model performing better in both cases.

By relying solely on local sensor data to\nsolve navigation tasks, we design an agent that assigns its own waypoints based\non intrinsic motivation. Our agent is able to learn goal-directed navigation\nbehavior even when facing only sparse feedback, i.e., delayed rewards when\nreaching the target. To address this challenge and the complexity of the\ncontinuous action space, we deploy a hierarchical agent structure in which the\nexploration is distributed across multiple layers. Within the hierarchical\nstructure, our agent self-assigns internal goals and learns to extract\nreasonable waypoints to reach the desired target position only based on local\nsensor data. In our experiments, we demonstrate the navigation capabilities of\nour agent in two environments and show that the hierarchical structure\nseriously improves the performance in terms of success rate and success\nweighted by path length in comparison to a flat structure.

Emphasis is\nplaced on scheduling the load shedding when there exist some priorities on the\nloads. First, a novel optimization problem is proposed to obtain the load\nshedding according to the predefined priority order. Then, a distributed\nalgorithm solving the optimization problem is presented. Finally, this paper\npresents how to integrate the proposed algorithms, i.e., the EDP and the load\nshedding, in a distributed manner. Simulation results are presented to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 14:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

Turbulence\nmodels based on MZ formalism have been scarce due to the limited knowledge of\nthe MZ operators, which originates from the difficulty in deriving MZ kernels\nfor complex nonlinear dynamical systems. In this work, we apply a recently\ndeveloped data-driven learning algorithm, which is based on Koopman's\ndescription of dynamical systems and Mori's linear projection operator, on a\nset of fully-resolved isotropic turbulence datasets to extract the Mori-Zwanzig\noperators.

A series of\nnumerical experiments are then constructed using the extracted kernels to\nevaluate the memory effects on predictions.

Many neurodegenerative diseases have been associated\nwith the disruption of transport. Therefore, it is essential to study how\nneurons control the transport process to localize materials to necessary\nlocations. Here, we develop a novel optimization model to simulate the traffic\nregulation mechanism of material transport in complex geometries of neurons.\nThe transport is controlled to avoid traffic jam of materials by minimizing a\npre-defined objective function. The optimization subjects to a set of partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) constraints that describe the material transport\nprocess based on a macroscopic molecular-motor-assisted transport model of\nintracellular particles. The proposed PDE-constrained optimization model is\nsolved in complex tree structures by using isogeometric analysis (IGA).\nDifferent simulation parameters are used to introduce traffic jams and study\nhow neurons handle the transport issue. Specifically, we successfully model and\nexplain the traffic jam caused by reduced number of microtubules (MTs) and MT\nswirls. In summary, our model effectively simulates the material transport\nprocess in healthy neurons and also explains the formation of a traffic jam in\nabnormal neurons. Our results demonstrate that both geometry and MT structure\nplay important roles in achieving an optimal transport process in neuron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 15:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

In federated learning, clients need to communicate their\nlocal model updates in each iteration of model learning.

Thus, the\ncommunication cost in federated learning can be quite heavy. In this paper, we\npropose a communication efficient federated learning method based on knowledge\ndistillation. Instead of directly communicating the large models between\nclients and server, we propose an adaptive mutual distillation framework to\nreciprocally learn a student and a teacher model on each client, where only the\nstudent model is shared by different clients and updated collaboratively to\nreduce the communication cost. Both the teacher and student on each client are\nlearned on its local data and the knowledge distilled from each other, where\ntheir distillation intensities are controlled by their prediction quality. To\nfurther reduce the communication cost, we propose a dynamic gradient\napproximation method based on singular value decomposition to approximate the\nexchanged gradients with dynamic precision. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets in different tasks show that our approach can effectively reduce the\ncommunication cost and achieve competitive results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 15:39:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 12:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

In contradistinction, amorphous materials in which a unique reference\nstate does not exist, nevertheless exhibits plastic events that act as\nscreening geometric charges with significant implications on the mechanical\nresponse. In a recent paper [Phys. Rev.

At low\ndensities the screening effect is reminiscent of the role of dipoles in\ndielectrics, in only renormalizing the elastic moduli. The effect of high\ndensity screening has no immediate electrostatic analog and is expected to\nchange qualitatively the mechanical response, as seen for example in the\ndisplacement field.

To\novercome this situation, we propose a component-based approach to create\npartial component models by machine learning (ML).

Roboticists are not, however, hardware engineers, and embedded\nexpertise is scarce among them. This white paper adopts a ROS 2\nroboticist-centric view for adaptive computing and proposes an architecture to\ninclude FPGAs as a first-class participant of the ROS 2 ecosystem. The\narchitecture proposed is platform- and technology-agnostic, and is easily\nportable.

In the local\nspace of the cavity, the electromagnetic field is expressed by Bessel\nfunctions. Although Bessel functions can form a complete set of orthogonal\nbasis, it is difficult to quantify them directly as fundamental wave functions.\nFortunately, with the Fourier expansion of Bessel functions, the local\nelectromagnetic field can be considered as the superposition of a series of\nplane waves. Therefore, with corresponding corrections of the cross section\nformula of the classical Compton scattering, the cross section of the linear or\nnonlinear microwave Compton scattering in the local space can be described\naccurately. As an important application of our results in astrophysics,\ncorresponding ground verification devices can be designed to perform\nexperimental verifications on the prediction of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ)\neffect of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

Choosing how and when to deploy those resources is, therefore, a\nfateful decision. Here, I analyze the priority for allocating resources to\nmitigate the risk of superintelligences.\n  Part I observes that a superintelligence unconnected to the outside world\n(de-efferented) carries no threat, and that any threat from a harmful\nsuperintelligence derives from the peripheral systems to which it is connected,\ne.g., nuclear weapons, biotechnology, etc. Because existentially-threatening\nperipheral systems already exist and are controlled by humans, the initial\neffects of a superintelligence would merely add to the existing human-derived\nrisk. This additive risk can be quantified and, with specific assumptions, is\nshown to decrease with the square of the number of humans having the capability\nto collapse civilization.\n  Part II proposes that biotechnology ranks high in risk among peripheral\nsystems because, according to all indications, many humans already have the\ntechnological capability to engineer harmful microbes having pandemic spread.\nProgress in biomedicine and computing will proliferate this threat. ``Savant''\nsoftware that is not generally superintelligent will underpin much of this\nprogress, thereby becoming the software responsible for the highest and most\nimminent existential risk -- ahead of hypothetical risk from\nsuperintelligences.\n  The analysis concludes that resources should be preferentially applied to\nmitigating the risk of peripheral systems and savant software. Concerns about\nsuperintelligence are at most secondary, and possibly superfluous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 01:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}
