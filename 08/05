A particular type of Counterfeit coin puzzle is known in the\nliterature as the \"Beam balance puzzle\". An abstract solution to it is provided\nby Iwama et.al as a modification of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, making\nuse of quantum parallelism and entanglement. Moreover, during this pandemic,\ngroup testing has proved to be an efficient algorithm to save time and cost of\ntesting specimens for the presence of infection. In this article, we propose a\n\"Binary Spring Balance\" (BSB) puzzle, to facilitate a unified picture of the\ncounterfeit coin problem and the testing for infection problem, as both aim to\nreduce the number of queries. We then showcase two solutions to the BSB\nproblem, one using bits and other using classical-qubits ('cebits\") for\nquerying. Both solutions are demonstrated using circuits. In this pursuit, we\ndevelop a modified optical implementation of Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm using\nonly polarizers (no need of beam splitters), which has surprisingly not yet\nbeen proposed earlier. Under the pretext of this demonstration we question why\nwe have not yet developed testing mechanisms inspired by Bernstein-Vazirani\nalgorithm for the pandemic, as they solve the problem in single query, they\nhave no issues related to prevalence of infection in the population, nor are\nthey plagued by the issue of dilution of samples due to pooling. The modified\nimplementation of Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm using polarizers can also be a\ncost-effective demonstration in an undergraduate lab.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 16:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

In this paper, we describe a psychology-informed approach\nto model and predict music relistening behavior that is inspired by studies in\nmusic psychology, which relate music preferences to human memory. We adopt a\nwell-established psychological theory of human cognition that models the\noperations of human memory, i.e., Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R).\nIn contrast to prior work, which uses only the base-level component of ACT-R,\nwe utilize five components of ACT-R, i.e., base-level, spreading, partial\nmatching, valuation, and noise, to investigate the effect of five factors on\nmusic relistening behavior: (i) recency and frequency of prior exposure to\ntracks, (ii) co-occurrence of tracks, (iii) the similarity between tracks, (iv)\nfamiliarity with tracks, and (v) randomness in behavior. On a dataset of 1.7\nmillion listening events from Last.fm, we evaluate the performance of our\napproach by sequentially predicting the next track(s) in user sessions.

To apply it to real-time monitoring, a system needs\nnot only to describe events accurately but also to produce the captions as soon\nas possible. Low-latency captioning is needed to realize such functionality,\nbut this research area for online video captioning has not been pursued yet.\nThis paper proposes a novel approach to optimize each caption's output timing\nbased on a trade-off between latency and caption quality. An audio-visual\nTrans-former is trained to generate ground-truth captions using only a small\nportion of all video frames, and to mimic outputs of a pre-trained Transformer\nto which all the frames are given.

The cause of such downflows, however, is still not fully clear and\nhas remained a matter of debate. We aim to understand the cause of such\ndownflows by studying the coronal and TR responses to the recently reported\nchromospheric downflowing rapid red shifted excursions (RREs), and their impact\non heating the solar atmosphere. We have used two sets of coordinated data from\nSST, IRIS, and SDO for analyzing the response of the downflowing RREs in the TR\nand corona. To provide theoretical support, we use an already existing 2.5D MHD\nsimulation of spicules performed with the Bifrost code. We find ample\noccurrences of downflowing RREs and show several examples of their\nspatio-temporal evolution, sampling multiple wavelength channels ranging from\nthe cooler chromospheric to hotter coronal channels. These downflowing features\nare thought to be likely associated with the returning components of the\npreviously heated spicular plasma. Furthermore, the TR Doppler shifts\nassociated with them are close to the average red shifts observed in this\nregion which further implies that these flows could (partly) be responsible for\nthe persistent downflows observed in the TR. We also propose two mechanisms (a\ntypical upflow followed by a downflow and downflows along a loop), from the\nperspective of numerical simulation, that could explain the ubiquitous\noccurrence of such downflows. A detailed comparison between the synthetic and\nobserved spectral characteristics, reveals a distinctive match, and further\nsuggests an impact on the heating of the solar atmosphere. We present evidence\nthat suggests that at least some of the downflowing RREs are the chromospheric\ncounterparts of the TR and lower coronal downflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 16:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

In\nthis evaluation, we explicitly state the update equations of the PP-EnKF,\ndiscuss the differences of this update equation compared to the update\nequations of similar EnKF methods, and perform an extensive performance\ncomparison. The performance of the PP-EnKF is tested and compared to the\nperformance of seven other EnKF methods in two model setups, a tracer setup and\na well setup.

Concretely, high-level features\nobtained from naive and prototypical contrastive learning are utilized to build\ndistribution graphs, guiding the process of low-level and mid-level feature\nlearning.

Its study continues to provide insights into quantum\nmaterials, uncovering new design principles for their discovery. However,\nunlike the Berry curvature, an intuitive understanding of the quantum metric is\nlacking. Here, we show that the quantum metric of Bloch electrons leads to a\nmomentum-space gravity. In particular, by extending the semiclassical\nformulation of electron dynamics to second order, we find that the resulting\nvelocity is modified by a geodesic term and becomes the momentum-space dual of\nthe Lorentz force in curved space. We calculate this geodesic response for\nmagic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and show that moir\\'e systems with flat\nbands are ideal candidates to observe this effect. Extending this analogy with\ngravity further, we find that the momentum-space dual of the Einstein field\nequations remains sourceless for pure states while for mixed states it acquires\na source term that depends on the von Neumann entropy, for small entropies. We\ncompare this stress-energy equation with the weak-field limit of general\nrelativity and conclude that the von Neumann entropy is the momentum-space dual\nof the gravitational potential. Consequently, the momentum-space geodesic\nequation for mixed states is modified by a term resembling an entropic force.\nOur results highlight connections between quantum geometry, momentum-space\ngravity and quantum information, prompting further exploration of this dual\ngravity in quantum materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2021 23:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

We\nconsider how the dynamical history of a progenitor cluster, as traced by the\nevolution of its stellar mass function, is reflected in the resultant stream.\nWe generate model streams by evolving star clusters with a range of initial\nhalf-mass relaxation times and dissolution times via direct N-body simulations.\nStellar streams that dissolve quickly show no variation in the stellar mass\nfunction along the stream. Variation is, however, observed along streams with\nprogenitor clusters that dissolve after several relaxation times. The mass\nfunction at the edges of a stream is approximately primordial as it is\npopulated by the first stars to escape the cluster before segregation occurs.\nMoving inwards the mass function steepens as the intermediate parts of the\nstream consist of mostly low-mass stars that escaped the cluster after some\nsegregation has occurred. The centre of the stream is then marked by a flatter\nmass function, as the region is dominated by high-mass stars that quickly\nsegregated to the progenitor cluster's centre and were the last stars to become\nunbound. We further find that the maximum slope of the mass function along the\nstream and the rate at which it decreases with distance from the dissolved\nprogenitor serve as proxies for the dynamical state reached by the progenitor\ncluster before dissolution; this may be able to be applied to observed streams\nwith near-future observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 20:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

It is believed that image-based navigation will increase the\naccess to reproducible, safe, and high-precision surgery as it may then be\nperformed at acceptable costs and effort. This is because image-based\ntechniques avoid the need of specialized equipment and seamlessly integrate\nwith contemporary workflows. Further, it is expected that image-based\nnavigation will play a major role in enabling mixed reality environments and\nautonomous, robotic workflows. A critical component of image guidance is 2D/3D\nregistration, a technique to estimate the spatial relationships between 3D\nstructures, e.g., volumetric imagery or tool models, and 2D images thereof,\nsuch as fluoroscopy or endoscopy. While image-based 2D/3D registration is a\nmature technique, its transition from the bench to the bedside has been\nrestrained by well-known challenges, including brittleness of the optimization\nobjective, hyperparameter selection, and initialization, difficulties around\ninconsistencies or multiple objects, and limited single-view performance. One\nreason these challenges persist today is that analytical solutions are likely\ninadequate considering the complexity, variability, and high-dimensionality of\ngeneric 2D/3D registration problems. The recent advent of machine\nlearning-based approaches to imaging problems that, rather than specifying the\ndesired functional mapping, approximate it using highly expressive parametric\nmodels holds promise for solving some of the notorious challenges in 2D/3D\nregistration. In this manuscript, we review the impact of machine learning on\n2D/3D registration to systematically summarize the recent advances made by\nintroduction of this novel technology.

The main advantage of the\nnew metric is that the key functions are considerably simplified, fully\nexplicit, and factorized. All four horizons are thus clearly identified, and\ndegenerate cases with extreme horizons can easily be discussed. Moreover, the\nnew metric depends only on six parameters with direct geometrical and physical\nmeaning, namely m, a, l, alpha, e, g which characterize mass, Kerr-like\nrotation, NUT parameter, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges of the\nblack hole, respectively. This general metric reduces directly to the familiar\nforms of either (possibly accelerating) Kerr-Newman, charged Taub-NUT solution,\nor (possibly rotating and charged) C-metric by simply setting the corresponding\nparameters to zero, without the need of any further transformations. In\naddition, it shows that the Plebanski-Demianski family does not involve\naccelerating black holes with just the NUT parameter, which were discovered by\nChng, Mann and Stelea in 2006. It also enables us to investigate various\nphysical properties, such as the character of singularities, horizons,\nergoregions, global conformal structure including the Penrose diagrams, cosmic\nstrings causing the acceleration of the black holes, their rotation,\npathological regions with closed timelike curves, or explicit thermodynamic\nproperties.

Previous advances in the material point method (MPM)\nled to a fast and simple, but potentially momentum violating, strategy for\nenforcing contact.

We propose a modified strategy which ensures\nconservation of both linear and angular momentum with a novel use of the affine\nparticle-in-cell (APIC) method. Two issues common to particle-in-cell based\nalgorithms for contact are also addressed: material bodies tend to stick at a\ngap which is proportional to the grid spacing; and material points tend to\nstick together permanently when located within the same grid cell, making\nmaterial rebound and friction challenging. We show that the use of APIC,\ncombined with a grid transfer and momentum update algorithm results in contact\nbeing enforced at essentially zero gap. For the second issue, we propose a\nnovel iterative scheme which allows particles interacting through the\nbackground grid to naturally separate after contact and enforce friction, while\nstill satisfying momentum conservation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 19:46:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

On the other hand, if we\nconsider any superposition of the same pair, with a nonzero amplitude for the\nentangled state of the pair, the output state may not always be entangled.\nMotivated by this fact, in this work, we study the superpositions of a pure\nentangled state and a pure product state, when the amplitudes corresponding to\nthe states appearing in any superposition are nonzero. We show, in particular,\nthat all such superpositions produce only entangled states if the initial\nentangled state has Schmidt rank three or higher. Again, superposing a pure\nentangled state and a product state cannot lead to product states only, in any\nbipartite quantum system. These lead us to define conditional and unconditional\ninseparabilities of superpositions. These concepts in turn are useful in\nquantum communication protocols. We find that conditional inseparability of\nsuperpositions help in identifying strategies for conclusive local\ndiscrimination of shared quantum ensembles.

One\napplication has been the classification or clustering of various wake\nstructures that emanate from bluff bodies such as cylinders or flapping foils,\ncreating a rich diversity of vortex formations specific to flow conditions,\ngeometry, and/or kinematics of the body. When utilizing oscillating foils to\nharvest energy from tidal or river flows, it is critical to understand the\nintricate and nonlinear relationship between flapping kinematics and the\ndownstream vortex wake structure for optimal siting and operation of arrays.\nThis paper develops a classification model to obtain groups of kinematics that\ncontain similar wake patterns within the energy harvesting regime. Data is\nobtained through simulations of 27 unique oscillating foil kinematics for a\ntotal of 13,650 samples of the wake vorticity field. Within these samples three\ngroups are visually labeled based on the relative angle of attack. A machine\nlearning approach combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) with long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) units is utilized to automatically classify the wakes\ninto the three groups. The average accuracy on five test data subsets is 80%\nwhen the three visually labeled groups are used for classification. After\nanalyzing the test subset with lowest accuracy, an update on the group division\nboundaries is proposed. With this update, the algorithm achieves an average\naccuracy of 90%, demonstrating that the three groups are able to discern\ndistinct wake structures within a range of energy harvesting kinematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 20:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

Robots operating in partially observable environments must infer\nlatent states from multiple sensory inputs using observation models that\ncapture the joint distribution between latent states and observations. This\ninference problem can be formulated as an objective over a graph that optimizes\nfor the most likely sequence of states using all previous measurements. Prior\nwork uses observation models that are either known a-priori or trained on\nsurrogate losses independent of the graph optimizer. In this paper, we propose\na method to directly optimize end-to-end tracking performance by learning\nobservation models with the graph optimizer in the loop. This direct approach\nmay appear, however, to require the inference algorithm to be fully\ndifferentiable, which many state-of-the-art graph optimizers are not. Our key\ninsight is to instead formulate the problem as that of energy-based learning.\nWe propose a novel approach, LEO, for learning observation models end-to-end\nwith graph optimizers that may be non-differentiable. LEO alternates between\nsampling trajectories from the graph posterior and updating the model to match\nthese samples to ground truth trajectories. We propose a way to generate such\nsamples efficiently using incremental Gauss-Newton solvers.

Since it was\nproposed, Bayesian optimization has quickly become a popular and promising\napproach for solving global optimization problems. However, the standard\nBayesian optimization algorithm is insufficient to solving the global optimal\nsolution when the model is high-dimensional. Hence, this paper presents a novel\nhigh dimensional Bayesian optimization algorithm by considering dimension\nreduction and different dimension fill-in strategies. Most existing literature\nabout Bayesian optimization algorithms did not discuss the sampling strategies\nto optimize the acquisition function. This study proposed a new sampling method\nbased on both the multi-armed bandit and random search methods while optimizing\nthe acquisition function. Besides, based on the time-dependent or\ndimension-dependent characteristics of the model, the proposed algorithm can\nreduce the dimension evenly. Then, five different dimension fill-in strategies\nwere discussed and compared in this study. Finally, to increase the final\naccuracy of the optimal solution, the proposed algorithm adds a local search\nbased on a series of Adam-based steps at the final stage. Our computational\nexperiments demonstrated that the proposed Bayesian optimization algorithm\ncould achieve reasonable solutions with excellent performances for high\ndimensional global optimization problems with a time-series optimal control\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 21:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

For most of the webs, Disperse nodes outnumber clusters, but\nnot every cluster has a Disperse node match (and sometimes $>1$ cluster matches\nto the same Disperse node). The clusters frequently lacking a matching Disperse\nnode have a different distribution of local shear trends and perhaps merger\nhistories.

This paper considers two major problems: how to learn\na diversified policy (instead of just one average policy) that can efficiently\nhandle different workpieces with minimum amount of training data, and how to\nhandle defects of workpieces during insertion. To address the problems, we\npropose tolerance-guided policy learning. To encourage transferability of the\nlearned policy to different workpieces, we add a task embedding to the policy's\ninput space using the insertion tolerance. Then we train the policy using\ngenerative adversarial imitation learning with reward shaping (RS-GAIL) on a\nvariety of representative situations. To encourage adaptability of the learned\npolicy to handle defects, we build a probabilistic inference model that can\noutput the best inserting pose based on failed insertions using the tolerance\nmodel. The best inserting pose is then used as a reference to the learned\npolicy. This proposed method is validated on a sequence of IC socket insertion\ntasks in simulation. The results show that 1) RS-GAIL can efficiently learn\noptimal policies under sparse rewards; 2) the tolerance embedding can enhance\nthe transferability of the learned policy; 3) the probabilistic inference makes\nthe policy robust to defects on the workpieces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 22:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

Running at a clock speed of 100MHz, BEANNA achieves a peak\nthroughput of 52.8 GigaOps/second when operating in high precision mode, and\n820 GigaOps/second when operating in binary mode. Evaluation of BEANNA was\nperformed by comparing a hybrid network with floating point outer layers and\nbinary hidden layers to a network with only floating point layers. The hybrid\nnetwork accelerated using BEANNA achieved a 194% throughput increase, a 68%\nmemory usage decrease, and a 66% energy consumption decrease per inference, all\nthis at the cost of a mere 0.23% classification accuracy decrease on the MNIST\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 23:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

However, vaccine hesitancy,\nfueled by exposure to social media misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines\nbecame a major hurdle. Therefore, it is essential to automatically detect where\nmisinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on social media is spread and what kind\nof misinformation is discussed, such that inoculation interventions can be\ndelivered at the right time and in the right place, in addition to\ninterventions designed to address vaccine hesitancy. This paper is addressing\nthe first step in tackling hesitancy against COVID-19 vaccines, namely the\nautomatic detection of known misinformation about the vaccines on Twitter, the\nsocial media platform that has the highest volume of conversations about\nCOVID-19 and its vaccines. We present CoVaxLies, a new dataset of tweets judged\nrelevant to several misinformation targets about COVID-19 vaccines on which a\nnovel method of detecting misinformation was developed. Our method organizes\nCoVaxLies in a Misinformation Knowledge Graph as it casts misinformation\ndetection as a graph link prediction problem. The misinformation detection\nmethod detailed in this paper takes advantage of the link scoring functions\nprovided by several knowledge embedding methods. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the superiority of this method when compared with\nclassification-based methods, widely used currently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 23:27:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 03:29:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 03:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

To provide insight into this unknown, we\ncreated a mathematical model that predicts the trajectory of human and zombie\npopulations during a zombie apocalypse. We parameterized our model according to\nthe demographics of the US, the zombie literature, and then conducted an\nevolutionary invasion analysis to determine conditions that permit the\nevolution of zombies. Our results indicate a zombie invasion is theoretically\npossible, provided there is a sufficiently large ratio of transmission rate to\nthe zombie death rate. While achieving this ratio is uncommon in nature, the\nexistence of zombie ant fungus illustrates it is possible and thereby suggests\nthat a zombie apocalypse among humans could occur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 23:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

The demand for on-demand ride services, such as\ntaxis and ridehailing has been specifically impacted, given both restrictions\nin service operations and user's concerns about virus transmission in shared\nvehicles. During the pandemic, demand for these modes have decreased by as much\nas 80%. This study examines intentions to use on-demand ride services in a\nperiod of drastic changes in lifestyles and daily routines coupled with\nunprecedented mobility reductions. Specifically, we examine the determinants\nfor the shift of intentions to use these on-demand modes of travel in the early\nstages of the pandemic. Using data from a survey disseminated in June 2020 to\n700 respondents from contiguous United States, ordinal regression modeling is\napplied to analyze the shift in consideration. The results indicate that\npolitical orientation and health-related experiences during the pandemic are\nsignificant sources of variation for individual changes in intentions to use\nridehailing. Additionally, characteristics such as age and income result in\nconsideration shifts that contradict the typical ridership profiles found in\nthe ridehailing literature. Specifically, on-demand ride consideration\ndecreases as a function of age and income. Moreover, transit-users are more\nwilling to consider on-demand rides than private vehicle users, suggesting that\nshared vehicle modes have a similar risk-profile. We discuss the role of\non-demand ride services in the pandemic era, and the need to investigate\npolitical orientation and evolving pandemic experiences to pinpoint their role\nin future mobility systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 00:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

Second, they usually rely on customized loss\nfunctions with extra sensitive hyperparameters for which fine tuning is\nrequired to achieve a well-calibrated PI. Third, they usually underestimate\nuncertainties of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples leading to over-confident\nPIs. Our PI3NN method calculates PIs from linear combinations of three NNs,\neach of which is independently trained using the standard mean squared error\nloss. The coefficients of the linear combinations are computed using\nroot-finding algorithms to ensure tight PIs for a given confidence level.

Are any systematic\nvariations related to their cognitive abilities? This study bridges\ndomain-specific perspectives on visualization design with those provided by\ncognition and perception. We measure variations in visualization task\nperformance across chemistry, computer science, and education, and relate these\ndifferences to variations in spatial ability. We conducted an online study with\nover 60 domain experts consisting of tasks related to pie charts, isocontour\nplots, and 3D scatterplots, and grounded by a well-documented spatial ability\ntest. Task performance (correctness) varied with profession across more complex\nvisualizations, but not pie charts, a comparatively common visualization. We\nfound that correctness correlates with spatial ability, and the professions\ndiffer in terms of spatial ability. These results indicate that domains differ\nnot only in the specifics of their data and tasks, but also in terms of how\neffectively their constituent members engage with visualizations and their\ncognitive traits. Analyzing participants' confidence and strategy comments\nsuggests that focusing on performance neglects important nuances, such as\ndiffering approaches to engage with even common visualizations and potential\nskill transference. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on\ndiscipline-specific visualization with recommendations to help guide\nvisualization design that celebrates the uniqueness of the disciplines and\nindividuals we seek to serve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 01:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

There are three\nmajor challenges facing OTPs: sparsity, diversity, and implicitness. In this\npaper, we present a novel Fliggy ITinerary-aware deep matching NETwork (FitNET)\nto address these three challenges. FitNET is designed based on the popular deep\nmatching network, which has been successfully employed in many industrial\nrecommendation systems, due to its effectiveness. The concept itinerary is\nfirstly proposed under the context of recommendation systems for OTPs, which is\ndefined as the list of unconsumed orders of a user. All orders in a user\nitinerary are learned as a whole, based on which the implicit travel intention\nof each user can be more accurately inferred. To alleviate the sparsity\nproblem, users' profiles are incorporated into FitNET. Meanwhile, a series of\nitinerary-aware attention mechanisms that capture the vital interactions\nbetween user's itinerary and other input categories are carefully designed.\nThese mechanisms are very helpful in inferring a user's travel intention or\npreference, and handling the diversity in a user's need. Further, two training\nobjectives, i.e., prediction accuracy of user's travel intention and prediction\naccuracy of user's click behavior, are utilized by FitNET, so that these two\nobjectives can be optimized simultaneously. An offline experiment on Fliggy\nproduction dataset with over 0.27 million users and 1.55 million travel items,\nand an online A/B test both show that FitNET effectively learns users' travel\nintentions, preferences, and diverse needs, based on their itineraries and\ngains superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

(2)\nThe semantics and temporal context are under-explored. To tackle those issues,\nwe are motivated by the prevalent cloze test in education and propose a novel\napproach named Visual Cloze Completion (VCC), which conducts VAD by learning to\ncomplete \"visual cloze tests\" (VCTs). Specifically, VCC first localizes each\nvideo event and encloses it into a spatio-temporal cube (STC). To achieve both\nprecise and comprehensive localization, appearance and motion are used as\ncomplementary cues to mark the object region associated with each event. For\neach marked region, a normalized patch sequence is extracted from current and\nadjacent frames and stacked into a STC. With each patch and the patch sequence\nof a STC compared to a visual \"word\" and \"sentence\" respectively, we\ndeliberately erase a certain \"word\" (patch) to yield a VCT. Then, the VCT is\ncompleted by training DNNs to infer the erased patch and its optical flow via\nvideo semantics. Meanwhile, VCC fully exploits temporal context by\nalternatively erasing each patch in temporal context and creating multiple\nVCTs. Furthermore, we propose localization-level, event-level, model-level and\ndecision-level solutions to enhance VCC, which can further exploit VCC's\npotential and produce significant performance improvement gain.

There has been significant progress in\nsolutions to protect the IP of DNN models in classification tasks. However,\nlittle attention has been devoted to the protection of DNNs in image processing\ntasks. By utilizing consistent invisible spatial watermarks, one recent work\nfirst considered model watermarking for deep image processing networks and\ndemonstrated its efficacy in many downstream tasks. Nevertheless, it highly\ndepends on the hypothesis that the embedded watermarks in the network outputs\nare consistent. When the attacker uses some common data augmentation attacks\n(e.g., rotate, crop, and resize) during surrogate model training, it will\ntotally fail because the underlying watermark consistency is destroyed. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose a new watermarking methodology, namely\n``structure consistency'', based on which a new deep structure-aligned model\nwatermarking algorithm is designed. Specifically, the embedded watermarks are\ndesigned to be aligned with physically consistent image structures, such as\nedges or semantic regions.

In particular, we not only use an\nobject-level GCN to capture the object to object spatial relation within a\nsingle image, but also adopt an image-level GCN to capture the feature\ninformation provided by similar images. With the well-designed Dual-GCN, we can\nmake the linguistic transformer better understand the relationship between\ndifferent objects in a single image and make full use of similar images as\nauxiliary information to generate a reasonable caption description for a single\nimage.

To solve the optimal battery control (OBC) problem using the\npowerful reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, this paper aims to develop a\nnew representation of the cycle-based battery degradation model according to\nthe rainflow algorithm. As the latter depends on the full trajectory, existing\nwork has to rely on linearized approximation for converting it into\ninstantaneous terms for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) based formulation. We\npropose a new MDP form by introducing additional state variables that can\neasily keep track of past switching points for determining the cycle depth. The\nproposed degradation model allows to adopt the powerful deep Q-Network (DQN)\nbased RL algorithm to efficiently search for the OBC policy.

While functional safety is a well-established concept, the question\nof measuring the behavioral safety of a vehicle remains subject to research.\nOne way to both objectively and computationally analyze traffic conflicts is\nthe development and utilization of so-called criticality metrics. Contemporary\napproaches have leveraged the potential of criticality metrics in various\napplications related to automated driving, e.g. for computationally assessing\nthe dynamic risk or filtering large data sets to build scenario catalogs. As a\nprerequisite to systematically choose adequate criticality metrics for such\napplications, we extensively review the state of the art of criticality\nmetrics, their properties, and their applications in the context of automated\ndriving. Based on this review, we propose a suitability analysis as a\nmethodical tool to be used by practitioners. Both the proposed method and the\nstate of the art review can then be harnessed to select well-suited measurement\ntools that cover an application's requirements, as demonstrated by an exemplary\nexecution of the analysis.

To accelerate its convergence, we propose a simple\nyet effective scheme for improving the DETR framework, namely Spatially\nModulated Co-Attention (SMCA) mechanism. The core idea of SMCA is to conduct\nlocation-aware co-attention in DETR by constraining co-attention responses to\nbe high near initially estimated bounding box locations. Our proposed SMCA\nincreases DETR's convergence speed by replacing the original co-attention\nmechanism in the decoder while keeping other operations in DETR unchanged.\nFurthermore, by integrating multi-head and scale-selection attention designs\ninto SMCA, our fully-fledged SMCA can achieve better performance compared to\nDETR with a dilated convolution-based backbone (45.6 mAP at 108 epochs vs. 43.3\nmAP at 500 epochs).

In specific, we introduce a tractable model to\neffectively capture the characteristics of multiple IRSs and multiple user\nequipments (UEs).

To compensate for the high complexity of the\noptimization problems, we propose a low complexity algorithm that has marginal\nperformance loss.

From a novel perspective, we\nargue that the bridging between the source and target domains can be utilized\nto tackle the UDA re-ID task, and we focus on explicitly modeling appropriate\nintermediate domains to characterize this bridging. Specifically, we propose an\nIntermediate Domain Module (IDM) to generate intermediate domains'\nrepresentations on-the-fly by mixing the source and target domains' hidden\nrepresentations using two domain factors. Based on the \"shortest geodesic path\"\ndefinition, i.e., the intermediate domains along the shortest geodesic path\nbetween the two extreme domains can play a better bridging role, we propose two\nproperties that these intermediate domains should satisfy. To ensure these two\nproperties to better characterize appropriate intermediate domains, we enforce\nthe bridge losses on intermediate domains' prediction space and feature space,\nand enforce a diversity loss on the two domain factors. The bridge losses aim\nat guiding the distribution of appropriate intermediate domains to keep the\nright distance to the source and target domains. The diversity loss serves as a\nregularization to prevent the generated intermediate domains from being\nover-fitting to either of the source and target domains.

However, the retrieval performance\nremains unsatisfactory due to a lack of consistent representation in both\nsemantics and structural spaces. In this work, we propose to address the above\nissue from two aspects: (i) constructing intrinsic structure (along with\nrelations) among the fragments of respective modalities, e.g., \"dog $\\to$ play\n$\\to$ ball\" in semantic structure for an image, and (ii) seeking explicit\ninter-modal structural and semantic correspondence between the visual and\ntextual modalities.

In\norder to jointly and explicitly learn the visual-textual embedding and the\ncross-modal alignment, SMFEA creates a novel multi-modal structured module with\na shared context-aware referral tree.

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a promising tool for\nanalyzing safety of vehicles for low-dimensional systems. However, reachability\nsuffers from the curse of dimensionality, making its direct application to more\nthan two vehicles intractable. Recent works have made it tractable to guarantee\nsafety for 3 and 4 vehicles with reachability. However, the number of vehicles\nsafety can be guaranteed for remains small. In this paper, we propose a novel\nreachability-based approach that guarantees safety for any number of vehicles\nwhile vehicles complete their objectives of visiting multiple targets\nefficiently, given any K-vehicle collision avoidance algorithm where K can in\ngeneral be a small number.

By reordering the\nnode indices of the original adjacency matrix, linear layouts provide knowledge\nof latent graph structures. Conventional linear layout methods commonly aim to\nfind an optimal reordering solution based on predefined features of a given\nmatrix and loss function. However, prior knowledge of the appropriate features\nto use or structural patterns in a given adjacency matrix is not always\navailable. In such a case, performing the reordering based on data-driven\nfeature extraction without assuming a specific structure in an adjacency matrix\nis preferable. Recently, a neural-network-based matrix reordering method called\nDeepTMR has been proposed to perform this function. However, it is limited to a\ntwo-mode reordering (i.e., the rows and columns are reordered separately) and\nit cannot be applied in the one-mode setting (i.e., the same node order is used\nfor reordering both rows and columns), owing to the characteristics of its\nmodel architecture. In this study, we extend DeepTMR and propose a new one-mode\nlinear layout method referred to as AutoLL. We developed two types of neural\nnetwork models, AutoLL-D and AutoLL-U, for reordering directed and undirected\nnetworks, respectively. To perform one-mode reordering, these AutoLL models\nhave specific encoder architectures, which extract node features from an\nobserved adjacency matrix.

We found a simple differential model, within the framework of\nwhich the concept of deactivation of the earthquake source is introduced. The\nquestion of dependence of the deactivation factor on the magnitude of main\nshock is analyzed theoretically and experimentally. A monotonic decrease in the\ndeactivation factor with an increase in the magnitude of the main shock has\nbeen reliably established.

Then, plasmonic properties are further investigated in the flat band\ntTLG with both zero-pressure magic angle and pressure-induced magic angle.

By\ncomparison, one is a high energy damping-free plasmon mode that shows similar\nbehavior, and the other is a low energy plasmon mode (flat-band plasmon) that\nshows obvious differences. The flat-band plasmon is contributed by both\ninterband and intraband transitions of flat bands, and its divergence is due to\nthe various shape of the flat bands in tTLG with zero-pressure and\npressure-induced magic angles.

One of these key features\nis the extreme eigenstate localization of eigenstates, also known as\nnon-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which occurs in open chains. However, many\nnew and peculiar non-Hermitian characteristics of the eigenstates and\neigenvlaues that emerge when two such non-Hermitian chains are coupled together\nremain largely unexplored. Here, we report various new avenues of eigenstate\nlocalization in coupled non-Hermitian chains with dissimilar inverse skin\nlengths in which the NHSE can be switched on and off by the inter-chain\ncoupling amplitude. A very small inter-chain strength causes the NHSE to be\npresent at both ends of an anti-symmetric coupled system because of the weak\nhybridization of the eigenstates of the individual chains. The eigenspectrum\nunder open boundary conditions (OBC) exhibits a discontinuous jump known as the\ncritical NHSE (CNHSE) as its size increases. However, when the hybridization\nbetween eigenstates becomes significant in a system with strong inter-chain\ncoupling, the NHSE and CNHSE vanish. Moreover, a peculiar \"half-half skin\nlocalization\" occurs in composite chains with opposite signs of inverse decay\nlengths, where half of the eigenstates are exponentially localized at one chain\nand the remainder of the eigenstates on the other chain.

Most previous studies at-tempt to develop models for polyp\ndifferentiation using Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) or other enhanced images.\nHowever, the wide range of these models' applications for clinical work has\nbeen limited by the lagging of imaging techniques. Thus, we propose a novel\nframework based on a teacher-student architecture for the accurate colorectal\npolyp classification (CPC) through directly using white-light (WL) colonoscopy\nimages in the examination. In practice, during training, the auxiliary NBI\nimages are utilized to train a teacher network and guide the student network to\nacquire richer feature representation from WL images. The feature transfer is\nrealized by domain alignment and contrastive learning. Eventually the final\nstudent network has the ability to extract aligned features from only WL images\nto facilitate the CPC task. Besides, we release the first public-available\npaired CPC dataset containing WL-NBI pairs for the alignment training.\nQuantitative and qualitative evaluation indicates that the proposed method\noutperforms the previous methods in CPC, improving the accuracy by 5.6%with\nvery fast speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 09:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

The living\nstructure is defined as a physical and mathematical structure or simply\ncharacterized by the recurring notion (or inherent hierarchy) of far more small\nsubstructures than large ones. This paper seeks to lay out a new geography as a\nscience of the Earth's surface founded on the third view of space. The new\ngeography aims not only to better understand geographic forms and processes but\nalso - maybe more importantly - to make geographic space or the Earth's surface\nto be living or more living. After introducing two fundamental laws of\ngeography: Tobler's law on spatial dependence (or homogeneity) and scaling law\non spatial heterogeneity, we argue that these two laws are fundamental laws of\nliving structure that favor statistics over exactitude, because the former (or\nstatistics) tends to make a structure more living than the latter (or\nexactitute).

As our most recent result we discuss the long-range memory of the\norder flow data in the financial markets and other social systems from the\nperspective of the fractional L\\`{e}vy stable motion. We test widely used\nlong-range memory estimators on discrete fractional L\\`{e}vy stable motion\nrepresented by the ARFIMA sample series. Our newly obtained results seem\nindicate that new estimators of self-similarity and long-range memory for\nanalyzing systems with non-Gaussian distributions have to be developed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 10:31:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 15:25:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 08:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

One of the main challenges\nin SER is data scarcity, i.e., insufficient amounts of carefully labeled data\nto build and fully explore complex deep learning models for emotion\nclassification. This paper aims to address this challenge using a transfer\nlearning strategy combined with spectrogram augmentation. Specifically, we\npropose a transfer learning approach that leverages a pre-trained residual\nnetwork (ResNet) model including a statistics pooling layer from speaker\nrecognition trained using large amounts of speaker-labeled data. The statistics\npooling layer enables the model to efficiently process variable-length input,\nthereby eliminating the need for sequence truncation which is commonly used in\nSER systems. In addition, we adopt a spectrogram augmentation technique to\ngenerate additional training data samples by applying random time-frequency\nmasks to log-mel spectrograms to mitigate overfitting and improve the\ngeneralization of emotion recognition models. We evaluate the effectiveness of\nour proposed approach on the interactive emotional dyadic motion capture\n(IEMOCAP) dataset.

The long-term behavior of\nfree-running RNNs, described by periodic, chaotic and fixed point attractors,\nis controlled by the statistics of the neural connection weights, such as the\ndensity $d$ of non-zero connections, or the balance $b$ between excitatory and\ninhibitory connections. However, for information processing purposes, RNNs need\nto receive external input signals, and it is not clear which of the dynamical\nregimes is optimal for this information import. We use both the average\ncorrelations $C$ and the mutual information $I$ between the momentary input\nvector and the next system state vector as quantitative measures of information\nimport and analyze their dependence on the balance and density of the network.\nRemarkably, both resulting phase diagrams $C(b,d)$ and $I(b,d)$ are highly\nconsistent, pointing to a link between the dynamical systems and the\ninformation-processing approach to complex systems. Information import is\nmaximal not at the 'edge of chaos', which is optimally suited for computation,\nbut surprisingly in the low-density chaotic regime and at the border between\nthe chaotic and fixed point regime. Moreover, we find a completely new type of\nresonance phenomenon, called 'Import Resonance' (IR), where the information\nimport shows a maximum, i.e. a peak-like dependence on the coupling strength\nbetween the RNN and its input. IR complements Recurrence Resonance (RR), where\ncorrelation and mutual information of successive system states peak for a\ncertain amplitude of noise added to the system. Both IR and RR can be exploited\nto optimize information processing in artificial neural networks and might also\nplay a crucial role in biological neural systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 11:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

Therefore, unmanned\naerial vehicles (UAVs), which are fast, agile, and have high degrees of\nfreedom, have been widely used. However, previous approaches have two\nlimitations: a) First, they may not be appropriate for exploring large-scale\nenvironments because they mainly depend on random sampling-based path planning\nthat causes unnecessary movements. b) Second, they assume the pose estimation\nis accurate enough, which is the most critical factor in obtaining an accurate\nmap. In this paper, to explore and map unknown large-scale environments rapidly\nand accurately, we propose a novel exploration method that combines the\npre-calculated Peacock Trajectory with graph-based global exploration and\nactive loop-closing. Because the two-step trajectory that considers the\nkinodynamics of UAVs is used, obstacle avoidance is guaranteed in the\nreceding-horizon manner. In addition, local exploration that considers the\nfrontier and global exploration based on the graph maximizes the speed of\nexploration by minimizing unnecessary revisiting. In addition, by actively\nclosing the loop based on the likelihood, pose estimation performance is\nimproved. The proposed method's performance is verified by exploring 3D\nsimulation environments in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.\nFinally, the proposed approach is validated in a real-world experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 12:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

A large number of teleportation schemes have\nalready been introduced so far.

Furthermore, we study the effects of six noise models, namely bit-flip\nnoise, phase-flip noise, bit-phase flip noise, amplitude damping, phase damping\nand the depolarizing error that may affect the communication channel used for\nthe teleportation. An investigation on the variation of the initial state's\nfidelity with respect to the teleported state in the presence of the noise\nmodel is performed. A visual representation of the variation of fidelity for\nvarious values of the noise parameter $\\eta$ is done through a graph plot.

Our finding implies that the gamma rays in 3C 279 escape from the\nedge of the broad emission line region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 14:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

This\ninvestigation aims to determine which scales of topography have the strongest\neffect on macroscopic adhesion. Adhesion measurements were performed on\ntechnology-relevant diamond coatings of varying roughness using spherical ruby\nprobes that are large enough ($0.5$-mm-diameter) to sample all length scales of\ntopography. For each material, more than $2000$ measurements of pull-off force\nwere performed in order to investigate the magnitude and statistical\ndistribution of adhesion. Using sphere-contact models, the roughness-dependent\neffective values of work of adhesion were measured, ranging from $0.08$ to\n$7.15$ mJ/m$^2$ across the four surfaces. The data was more accurately fit\nusing numerical analysis, where an interaction potential was integrated over\nthe AFM-measured topography of all contacting surfaces. These calculations\nrevealed that consideration of nanometer-scale plasticity in the materials was\ncrucial for a good quantitative fit of the measurements, and the presence of\nsuch plasticity was confirmed with AFM measurements of the probe after testing.\nThis analysis enabled the extraction of geometry-independent material\nparameters; the intrinsic work of adhesion between ruby and diamond was\ndetermined to be $46.3$ mJ/m$^2$. The range of adhesion was $5.6$ nm, which is\nlonger than is typically assumed for atomic interactions, but is in agreement\nwith other recent investigations. Finally, the numerical analysis was repeated\nfor the same surfaces but this time with different length-scales of roughness\nincluded or filtered out. The results demonstrate a critical band of\nlength-scales between $43$ nm and $1.8$ nm in lateral size that has the\nstrongest effect on the total adhesive force for these hard, rough contacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 14:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

The deep features being distinguishing in\nclassification from the convolutional neural networks (CNN) are demonstrated in\nthis study to provide comprehensive interpretability for the proposed CAD\nsystem using pathological knowledge. Methods: In the experiment, a total of 186\nslides of WSIs were collected and classified into three categories:\nNon-Carcinoma, Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS), and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma\n(IDC). Instead of conducting pixel-wise classification into three classes\ndirectly, we designed a hierarchical framework with the multi-view scheme that\nperforms lesion detection for region proposal at higher magnification first and\nthen conducts lesion classification at lower magnification for each detected\nlesion. Results: The slide-level accuracy rate for three-category\nclassification reaches 90.8% (99/109) through 5-fold cross-validation and\nachieves 94.8% (73/77) on the testing set.

These constraints have pointed towards the existence of angular\nmomentum transport processes unaccounted for in theoretical models.\nConstraining the properties of their internal rotation thus appears as the\ngolden path to determine the physical nature of these missing dynamical\nprocesses. We wish to determine the robustness of a new approach to study the\ninternal rotation of post main-sequence stars, using parametric rotation\nprofiles coupled to a global optimization technique. We test our methodology on\nKepler 56, a red giant observed by the Kepler mission. First, we carry out an\nextensive modelling of the star using global and local minimizations\ntechniques, and seismic inversions. Then, using our best model, we study in\ndetails its internal rotation profile, we adopted a Bayesian approach to\nconstrain stellar parametric predetermined rotation profiles using a Monte\nCarlo Markov Chain analysis of the rotational splittings of mixed modes. Our\nMonte Carlo Markov Chain analysis of the rotational splittings allows to\ndetermine the core and envelope rotation of Kepler 56 as well as give hints\nabout the location of the transition between the slowly rotating envelope and\nthe fast rotating core. We are able to discard a rigid rotation profile in the\nradiative regions followed by a power-law in the convective zone and show that\nthe data favours a transition located in the radiative region, as predicted by\nprocesses originating from a turbulent nature. Our analysis of Kepler 56\nindicates that turbulent processes whose transport efficiency is reduced by\nchemical gradients are favoured, while large scale fossil magnetic fields are\ndisfavoured as a solution to the missing angular momentum transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 15:07:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 13:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

However, the directional beamforming-based\ntechniques require an additional angle estimator and are not reliable if the\nflow angle is not constant throughout the region of interest. On the other\nhand, estimates with triangulation-based techniques are prone to large bias and\nvariance at low imaging depths due to limited angle for left and right\napertures. In view of this, a novel angle independent depth aware fusion\nbeamforming approach is proposed and evaluated in this paper. The hypothesis\nbehind the proposed approach is that the peripheral flows are transverse in\nnature, where directional beamforming can be employed without the need of an\nangle estimator and the deeper flows being non-transverse and directional,\ntriangulation-based vector flow imaging can be employed. In the simulation\nstudy, an overall 67.62% and 74.71% reduction in magnitude bias along with a\nslight reduction in the standard deviation are observed with the proposed\nfusion beamforming approach when compared to triangulation-based beamforming\nand directional beamforming, respectively, when implemented individually.

But the\nconventional DAS technique offers poor contrast, low imaging resolution, and\nlimited spatiotemporal sensitivity. This article attempts to improve the\nspatiotemporal sensitivity of conventional flow imaging with a novel multiply\nand sum based nonlinear high-resolution (NLHR) beamforming approach. The major\nadvantages of the proposed beamformer are the harmonic generation and the\nenhanced coherence in beamformed signals that improve the spatiotemporal\nsensitivity towards flow transients. We demonstrate the proposed beamformer for\na directional cross-correlation as well as an autocorrelation based velocity\nestimator with simulated parabolic flow profiles of different velocities and\nflow directions, an in-vitro rotating disk dataset, and pulsatile flow\nexperiments. The sensitivity of NLHR beamforming towards the flow transients is\nvalidated in-vitro with a sudden reversal of flow direction and air bubble\ntracking experiments. The comparison between the time-frequency plots of DAS\nand NLHR beamforming indicates that the impulsive spatiotemporal changes\ninduced by the flow of air bubbles are clearly characterized by nonlinear\nbeamforming than that of DAS beamforming. Furthermore, better spatiotemporal\nvelocity tracking of a single air bubble and a clear distinguishability between\nthe tracking of two proximal air bubbles are observed in-vitro. Preliminary\nstudies on the in-vivo carotid data also show comparable, if not better,\nresults than that of the DAS algorithm.

Multipath cohomology is defined as the (poset) homology of the\npath poset -- i.e., the poset of disjoint simple paths in a graph -- with\nrespect to a certain functor. This construction is essentially equivalent,\nalbeit more computable, to taking the higher limits of said functor on (a\ncertain modification of) the path poset. We investigate the functorial\nproperties of multipath cohomology.

Despite\nremarkable advances achieved by traditional process-based methods, statistical\napproaches and recently famous deep learning-based models, few works have\nfocused on producing several kinds of rocks with one trained model and allowing\nthe reconstructed samples to satisfy certain given properties, such as\nporosity. To fill this gap, we propose a new framework, named RockGPT, which is\ncomposed of VQ-VAE and conditional GPT, to synthesize 3D samples based on a\nsingle 2D slice from the perspective of video generation. The VQ-VAE is\nutilized to compress high-dimensional input video, i.e., the sequence of\ncontinuous rock slices, to discrete latent codes and reconstruct them. In order\nto obtain diverse reconstructions, the discrete latent codes are modeled using\nconditional GPT in an autoregressive manner, while incorporating conditional\ninformation from a given slice, rock type, and porosity. We conduct two\nexperiments on five kinds of rocks, and the results demonstrate that RockGPT\ncan produce different kinds of rocks with the same model, and the reconstructed\nsamples can successfully meet certain specified porosities. In a broader sense,\nthrough leveraging the proposed conditioning scheme, RockGPT constitutes an\neffective way to build a general model to produce multiple kinds of rocks\nsimultaneously that also satisfy user-defined properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 00:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

The modeling power of DNN is believed to\nhave come from the complexity and over-parameterization of the model, which on\nthe other hand has been criticized for the lack of interpretation. Although\ncertainly not true for every application, in some applications, especially in\neconomics, social science, healthcare industry, and administrative decision\nmaking, scientists or practitioners are resistant to use predictions made by a\nblack-box system for multiple reasons. One reason is that a major purpose of a\nstudy can be to make discoveries based upon the prediction function, e.g., to\nreveal the relationships between measurements. Another reason can be that the\ntraining dataset is not large enough to make researchers feel completely sure\nabout a purely data-driven result. Being able to examine and interpret the\nprediction function will enable researchers to connect the result with existing\nknowledge or gain insights about new directions to explore. Although classic\nstatistical models are much more explainable, their accuracy often falls\nconsiderably below DNN. In this paper, we propose an approach to fill the gap\nbetween relatively simple explainable models and DNN such that we can more\nflexibly tune the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. Our main\nidea is a mixture of discriminative models that is trained with the guidance\nfrom a DNN. Although mixtures of discriminative models have been studied\nbefore, our way of generating the mixture is quite different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 02:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

Among many\nothers, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) exclusively use chemical energy stored\nin their battery packs for propulsion. Hence, it becomes important to\nunderstand how much energy can be consumed by such vehicles in various traffic\nscenarios towards effective energy management. To address this challenge, we\npropose a novel framework in this paper by leveraging the federated learning\napproaches for modelling energy consumption for BEVs (Fed-BEV). More\nspecifically, a group of BEVs involved in the Fed-BEV framework can learn from\neach other to jointly enhance their energy consumption model.

The variability of renewables may\nrequire conventional generators to remain active and operate inefficiently. The\ngrid's inertia grows weaker, jeopardizing its stability. Network-related\nproblems become more prevalent, threatening the grid's security. Finally, the\nindustry experiences price cannibalization to extensive degrees, with frequent\nnegative prices and with renewable energy producers downregulating their\nproduction in order to avoid severe penalties. To this day, no previous work\nhas provided a holistic analysis on how each energy asset could contribute to\ngrid management within the power market setting. This paper attempts to fill\nthis knowledge gap by investigating the \"flexicurity\" potential of energy\nassets, in the context of smart grids and the so-called \"2050 strategy\". More\nlight is cast on their true value, thus better guiding network operators and\nmarket players. To the above, we categorize all flexibility and security\ncapabilities of each energy asset, qualitatively grade their \"performance\". We\nsecondly introduce the concept of \"flexicurity\" and discuss a gradual shift\ntowards an alternative flexicurity-based market operation.

As the Internet of Things (IoT)\nevolves towards a more transient and opportunistic execution paradigm, reducing\nenergy storage costs will be key for its economic and ecologic viability.\nHowever, decreasing energy storage in harvesting systems introduces reliability\nissues. Transducers only produce intermittent energy at low voltage and current\nlevels, making guaranteed task completion a challenge. Existing ad hoc methods\novercome this by buffering enough energy either for single tasks, incurring\nlarge data-retention overheads, or for one full application cycle, requiring a\nlarge energy buffer. We present Julienning: an automated method for optimizing\nthe total energy cost of batteryless applications. Using a custom specification\nmodel, developers can describe transient applications as a set of atomically\nexecuted kernels with explicit data dependencies. Our optimization flow can\npartition data- and energy-intensive applications into multiple execution\ncycles with bounded energy consumption. By leveraging interkernel data\ndependencies, these energy-bounded execution cycles minimize the number of\nsystem activations and nonvolatile data transfers, and thus the total energy\noverhead.

This approach makes it\nfeasible to write $\\boldsymbol{B}(\\boldsymbol{r})$ as the circular loop\nmagnetic field contribution plus a sum of powers of $H/R$. Analytic formulas\nfor the magnetic field are obtained from truncated finite expansions outside\nthe neighborhood of the wire. These showed to be computationally less expensive\nthan numerical integration in regions where the dipole approximation is not\nenough to describe the field properly. Illustrative examples of the magnetic\nfield due to circular wires deformed harmonically are developed in the article,\nobtaining exact expansion coefficients and accurate descriptions. Error\nestimates are calculated to identify the regions in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ where the\nanalytical expansions perform well. Finally, first-order deformation formulas\nfor the magnetic field are studied for generic even deformation functions\n$f(\\phi)$.\n  Keywords: Magnetic Field, Gegenbauer Polynomials, Arbitrary current loop,\nBiot-Savart law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 17:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

Machine learning can predict which students are at risk of failing a\nhigh-stakes certification exam. If predictions can be made well in advance of\nthe exam, then educators can meaningfully intervene before students take the\nexam to reduce the chances of a failing score.\n  Methods: Using already-collected, first-year student assessment data from\nfive cohorts in a Master of Physician Assistant Studies program, the authors\nimplement an \"adaptive minimum match\" version of the k-nearest neighbors\nalgorithm (AMMKNN), using changing numbers of neighbors to predict each\nstudent's future exam scores on the Physician Assistant National Certifying\nExamination (PANCE). Validation occurred in two ways: Leave-one-out\ncross-validation (LOOCV) and evaluating the predictions in a new cohort.\n  Results: AMMKNN achieved an accuracy of 93% in LOOCV. AMMKNN generates a\npredicted PANCE score for each student, one year before they are scheduled to\ntake the exam. Students can then be classified into extra support, optional\nextra support, or no extra support groups. The educator then has one year to\nprovide the appropriate customized support to each category of student.\n  Conclusions: Predictive analytics can identify at-risk students, so they can\nreceive additional support or remediation when preparing for high-stakes\ncertification exams. Educators can use the included methods and code to\ngenerate predicted test outcomes for students. The authors recommend that\neducators use this or similar predictive methods responsibly and transparently,\nas one of many tools used to support students.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 03:55:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2022 07:10:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 16:08:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Reinforcement\nlearning is similar to learning in biology. It is of great significance to\nstudy the combination of SNN and RL. We propose the reinforcement learning\nmethod of spike distillation network (SDN) with STBP. This method uses\ndistillation to effectively avoid the weakness of STBP, which can achieve SOTA\nperformance in classification, and can obtain a smaller, faster convergence and\nlower power consumption SNN reinforcement learning model. Experiments show that\nour method can converge faster than traditional SNN reinforcement learning and\nDNN reinforcement learning methods, about 1000 epochs faster, and obtain SNN\n200 times smaller than DNN. We also deploy SDN to the PKU nc64c chip, which\nproves that SDN has lower power consumption than DNN, and the power consumption\nof SDN is more than 600 times lower than DNN on large-scale devices. SDN\nprovides a new way of SNN reinforcement learning, and can achieve SOTA\nperformance, which proves the possibility of further development of SNN\nreinforcement learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 07:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

The main focus of the research\nis the response of the subgrid scale models to the coarse mesh and their\nability to predict the flow in a thermally driven 3D cavity with the mesh\nresolution below generally accepted LES standards. The research is motivated by\ninvestigating a feasible modeling strategy for the particulate flow in the\nwall-bounded side-wall heated cavity. As URANS and hybrid RANS-LES models fail\nto produce modeled energy due to laminarization, the alternative is LES applied\non the coarse mesh. In a quantitative manner, first and second-moment\nstatistics are com-pared against both reference LES and experimental databases\nfrom literature. For first moment statistics, both models globally predict the\nflow field well. However, for higher moments, the dynamic model outperforms the\nstandard Smagorinsky model using the same mesh resolution. In a qualitative\nfashion, we report the contours of both temperature and velocity fields as well\nas the near-wall turbulent coherent structures. Results of flow quantities are\nglobally in very good agreement with both reference LES and experimental\nmeasurements at a fraction of the CPU power needed for conventional LES.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 09:53:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}
