Thus, the combination of\nchallenging swarm strategy and human-drone collaboration aims to make the games\nwith machines tangible and interactive. Although some research on AI for board\ngames already exists, e.g., chess, the SwarmPlay technology has the potential\nto offer much more engagement and interaction with the user as it proposes a\nmulti-agent swarm instead of a single interactive robot. We explore user's\nevaluation of RL-based swarm behavior in comparison with the game theory-based\nbehavior. The preliminary user study revealed that participants were highly\nengaged in the game with drones (70% put a maximum score on the Likert scale)\nand found it less artificial compared to the regular computer-based systems\n(80%).

Big data science tools\ncan cope with this order of magnitude, enabling researchers to automatically\nextract meaningful knowledge from the archived data. This knowledge helps not\nonly to explain the past but also to predict the future through the\ncomputational modelling of events and behaviours. Currently, there is an\nimmense landscape of big data tools, machine learning frameworks and deep\nlearning algorithms that significantly increase the scalability and performance\nof several computational tasks, especially over text, image and audio. Web\narchives have been taking advantage of this panoply of technologies to provide\ntheir users with more powerful tools to explore and exploit historical data.\nThis chapter presents several examples of these tools and gives an overview of\ntheir application to support longitudinal studies over web archive collections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 16:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

Matrix exposed points in finite dimensions were\nfirst defined by Kriel in 2019. Here this notion is extended to matrix convex\nsets in infinite-dimensional vector spaces. Then a connection between matrix\nexposed points and matrix extreme points is established: a matrix extreme point\nis ordinary exposed if and only if it is matrix exposed. This leads to a\nKrein-Milman type result for matrix exposed points that is due to\nStraszewicz-Klee in classical convexity: a compact matrix convex set is the\nclosed matrix convex hull of its matrix exposed points.\n  Several notions of a fixed-level as well as a multicomponent matrix face and\nmatrix exposed face are introduced to extend the concepts of a matrix extreme\npoint and a matrix exposed point, respectively. Their properties resemble those\nof (exposed) faces in the classical sense, e.g., it is shown that the\n$C^\\ast$-extreme (matrix extreme) points of a matrix face (matrix multiface) of\na matrix convex set $K$ are matrix extreme in $K$. As in the case of extreme\npoints, any fixed-level matrix face is ordinary exposed if and only if it is a\nmatrix exposed face. From this it follows that every fixed-level matrix face of\na free spectrahedron is matrix exposed. On the other hand, matrix multifaces\ngive rise to the noncommutative counterpart of the classical theory connecting\n(archimedean) faces of compact convex sets and (archimedean) order ideals of\nthe corresponding function systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 16:27:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 18:58:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 12:33:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 10:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

The\ntraditional image signal processing (ISP) pipeline in a smartphone camera\nconsists of several image processing steps performed sequentially to\nreconstruct a high quality sRGB image from the raw sensor data. These steps\nconsist of demosaicing, denoising, white balancing, gamma correction, colour\nenhancement, etc. Since each of them are performed sequentially using\nhand-crafted algorithms, the residual error from each processing module\naccumulates in the final reconstructed signal. Thus, the traditional ISP\npipeline has limited reconstruction quality in terms of generalizability across\ndifferent lighting conditions and associated noise levels while capturing the\nimage. Deep learning methods using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have\nbecome popular in solving many image-related tasks such as image denoising,\ncontrast enhancement, super resolution, deblurring, etc. Furthermore, recent\napproaches for the RAW to sRGB conversion using deep learning methods have also\nbeen published, however, their immense complexity in terms of their memory\nrequirement and number of Mult-Adds make them unsuitable for mobile camera ISP.\nIn this paper we propose DelNet - a single end-to-end deep learning model - to\nlearn the entire ISP pipeline within reasonable complexity for smartphone\ndeployment. Del-Net is a multi-scale architecture that uses spatial and channel\nattention to capture global features like colour, as well as a series of\nlightweight modified residual attention blocks to help with denoising.

We\nfirst found Unet is most suitable in augmented microscopy by comparing\nperformance in multi-class semantics segmentation. We develop the augmented\nmicroscopy method to capture nuclei in a brightfield image and the transformer\nusing Unet model to convert an input image into a sequence of topological\ninformation.

In this paper, we study the\ncontrolled islanding problem of a power system under disturbances introduced by\na malicious adversary. We formulate the interaction between the grid operator\nand adversary using a game-theoretic framework. The grid operator first\ncomputes a controlled islanding strategy, along with the power generation for\nthe post-islanding system to guarantee stability. The adversary observes the\nstrategies of the grid operator. The adversary then identifies critical\nsubstations of the power system to compromise and trips the transmission lines\nthat are connected with compromised substations. For our game formulation, we\npropose a double oracle algorithm based approach that solves the best response\nfor each player. We show that the best responses for the grid operator and\nadversary can be formulated as mixed integer linear programs. In addition, the\nbest response of the adversary is equivalent to a submodular maximization\nproblem under a cardinality constraint, which can be approximated up to a\n$(1-\\frac{1}{e})$ optimality bound in polynomial time.

This has a number of interesting corollaries. First as mentioned,\nusing the current best-known bounds on coloring small $K_t$-minor-free graphs,\nwe show that $K_t$-minor-free graphs are $O(t\\log\\log t)$-colorable. Second, it\nshows that proving Linear Hadwiger's Conjecture (that $K_t$-minor-free graphs\nare $O(t)$-colorable) reduces to proving it for small graphs. Third, we prove\nthat $K_t$-minor-free graphs with clique number at most $\\sqrt{\\log t}/ (\\log\n\\log t)^2$ are $O(t)$-colorable. This implies our final corollary that Linear\nHadwiger's Conjecture holds for $K_r$-free graphs for every fixed $r$.\n  One key to proving the main theorem is a new standalone result that every\n$K_t$-minor-free graph of average degree $d=\\Omega(t)$ has a subgraph on $O(t\n\\log^3 t)$ vertices with average degree $\\Omega(d)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 17:09:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 17:59:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 15:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

By\nfitting these data with synthetic spectra, we determine various stellar\nparameters (T_eff = 10,850 +/- 250 K, log g = 2.20 +/- 0.13) and the\nphotospheric abundances of 26 elements, including Ne, P, Cl, Ga, Pd, In, Sn,\nHg, and Pb, which have not previously been published for this cluster.\nAbundances of intermediate-mass elements (Mg through Ga) generally scale with\nFe, while the heaviest elements (Pd through Pb) have roughly solar abundances.\nIts low C/O ratio indicates that the star did not undergo third dredge-up and\nsuggests that its heavy elements were made by a previous generation of stars.\nIf so, this pattern should be present throughout the cluster, not just in this\nstar. Stellar-evolution models suggest that the Bright Star is powered by a\nHe-burning shell, having left the AGB during or immediately after a thermal\npulse. Its mass (0.54 +/- 0.16 M_sun) implies that single stars in 47 Tuc lose\n0.1--0.2 M_sun on the AGB, only slightly less than they lose on the RGB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 17:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

Simulations reveal that even such mild\nlocal color preferences, or homophily, are sufficient to cause segregation. In\nthis work, we propose a stochastic generalization of the Schelling model, based\non both race and wealth, to understand how carefully architected placement of\nincentives, such as urban infrastructure, might affect segregation. In our\nmodel, each agent is assigned one of two colors along with a label, rich or\npoor. Further, we designate certain vertices on the lattice as \"urban sites,\"\nproviding civic infrastructure that most benefits the poorer population, thus\nincentivizing the occupation of such vertices by poor agents of either color.\nWe look at the stationary distribution of a Markov process reflecting these\npreferences to understand the long-term effects. We prove that when incentives\nare large enough, we will have \"urbanization of poverty,\" an observed effect\nwhereby poor people tend to congregate on urban sites. Moreover, even when\nhomophily preferences are very small, if the incentives are large and there is\nincome inequality in the two-color classes, we can get racial segregation on\nurban sites but integration on non-urban sites. In contrast, we find overall\nmitigation of segregation when the urban sites are distributed throughout the\nlattice and the incentives for urban sites exceed the homophily biases.

Deep learning methods have achieved the\nstate-of-the-art performance in many medical image analysis tasks, including\nbrain age estimation. However, the performance and generalisability of the deep\nlearning model are highly dependent on the quantity and quality of the training\ndata set.

In this paper, to overcome the data scarcity problem, we\npropose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based image synthesis method.\nDifferent from the existing GAN-based methods, we integrate a task-guided\nbranch (a regression model for age estimation) to the end of the generator in\nGAN. By adding a task-guided loss to the conventional GAN loss, the learned\nlow-dimensional latent space and the synthesised images are more task-specific.\nIt helps to boost the performance of the down-stream task by combining the\nsynthesised images and real images for model training.

As a typical example,\nthe Vision Transformer (ViT) directly applies a pure transformer architecture\non image classification, by simply splitting images into tokens with a fixed\nlength, and employing transformers to learn relations between these tokens.\nHowever, such naive tokenization could destruct object structures, assign grids\nto uninterested regions such as background, and introduce interference signals.\nTo mitigate the above issues, in this paper, we propose an iterative and\nprogressive sampling strategy to locate discriminative regions. At each\niteration, embeddings of the current sampling step are fed into a transformer\nencoder layer, and a group of sampling offsets is predicted to update the\nsampling locations for the next step. The progressive sampling is\ndifferentiable. When combined with the Vision Transformer, the obtained PS-ViT\nnetwork can adaptively learn where to look.

A novel approach for dealing\nwith missing data are Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), which have been\ngenerating huge research interest in image generation and transformation.\nRecently, researchers have attempted to apply GANs to missing data generation\nand imputation for EHR data: a major challenge here is the categorical nature\nof the data. State-of-the-art solutions to the GAN-based generation of\ncategorical data involve either reinforcement learning, or learning a\nbidirectional mapping between the categorical and the real latent feature\nspace, so that the GANs only need to generate real-valued features. However,\nthese methods are designed to generate complete feature vectors instead of\nimputing only the subsets of missing features. In this paper we propose a\nsimple and yet effective approach that is based on previous work on GANs for\ndata imputation. We first motivate our solution by discussing the reason why\nadversarial training often fails in case of categorical features. Then we\nderive a novel way to re-code the categorical features to stabilize the\nadversarial training.

In contrast, limited knowledge has been\ngained on possible universal characteristics in the non-equilibrium evolution\nof systems in quantum critical phases. In this context, universality is\ngenerically attributed to the insensitivity of observables to the microscopic\nsystem parameters and initial conditions. Here, we present such a universal\nfeature in the equilibration dynamics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK)\nHamiltonian -- a paradigmatic system of disordered, all-to-all interacting\nfermions that has been designed as a phenomenological description of quantum\ncritical regions.

Under a\nstraightforward rescaling, data that correspond to different initial states\ncollapse onto a universal curve, which can be well approximated by a Gaussian\nthroughout large parts of the evolution. To reveal the physics behind this\nprocess, we formulate a general theoretical framework based on the\nNovikov--Furutsu theorem.

The exact non-Markovian evolution of the\nSYK ensemble is very well captured by Bourret--Markov approximations, which\ncontrary to common lore become justified thanks to the extreme chaoticity of\nthe system, and universality is revealed in a spectral analysis of the\ncorresponding Liouvillian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 19:43:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 10:09:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 10:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

The waves are reflected,\nrefracted, and diffracted, leading to a decrease in efficiency of heating\nand/or current generation. The scattering of RF waves (lower hybrid, helicon,\nand ion cyclotron waves) by a single cylindrical filament is studied using a\nfull-wave analytical theory. Analysis reveals a variety of common scattering\nfeatures among the three different RF waves which can be inferred by examining\nthe cold plasma dispersion relation. The physical intuition is useful in\nunderstanding experimental observations and results from complex numerical\nsimulations. While a filament can affect the propagation of RF waves, the\nradiation force exerted by the waves can influence the filament. The force on a\nfilament is determined using the Maxwell stress tensor. In 1905, Poynting was\nthe first to evaluate and measure the radiation force on an interface\nseparating two different dielectric media. For ordinary light propagating in\nvacuum and incident on a glass surface, Poynting noted that the surface is\n\"pulled\" towards the vacuum. In a magnetized cold plasma, there are two\nindependent wave modes. Even if only one of these modes is excited by a RF\nantenna, a filament will couple power to the other mode, a consequence of\nboundary conditions. This facet of scattering has consequences on the radiation\nforce that go beyond Poynting's seminal contribution. The direction of the\nforce depends on the polarization of the incident wave and on the mode\nstructure of the waves inside and in the vicinity of a filament. It can either\npull a filament towards the RF source or push it away. For all three waves, the\nforce is large enough to impact the motion of a filament and could be measured\nexperimentally. It may be possible to modify edge turbulence using RF waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 19:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

Most radio observations of gamma-ray pulsars have been\nperformed at frequencies between 300 MHz and 2 GHz. However, pulsar radio\nfluxes increase rapidly with decreasing frequency, and their radio beams often\nbroaden at low frequencies. As a consequence, some of these pulsars might be\ndetectable at low radio frequencies even when no radio flux is detected above\n300 MHz. Our aim is to test this hypothesis with low-frequency radio\nobservations. We have observed 27 Fermi-discovered gamma-ray pulsars with the\ninternational LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) station FR606 in single-station mode.\nWe used the LOFAR high band antenna (HBA) band (110-190 MHz). On average, we\nuse 9 h of observation per target after the removal of affected datasets,\nresulting in a sensitivity for pulse-averaged flux on the order of 1-10 mJy. We\ndo not detect radio pulsations from any of the 27 sources, and we establish\nstringent upper limits on their low-frequency radio fluxes. These nondetections\nare compatible with the upper limits derived from radio observations at other\nfrequencies. We also determine the pulsars' geometry from the gamma-ray\nprofiles to see for which pulsars the low-frequency radio beam is expected to\ncross Earth. This set of observations provides the most constraining upper\nlimits on the flux density at 150 MHz for 27 radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars. In\nspite of the beam-widening expected at low radio frequencies, most of our\nnondetections can be explained by an unfavorable viewing geometry; for the\nremaining observations, especially those of pulsars detected at higher\nfrequencies, the nondetection is compatible with insufficient sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 21:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

Zonotopes, a type of symmetric, convex polytope, are similarly\nfrequently used due to efficient numerical implementation of affine maps and\nexact Minkowski sums. Both of these representations also enable efficient,\nconvex collision detection for fault detection or formal verification tasks,\nwherein one checks if the reachable set of a system collides (i.e., intersects)\nwith an unsafe set. However, both representations often result in conservative\nrepresentations for reachable sets of arbitrary systems, and neither is closed\nunder intersection. Recently, representations such as constrained zonotopes and\nconstrained polynomial zonotopes have been shown to overcome some of these\nconservativeness challenges, and are closed under intersection.

A natural extension of this LFA framework is the\nanalysis of h-multigrid for finite element discretizations or finite difference\ndiscretizations that can be represented in the language of finite elements.\nWith this extension, we can replicate previous work on the LFA of h-multigrid\nfor arbitrary order discretizations using a convenient and extensible\nabstraction.

Like other\nrisk-averse utility functionals, EU encodes risk aversion through an increasing\nconvex mapping $\\varphi$ of objective costs to subjective costs. An objective\ncost is a realization $y$ of a random variable $Y$. In contrast, a subjective\ncost is a realization $\\varphi(y)$ of a random variable $\\varphi(Y)$ that has\nbeen transformed to measure preferences about the outcomes. For EU, the\ntransformation is $\\varphi(y) = \\exp(\\frac{-\\theta}{2}y)$, and under certain\nconditions, the quantity $\\varphi^{-1}(E(\\varphi(Y)))$ can be approximated by a\nlinear combination of the mean and variance of $Y$. More recently, there has\nbeen growing interest in risk-averse control using the Conditional\nValue-at-Risk (CVaR) functional. In contrast to the EU functional, the CVaR of\na random variable $Y$ concerns a fraction of its possible realizations. If $Y$\nis a continuous random variable with finite $E(|Y|)$, then the CVaR of $Y$ at\nlevel $\\alpha$ is the expectation of $Y$ in the $\\alpha \\cdot 100 \\%$ worst\ncases.

As datacenters have become ever-larger and more powerful,\nthey play an increasingly significant role in the energy arena. With their\nunique characteristics, datacenters have been proved to be well-suited for\nregulating the power grid yet currently provide little, if any, such active\nresponse. This problem is due to issues such as unsuitability of the market\ndesign, high complexity of the currently proposed solutions, as well as the\npotential risks thereof. This work aims to provide individual datacenters with\ninsights on the feasibility and profitability of directly participating in the\nenergy market. By modelling the power system of datacenters, and by conducting\nsimulations on real-world datacenter traces, we demonstrate the substantial\nfinancial incentive for individual datacenters to directly participate in both\nthe day-ahead and the balancing markets.

However, existing recurrent spiking neural networks\n(RSNNs) are often constructed by random connections without optimization. While\nRSNNs can produce rich dynamics that are critical for memory formation and\nlearning, systemic architectural optimization of RSNNs is still an opening\nchallenge. We aim to enable systemic design of large RSNNs via a new scalable\nRSNN architecture and automated architectural optimization. We compose RSNNs\nbased on a layer architecture called Sparsely-Connected Recurrent Motif Layer\n(SC-ML) that consists of multiple small recurrent motifs wired together by\nsparse lateral connections. The small size of the motifs and sparse inter-motif\nconnectivity leads to an RSNN architecture scalable to large network sizes. We\nfurther propose a method called Hybrid Risk-Mitigating Architectural Search\n(HRMAS) to systematically optimize the topology of the proposed recurrent\nmotifs and SC-ML layer architecture. HRMAS is an alternating two-step\noptimization process by which we mitigate the risk of network instability and\nperformance degradation caused by architectural change by introducing a novel\nbiologically-inspired \"self-repairing\" mechanism through intrinsic plasticity.\nThe intrinsic plasticity is introduced to the second step of each HRMAS\niteration and acts as unsupervised fast self-adaption to structural and\nsynaptic weight modifications introduced by the first step during the RSNN\narchitectural \"evolution\". To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the\nfirst work that performs systematic architectural optimization of RSNNs.

Notwithstanding, the performance of the best\nperforming bottom-up method is still inferior to that of the best performing\ntop-down method even with the help of GCN. We argue that this is not mainly\ncaused by the limited feature capturing ability of the text proposal backbone\nor GCN, but by their failure to make a full use of visual-relational features\nfor suppressing false detection, as well as the sub-optimal route-finding\nmechanism used for grouping text segments. In this paper, we revitalize the\nclassic text detection frameworks by aggregating the visual-relational features\nof text with two effective false positive/negative suppression mechanisms.\nFirst, dense overlapping text segments depicting the `characterness' and\n`streamline' of text are generated for further relational reasoning and weakly\nsupervised segment classification. Here, relational graph features are used for\nsuppressing false positives/negatives. Then, to fuse the relational features\nwith visual features, a Location-Aware Transfer (LAT) module is designed to\ntransfer text's relational features into visual compatible features with a Fuse\nDecoding (FD) module to enhance the representation of text regions for the\nsecond step suppression.

There are methods modeling unified video\nsimilarity in an end-to-end way, but losing detailed partial alignment\ninformation, which causes the incapability of copy segments localization. To\naddress the above issues, we propose the Video Similarity and Alignment\nLearning (VSAL) approach, which jointly models spatial similarity, temporal\nsimilarity and partial alignment. To mitigate the spatial similarity bias, we\nmodel the temporal similarity as the mask map predicted from frame-level\nspatial similarity, where each element indicates the probability of frame pair\nlying right on the partial alignments. To further localize partial copies, the\nstep map is learned from the spatial similarity where the elements indicate\nextending directions of the current partial alignments on the spatial-temporal\nsimilarity map. Obtained from the mask map, the start points extend out into\npartial optimal alignments following instructions of the step map. With the\nsimilarity and alignment learning strategy, VSAL achieves the state-of-the-art\nF1-score on VCDB core dataset.

As a quasiperiodic signal in time,\nechoes are characterized by the nearly constant time delay, and its precise\nmeasurement can help reveal a Planck-scale deviation outside of the would-be\nhorizon. Different search methods have been developed for this quasiperiodic\nsignal, while the searches suffer from large theoretical uncertainties of the\necho waveform associated with the near-horizon physics. On the other hand, a\ncoherent combination of a large number of pulses gives rise to a generic narrow\nresonance structure for the echo amplitude in frequency. The quasiperiodic\nresonance structure sets a complementary search target for echoes, and the time\ndelay is inversely related to the average resonance spacing. A uniform comb has\nbeen proposed to look for the resonance structure in a rather model-independent\nway. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian algorithm to search for the resonance\nstructure based on combs, where a phase-marginalized likelihood plays an\nessential role. The algorithm is validated with signal injections in detector\nnoise from Advanced LIGO. With special treatments of the non-Gaussian\nartifacts, the noise outliers of the log Bayes factor distribution are properly\nremoved.

However, due to the domain shift problem, the\nperformance of these algorithms often degrades when they are applied to new\ndata that is different from the training data. Manually labeling new data for\neach test domain is often a time-consuming and laborious task. In this work, we\nexplore unsupervised domain adaptation in retinal vessel segmentation by using\nentropy-based adversarial learning and transfer normalization layer to train a\nsegmentation network, which generalizes well across domains and requires no\nannotation of the target domain. Specifically, first, an entropy-based\nadversarial learning strategy is developed to reduce the distribution\ndiscrepancy between the source and target domains while also achieving the\nobjective of entropy minimization on the target domain. In addition, a new\ntransfer normalization layer is proposed to further boost the transferability\nof the deep network. It normalizes the features of each domain separately to\ncompensate for the domain distribution gap. Besides, it also adaptively selects\nthose feature channels that are more transferable between domains, thus further\nenhancing the generalization performance of the network. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on three regular fundus image datasets and an ultra-widefield\nfundus image dataset, and the results show that our approach yields significant\nperformance gains compared to other state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 02:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

In this study, we propose\nan unsupervised method called the \"information sieve\" to reduce the effect of\ncontent leakage in prosody transfer. The rationale of this approach is that the\nstyle encoder can be forced to focus on style information rather than on\ntextual information contained in the reference speech by a well-designed\ndownsample-upsample filter, i.e., the extracted style embeddings can be\ndownsampled at a certain interval and then upsampled by duplication.\nFurthermore, we used instance normalization in convolution layers to help the\nsystem learn a better latent style space.

Leading edge noise models, e.g.,\nAmiet's model, are widely applied to predict the noise produced by these\napplications. This noise prediction model relies on the accuracy of the\nturbulence spectrum, which is usually assumed to be the von K\\'arm\\'an energy\nspectrum for isotropic turbulence. However, the von K\\'arm\\'an spectrum does\nnot model accurately the dissipation range of the turbulent energy, resulting\nin incorrect far-field noise predictions for the high-frequency range. An\nexponential correction can be applied to the spectrum to model the dissipation\nrange. This correction depends on the dissipation frequency, which is the\nfrequency where the energy spectrum changes from a dependence of $k^{-5/3}$ to\nan exponential decay. This study experimentally investigates nearly isotropic\ninflow turbulence and determines the flow field characteristics that affect the\ndissipation frequency in order to model this frequency and the dissipation\nrange. Experiments have been conducted with two passive grids and hot-wire\nanemometry in the Aeroacoustic Wind Tunnel of the University of Twente. The\nturbulence uniformity in the test section and the turbulence development in the\nstreamwise direction were analyzed, showing that the grid generated turbulence\nwas mostly uniform and nearly isotropic. The dissipation frequency was observed\nto depend on the turbulence intensity, the free-stream velocity, and the\nturbulence length scale. An expression to compute this frequency is proposed,\nas well as a formula to predict the dissipation range. The predicted leading\nedge noise is affected by the dissipation range modelling in the high-frequency\nrange, presenting a decrease in level up to 17 dB for the highest frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 07:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

With real-time communication and precise motion\ncontrol, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) provide an opportunity to\nsubstantially enhance the traffic operational performance of on-ramp\nbottlenecks. In this paper, we propose an upper-level control strategy to\ncoordinate the two traffic streams at on-ramp merging through proactive gap\ncreation and platoon formation. The coordination consists of three components:\n(1) mainline vehicles proactively decelerate to create large merging gaps; (2)\nramp vehicles form platoons before entering the main road; (3) the gaps created\non the main road and the platoons formed on the ramp are coordinated with each\nother in terms of size, speed, and arrival time. The coordination is formulated\nas a constrained optimization problem, incorporating both macroscopic and\nmicroscopic traffic flow models, for flow-level efficiency gains. The model\nuses traffic state parameters as inputs and determines the optimal coordination\nplan adaptive to real-time traffic conditions. The benefits of the proposed\ncoordination are demonstrated through an illustrative case study. Results show\nthat the coordination is compatible with real-world implementation and can\nsubstantially improve the overall efficiency of on-ramp merging, especially\nunder high traffic volume conditions, where recurrent traffic congestion is\nprevented, and merging throughput increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 07:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

Kang (2021) demonstrated that the\nre-acceleration of cosmic ray (CR) protons via diffusive shock acceleration\n(DSA) by multiple shocks could enhance the acceleration efficiency and flatten\nthe CR spectrum, compared to a single episode of DSA. Here we examine the CR\nelectron acceleration through multiple re-acceleration by considering energy\nlosses and decompression of the particle distribution and magnetic fields in\nthe postshock region between consecutive shock passages. We find that the\naccumulated effects of repeated re-acceleration are significant, if preceding\nshocks are stronger than the last shock and the shock passage interval is\n$\\lesssim20$ Myr. In such cases, both the CR spectrum and the ensuing radiation\nspectrum behind the last shock are enhanced and become flatter than the\ncanonical DSA power-law forms. As a result, the shock Mach number estimated\nfrom radio observations tends be higher than the actual Mach number of the last\nshock. Thus, multiple episodes of DSA may explain the enhanced acceleration\nefficiency for CR electrons and the discrepancy of shock Mach numbers, $M_{\\rm\nX} \\lesssim M_{\\rm rad}$, inferred for some observed radio relics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 07:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

The present study probes\nthe collective plasmonic characteristics and resulting photothermal behavior of\nclosed packed 2D Au nanoparticle clusters in order to delineate the effects of\ncluster size, inter-particle distance and particle size. Smaller nanoparticles\n(20 nm and 40 nm in diameter) that exhibit low individual scattering and high\nabsorption were considered for their relevance to photothermal applications. In\ncontrast to typical literature studies, the present study compares the optical\nresponse of clusters of different sizes ranging from a single nanoparticle up\nto large assemblies of 61 nanoparticles. Increasing the cluster size induces\nsignificant changes to the spectral position and opto-physical characteristics.\nBased on the model outcome, an optimal cluster size for maximum absorption per\nnanoparticle is also determined for enhanced photothermal effects. The effect\nof particle size and inter-particle distance is investigated in order to\nelucidate the nature of interaction in terms of near-field and far-field\ncoupling. The photothermal effect resulting from absorption is compared for\ndifferent cluster sizes and inter-particle distances considering a homogeneous\nwater medium. A strong dependence of the steady state temperature of the\nnanoparticles on the cluster size, particle position in the cluster, incident\nlight polarization and inter-particle distance provides new physical insight in\nlocal temperature control of plasmonic nanostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 07:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

Trailing\nedge noise, caused by the turbulent boundary layer interacting with the airfoil\nsurface, is the primary source of noise of modern horizontal and vertical axis\nwind turbines. Low inflow turbulence levels do not affect the trailing edge\nnoise. However, an inflow of high turbulence intensity has flow structures that\ncan penetrate the boundary layer, increasing the velocity fluctuations inside\nthe boundary layer and, consequently, the wall pressure fluctuations and\ntrailing edge noise. This research investigates the effect of high free-stream\nturbulence, observed in the atmospheric boundary layer of urban zones, in the\ntrailing edge noise generation. This was performed by measuring the increment\nof the turbulence inside of the boundary layer and surface pressure\nfluctuations near the trailing edge when an airfoil is submitted to high inflow\nturbulence. Experimental measurements were performed in the Aeroacoustic Wind\nTunnel of the University of Twente on a NACA 0012 airfoil subjected to a\nturbulent inflow. The chord-based Reynolds number of the experiments ranged\nfrom 170 x 10^3 to 500 x 10^3. Results showed that high inflow turbulence\nsignificantly increases the velocity fluctuations and the integral length scale\nalong the entire boundary layer, resulting in an increment of the surface\npressure spectrum more than 6 dB and 10 dB in the entire frequency range for\n10% and 20% of free-stream turbulence, respectively. The 10% free-stream\nturbulence increases the velocity fluctuations just in the low--frequency\nrange, whereas the 20% inflow turbulence influences the velocity spectrum in\nthe entire frequency range, increasing the size of the smallest structures of\nthe turbulence. Amiet's theory is applied to predict the trailing edge\nfar-field noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 08:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

In light of this,\nFederated Learning has recently been proposed as a solution to train on private\ndata without breach of confidentiality. This conservation of privacy is\nparticularly appealing in the field of healthcare, where patient data is highly\nconfidential. However, many studies have shown that its assumption of\nIndependent and Identically Distributed data is unrealistic for medical data.\nIn this paper, we propose Personalized Federated Cluster Models, a hierarchical\nclustering-based FL process, to predict Major Depressive Disorder severity from\nHeart Rate Variability. By allowing clients to receive more personalized model,\nwe address problems caused by non-IID data, showing an accuracy increase in\nseverity prediction.

In this work, we\npresent a 3D biventricular electromechanical model coupled with a 0D\nclosed-loop model of the whole cardiovascular system that addresses the two\nformer crucial factors. With this aim, we introduce a boundary condition for\nthe mechanical problem that accounts for the neglected part of the domain\nlocated on top of the biventricular basal plane and that is consistent with the\nprinciples of momentum and energy conservation. We also discuss in detail the\ncoupling conditions that stand behind the 3D and the 0D models. We perform\nelectromechanical simulations in physiological conditions using the 3D-0D model\nand we show that our results match the experimental data of relevant mechanical\nbiomarkers available in literature. Furthermore, we investigate different\narrangements in cross-fibers active contraction. We prove that an active\ntension along the sheet direction counteracts the myofiber contraction, while\nthe one along the sheet-normal direction enhances the cardiac work.

Even more obvious are security attacks, whereby one or several\nmalicious peers return wrong model updates in order to disrupt the learning\nprocess and lead to a wrong model being learned. In this paper we build a\nfederated learning framework that offers privacy to the participating peers as\nwell as security against Byzantine and poisoning attacks.

These photons can contribute the diffuse free-free\nbackground radiation in the frequency range of the cosmic microwave background\nradiation (CMB). We show that the intensity of the free-free background\nradiation from PBHs depends on the mass and abundance of PBHs. In particular,\nconsidering the growth of a dark matter (DM) halo around a PBH by non-PBH DM\nparticles strongly enhances the free-free background radiation. Large PBH\nfraction increase the signal of the free-free emission. However, large PBH\nfraction also can heat the IGM gas and, accordingly, suppresses the accretion\nrate. As a result, the free-free emission decreases when the PBH fraction is\nlarger than 0.1. We find that the free-free emission from PBHs in the CMB and\nradio frequency is much lower than the CMB blackbody spectrum and the observed\nfree-free emission component in the background radiation. Therefore, it is\ndifficult to obtain the constraint from the free-free emission observation.\nHowever further theoretical understanding and observation on the free-free\nemission from cosmological origin is helpful to study the PBH abundance with\nthe stellar mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 09:04:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 00:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

With the surge of computing resources at the IoT devices, it\nis possible to preprocess the information packets that contain the status\nupdate before sending them to the destination so as to alleviate the\ntransmission burden. However, the additional time and energy expenditure\ninduced by computing also make the optimal updating a non-trivial problem. In\nthis paper, we consider a time-critical IoT system, where the IoT device is\ncapable of preprocessing the status update before the transmission.\nParticularly, we aim to jointly design the preprocessing and transmission so\nthat the weighted sum of the average AoI of the destination and the energy\nconsumption of the IoT device is minimized. Due to the heterogeneity in\ntransmission and computation capacities, the durations of distinct actions of\nthe IoT device are non-uniform. Therefore, we formulate the status updating\nproblem as an infinite horizon average cost semi-Markov decision process (SMDP)\nand then transform it into a discrete-time Markov decision process. We\ndemonstrate that the optimal policy is of threshold type with respect to the\nAoI. Equipped with this, a structure-aware relative policy iteration algorithm\nis proposed to obtain the optimal policy of the SMDP. Our analysis shows that\npreprocessing is more beneficial in regimes of high AoIs, given it can reduce\nthe time required for updates. We further prove the switching structure of the\noptimal policy in a special scenario, where the status updates are transmitted\nover a reliable channel, and derive the optimal threshold. Finally, simulation\nresults demonstrate the efficacy of preprocessing and show that the proposed\npolicy outperforms two baseline policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 09:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

The low-energy charge dynamics is\ncontrolled by the spin-spin interaction J, which generates various bond-charge\nordering tendencies including the electronic nematic order. The nematic order\nis driven by a d-wave Pomeranchuk instability and is pronounced in the\nunderdoped region as well as around van Hove filling in the hole-doped case;\nthe nematic tendency is weak in the electron-doped region.

However, existing UVAD methods still rely\non shallow models to perform detection or initialization, and they are\nevidently inferior to classic VAD methods. This paper proposes a full deep\nneural network (DNN) based solution that can realize highly effective UVAD.\nFirst, we, for the first time, point out that deep reconstruction can be\nsurprisingly effective for UVAD, which inspires us to unveil a property named\n\"normality advantage\", i.e., normal events will enjoy lower reconstruction loss\nwhen DNN learns to reconstruct unlabeled videos. With this property, we propose\nLocalization based Reconstruction (LBR) as a strong UVAD baseline and a solid\nfoundation of our solution. Second, we propose a novel self-paced refinement\n(SPR) scheme, which is synthesized into LBR to conduct UVAD. Unlike ordinary\nself-paced learning that injects more samples in an easy-to-hard manner, the\nproposed SPR scheme gradually drops samples so that suspicious anomalies can be\nremoved from the learning process. In this way, SPR consolidates normality\nadvantage and enables better UVAD in a more proactive way. Finally, we further\ndesign a variant solution that explicitly takes the motion cues into account.\nThe solution evidently enhances the UVAD performance, and it sometimes even\nsurpasses the best classic VAD methods. Experiments show that our solution not\nonly significantly outperforms existing UVAD methods by a wide margin (5% to 9%\nAUROC), but also enables UVAD to catch up with the mainstream performance of\nclassic VAD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 11:31:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 04:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 08:09:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Nonetheless, its solution is not\ncomplete yet.

However, the wave functions of the problem are singular at r = 0\nand do not admit the limiting transition to the wave function of the ground\nstate. Therefore, the unboundedness of the spectrum is only the necessary\ncondition. To prove that a quantum particle indeed can fall to the center, a\nwave function describing the fall should be obtained explicitly. This is done\nin the present paper. Specifically, an exact solution of the time-dependent\nSchrodinger equation describing the fall to the center is obtained and\nanalyzed.

Applications of ML to voice biometrics authentication are no\nexception. Yet, the implications of audio adversarial examples on these\nreal-world systems remain poorly understood given that most research targets\nlimited defenders who can only listen to the audio samples. Conflating\ndetectability of an attack with human perceptibility, research has focused on\nmethods that aim to produce imperceptible adversarial examples which humans\ncannot distinguish from the corresponding benign samples. We argue that this\nperspective is coarse for two reasons: 1. Imperceptibility is impossible to\nverify; it would require an experimental process that encompasses variations in\nlistener training, equipment, volume, ear sensitivity, types of background\nnoise etc, and 2. It disregards pipeline-based detection clues that realistic\ndefenders leverage. This results in adversarial examples that are ineffective\nin the presence of knowledgeable defenders. Thus, an adversary only needs an\naudio sample to be plausible to a human. We thus introduce surreptitious\nadversarial examples, a new class of attacks that evades both human and\npipeline controls. In the white-box setting, we instantiate this class with a\njoint, multi-stage optimization attack. Using an Amazon Mechanical Turk user\nstudy, we show that this attack produces audio samples that are more\nsurreptitious than previous attacks that aim solely for imperceptibility.\nLastly we show that surreptitious adversarial examples are challenging to\ndevelop in the black-box setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 16:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

Second, it partitions the\nSNN workload and generates clusters that fit on crossbars of the target\nneuromorphic hardware. Third, it exploits the rich semantics of Synchronous\nDataflow Graph (SDFG) to represent a clustered SNN program, allowing for\nperformance analysis in terms of key hardware constraints such as number of\ncrossbars, dimension of each crossbar, buffer space on tiles, and tile\ncommunication bandwidth. Finally, it uses a novel scheduling algorithm to\nexecute clusters on crossbars of the hardware, guaranteeing hardware\nperformance. We evaluate DFSynthesizer with 10 commonly used machine-learning\nprograms. Our results demonstrate that DFSynthesizer provides much tighter\nperformance guarantee compared to current mapping approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 12:49:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

One\nsuch problem is Connectivity Augmentation, where the goal is to cheaply\nincrease the connectivity of a network from a value k to k+1.\n  The most studied setting focuses on edge-connectivity, which reduces to k=2,\ncalled Cactus Augmentation. From an approximation perspective, Byrka, Grandoni,\nand Jabal Ameli (2020) were the first to break the 2-approximation barrier for\nthis problem, by exploiting a connection to the Steiner Tree problem, and by\ntailoring the analysis of the iterative randomized rounding technique for\nSteiner Tree to the specific instances arising from this connection. Recently,\nNutov (2020) observed that a similar reduction to Steiner Tree holds for a\nnode-connectivity problem called Block-Tree Augmentation, where the goal is to\nadd edges to a given spanning tree so that the resulting graph\n2-node-connected. Combining Nutov's result with the algorithm of Byrka,\nGrandoni, and Jabal Ameli yields a 1.91-approximation for Block-Tree\nAugmentation, that is the best bound known so far.\n  In this work, we give a 1.892-approximation algorithm for the problem of\naugmenting the node-connectivity of any graph from 1 to 2. As a corollary, we\nimprove upon the state-of-the-art approximation factor for Block-Tree\nAugmentation. Our result is obtained by developing a different and simpler\nanalysis of the iterative randomized rounding technique. Our results also imply\na 1.892-approximation algorithm for Cactus Augmentation. While this does not\nbeat the best approximation by Cecchetto, Traub, and Zenklusen (2021) known for\nthis problem, our analysis is quite simple compared to previous results in the\nliterature. In addition, our work gives new insights on the iterative\nrandomized rounding method, that might be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 13:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

To overcome this problem, developers can now rely on\nautomatic techniques, like machine learning based prediction models, to detect\nsuch issues. An inherent property of such approaches is that they work with\nnumeric vectors (i.e., feature vectors) as inputs. Therefore, one needs to\ntransform the source code into such feature vectors, often referred to as code\nembedding. A popular approach for code embedding is to adapt natural language\nprocessing techniques, like text representation, to automatically derive the\nnecessary features from the source code. However, the suitability and\ncomparison of different text representation techniques for solving Software\nEngineering (SE) problems is rarely studied systematically. In this paper, we\npresent a comparative study on three popular text representation methods,\nword2vec, fastText, and BERT applied to the SE task of detecting\nvulnerabilities in Python code. Using a data mining approach, we collected a\nlarge volume of Python source code in both vulnerable and fixed forms that we\nembedded with word2vec, fastText, and BERT to vectors and used a Long\nShort-Term Memory network to train on them. Using the same LSTM architecture,\nwe could compare the efficiency of the different embeddings in deriving\nmeaningful feature vectors. Our findings show that all the text representation\nmethods are suitable for code representation in this particular task, but the\nBERT model is the most promising as it is the least time consuming and the LSTM\nmodel based on it achieved the best overall accuracy(93.8%) in predicting\nPython source code vulnerabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 13:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

GQAM first applies a Geometry-informed Visual Encoder to\nfuse region-level object features and region-level scene text features with\nconsidering spatial relationships. Then, we design a Question-guided Encoder to\nselect the most relevant visual features for each question. Finally, GQAM\ngenerates a personalized text-aware caption with a Multimodal Decoder. Our\nmodel achieves better captioning performance and question answering ability\nthan carefully designed baselines on both two datasets. With questions as\ncontrol signals, our model generates more informative and diverse captions than\nthe state-of-the-art text-aware captioning model.

The growth of\nbarchans results from the interplay between a fluid flow and a granular bed,\nbut their size regulation involves intricate exchanges between different\nbarchans within a field. One size-regulating mechanism is the binary\ninteraction between nearby dunes, when two dunes exchange mass via the near\nflow field or by direct contact (collision). In a recent Letter (Assis and\nFranklin, Geophys. Res. Lett., 2020), we identified five different patterns\narising from binary interactions of subaqueous barchans, and proposed\nclassification maps. In this paper, we further inquire into binary exchanges by\ninvestigating the motion of individual grains while barchans interact with each\nother. The experiments were conducted in a water channel where the evolution of\npairs of barchans in both aligned and off-centered configurations was recorded\nby conventional and high-speed cameras. Based on image processing, we obtained\nthe morphology of dunes and motion of grains for all interaction patterns. We\npresent the trajectories of individual grains, from which we show the origin\nand destination of moving grains, and their typical lengths and velocities.

In speech, expected words are\neasier to recognise than unexpected words, particularly in noisy environments,\nand incorrect expectations can make us misunderstand our conversational\npartner. Expectations are combined with the output from the sensory pathways to\nform representations of speech in the cerebral cortex. However, it is unclear\nwhether expectations are propagated further down to subcortical structures to\naid the encoding of the basic dynamic constituent of speech: fast\nfrequency-modulation (FM). Fast FM-sweeps are the basic invariant constituent\nof consonants, and their correct encoding is fundamental for speech\nrecognition. Here we tested the hypothesis that subjective expectations drive\nthe encoding of fast FM-sweeps characteristic of speech in the human\nsubcortical auditory pathway. We used fMRI to measure neural responses in the\nhuman auditory midbrain (inferior colliculus) and thalamus (medial geniculate\nbody). Participants listened to sequences of FM-sweeps for which they held\ndifferent expectations based on the task instructions. We found robust evidence\nthat the responses in auditory midbrain and thalamus encode the difference\nbetween the acoustic input and the subjective expectations of the listener. The\nresults indicate that FM-sweeps are already encoded at the level of the human\nauditory midbrain and that encoding is mainly driven by subjective\nexpectations.

By building a neural network\nthat provides a confidence on the predicted properties, we are able to develop\nan active learning scheme that can reduce the amount of labelled data required,\nby identifying the areas of chemical space where the model is most uncertain.\nWe present a scheme for coupling a graph neural network with a Gaussian process\nto featurise solid-state materials and predict properties \\textit{including} a\nmeasure of confidence in the prediction. We then demonstrate that this scheme\ncan be used in an active learning context to speed up the training of the\nmodel, by selecting the optimal next experiment for obtaining a data label. Our\nactive learning scheme can double the rate at which the performance of the\nmodel on a test data set improves with additional data compared to choosing the\nnext sample at random. This type of uncertainty quantification and active\nlearning has the potential to open up new areas of materials science, where\ndata are scarce and expensive to obtain, to the transformative power of graph\nneural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 14:22:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 10:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-16"}

Local\ndifferential privacy enables data sharing in which users share a perturbed\nversion of their data, but existing mechanisms fail to incorporate\nuser-independent public knowledge (e.g., business locations and opening times,\npublic transport schedules, geo-located tweets). This limitation makes\nmechanisms too restrictive, gives unrealistic outputs, and ultimately leads to\nlow practical utility.

Dyadic tie strength has often been used as an\nindicator for whether a relationship is bridging, under the assumption that\nbridging ties are always weak ties. However, recent empirical evidence suggests\nthat bridging ties are often strong, forcing us to rethink the relationship\nbetween social network structure and dyadic tie strength. Here, we provide an\nanalysis based on algebraic topology which clarifies this relationship between\nnetwork structure and dyadic tie strength. Rather than model the network as a\ngraph, we use a simplicial complex which can explicitly encode group\ninteractions between three or more individuals. First, we show theoretically\nand empirically that Edge PageRank, an algebraic topological measure originally\ndefined as an extension of the classical PageRank measure, is a valid\ncontinuous measure of how well a relationship acts as a bridge. Second, we use\nthe tool of Hodge Decomposition, which allows us to decompose any flow in a\nsimplicial complex into three orthogonal components, to clarify the\nrelationship between dyadic tie strength and network structure.

Our\napproach was inspired by the fact that the HITL push the model to learn from\nthe unknown problems by adding a small amount of data based on knowledge. The\nHITL select key samples by using confidence. However, using confidence to find\nkey samples is not suitable for DLA tasks. We propose the Key Samples Selection\n(KSS) method to find key samples in high-level tasks (semantic segmentation)\nmore accurately through agent collaboration, effectively reducing costs. Once\nselected, these key samples are passed to human beings for active labeling,\nthen the model will be updated with the labeled samples. Hence, we revisited\nthe learning system from reinforcement learning and designed a sample-based\nagent update strategy, which effectively improves the agent's ability to accept\nnew samples. It achieves significant improvement results in two benchmarks\n(DSSE-200 (from 77.1% to 86.3%) and CS-150 (from 88.0% to 95.6%)) by using 10%\nof labeled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 14:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

The high-level circuit defining the\nsimulation needs to be compiled into one that complies with hardware\nlimitations such as qubit architecture (connectivity) and instruction (gate)\nset. General-purpose quantum compilers work at the gate level and have little\nknowledge of the mathematical properties of quantum applications, missing\nfurther optimization opportunities. Existing application-specific compilers\nonly apply advanced optimizations in the scheduling procedure and are\nrestricted to the CNOT or CZ gate set. In this work, we develop a compiler,\nnamed 2QAN, to optimize quantum circuits for 2-local qubit Hamiltonian\nsimulation problems, a framework which includes the important quantum\napproximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). In particular, we exploit the\nflexibility of permuting different operators in the Hamiltonian (no matter\nwhether they commute) and propose permutation-aware techniques for qubit\nrouting, gate optimization and scheduling to minimize compilation overhead.\n2QAN can target different qubit topologies and different hardware gate sets.\nCompilation results on four applications (up to 50 qubits) and three quantum\ncomputers (namely, Google Sycamore, IBMQ Montreal and Rigetti Aspen) show that\n2QAN outperforms state-of-the-art general-purpose compilers and\napplication-specific compilers.

One approach to reduce the communication cost is to\ncompress the gradient during communication. However, directly compressing the\ngradient decelerates the convergence speed, and the resulting algorithm may\ndiverge for biased compression. Recent work addressed this problem for\nstochastic gradient descent by adding back the compression error from the\nprevious step. This idea was further extended to one class of variance reduced\nalgorithms, where the variance of the stochastic gradient is reduced by taking\na moving average over all history gradients. However, our analysis shows that\njust adding the previous step's compression error, as done in existing work,\ndoes not fully compensate the compression error. So, we propose\nErrorCompensatedX, which uses the compression error from the previous two\nsteps.

However, when we handle large signals, using random matrices become\ncumbersome especially when it comes to iterative optimization-based solutions.\nEven though recent deep learning-based solutions boost the reconstruction\naccuracy performance while speeding up the recovery, still jointly learning the\nwhole measurement matrix is a difficult process. In this work, we introduce a\nseparable multi-linear learning of the CS matrix by representing it as the\nsummation of arbitrary number of tensors. For a special case where the CS\noperation is set as a single tensor multiplication, the model is reduced to the\nlearning-based separable CS; while a dense CS matrix can be approximated and\nlearned as the summation of multiple tensors. Both cases can be used in CS of\ntwo or multi-dimensional signals e.g., images, multi-spectral images, videos,\netc. Structural CS matrices can also be easily approximated and learned in our\nmulti-linear separable learning setup with structural tensor sum\nrepresentation. Hence, our learnable generalized tensor summation CS operation\nencapsulates most CS setups including separable CS, non-separable CS\n(traditional vector-matrix multiplication), structural CS, and CS of the\nmulti-dimensional signals. For both gray-scale and RGB images, the proposed\nscheme surpasses most state-of-the-art solutions, especially in lower\nmeasurement rates. Although the performance gain remains limited from tensor to\nthe sum of tensor representation for gray-scale images, it becomes significant\nin the RGB case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 13:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-09"}

However, the integrands in these\noperators are difficult to define from the data that are typically available\nfor a given physical system, such as laboratory mechanical property tests. In\ncontrast, molecular dynamics (MD) does not require these integrands, but it\nsuffers from computational limitations in the length and time scales it can\naddress. To combine the strengths of both methods and to obtain a\ncoarse-grained, homogenized continuum model that efficiently and accurately\ncaptures materials' behavior, we propose a learning framework to extract, from\nMD data, an optimal Linear Peridynamic Solid (LPS) model as a surrogate for MD\ndisplacements.

The dual\nversions arise from an identity relating observer time to proper time as a\ncontact transformation on configuration space, which leaves phase space\ninvariant. The special theory has a dual version in the sense that, for any set\nof $n$ particles, every observer has two unique sets of global variables\n$({\\bf{X}}, t)$ and $({\\bf{X}}, \\tau)$ to describe the dynamics, where\n${\\bf{X}}$ is the (unique) canonical center of mass. In the $({\\bf{X}}, t)$\nvariables, time is relative and the speed of light is unique, while in the\n$({\\bf{X}}, \\tau)$ variables, time is unique and the speed of light is relative\nwith no upper bound. In the Maxwell case, the two sets of particle wave\nequations are not equivalent. The dual version contains an additional\nlongitudinal (dissipative) radiation term that appears instantaneously with\nacceleration, leading to the prediction that radiation from a betatron (of any\nfrequency) will not produce photoelectrons. A major outcome is the dual\nunification of Newtonian mechanics and classical electrodynamics with\nEinstein's special theory of relativity, without a self-energy divergency, or\nneed of the problematic Lorentz-Dirac equation or any assumptions about the\nsize or structure of a particle. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and\ndevelop the dual theory of relativistic quantum mechanics. We obtain three\ndistinct dual relativistic wave equations that reduce to the Schr{\\\"o}dinger\nequation when minimal coupling is turned off. We show that the dual Dirac\nequation provides a new formula for the anomalous magnetic moment of a charged\nparticle. We can obtain the exact value for the electron g-factor and\nphenomenological values for the muon and proton g-factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 15:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

A bianisotropic\nmetasurface is characterized by an electric response, a magnetic response, and\nan electromagnetic/magnetoelectric response. In general, these metasur-faces\nconsists of an array of metallic or dielectric particles located within a\nsubwavelength thick host medium, and are approximated and modelled as\ninfinitely-thin, idealized sheet boundaries defined along a surface. An\nappropriate sheet boundary condition which effectively models the tangential\nfield discontinuity due to the array of magnetoelectric inclusions is the\nGeneralized Sheet Transition Condition or GSTC. Several forms of the GSTC\nappear in literature. Here, we present each interpretation and show how they\nare related. Synthesis approaches unique to each form are overviewed. By\nutilizing the GSTC in metasurface design, new possibilities emerge which are\nnot possible with conventional design techniques incorporating only electric or\nonly magnetic responses. Since the metasurfaces are designed using\nbianisotropic boundary conditions, they must be realized using particles which\ncontain magnetoelectric responses. This review article discusses the design of\nmetasurfaces using the GSTC, and the bianisotropic particles used to realize\nGSTCs.

To this\nend, we use the semi-Markov process to model the sequential arrivals of feints\nand real attacks with category labels attached in the associated alerts.

A data-driven design methodology that leverages\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) is adopted in order to efficiently parametrize the\npower control policy mapping the channel state information (CSI) to transmit\npowers. The specific GNN architecture, known as random edge GNN (REGNN),\ndefines a non-linear graph convolutional filter whose spatial weights are tied\nto the channel coefficients. While prior work assumed a joint training approach\nwhereby the REGNN-based policy is shared across all topologies, this paper\ntargets adaptation of the power control policy based on limited CSI data\nregarding the current topology. To this end, we propose a novel modular\nmeta-learning technique that enables the efficient optimization of module\nassignment. While black-box meta-learning optimizes a general-purpose\nadaptation procedure via (stochastic) gradient descent, modular meta-learning\nfinds a set of reusable modules that can form components of a solution for any\nnew network topology. Numerical results validate the benefits of meta-learning\nfor power control problems over joint training schemes, and demonstrate the\nadvantages of modular meta-learning when data availability is extremely\nlimited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 13:06:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 16:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

This\nseverely limits the receptive field and information flow between layers and\nthus brings the necessity for deep and complex models. It is highly desired to\nimprove the receptive field size without increasing the kernel dimensions. This\nrequires a significant upgrade over the generative neurons to achieve the\nnon-localized kernel operations for each connection between consecutive layers.\nIn this article, we present superior (generative) neuron models (or super\nneurons in short) that allow random or learnable kernel shifts and thus can\nincrease the receptive field size of each connection. The kernel localization\nprocess varies among the two super-neuron models. The first model assumes\nrandomly localized kernels within a range and the second one learns (optimizes)\nthe kernel locations during training. An extensive set of comparative\nevaluations against conventional and deformable convolutional, along with the\ngenerative neurons demonstrates that super neurons can empower Self-ONNs to\nachieve a superior learning and generalization capability with a minimal\ncomputational complexity burden.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 16:17:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2023 21:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}
