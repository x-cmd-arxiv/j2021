It\nwould also create infrastructure that could rapidly identify potential threats\nor harms that could occur as a consequence of changes in the AI ecosystem, such\nas the emergence of strategically transformative capabilities, or the\ndeployment of harmful systems.\n  We begin by outlining the problem which motivates this proposal: in brief,\ntraditional governance approaches struggle to keep pace with the speed of\nprogress in AI. We then present our proposal for addressing this problem:\ngovernments must invest in measurement and monitoring infrastructure. We\ndiscuss this proposal in detail, outlining what specific things governments\ncould focus on measuring and monitoring, and the kinds of benefits this would\ngenerate for policymaking.

In\nparticular, we aim at developing anisotropic cohesive phase-field (PF) damage\nmodels by extending the idea introduced in \\cite{REZAEI2021a} for\ndirection-dependent fracture energy and also anisotropic PF damage models based\non structural tensors. The cohesive PF damage formulation used in the current\ncontribution is motivated by the works of \\cite{LORENTZ201120, wu2018,\nGEELEN2019}. The results of the latter models are shown to be insensitive with\nrespect to the length scale parameter for the isotropic case. This is because\nthey manage to formulate the fracture energy as a function of diffuse\ndisplacement jumps in the localized damaged zone. In the present paper, we\ndiscuss numerical examples and details on finite element implementations where\nthe fracture energy, as well as the material strength, are introduced as an\narbitrary function of the crack direction. Using the current formulation for\nanisotropic cohesive fracture, the obtained results are almost insensitive with\nrespect to the length scale parameter. The latter is achieved by including the\ndirection-dependent strength of the material in addition to its fracture\nenergy. Utilizing the current formulation, one can increase the mesh size which\nreduces the computational time significantly without any severe change in the\npredicted crack path and overall obtained load-displacement curves.

Merging of plasmoids is taken\ninto account either assuming that guide field flux is conserved resulting in\nnon-force-free profiles in general, or that magnetic helicity is conserved and\nTaylor relaxation occurs to convert part of the summed guide field flux into\nreconnecting field flux towards minimum energy states resulting in force-free\nprofiles. It is found that the plasmoid distribution in terms of reconnecting\nfield flux follows a power law with index 7/4 or 1 depending on whether merger\nfrequencies are independent of or dependent on their relative velocity to the\noutflow speed, respectively. This result is approximately the same for the\nforce-free and non-force-free models, with non-force-free models exhibiting\nindices of 2 and 1 for the same velocity dependencies. Distributions in terms\nof guide field flux yield indices of 3/2 for the non-force-free model\nregardless of velocity dependence. This is notably distinct from the indices of\n11/8 and 1 for the force-free models independent of and dependent on velocity,\nrespectively. At low guide field fluxes the force-free models exhibit a second\npower law index of 1/2 due to non-constant flux growth rates. The velocity\ndependent force-free model predicts the production of slightly more rapidly\nmoving large guide field flux plasmoids which is supported by observational\nevidence of flux ropes with strong core fields.

The locality constraints of a linear\ncode are stipulated by a matrix $H$ of $\\star$'s and $0$'s (which we call a\n\"stencil\"), whose rows correspond to the local parity checks (with the\n$\\star$'s indicating the support of the check). The visible rank of $H$ is the\nlargest $r$ for which there is a $r \\times r$ submatrix in $H$ with a unique\ngeneralized diagonal of $\\star$'s. The visible rank yields a field-independent\ncombinatorial lower bound on the rank of $H$ and thus the co-dimension of the\ncode.\n  We prove a rank-nullity type theorem relating visible rank to the rank of an\nassociated construct called \\emph{symmetric spanoid}, which was introduced by\nDvir, Gopi, Gu, and Wigderson~\\cite{DGGW20}. Using this connection and a\nconstruction of appropriate stencils, we answer a question posed in\n\\cite{DGGW20} and demonstrate that symmetric spanoid rank cannot improve the\ncurrently best known $\\widetilde{O}(n^{(q-2)/(q-1)})$ upper bound on the\ndimension of $q$-query locally correctable codes (LCCs) of length $n$.\n  We also study the $t$-Disjoint Repair Group Property ($t$-DRGP) of codes\nwhere each codeword symbol must belong to $t$ disjoint check equations. It is\nknown that linear $2$-DRGP codes must have co-dimension $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$. We\nshow that there are stencils corresponding to $2$-DRGP with visible rank as\nsmall as $O(\\log n)$. However, we show the second tensor of any $2$-DRGP\nstencil has visible rank $\\Omega(n)$, thus recovering the $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$\nlower bound for $2$-DRGP.

In an\nanalysis of related works, it was observed that most researchers aim to obtain\nbetter classification results by using a set of untried combinations of Feature\nReduction (FR) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques on NIDS datasets. However,\nthese datasets are different in feature sets, attack types, and network design.\nTherefore, this paper aims to discover whether these techniques can be\ngeneralised across various datasets. Six ML models are utilised: a Deep Feed\nForward (DFF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network\n(RNN), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), and Naive Bayes (NB). The\naccuracy of three Feature Extraction (FE) algorithms; Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA), Auto-encoder (AE), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), are\nevaluated using three benchmark datasets: UNSW-NB15, ToN-IoT and\nCSE-CIC-IDS2018. Although PCA and AE algorithms have been widely used, the\ndetermination of their optimal number of extracted dimensions has been\noverlooked. The results indicate that no clear FE method or ML model can\nachieve the best scores for all datasets. The optimal number of extracted\ndimensions has been identified for each dataset, and LDA degrades the\nperformance of the ML models on two datasets. The variance is used to analyse\nthe extracted dimensions of LDA and PCA. Finally, this paper concludes that the\nchoice of datasets significantly alters the performance of the applied\ntechniques.

The collective modes of these dense nuclear\nspin ensembles provide a natural basis for quantum storage, however, utilizing\nthem as a resource for single spin qubits has thus far remained elusive.

Each event has a different duration\nand spatial structure, making it hard to define an objective \"average event.\"\nWe argue here that transition path theory (TPT), a stochastic process\nframework, is an appropriate tool for the task. We demonstrate TPT's capacities\non a wave-mean flow model of sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) developed by\nHolton and Mass (1976), which is idealized enough for transparent TPT analysis\nbut complex enough to demonstrate computational scalability. Whereas a recent\narticle (Finkel et al. 2021) studied near-term SSW predictability, the present\narticle uses TPT to link predictability to long-term SSW frequency. This\nrequires not only forecasting forward in time from an initial condition, but\nalso \\emph{backward in time} to assess the probability of the initial\nconditions themselves. TPT enables one to condition the dynamics on the regime\ntransition occurring, and thus visualize its physical drivers with a vector\nfield called the \\emph{reactive current}. The reactive current shows that\nbefore an SSW, dissipation and stochastic forcing drive a slow decay of vortex\nstrength at lower altitudes. The response of upper-level winds is late and\nsudden, occurring only after the transition is almost complete from a\nprobabilistic point of view. This case study demonstrates that TPT quantities,\nvisualized in a space of physically meaningful variables, can help one\nunderstand the dynamics of regime transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 01:26:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 15:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

The main\ngoal of this work is to develop a simple numerical method to predict the\nstructural strength and crack-growth-path of U-notched specimens made of\nbrittle materials. For this purpose, the Fragile Points Method (FPM), as\npreviously proposed by the authors, has been augmented by an interface\ndebonding model at the interfaces of the FPM domains, to simulate crack\ninitiation and development. The formulations of FPM are based on a\ndiscontinuous Galerkin weak form where point-based piece-wise-continuous\npolynomial test and trial functions are used instead of element-based basis\nfunctions. In this work, the numerical fluxes introduced across interior\ninterfaces between subdomains are postulated as the tractions acting on the\ninterface derived from an interface damage model. The interface damage is\ntriggered when the numerical flux reaches the interface strength, and the\nprocess of crack-surface separation is governed by the fracture energy.

First, a\nMU-MC-VLC system model is established, and then a sum-rate maximization problem\nunder dimming level and illumination uniformity constraints is formulated. In\nthis studied problem, the indices of activated LEDs and precoding matrices are\noptimized, which result in a complex non-convex mixed integer problem. To solve\nthis problem, the original problem is separated into two subproblems.

Our main result states that\nsecond-order finite automata can be canonized with respect to the second-order\nlanguages they represent. Using this canonization result, we show that sets of\nsets of strings represented by second-order finite automata are closed under\nthe usual Boolean operations, such as union, intersection, difference and even\nunder a suitable notion of complementation. Additionally, emptiness of\nintersection and inclusion are decidable.\n  We provide two algorithmic applications for second-order automata. First, we\nshow that several width/size minimization problems for deterministic and\nnondeterministic ODDs are solvable in fixed-parameter tractable time when\nparameterized by the width of the input ODD. In particular, our results imply\nFPT algorithms for corresponding width/size minimization problems for ordered\nbinary decision diagrams (OBDDs) with a fixed variable ordering.

Learning the non-linear representations is done using a variational\nautoencoder (VAE). The VAE is trained on voxelwise rs-fMRI data and performs\nnon-linear dimensionality reduction that retains meaningful information. The\nretention of information in the model's representations is evaluated using\ndownstream age regression and sex classification tasks. The results on these\ntasks are highly encouraging and a linear regressor trained with the\nrepresentations of our unsupervised model performs almost as well as a\nsupervised neural network, trained specifically for age regression on the same\ndataset. The model is also evaluated with a schizophrenia diagnosis prediction\ntask, to assess its feasibility as a dimensionality reduction method for\nneuropsychiatric datasets. These results highlight the potential for\npre-training on a larger set of individuals who do not have mental illness, to\nimprove the downstream neuropsychiatric task results. The pre-trained model is\nfine-tuned for a variable number of epochs on a schizophrenia dataset and we\nfind that fine-tuning for 1 epoch yields the best results. This work therefore\nnot only opens up non-linear dimensionality reduction for voxelwise rs-fMRI\ndata but also shows that pre-training a deep learning model on voxelwise\nrs-fMRI datasets greatly increases performance even on smaller datasets. It\nalso opens up the ability to look at the distribution of rs-fMRI time series in\nthe latent space of the VAE for heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorders like\nschizophrenia in future work. This can be complemented with the generative\naspect of the model that allows us to reconstruct points from the model's\nlatent space back into brain space and obtain an improved understanding of the\nrelation that the VAE learns between subjects, timepoints, and a subject's\ncharacteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 05:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

In this paper, we present two\neffective modifications of CNNs to improve network learning from long-tailed\ndistribution. First, we present a Class Activation Map Calibration (CAMC)\nmodule to improve the learning and prediction of network classifiers, by\nenforcing network prediction based on important image regions. The proposed\nCAMC module highlights the correlated image regions across data and reinforces\nthe representations in these areas to obtain a better global representation for\nclassification. Furthermore, we investigate the use of normalized classifiers\nfor representation learning in long-tailed problems.

Standard methods to detect genuine multipartite entanglement, e.g.,\nentanglement witnesses, state tomography, or quantum state verification,\nrequire full knowledge of the Hilbert space dimension and precise calibration\nof measurement devices, which are usually difficult to acquire in an\nexperiment. The most radical way to overcome these problems is to detect\nentanglement solely based on the Bell-like correlations of measurement outcomes\ncollected in the experiment, namely, device-independently (DI). However, it is\ndifficult to certify genuine entanglement of practical multipartite states in\nthis way, and even more difficult to quantify it, due to the difficulty to\nidentify optimal multipartite Bell inequalities and protocols tolerant to state\nimpurity. In this work, we explore a general and robust DI method which can be\napplied to various realistic multipartite quantum state in arbitrary finite\ndimension, while merely relying on bipartite Bell inequalities. Our method\nallows us both to certify the presence of genuine multipartite entanglement and\nto quantify it. Several important classes of entangled states are tested with\nthis method, leading to the detection of genuinely entangled states.

Significant computational\nchallenges are encountered when solving these equations due both to the kernel\nsingularity in the fractional integral operator and to the resulting dense\ndiscretized operators, which quickly become prohibitively expensive to handle\nbecause of their memory and arithmetic complexities.\n  In this work, we present a singularity-aware discretization scheme that\nregularizes the singular integrals through a singularity subtraction technique\nadapted to the spatial variability of diffusivity and fractional order. This\nregularization strategy is conveniently formulated as a sparse matrix\ncorrection that is added to the dense operator, and is applicable to different\nformulations of fractional diffusion equations. We also present a block low\nrank representation to handle the dense matrix representations, by exploiting\nthe ability to approximate blocks of the resulting formally dense matrix by low\nrank factorizations.

Taking the task as a point cloud retrieval problem, previous\nmethods have made delightful achievements. However, how to deal with\ncatastrophic collapse caused by rotation problems is still under-explored. In\nthis paper, to tackle the issue, we propose a novel Point Cloud-based\nRotation-aware Large Scale Place Recognition Network (RPR-Net). In particular,\nto solve the problem, we propose to learn rotation-invariant features in three\nsteps. First, we design three kinds of novel Rotation-Invariant Features\n(RIFs), which are low-level features that can hold the rotation-invariant\nproperty. Second, using these RIFs, we design an attentive module to learn\nrotation-invariant kernels. Third, we apply these kernels to previous point\ncloud features to generate new features, which is the well-known SO(3) mapping\nprocess.

An often-used technique against this threat\nis the use of honey (or canary) files, which serve as ``trip wires'' to detect\nransomware in its early stages. However, in our analysis of ransomware samples\nfrom the wild, we discovered that attackers are well-aware of these traps, and\nnewer variants use several evasive strategies to bypass traditional honey\nfiles. Hence, we present the design of SentryFS - a specialized file system\nthat strategically ``sprays'' specially-crafted honey files across the file\nsystem. The canaries are generated using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and\nthe content and the metadata is constantly updated to make the canaries appear\nmore attractive for smarter ransomware that is selective in choosing victim\nfiles. Furthermore, to assist with the management of the honey files, SentryFS\nconnects with an anti-ransomware web service to download the latest\nintelligence on novel ransomware strategies to update the canaries. Finally, as\na contingency, SentryFS also leverages file clones to prevent processes from\nwriting to files directly in the event a highly stealthy ransomware goes\nundetected. In this case, the ransomware encrypts the clones rather than the\nactual files, leaving users' data unmodified. An AI agent then assigns a\nsuspicion score to the write activity so that users can approve/discard the\nchanges. As an early-warning system, the proposed design might help mitigate\nthe problem of ransomware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 09:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

First, we exploit the\nLaing-Garrington effect (asymmetry in the observed polarization fraction\nbetween radio galaxy jets) for 57 galaxies with redshifts up to $0.5$. We use\nthe differences in polarization fraction and rotation measure between the jet\nand counterjet to estimate the small- and large-scale magnetic fields in and\naround ellipticals (including their circumgalactic medium).

The large-scale field (at scales of $100~{\\rm kpc}$) is an order of\nmagnitude smaller than the small-scale field.

The control\nsignal in the networked system is transmitted over an unreliable channel. In\nthis unreliable channel, the data transmission times, referred to as channel\ninduced delays, are random values and the transmitted data could also be\ndropout with certain probability. The channel induced delays and packet dropout\nare modeled by an independent and identically distributed stochastic process\nwith a fixed probability mass function. At the channel terminal, a linear\ncombination of data received at one sampling time is applied to the plant of\nthe networked feedback system as a new control signal. To describe the\nuncertainty in the channel, a concept so called frequency response of variation\nis introduced for the unreliable channel. With the given linear receiving\nstrategy, a mean-square stability criterion is established in terms of the\nfrequency response of variation of the unreliable channel for the networked\nfeedback system. It is shown by this criterion that the mean-square stability\nis determined by the interaction between the frequency response of variation\nand the nominal feedback system. The role played by the random channel induced\ndelays is the same as that played by a colored additive noise in an additive\nnoise channel with a signal-to-noise ratio constraint. Moreover, the\nmean-square input-output stabilizability via output feedback is studied for the\nnetworked system. When the plant in the networked feedback system is minimum\nphase, an analytic necessary and sufficient condition is presented for its\nmean-square input-output stabilizability. It turns out that the stabilizability\nis only determined by the interaction between the frequency response of\nvariation of the channel and unstable poles of the plant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 09:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

The direct gap semiconducting\nnature of CrC2N4 monolayer results in excellent absorption of visible light.\nThe elastic modulus and tensile strength of CrC2N4 nanosheet are predicted to\nbe remarkably high, 676 and 54.8 GPa, respectively. On the basis of iterative\nsolutions of the Boltzmann transport equation, the room temperature lattice\nthermal conductivity of CrC2N4 monolayer is predicted to be 350 W/mK, among the\nhighest in 2D semiconductors.

Every airport generally has a variety of planes with various\nphysical and technological requirements as well as diverse service\nrequirements. Detecting the presence of new planes will not address all traffic\ncongestion issues. Identifying the type of airplane, on the other hand, will\nentirely fix the problem because it will offer important information about the\nplane's technical specifications (i.e., the time it needs to be served and its\nappropriate place in the airport). Several studies have provided various\ncontributions to address airport traffic jams; however, their ultimate goal was\nto determine the existence of airplane objects. This paper provides a practical\napproach to identify the type of airplane in airports depending on the results\nprovided by the airplane detection process using mask region convolution neural\nnetwork. The key feature employed to identify the type of airplane is the\nsurface area calculated based on the results of airplane detection. The surface\narea is used to assess the estimated cabin length which is considered as an\nadditional key feature for identifying the airplane type. The length of any\ndetected plane may be calculated by measuring the distance between the detected\nplane's two furthest points. The suggested approach's performance is assessed\nusing average accuracies and a confusion matrix. The findings show that this\nmethod is dependable.

The concept of a vortex\nfield is introduced, which is caused by the motion of the particles of the\nelectron and nuclear subsystems of atoms of the macrosystem relative to each\nother. It is assumed that helium-4 atoms \"immersed\" in the internal vortex\nfield acquire the properties of fermionic particles due to the atomic\npseudospins s=1/2 generated by the vortex. On this basis, a heuristic\nevolutionary model of helium-4 as an ensemble of atom-like quasiparticles with\nfermionic properties is constructed. As the temperature decreases, bonds are\nformed between pseudofermionic quasiparticles by pairing their pseudospins. The\nformation of a hierarchy of composite quasiparticles on this basis leads to the\ntransition of helium-4 atoms from the gas phase to the liquid state, then to\nthe state of incoherent Bose condensate, and finally to the state with a\nlong-range order of atom-like quasiparticles. The structural forms of composite\nquasiparticles in different phases, the mechanisms of their formation, and the\ntemperatures of these phase transitions ($T_{cr}=5.22K$, $T_0=4.14K$ and\n$T_\\lambda=2.175K$, respectively) are determined. The ideas and calculations\npresented in this paper form the basis for solving the problem of the\ntemperature dependence of the heat capacity of liquid helium-4 in both the\nhelium-I and helium-II phases. The obtained solution has a logarithmic\ndependence of the heat capacity on the reduced temperature\n(${|1-{T/T_\\lambda}|}$) in the region of the $\\lambda$-point of the phase\ntransition of helium-4 from a disordered to an ordered state. The numerical\ncalculations of the heat capacity in the vicinity of the temperature\n$T_\\lambda$ are in very good agreement with the experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 11:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

The most known\nexample of such quantity is the cosmological constant of unimodular gravity.\nMore examples are provided in the article for the higher spin gravity analogues\nof the cosmological constant.

The higher order gauge\nsymmetry is reducible in general, even if the unfree symmetry is not. The\nrelationship is detailed between these two forms of gauge symmetry in the\nconstrained Hamiltonian formalism.

However, in the era of deep\nlearning, what concerns us more regarding a neural network is its depth as well\nas how depth impacts the behaviors of a network. Inspired by a width-depth\nsymmetry consideration, we use a shortcut network to show that increasing the\ndepth of a neural network can also give rise to a Gaussian process, which is a\nvaluable addition to the existing theory and contributes to revealing the true\npicture of deep learning. Beyond the proposed Gaussian process by depth, we\ntheoretically characterize its uniform tightness property and the smallest\neigenvalue of the Gaussian process kernel.

Currently, the main workhorse for solving UDA is\ndomain alignment, which has proven successful. However, it is often difficult\nto find an appropriate source domain with identical label space. A more\npractical scenario is so-called partial domain adaptation (PDA) in which the\nsource label set or space subsumes the target one. Unfortunately, in PDA, due\nto the existence of the irrelevant categories in the source domain, it is quite\nhard to obtain a perfect alignment, thus resulting in mode collapse and\nnegative transfer. Although several efforts have been made by down-weighting\nthe irrelevant source categories, the strategies used tend to be burdensome and\nrisky since exactly which irrelevant categories are unknown. These challenges\nmotivate us to find a relatively simpler alternative to solve PDA.

Due to the complex spatial\ncorrelation and temporal variation of urban subway ridership behavior, deep\nlearning has been widely used to capture non-linear spatial-temporal\ndependencies. Unfortunately, the current deep learning methods only adopt graph\nconvolutional network as a component to model spatial relationship, without\nmaking full use of the different spatial correlation patterns between stations.\nIn order to further improve the accuracy of metro passenger volume prediction,\na deep learning model composed of Parallel multi-graph convolution and stacked\nBidirectional unidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (PB-GRU) was proposed in this\npaper. The parallel multi-graph convolution captures the origin-destination\n(OD) distribution and similar flow pattern between the metro stations, while\nbidirectional gated recurrent unit considers the passenger volume sequence in\nforward and backward directions and learns complex temporal features. Extensive\nexperiments on two real-world datasets of subway passenger flow show the\nefficacy of the model. Surprisingly, compared with the existing methods, PB-GRU\nachieves much lower prediction error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 13:07:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

In\nsuch a network, the nodes represent the companies, and the links represent the\nownership. Within this context, we introduce the out-degree of the nodes --\nwhich represents the diversification -- and the in-degree of them -- capturing\nthe integration. Diversification and integration allow a clear description of\nthe industrial structure formed by the considered companies. The stochastic\ndependence of diversification and integration is modelled through copulas. We\nargue that copulas are well suited for modelling the joint distribution. The\nanalysis of the stochastic dependence between integration and diversification\nby means of the Tsallis entropy gives a crucial information on the reaction of\nthe market structure to the external shocks, - on the basis of some relevant\ncases of dependence between the considered variables. In this respect, the\nconsidered entropy framework provides insights on the relationship between\nin-degree and out-degree dependence structure and market polarisation or\nfairness. Moreover, the interpretation of the results in the light of the\nTsallis entropy parameter gives relevant suggestions for policymakers who aim\nat shaping the industrial context for having high polarisation or fair joint\ndistribution of diversification and integration. Furthermore, a discussion of\npossible parametrisations of the in-degree and out-degree marginal\ndistribution, -- by means of power laws or exponential functions, -- is also\ncarried out.

While\nthis facilitates people's communication and access to information, it also\nprovides an ideal platform for spreading rumors. In normal or critical\nsituations, rumors will affect people's judgment and even endanger social\nsecurity. However, natural language is high-dimensional and sparse, and the\nsame rumor may be expressed in hundreds of ways on social media. As such, the\nrobustness and generalization of the current rumor detection model are put into\nquestion. We proposed a novel \\textbf{h}ierarchical \\textbf{a}dversarial\n\\textbf{t}raining method for \\textbf{r}umor \\textbf{d}etection (HAT4RD) on\nsocial media. Specifically, HAT4RD is based on gradient ascent by adding\nadversarial perturbations to the embedding layers of post-level and event-level\nmodules to deceive the detector. At the same time, the detector uses stochastic\ngradient descent to minimize the adversarial risk to learn a more robust model.\nIn this way, the post-level and event-level sample spaces are enhanced, and we\nhave verified the robustness of our model under a variety of adversarial\nattacks. Moreover, visual experiments indicate that the proposed model drifts\ninto an area with a flat loss landscape, leading to better generalization. We\nevaluate our proposed method on three public rumors datasets from two commonly\nused social platforms (Twitter and Weibo). Experiment results demonstrate that\nour model achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 10:10:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 14:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}
