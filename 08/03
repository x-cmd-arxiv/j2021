Efficient classification of wood points and leaf\npoints is essential to study tree structural parameters and ecological\ncharacteristics. By using both the intensity and spatial information, a\nthree-step classification and verification method was proposed to achieve\nautomated wood-leaf classification. Tree point cloud was classified into wood\npoints and leaf points by using intensity threshold, neighborhood density and\nvoxelization successively. Experiment was carried in Haidian Park, Beijing, and\n24 trees were scanned by using the RIEGL VZ-400 scanner. The tree point clouds\nwere processed by using the proposed method, whose classification results were\ncompared with the manual classification results which were used as standard\nresults. To evaluate the classification accuracy, three indicators were used in\nthe experiment, which are Overall Accuracy (OA), Kappa coefficient (Kappa) and\nMatthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The ranges of OA, Kappa and MCC of the\nproposed method are from 0.9167 to 0.9872, from 0.7276 to 0.9191, and from\n0.7544 to 0.9211 respectively. The average values of OA, Kappa and MCC are\n0.9550, 0.8547 and 0.8627 respectively. Time cost of wood-leaf classification\nwas also recorded to evaluate the algorithm efficiency. The average processing\ntime are 1.4 seconds per million points. The results showed that the proposed\nmethod performed well automatically and quickly on wood-leaf classification\nbased on the experimental dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 16:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

The former must be conducted facing an\nuncertain net demand that includes non-dispatchable electricity consumption and\nrenewable power generation. The latter copes with the plausible deviations with\nrespect to the forward schedule by making use of balancing power during the\nactual operation of the system. Standard industry practice deals with the\nuncertain net demand in the forward stage by replacing it with a good estimate\nof its conditional expectation (usually referred to as a point forecast), so as\nto minimize the need for balancing power in real time. However, it is well\nknown that the cost structure of a power system is highly asymmetric and\ndependent on its operating point, with the result that minimizing the amount of\npower imbalances is not necessarily aligned with minimizing operating costs. In\nthis paper, we propose a bilevel program to construct, from the available\nhistorical data, a prescription of the net demand that does account for the\npower system's cost asymmetry. Furthermore, to accommodate the strong\ndependence of this cost on the power system's operating point, we use\nclustering to tailor the proposed prescription to the foreseen net-demand\nregime. By way of an illustrative example and a more realistic case study based\non the European power system, we show that our approach leads to substantial\ncost savings compared to the customary way of doing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 16:05:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 16:51:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 17:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

In the above-mentioned\napproach, the partitioning of feature set into feature sub-sets is still an\ninteresting area in the literature of this field. In this research, an\ninnovative framework for multi-view ensemble classification, inspired by the\nproblem of object recognition in the multiple views theory of humans, is\nproposed. In this method, at first, the collaboration values between the\nfeatures is calculated using a criterion called the features collaboration\ncriterion. Then, the collaboration graph is formed based on the calculated\ncollaboration values. In the next step, using the community detection method,\ngraph communities are found. The communities are considered as the problem\nviews and the different base classifiers are trained for different views using\nthe views corresponding training data. The multi-view ensemble classifier is\nthen formed by a combination of base classifiers based on the AdaBoost\nalgorithm. The simulation results of the proposed method on the real and\nsynthetic datasets show that the proposed method increases the classification\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 16:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

However,\nlimited by large model and computation complexity, GCNs for action recognition\nlike 2s-AGCN have insufficient power-efficiency and throughput on GPU. Thus,\nthe demand of model reduction and hardware acceleration for low-power GCNs\naction recognition application becomes continuously higher.\n  To address challenges above, this paper proposes a runtime sparse feature\ncompress accelerator with hybrid pruning method: RFC-HyPGCN. First, this method\nskips both graph and spatial convolution workloads by reorganizing the\nmultiplication order. Following spatial convolution workloads channel-pruning\ndataflow, a coarse-grained pruning method on temporal filters is designed,\ntogether with sampling-like fine-grained pruning on time dimension. Later, we\ncome up with an architecture where all convolutional layers are mapped on chip\nto pursue high throughput. To further reduce storage resource utilization,\nonline sparse feature compress format is put forward. Features are divided and\nencoded into several banks according to presented format, then bank storage is\nsplit into depth-variable mini-banks. Furthermore, this work applies\nquantization, input-skipping and intra-PE dynamic data scheduling to accelerate\nthe model. In experiments, proposed pruning method is conducted on 2s-AGCN,\nacquiring 3.0x-8.4x model compression ratio and 73.20\\% graph-skipping\nefficiency with balancing weight pruning.

For\nmany systems, one can efficiently calculate these quantities via the zero-range\nHuang-Yang pseudopotential (HYP), in which the interatomic interaction is\ncharacterized by the scattering length $a$. Furthermore, when the scattering\nlength is dependent on the kinetic energy $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$ of two-atom\nrelative motion, the results are applicable for a broad energy region. However,\nwhen the free Hamiltonian of atomic internal state does not commute with the\ninter-atomic interaction, or the center-of-mass (c.m.) motion is coupled to the\nrelative motion, the generalization of this technique is still lacking. We\nsolve this problem and construct a reasonable energy-dependent multi-channel\nHYP, which is characterized by a \"scattering length operator\" ${\\hat a}_{\\rm\neff}$. Here ${\\hat a}_{\\rm eff}$ is an operator for atomic internal states and\nc.m. motion, and depends on both the total two-atom energy and the external\nfield as well as the trapping parameter.

We conduct experiments on realistic\nscenarios and show that graph neural network support enables substantial\nspeedup and smoother scaling to harder path-planning problems.

While the number of SMARTs has increased in recent years, their\ndesign has remained limited to the frequentist setting, which may not fully or\nappropriately account for uncertainty in design parameters and hence not yield\nappropriate sample size recommendations. Specifically, standard frequentist\nformulae rely on several assumptions that can be easily misspecified. The\nBayesian framework offers a straightforward path to alleviate some of these\nconcerns. In this paper, we provide calculations in a Bayesian setting to allow\nmore realistic and robust estimates that account for uncertainty in inputs\nthrough the `two priors' approach. Additionally, compared to the standard\nformulae, this methodology allows us to rely on fewer assumptions, integrate\npre-trial knowledge, and switch the focus from the standardized effect size to\nthe minimal detectable difference. The proposed methodology is evaluated in a\nthorough simulation study and is implemented to estimate the sample size for a\nfull-scale SMART of an Internet-Based Adaptive Stress Management intervention\nbased on a pilot SMART conducted on cardiovascular disease patients from two\nCanadian provinces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 17:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

One common task of visual analysis with\nmultiple views is to relate data across different views. For example, to\nidentify threats, an intelligence analyst needs to link people from a social\nnetwork graph with locations on a crime-map, and then search for and read\nrelevant documents. Currently, exploring cross-view data relationships heavily\nrelies on view-coordination techniques (e.g., brushing and linking), which may\nrequire significant user effort on many trial-and-error attempts, such as\nrepetitiously selecting elements in one view, and then observing and following\nelements highlighted in other views. To address this, we present SightBi, a\nvisual analytics approach for supporting cross-view data relationship\nexplorations. We discuss the design rationale of SightBi in detail, with\nidentified user tasks regarding the use of cross-view data relationships.\nSightBi formalizes cross-view data relationships as biclusters, computes them\nfrom a dataset, and uses a bi-context design that highlights creating\nstand-alone relationship-views. This helps preserve existing views and offers\nan overview of cross-view data relationships to guide user exploration.\nMoreover, SightBi allows users to interactively manage the layout of multiple\nviews by using newly created relationship-views.

We present GWTC-2.1, which\nreports on a deeper list of candidate events observed over the same period. We\nanalyze the final version of the strain data over this period with improved\ncalibration and better subtraction of excess noise, which has been publicly\nreleased. We employ three matched-filter search pipelines for candidate\nidentification, and estimate the astrophysical probability for each candidate\nevent. While GWTC-2 used a false alarm rate threshold of 2 per year, we include\nin GWTC-2.1, 1201 candidates that pass a false alarm rate threshold of 2 per\nday. We calculate the source properties of a subset of 44 high-significance\ncandidates that have an astrophysical probability greater than 0.5. Of these\ncandidates, 36 have been reported in GWTC-2. If the 8 additional\nhigh-significance candidates presented here are astrophysical, the mass range\nof events that are unambiguously identified as binary black holes (both objects\n$\\geq 3M_\\odot$) is increased compared to GWTC-2, with total masses from $\\sim\n14 M_\\odot$ for GW190924_021846 to $\\sim 182 M_\\odot$ for GW190426_190642. The\nprimary components of two new candidate events (GW190403_051519 and\nGW190426_190642) fall in the mass gap predicted by pair instability supernova\ntheory.

Here, we study the mixing of a passive scalar\n(dye) in dilute suspensions of swimming Escherichia coli in experiments using a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) time-periodic flow and in a simple simulation. Results\nshow that the presence of bacteria hinders large scale transport and reduce\noverall mixing rate. Stretching fields, calculated from experimentally measured\nvelocity fields, show that bacterial activity attenuates fluid stretching and\nlowers flow chaoticity. Simulations suggest that this attenuation may be\nattributed to a transient accumulation of bacteria along regions of high\nstretching. Spatial power spectra and correlation functions of dye\nconcentration fields show that the transport of scalar variance across scales\nis also hindered by bacterial activity, resulting in an increase in average\nsize and lifetime of structures. On the other hand, at small scales, activity\nseems to enhance local mixing. One piece of evidence is that the probability\ndistribution of the spatial concentration gradients is nearly symmetric with a\nvanishing skewness. Overall, our results show that the coupling between\nactivity and flow can lead to nontrivial effects on mixing and transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 17:13:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2021 22:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

To date,\nall of the LIGO-Virgo BBH detections have been made using quasi-circular\ntemplates in their initial discovery. However, recent studies have found some\nof these systems to be compatible with high eccentricity in the LIGO band,\n$e_{10 \\textrm{Hz}} > 0.1$, possibly pointing to a population of sources that\nare challenging to detect. Current low-latency search methods used with\nground-based GW detector data are not well equipped to detect highly eccentric\nsources. Template-based, matched-filter searches require accurate eccentric\nwaveform models that are computational expensive. Unmodeled burst searches are\ndesigned to detected localized excess power and are unable to identify multiple\nisolated bursts, as would originate from a single highly eccentric BBH.\nTherefore, we propose a signal-based prior that can be incorporated into an\nexisting GW burst search to target highly eccentric BBHs.

We show that there is a regime\nwhen the mutual information and the quantum discord between the parts of the\nenvironment correlated by these two processes grow quadratically in time, while\nentanglement production is time-extensive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 17:56:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2021 11:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

Such a \"spin + companion\" system\n(called Colombo's top) appears in many [exo]planetary contexts. The competition\nbetween the tidal torque (which drives spin-orbit alignment and\nsynchronization) and the gravitational torque from the companion (which drives\norbital precession of the planet) gives rise to two possible spin equilibria\n(\"Tidal Cassini Equilibria\", tCE) that are stable and attracting: the \"simple\"\ntCE1, which typically has a low spin obliquity, and the \"resonant\" tCE2, which\ncan have a significant obliquity. The latter arises from a spin-orbit resonance\nand can be broken when the tidal alignment torque is stronger than the\nprecessional torque from the companion. We characterize the long-term evolution\nof the planetary spin (both magnitude and obliquity) for an arbitrary initial\nspin orientation, and develop a new theoretical method to analytically obtain\nthe probability of resonance capture driven by tidal dissipation.

Galaxy luminosity functions estimated from the spectroscopic galaxy\nfractions show the bright end excess beyond the Schechter function at >2sigma\nlevels, which is possibly made by inefficient mass quenching, low dust\nobscuration, and/or hidden AGN activity. By analyzing the correlation functions\nat z~2-6 with halo occupation distribution models, we find a weak redshift\nevolution (within 0.3 dex) of the ratio of the star formation rate (SFR) to the\ndark matter accretion rate, SFR/(dMh/dt), indicating the almost constant star\nformation efficiency at z~2-6, as suggested by our earlier work at z~4-7.\nMeanwhile, the ratio gradually increases with decreasing redshift at z<5 within\n0.3 dex, which quantitatively reproduces the redshift evolution of the cosmic\nSFR density, suggesting that the evolution is primarily driven by the increase\nof the halo number density due to the structure formation, and the decrease of\nthe accretion rate due to the cosmic expansion.

The occurrence\nand target of such attack events can be very dynamic, making real-time and\nnear-real-time detection challenging.

The resulting debris\nforms a tidal stream orbiting the SMBH which can collide with itself due to\nrelativistic apsidal precession. These self-collisions dissipate energy,\ncausing the stream to circularize. We perform kinematic simulations of these\nstream self-collisions to estimate the efficiency of this circularization as a\nfunction of SMBH mass $M_\\bullet$ and penetration factor $\\beta$, the ratio of\nthe tidal radius to the pericenter distance. We uncover two distinct regimes\ndepending on whether the time $t_c$ at which the most tightly bound debris\ncircularizes is greater or less than the time $t_{\\rm fb}$ at which the mass\nfallback rate peaks. The bolometric light curve of energy dissipated in the\nstream self-collisions has a single peak at $t > t_{\\rm fb}$ in the slow\ncircularization regime ($t_c > t_{\\rm fb}$), but two peaks (one at $t < t_{\\rm\nfb}$ and a second at $t_{\\rm fb}$) in the fast circularization regime ($t_c <\nt_{\\rm fb}$).

Some of these errors\nare typographical in nature. They occur due to orthographic variations of some\nArabic letters and the complex rules that dictate their correct usage. Many\npeople forgo these rules, and given the identical phonetic sounds, they often\nconfuse such letters. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term\nmemory network that corrects this class of errors. We develop, train, evaluate,\nand compare a set of BiLSTM networks. We approach the spelling correction\nproblem at the character level. We handle Arabic texts from both classical and\nmodern standard Arabic.

Since the soft Arabic errors class encompasses omission\nand addition mistakes, to preserve the one-to-one sequence transcription, we\npropose a simple low-resource yet effective technique that maintains the\none-to-one sequencing and avoids using a costly encoder-decoder architecture.\nWe train the BiLSTM models to correct the spelling mistakes using transformed\ninput and stochastic error injection approaches.

However, their damping and\namplification mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we investigate\nthe attenuation and amplification of LALOs using high-resolution numerical\nsimulations with progressively increasing spatial resolutions. We performed\ntime-dependent numerical simulations of LALOs using the 2D magnetic\nconfiguration that contains a dipped region. After the prominence mass loading\nin the magnetic dips, we triggered LALOs by perturbing the prominence mass\nalong the magnetic field. We performed the experiments with four values of\nspatial resolution. In the simulations with the highest resolution, the period\nshows a good agreement with the pendulum model. The convergence experiment\nrevealed that the damping time saturates at the bottom prominence region with\nimproving the resolution, indicating the existence of a physical reason for the\ndamping of oscillations. At the prominence top, the oscillations are amplified\nduring the first minutes and then are slowly attenuated. The characteristic\ntime suggests more significant amplification in the experiments with the\nhighest spatial resolution. The analysis revealed that the energy exchange\nbetween the bottom and top prominence regions is responsible for the\nattenuation and amplification of LALOs. The high-resolution experiments are\ncrucial for the study of the periods and the damping mechanism of LALOs. The\nperiod agrees with the pendulum model only when using high enough spatial\nresolution. The results suggest that numerical diffusion in simulations with\ninsufficient spatial resolution can hide important physical mechanisms, such as\namplification of oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 19:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

Despite the efforts made by researchers to\nautomatically identify FQNs in code snippets, the current approaches suffer\nfrom low accuracy when it comes to practice.

Recent work has shown that mid-level perceptual abstractions, such as\ndepth estimates or 2D semantic segmentation, lead to more effective policies\nwhen provided as observations in place of raw sensor data (e.g., RGB images).\nHowever, such policies must still learn latent three-dimensional scene\nproperties from mid-level abstractions. In contrast, high-level, hierarchical\nrepresentations such as 3D scene graphs explicitly provide a scene's geometry,\ntopology, and semantics, making them compelling representations for navigation.\nIn this work, we present a reinforcement learning framework that leverages\nhigh-level hierarchical representations to learn navigation policies. Towards\nthis goal, we propose a graph neural network architecture and show how to embed\na 3D scene graph into an agent-centric feature space, which enables the robot\nto learn policies for low-level action in an end-to-end manner.

Current quantum computers\nexecute their algorithms imperfectly, due to uncorrected noise, gate errors,\nand decoherence. This severely limits the size and scope of protocols which can\nbe run on near-term quantum hardware. Much research has been focused on\nbuilding more robust hardware to address this issue, however the advantages of\nmore robust algorithms remains largely unexplored. Here we show that algorithms\nfor solving the driven-dissipative many-body problem, among the hardest\nproblems in quantum mechanics, are inherently robust against errors. We find it\nis possible to solve dissipative problems requiring deep circuits on current\nquantum devices due to the contractive nature of their time evolution maps. We\nsimulate one thousand steps of time evolution for the non-interacting limit of\nthe infinite driven-dissipative Hubbard model, calculate the current through\nthe system and prepare a thermal state of the atomic limit of the Hubbard\nmodel. These problems were solved using circuits containing up to two thousand\nentangling gates on quantum computers made available by IBM, showing no signs\nof decreasing fidelity at long times. Our results demonstrate that algorithms\nfor simulating dissipative problems are able to far out-perform similarly\ncomplex non-dissipative algorithms on noisy hardware. Our two algorithmic\nprimitives are the basic building blocks of many condensed-matter-physics\nsystems, and we anticipate their demonstrated robustness to hold when\ngeneralized to solve the full many-body driven-dissipative quantum problem.\nBuilding upon the algorithms presented here may prove to be the most promising\napproach to tackle important, classically intractable problems on quantum\ncomputers before error correction is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 21:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

To interpret these spectral\nvariations, we further investigate two hypothetical and disputable mechanisms\nabout bound waves and finite-size effect. Through a tri-coherence analysis, we\nfind that the finite-size effect is present in all cases, which is responsible\nfor the overall steepening of the spectra and reduced capacity of energy flux\nat lower nonlinearity levels. The fraction of bound waves in the domain\ngenerally decreases with the decrease of nonlinearity level, except for the\nnarrow-band case, which exhibits a transition at some critical nonlinearity\nlevel below which a rapid increase is observed.

Here, we report on a method relying\non a mixture of temperature-responsive microgel particles,\npoly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM), and a polymer which undergo fluid-fluid\nphase separation. At room temperature this mixture separates into colloid-rich\n(liquid) and colloid-poor (gas) fluids. By heating the sample above a critical\ntemperature where the microgel particles shrink dramatically and develop a more\ndeeply attractive interparticle potential, the droplets of the colloid-rich\nphase become gel-like. As the temperature is lowered back to room temperature,\nthese droplets of gelled colloidal particles reliquefy and phase separation\nwithin the droplet occurs. This phase separation leads to colloid-poor droplets\nwithin the colloid-rich droplets surrounded by a continuous colloid-poor phase.\nThe gas/liquid/gas all-aqueous double emulsion lasts only a few minutes before\na majority of the inner droplets escape. However, the colloid-rich shell of the\ncore-shell droplets can solidify with the addition of salt. That this method\ncreates a core-shell structures with a shell composed of stimuli-sensitive\nmicrogel colloidal particles using only aqueous components makes it attractive\nfor encapsulating biological materials and making capsules that respond to\nchanges in, for example, temperature, salt concentration, or pH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 22:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

This article introduces a Multi-Objective\nHardware-Aware Quantization (MOHAQ) method, which considers hardware efficiency\nand inference error as objectives for mixed-precision quantization. The\nproposed method feasibly evaluates candidate solutions in a large search space\nby relying on two steps. First, post-training quantization is applied for fast\nsolution evaluation (inference-only search). Second, we propose the\n\"beacon-based search\" to retrain selected solutions only and use them as\nbeacons to know the effect of retraining on other solutions.

Based on this in-memory logic, PIRM provides a technique to\nconduct multi-operand addition and two operand multiplication using transverse\naccess.

How to\nefficiently deploy deep models for diverse deployment scenarios is a new\nchallenge. Previous NAS approaches seek to design architectures for all classes\nsimultaneously, which may not be optimal for some individual superclasses. A\nstraightforward solution is to search an architecture from scratch for each\ndeployment scenario, which however is computation-intensive and impractical. To\naddress this, we present a novel and general framework, called Elastic\nArchitecture Search (EAS), permitting instant specializations at runtime for\ndiverse superclasses with various resource constraints. To this end, we first\npropose to effectively train an over-parameterized network via a superclass\ndropout strategy during training. In this way, the resulting model is robust to\nthe subsequent superclasses dropping at inference time. Based on the\nwell-trained over-parameterized network, we then propose an efficient\narchitecture generator to obtain promising architectures within a single\nforward pass.

Finite sample properties of conditional observed\ninformation matrices are established.

An\nexplicit form of the observed Fisher information (OFI) is derived for the\ncalculation of standard errors of the ML estimates. It simplifies Louis (1982)\ngeneral formula for the OFI matrix. To prevent from getting an incorrect\ninverse of the OFI matrix, which may be attributed by the lack of sparsity and\nlarge size of the matrix, a monotone convergent recursive equation for the\ninverse matrix is developed which in turn generalizes the algorithm of Hero and\nFessler (1994) for the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound. To improve the estimation, in\nparticular when applying repeated sampling to incomplete data, a robust\nM-estimator is introduced. A closed form sandwich estimator of covariance\nmatrix is proposed to provide the standard errors of the M-estimator. By the\nresulting loss of information presented in finite-sample incomplete data, the\nsandwich estimator produces smaller standard errors for the M-estimator than\nthe ML estimates. In the case of complete information or absence of\nre-sampling, the M-estimator coincides with the ML estimates.

However, empirical studies show\nthat the IPTW estimators can be sensitive to the misspecification of the\npropensity score model. To address this problem, researchers have proposed to\nestimate propensity score by directly optimizing the balance of pre-treatment\ncovariates. While these methods appear to empirically perform well, little is\nknown about how the choice of balancing conditions affects their theoretical\nproperties. To fill this gap, we first characterize the asymptotic bias and\nefficiency of the IPTW estimator based on the Covariate Balancing Propensity\nScore (CBPS) methodology under local model misspecification. Based on this\nanalysis, we show how to optimally choose the covariate balancing functions and\npropose an optimal CBPS-based IPTW estimator. This estimator is doubly robust;\nit is consistent for the ATE if either the propensity score model or the\noutcome model is correct. In addition, the proposed estimator is locally\nsemiparametric efficient when both models are correctly specified. To further\nrelax the parametric assumptions, we extend our method by using a sieve\nestimation approach.

It is a strong\ncondition on the local structure and has direct consequences on entanglement\nmeasures. It was first shown to hold for a free scalar field and causal\ndiamonds by Araki in 1964 and later by many authors in different ways. In\nparticular, Eckmann and Osterwalder (EO) used Tomita-Takesaki modular theory to\ngive a direct proof. However, it is not straightforward to relate this proof to\nthe works of Araki, since they rely on two forms of the canonical commutation\nrelations (CCR), called Segal and Weyl formulations, while EO work as starting\npoint assumes that duality holds in the so-called ``first quantization'' in the\nWeyl formulation. It is our purpose to first introduce the works of Araki in a\nmore easy-to-read but still rigorous and self-contained fashion, and show how\nHaag duality is stated in the Segal and Weyl formulations and in both first and\nsecond quantizations (and their immediate combination). This permits to\nunderstand the setting of the EO proof of Haag duality. There is nothing\nessentially new in this manuscript, with the exception of what we consider a\nsimplification of EO proof that uses the adjoint $S^*$ of the Tomita operator\n$S$ instead of introducing several auxiliary operators.

It aims to predict the probability of a user clicking a\nparticular item given user and item features. As feature interactions bring in\nnon-linearity, they are widely adopted to improve the performance of CTR\nprediction models. Therefore, effectively modelling feature interactions has\nattracted much attention in both the research and industry field. The current\napproaches can generally be categorized into three classes: (1) na\\\"ive\nmethods, which do not model feature interactions and only use original\nfeatures; (2) memorized methods, which memorize feature interactions by\nexplicitly viewing them as new features and assigning trainable embeddings; (3)\nfactorized methods, which learn latent vectors for original features and\nimplicitly model feature interactions through factorization functions. Studies\nhave shown that modelling feature interactions by one of these methods alone\nare suboptimal due to the unique characteristics of different feature\ninteractions. To address this issue, we first propose a general framework\ncalled OptInter which finds the most suitable modelling method for each feature\ninteraction. Different state-of-the-art deep CTR models can be viewed as\ninstances of OptInter.

We formulate this problem\nas a set-partitioning and solve it using a column generation based algorithm.\nThe resulting pricing problem of the column generation is a complicated problem\nas, next to the usual operational constraints e.g. time windows and vehicle\ncapacity, electric vehicle related features are also considered. In particular,\nthe nonlinear nature of the battery charging process requires the incorporation\nof a set of sophisticated recursive functions in the pricing algorithm. We show\nhow these recursive functions allow for the simultaneous evaluation of the\nrouting and charging decisions. Moreover, we illustrate how they can\nefficiently be embedded in the pricing algorithm. The column generation\nalgorithm is integrated in a branch and bound algorithm and cutting planes are\nadded resulting in a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm for the E-VRP-NL. Next\nto the exact algorithm, we also develop a tabu search based heuristic to solve\nthe problem quickly. To prove the efficiency of the proposed algorithms, their\nperformance is tested on benchmark instances from the literature. Our exact\nalgorithm can optimally solve instances with up to 40 customers, including\nseveral instances previously unsolved to optimality. The tabu search heuristic\nproves to be superior to state-of-the-art heuristics in the literature both on\nsolution quality and computation times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 03:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

Methods: We model volumetric dose distribution as\nanalytical extension of two iso-surfaces with the extension variables as\ndistances to iso-surfaces. We built a 3D lookup table (LUT) which are generated\nbased on clinical dose distributions. Two LUT tables store the mean and\nstandard deviation of voxel dose values of clinical doses and binned as\ndistance to 100% iso-surface, reference iso-surface and reference dose level.\nThe process of interactive tuning starts from a given base plan. A user drags\niso-surface for a desired carving. Our method responds with tuned dose. The\nderivation of tuned dose follows two steps. Dose is extended from the two\nuser-desired iso-surfaces (eg.100% and 50%) to the whole patient volume by\ntable lookup, using distances to two iso-surfaces and reference dose level as\nkeys. Then we fine tune the extended dose by a correction strategy utilizing\nthe information of base plan. Results: We validated this method on coplanar\nVMAT doses of post-operative prostate plans. The LUT was populated by dose\ndistributions of 27 clinical plans. We optimized two plans with different\nrectum sparing for an independent case to mimic the process of dose tuning. The\nplan with less rectum sparing is set as base plan. The 50% iso-surface of the\nmore-sparing plan is defined as the desired iso-surface input. The dose output\nby our method (expansion and correction) agrees with the more-sparing plan\nobtained by optimization, in terms of gamma (97.2%), DVH and profiles. The\noverall dose reconstruction time is within two seconds.

We introduce Arby, an\nentirely data-driven Python package for building reduced order or surrogate\nmodels. In contrast to standard approaches, which involve solving partial\ndifferential equations, Arby is entirely data-driven.

The conventional dynamic state estimation of power networks in the\ntransmission system relies on the forecasting methods to obtain the\nstate-transition model of state variables. However, under highly dynamic\nconditions in the operation of microgrids and active distribution networks,\nthis approach may become ineffective as the forecasting accuracy is not\nguaranteed. To overcome such drawbacks, this paper employs the power networks\nmodel derived from the physical equations of branch currents. Specifically, the\npower network model is a linear state-space model, in which the state vector\nconsists of branch currents, and the input vector consists of bus voltages. To\nestimate both state and input variables, we propose linear Kalman-based dynamic\nfiltering algorithms in batch-mode regression form, considering the\ncross-correlation between states and inputs. For the scalability of the\nproposed scheme, the distributed implementation is also presented.\nComplementarily, the predicted state and input vectors are leveraged for bad\ndata detection.

We consider a model in which a scalar field is coupled to the\nGauss-Bonnet term and show that primordial blackholes may be seeded when a\nscalar potential term and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling term are nearly balanced.\nLarge curvature perturbation in this model not only leads to the production of\nprimordial blackholes but it also sources gravitational waves at the second\norder. We calculate the present density parameter of the gravitational waves\nand discuss the detectability of the signals by comparing them with sensitivity\nbounds of future gravitational wave experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 07:40:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 09:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

Despite the fast\nprogress in blockchain designs in recent years, existing blockchain systems can\nstill only tolerate $f$ below $0.5$. Can practically usable blockchains\ntolerate a malicious majority, i.e., $f$ above $0.5$?\n  This work presents a positive answer to this question. We first note that the\nwell-known impossibility of {\\em byzantine consensus} for $f$ above $0.5$ does\nnot carry over to blockchains. To tolerate $f$ above $0.5$, we use {\\em\nbyzantine broadcast}, instead of byzantine consensus, as the core of the\nblockchain. A major obstacle in doing so, however, is that the resulting\nblockchain may have extremely low throughput. To overcome this central\ntechnical challenge, we propose a novel byzantine broadcast protocol OverlayBB,\nthat can tolerate $f$ above $0.5$ while achieving good throughput. Using\nOverlayBB as the core, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of\na novel Proof-of-Stake blockchain called BCube. BCube can tolerate a malicious\nmajority, while achieving practically usable transaction throughput and\nconfirmation latency in our experiments with $10000$ nodes and under $f = 0.7$.\nTo our knowledge, BCube is the first blockchain that can achieve such\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 07:42:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 03:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

To address these issues, we propose a novel method\nnamed Intra- and Inter-Instance Collaborative Learning (I3CL). Specifically, to\naddress the first issue, we design an effective convolutional module with\nmultiple receptive fields, which is able to collaboratively learn better\ncharacter and gap feature representations at local and long ranges inside a\ntext instance. To address the second issue, we devise an instance-based\ntransformer module to exploit the dependencies between different text instances\nand a global context module to exploit the semantic context from the shared\nbackground, which are able to collaboratively learn more discriminative text\nfeature representation. In this way, I3CL can effectively exploit the intra-\nand inter-instance dependencies together in a unified end-to-end trainable\nframework. Besides, to make full use of the unlabeled data, we design an\neffective semi-supervised learning method to leverage the pseudo labels via an\nensemble strategy.

To obtain an overview of how\nthe 4d-band filling influences the exchange interactions in the Fe layer we\nhave calculated the energy dispersion of spin spirals for 4d/Fe/2W unsupported\nquadlayers, in which the W(001)substrate is represented by only two atomic\nlayers. Hybridization with the overlayer leads to a reduced ferromagnetic\nnearest-neighbor exchange interaction and the next-nearest neighbor exchange\ngains in strength. Surprisingly, we find that the $c(2 \\times 2)$\nantiferromagnetic state is unfavorable for all systems with a 4d overlayer. For\n4d overlayers from the beginning (Nb) or end (Pd) of the series we find a\nferromagnetic ground state. As one moves to the center of the series there is a\ntransition via a spin spiral (Mo, Rh) to a $p (2 \\times 1)$ antiferromagnetic\nground state (Tc, Ru). We have studied the Mo, Ru, and Pd overlayer on\nFe/W(001) representing the surface by a sufficiently large number of W layers\nto obtain bulk like properties in its center. The energy dispersion of spin\nspirals show qualitatively the same results as those from the 4\\textit{d}/Fe/2W\nquadlayers. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction calculated upon including\nspin-orbit coupling shows significant strength and considerable frustration\neffects. The calculated magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy is large as well.\nAll 4d/Fe/W(001) films are potential candidates for complex non-collinear spin\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 08:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

Plenty of works have studied the patterns and attention\nallocations of reading comprehension in information retrieval related\nscenarios. However, little is known about what happens in human brain during\nreading comprehension and how these cognitive activities can affect information\nretrieval process. Additionally, with the advances in brain imaging techniques\nsuch as electroencephalogram (EEG), it is possible to collect brain signals in\nalmost real time and explore whether it can be utilized as feedback to\nfacilitate information acquisition performance. In this paper, we carefully\ndesign a lab-based user study to investigate brain activities during reading\ncomprehension. Our findings show that neural responses vary with different\ntypes of reading contents, i.e., contents that can satisfy users' information\nneeds and contents that cannot. We suggest that various cognitive activities,\ne.g., cognitive loading, semantic-thematic understanding, and inferential\nprocessing, underpin these neural responses at the micro-time scale during\nreading comprehension. From these findings, we illustrate several insights for\ninformation retrieval tasks, such as ranking models construction and interface\ndesign. Besides, we suggest the possibility of detecting reading comprehension\nstatus for a proactive real-world system. To this end, we propose a Unified\nframework for EEG-based Reading Comprehension Modeling (UERCM). To verify its\neffectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments based on EEG features for two\nreading comprehension tasks: answer sentence classification and answer\nextraction. Results show that it is feasible to improve the performance of two\ntasks with brain signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 08:37:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 01:07:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 06:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

In\nmulti-head attention mechanism, different heads attend to different parts of\nthe input. However, the limitation is that multiple heads might attend to the\nsame part of the input, resulting in multiple heads being redundant. Thus, the\nmodel resources are under-utilized. One approach to avoid this is to prune\nleast important heads based on certain importance score. In this work, we focus\non designing a Dynamic Head Importance Computation Mechanism (DHICM) to\ndynamically calculate the importance of a head with respect to the input. Our\ninsight is to design an additional attention layer together with multi-head\nattention, and utilize the outputs of the multi-head attention along with the\ninput, to compute the importance for each head. Additionally, we add an extra\nloss function to prevent the model from assigning same score to all heads, to\nidentify more important heads and improvise performance. We analyzed\nperformance of DHICM for NMT with different languages. Experiments on different\ndatasets show that DHICM outperforms traditional Transformer-based approach by\nlarge margin, especially, when less training data is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 09:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

Since the computation\ncomplexity of ViT is quadratic with respect to the input sequence length, a\nmainstream paradigm for computation reduction is to reduce the number of\ntokens. Existing designs include structured spatial compression that uses a\nprogressive shrinking pyramid to reduce the computations of large feature maps,\nand unstructured token pruning that dynamically drops redundant tokens.\nHowever, the limitation of existing token pruning lies in two folds: 1) the\nincomplete spatial structure caused by pruning is not compatible with\nstructured spatial compression that is commonly used in modern deep-narrow\ntransformers; 2) it usually requires a time-consuming pre-training procedure.\nTo tackle the limitations and expand the applicable scenario of token pruning,\nwe present Evo-ViT, a self-motivated slow-fast token evolution approach for\nvision transformers. Specifically, we conduct unstructured instance-wise token\nselection by taking advantage of the simple and effective global class\nattention that is native to vision transformers. Then, we propose to update the\nselected informative tokens and uninformative tokens with different computation\npaths, namely, slow-fast updating. Since slow-fast updating mechanism maintains\nthe spatial structure and information flow, Evo-ViT can accelerate vanilla\ntransformers of both flat and deep-narrow structures from the very beginning of\nthe training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly reduces the computational cost of vision transformers while\nmaintaining comparable performance on image classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 09:56:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 13:15:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 13:24:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 03:08:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 15:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

Existing single-stage methods\nhave their own caveats such as the need for segmentation of the object or\ngenerating individual parts that have to be assembled together to yield the\nfinal model. We address these limitations by proposing a two-stage training\napproach to synthesize auto-colored 3D models. In the first stage, we obtain a\n3D point cloud representing a 3D object, whilst in the second stage, we assign\ncolors to points within such cloud. Next, by leveraging the so-called\ntriangulation trick, we generate a 3D mesh in which the surfaces are colored\nbased on interpolation of colored points representing vertices of a given mesh\ntriangle. This approach allows us to generate a smooth coloring scheme.\nExperimental evaluation shows that our two-stage approach gives better results\nin terms of shape reconstruction and coloring when compared to traditional\nsingle-stage techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 11:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

To simulate this\nsituation, we use our previous work [Grawitter and Stark, Soft Matter 17, 2454\n(2021)], where we implemented the boundary element method in combination with\nthe Cox-Voinov law for the contact-line velocity, to determine the fluid flow\ninside a droplet. After a transient regime the droplet performs steady\noscillations, the amplitude of which decreases with increasing frequency. For\nslow oscillations our numerical results agree well with the linearized\nspherical-cap model. They collapse on a master curve when we rescale frequency\nby a characteristic relaxation time. In contrast, for fast oscillations we\nobserve significant deviations from the master curve. The decay of the\nsusceptibility is weaker and the phase shift between oscillations in\nwettability and contact angle stays below the predicted $\\pi/2$. The reason\nbecomes obvious when studying the combined dynamics of droplet height and\ncontact angle. It reveals non-reciprocal shape changes during one oscillation\nperiod even at low frequencies due to the induced fluid flow inside the\ndroplet, which are not captured by the spherical-cap model.

Those are:\ndigital tracing (PIV), shadow background method (BOS), seedless shadow methods,\nthermographic PIV, velocity measurement in viscous coatings, micro, tomographic\nmodifications of PIV, etc. The actual problem of digital data analyzing in a\npanoramic experiment is touched upon - the problem of big data. Examples of\nmachine learning use in the analysis of big data sets of shadow surveys are\ngiven. Some examples of numerical simulation data visualization (simulation of\nexperimental flowfields) are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 12:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

The main\nproblem is that the computation time and memory necessary for performing the\ncalculations usually grow exponentially with the number of particles $N$. An\nefficient approach to simulate many-body quantum systems is the use of\nclassical approximation. However, it is known that at least at low\ntemperatures, the allowed spin fluctuations in this approach are overestimated\nwhat results in enhanced thermal fluctuations. It is therefore timely and\nimportant to assess the validity of the classical approximation. To this end,\nin this work, we compare the results of numerical calculations of small\nMn$^{3+}$ magnetic clusters in GaN, where the Mn spins are treated classically\nwith those where they are treated quantum-mechanically (crystal field model).\nIn the first case, we solve the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation that\ndescribes the precessional dynamics of spins represented by classical vectors.\nOn the other hand, in the crystal field model, the state of Mn$^{3+}$ ion\n($d^4$ configuration with $S=2$, $L=2$) is characterized by the set of orbital\nand spin quantum numbers $|m_s,m_L>$. Particular attention is paid to use\nnumerical parameters that ensure the same single ion magnetic anisotropy in\nboth classical and quantum approximation.

By using the theory of Taylor bubbles, the dynamic profile of the\ndeposited liquid film is calculated within the lubrication approximation\naccounting for the finiteness of the film length, i.e. for the presence of the\ncontact line. The latter is assumed to be pinned on a surface defect and thus\nimmobile; the contact angle is allowed to vary. The fluid flow effect on the\ncurvature in the central meniscus part is neglected. This curvature varies in\ntime because of the film variation and is determined as a part of the solution.\nThe film dynamics depends on the initial contact angle, which is the maximal\ncontact angle attained during oscillation. The average film thickness is\nstudied as a function of system parameters. The numerical results are compared\nto existing experimental data and to the results of the quasi-steady\napproximation. Finally, the problem of an oscillating meniscus is considered\naccounting for the superheating of the capillary wall with respect to the\nsaturation temperature, which causes evaporation. When the superheating exceeds\na quite low threshold, oscillations with a pinned contact line are impossible\nand the contact line recession caused by evaporation needs to be accounted for.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 13:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

In this paper, we tackle this issue by\nconducting a systematic cross-modal analysis of sensor-algorithm combinations\ntypically used in robotics.

In\nthis paper, we defend the problem setting for improving localization\nperformance by leveraging the bounding box regression knowledge from a\nwell-annotated auxiliary dataset. First, we use the well-annotated auxiliary\ndataset to explore a series of learnable bounding box adjusters (LBBAs) in a\nmulti-stage training manner, which is class-agnostic. Then, only LBBAs and a\nweakly-annotated dataset with non-overlapped classes are used for training\nLBBA-boosted WSOD.

In order to borrow\nstrength across the coordinates, we propose to project these MissCUSUM\nstatistics along a direction found as the solution to a penalised optimisation\nproblem tailored to the specific sparsity structure. The changepoint can then\nbe estimated as the location of the peak of the absolute value of the projected\nunivariate series. In a model that allows different missingness probabilities\nin different component series, we identify that the key interaction between the\nmissingness and the signal is a weighted sum of squares of the signal change in\neach coordinate, with weights given by the observation probabilities. More\nspecifically, we prove that the angle between the estimated and oracle\nprojection directions, as well as the changepoint location error, are\ncontrolled with high probability by the sum of two terms, both involving this\nweighted sum of squares, and representing the error incurred due to noise and\nthe error due to missingness respectively.

Specifically, unlike the widely used 5-dimensional rectangle, the\ngripper configuration is defined as a pair of fingertips. An effective CNN\narchitecture is introduced to localize such fingertips, and with the help of\nauxiliary centers for refinement, it accurately and robustly infers grasp\ncandidates. Additionally, we design a specialized loss function to measure the\nquality of grasps, and in contrast to the IoU scores of bounding boxes adopted\nin object detection, it is more consistent to the grasp detection task. Both\nthe simulation and robotic experiments are executed and state of the art\naccuracies are achieved, showing that DD-Net is superior to the counterparts in\nhandling unseen objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 14:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

We analyzed all available images of the surface of Mercury that have\nsufficient resolution and quality to detect boulders, and we mapped all the\nboulders observed. The lower size limit of detectable boulders was ~5 m. All\nboulders found on Mercury are associated with fresh impact craters hundreds of\nmeters in diameter or larger. We compared boulder population on Mercury with\npopulation of boulders of the same size on the Moon, and found that boulders on\nMercury are ~30 times less abundant than in the lunar highlands. This exact\nquantitative estimate is inherently inaccurate due to the limitation in the\nsource data; however, the significant relative rarity of boulders on Mercury\ncan be firmly and reliably established. We discuss possible causes of the\nobserved difference. Higher thermal stresses and more rapid material fatigue\ndue to diurnal temperature cycling on Mercury may cause rapid disintegration of\nthe upper decimeters of the boulder surface and thus contribute to more rapid\nboulder obliteration; however, these factors alone cannot account for the\nobserved difference. A proposed thicker regolith on Mercury is likely to\nsignificantly reduce boulder production rate. A higher micrometeoritic flux on\nMercury is likely to result in micrometeoritic abrasion being a dominant\ncontributor to boulder degradation; this high abrasion rate likely shortens the\nboulder lifetime. A combination of these factors appears to be able to account\nfor the relative rarity of boulders on Mercury.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 14:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

In this paper, we propose a\ndeep learning-based approach that directly optimizes the beamformers at the\nbase station according to the received uplink pilots, thereby, bypassing the\nexplicit channel estimation. Different from the existing fully data-driven\napproach where all the modules are replaced by deep neural networks (DNNs), a\nneural calibration method is proposed to improve the scalability of the\nend-to-end design. In particular, the backbone of conventional time-efficient\nalgorithms, i.e., the least-squares (LS) channel estimator and the zero-forcing\n(ZF) beamformer, is preserved and DNNs are leveraged to calibrate their inputs\nfor better performance. The permutation equivariance property of the formulated\nresource allocation problem is then identified to design a low-complexity\nneural network architecture.

An observable\nsignature of this exotic pairing is the emergence of a pair of symmetric\nsuperconducting coherence peaks in the density of states at finite energies.\nMoreover, the angular-momentum-resolved density of states in the presence of a\nperturbative Zeeman field reflects the $m_j$ composition of the Cooper pairs.\nWe argue that such finite-energy pairing is a generic feature of $j=3/2$\nsuperconductors, both in presence and absence of inversion symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 14:54:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 01:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

After training, the sparse coding basis functions with a\nhigher degree of sparsity resembled qualitatively different structures, such as\ncurves and corners. The contributions of the models were assessed with image\nclassification tasks, specifically tasks associated with mid-level vision\nincluding figure-ground classification, texture classification, and angle\nprediction between two line stimuli. In addition, the models were assessed in\ncomparison to a texture sensitivity measure that has been reported in V2\n(Freeman et al., 2013), and a deleted-region inference task. The results from\nthe experiments show that while sparse coding performed worse than ICA at\nclassifying images, only sparse coding was able to better match the texture\nsensitivity level of V2 and infer deleted image regions, both by increasing the\ndegree of sparsity in sparse coding.

The local strategy implies the\nignorance of the mutual coupling between subunits, which limits the efficiency\nof targeted sound manipulation, especially in complex environments. By taking\ninto account the ``nonlocal'' interaction among subunits, nonlocal metasurface\noffers an opportunity for accurate control of sound propagation, but the\nrequirement of the consideration of gathering coupling among all subunits, not\njust the nearest-neighbor coupling, greatly increases the complexity of the\nsystem and therefore hinders the explorations of functionalities of nonlocal\nmetasurfaces. In this work, empowered by deep learning algorithms, the complex\ngathering coupling can be learned efficiently from the preset dataset so that\nthe functionalities of nonlocal metasurfaces can be significantly uncovered. As\nan example, we demonstrate that nonlocal metasurfaces, which can redirect an\nincident wave into multi-channel reflections with arbitrary energy ratios, can\nbe accurately predicted by deep learning algorithms. Compared to the theory,\nthe relative error of the energy ratios is less than 1\\%. Furthermore,\nexperiments witness three-channel reflection with three types of energy ratios\nof (1, 0, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), and (1/3, 1/3, 1/3), proving the validity of the\ndeep learning enabled nonlocal metasurfaces.

Previous works focus on\npreserving clothing details ( e.g., texture, logos, patterns ) when\ntransferring desired clothes onto a target person under a fixed pose. However,\nthe performances of existing methods significantly dropped when extending\nexisting methods to multi-pose virtual try-on. In this paper, we propose an\nend-to-end Semantic Prediction Guidance multi-pose Virtual Try-On Network\n(SPG-VTON), which could fit the desired clothing into a reference person under\narbitrary poses. Concretely, SPG-VTON is composed of three sub-modules. First,\na Semantic Prediction Module (SPM) generates the desired semantic map. The\npredicted semantic map provides more abundant guidance to locate the desired\nclothes region and produce a coarse try-on image. Second, a Clothes Warping\nModule (CWM) warps in-shop clothes to the desired shape according to the\npredicted semantic map and the desired pose. Specifically, we introduce a\nconductible cycle consistency loss to alleviate the misalignment in the clothes\nwarping process. Third, a Try-on Synthesis Module (TSM) combines the coarse\nresult and the warped clothes to generate the final virtual try-on image,\npreserving details of the desired clothes and under the desired pose. Besides,\nwe introduce a face identity loss to refine the facial appearance and maintain\nthe identity of the final virtual try-on result at the same time.

Naturally, they perform well at generalizing\nwithin the limits of their target function, but they often fail to generalize\noutside of the explicitly learned feature space. It is therefore an open\nresearch topic whether and how neural network-based architectures can be\ndeployed for systematic reasoning. Many studies have shown evidence for poor\ngeneralization, but they often work with abstract data or are limited to\nsingle-channel input. Humans, however, learn and interact through a combination\nof multiple sensory modalities, and rarely rely on just one. To investigate\ncompositional generalization in a multimodal setting, we generate an extensible\ndataset with multimodal input sequences from simulation. We investigate the\ninfluence of the underlying training data distribution on compostional\ngeneralization in a minimal LSTM-based network trained in a supervised, time\ncontinuous setting. We find compositional generalization to fail in simple\nsetups while improving with the number of objects, actions, and particularly\nwith a lot of color overlaps between objects. Furthermore, multimodality\nstrongly improves compositional generalization in settings where a pure vision\nmodel struggles to generalize.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 12:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

However, it remains\nchallenging to build an efficient end-to-end multimedia application with most\nexisting frameworks.

Further, in terms of adaptability, elastic\ncomputation solutions are much needed as the actual serving workload fluctuates\nconstantly, and scaling the hardware resources to handle the fluctuating\nworkload is typically infeasible. To address these challenges, we introduce\nSINGA-Easy, a new deep learning framework that provides distributed\nhyper-parameter tuning at the training stage, dynamic computational cost\ncontrol at the inference stage, and intuitive user interactions with multimedia\ncontents facilitated by model explanation. Our experiments on the training and\ndeployment of multi-modality data analysis applications show that the framework\nis both usable and adaptable to dynamic inference loads.

In order to learn the\nradio-geometry map and capture the relative position of each UE, an\nautoencoder-based channel chart is constructed in an unsupervised manner, such\nthat neighboring UEs in the physical space will remain close in the channel\nchart. Next, the channel charting model is extended to a semi-supervised\nframework, where the autoencoder is divided into two components: an encoder and\na decoder, and each component is optimized individually, using the labeled CSI\ndataset with associated location information, to further improve positioning\naccuracy.
