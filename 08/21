We use\namortized neural posterior estimation to produce a model that approximates the\nhigh-dimensional posterior distribution for spectroscopic observations of\nselected spectral ranges sampled at arbitrary rotation phases. The posterior\ndistribution is approximated with conditional normalizing flows, which are\nflexible, tractable and easy to sample approximations to arbitrary\ndistributions.

Our holographic analysis is complemented\nby the study of circuit complexity in a two dimensional free scalar model for a\nthermofield double (TFD) state with angular momentum. We show how this can be\ngiven a description in terms of non-rotating TFD states introducing\nmode-by-mode effective temperatures and times. We comment on the similarities\nand differences of the holographic and QFT complexity results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 17:18:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 20:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

However, it is not possible to describe\nthe synchronization of multiple processes. Furthermore, both restricted forms\nof shuffling are not associative. Here, we extend the literal shuffle and the\ninitial literal shuffle to multiple arguments. We also introduce iterated\nversions, much different from the iterated ones previously introduced for the\nbinary literal and initial literal shuffle. We investigate formal properties,\nand show that in terms of expressive power, in a full trio, they coincide with\nthe general shuffle. Furthermore, we look at closure properties with respect to\nthe regular, context-free, context-sensitive, recursive and recursively\nenumerable languages for all operations introduced. Then, we investigate\nvarious decision problems motivated by analogous problems for the (ordinary)\nshuffle operation. Most problems we look at are tractable, but we also identify\none intractable decision problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 17:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

In the model, a\npacking is described as an arrangement of $k$ helical sections, separated by\ndefects, that have alternating helical twist directions and where all spheres\nsatisfy local jamming constraints. The structure of each helical section is\ndetermined by a single helical twist angle, and a jammed packing is obtained by\nminimizing the length of the channel per particle with respect to the $k$\nhelical section angles. An analysis of a small system of $N=20$ spheres shows\nthat the basins on the inherent structure landscape associated with these\nhelical arrangements split into a number of distinct jammed states separated by\nlow barriers giving rise to a degree of hierarchical organization. The model\naccurately predicts the geometric properties of packings generated using the\nLubachevsky and Stillinger compression scheme ($N=10^4$) and provides insight\ninto the nature of the probability distribution of helical section lengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 17:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

In this paper we point out that\nsince the CMB polarization is produced at two very different redshifts - it is\ngenerated at both reionization and recombination - new parity-violating physics\ncan generically rotate the polarization signals from these different sources by\ndifferent amounts. We explore two implications of this. First, measurements of\nCMB birefringence are challenging because the effect is degenerate with a\nmiscalibration of CMB polarization angles; however, by taking the difference of\nthe reionization and recombination birefringence angles (measured from\ndifferent CMB angular scales), we can obtain a cosmological signal that is\nimmune to instrumental angle miscalibration. Second, we note that the\ncombination with other methods for probing birefringence can give tomographic\ninformation, constraining the redshift origin of any physics producing\nbirefringence. We forecast that the difference of the reionization and\nrecombination birefringence angles can be competitively determined to within\n~0.05 degrees for future CMB satellites such as LiteBIRD. Although much further\nwork is needed, we argue that foreground mitigation for this measurement should\nbe less challenging than for inflationary B-mode searches on similar scales due\nto larger signals and lower foregrounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 17:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

We then derive a novel,\nstrictly-proper VCG scoring mechanism for the liquidity-constrained setting.\nWhereas Chen et al. [2011] give an impossibility result for an analogous\nsetting in which sequential reports are made in the context of decision\nmarkets, we achieve a positive result through appeal to interim beliefs about\nthe reports of others in a setting with simultaneous reports.Moreover, the use\nof VCG methods allows for the integration of linear belief aggregation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 17:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

We note that the best existing multi-label ZSL method takes a\nshared approach towards attending to region features with a common set of\nattention maps for all the classes. Such shared maps lead to diffused\nattention, which does not discriminatively focus on relevant locations when the\nnumber of classes are large. Moreover, mapping spatially-pooled visual features\nto the class semantics leads to inter-class feature entanglement, thus\nhampering the classification. Here, we propose an alternate approach towards\nregion-based discriminability-preserving multi-label zero-shot classification.\nOur approach maintains the spatial resolution to preserve region-level\ncharacteristics and utilizes a bi-level attention module (BiAM) to enrich the\nfeatures by incorporating both region and scene context information.

In particular, we find\nthat the topological string partition function of a smooth genus one fibered\nCalabi-Yau threefold is transformed into that of a non-commutative resolution\nof the Jacobian by a Fricke involution. In the case of Calabi-Yau threefolds,\nwe propose an expansion of the partition functions of a singular fibration and\nits non-commutative resolutions in terms of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants that are\nassociated to BPS states with discrete charges. For genus one fibrations with\n5-sections, this provides an enumerative interpretation for the partition\nfunctions that arise at certain irrational points of maximally unipotent\nmonodromy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Previous studies have demonstrated\nthat varying magnetic properties of a coronal flux rope system could result in\na catastrophe of the rope, which may trigger solar eruptive activities. Since\nthe total mass of a flux rope also plays an important role in stabilizing the\nrope, we use 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulations in\nthis letter to investigate how a flux rope evolves as its total mass varies. It\nis found that an unloading process that decreases the total mass of the rope\ncould result in an upward (eruptive) catastrophe in the flux rope system,\nduring which the rope jumps upward and the magnetic energy is released. This\nindicates that mass unloading processes could initiate the eruption of the flux\nrope. Moreover, when the system is not too diffusive, there is also a downward\n(confined) catastrophe that could be caused by mass loading processes, via\nwhich the total mass accumulates. The magnetic energy, however, is increased\nduring the downward catastrophe, indicating that mass loading processes could\ncause confined activities that may contribute to the storage of energy before\nthe onset of coronal eruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 23:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

Synchronization\nrequirement is often used to ensure that the execution of the concurrent\nprogram can be serialized. Without synchronization requirement, a program\nsuffers from consistency violations. Recently, it was shown that if programs\nare designed to tolerate such consistency violation faults (\\cvf{s}) then one\ncan obtain substantial performance gain. Previous efforts to analyze the effect\nof \\cvf-tolerance are limited to run-time analysis of the program to determine\nif tolerating \\cvf{s} can improve the performance. Such run-time analysis is\nvery expensive and provides limited insight.\n  In this work, we consider the question, `Can static analysis of the program\npredict the benefit of \\cvf-tolerance?' We find that the answer to this\nquestion is affirmative. Specifically, we use static analysis to evaluate the\ncost of a \\cvf and demonstrate that it can be used to predict the benefit of\n\\cvf-tolerance. We also find that when faced with a large state space, partial\nanalysis of the state space (via sampling) also provides the required\ninformation to predict the benefit of \\cvf-tolerance. Furthermore, we observe\nthat the \\cvf-cost distribution is exponential in nature, i.e., the probability\nthat a \\cvf has a cost of $c$ is $A.B^{-c}$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants,\ni.e., most \\cvf{s} cause no/low perturbation whereas a small number of \\cvf{s}\ncause a large perturbation.

Efficiently executing\nlossless compression has become a practical problem. Commonly, it is hard to\nmake accurate probability estimates for each pixel. To tackle this, we propose\nL3C-Stereo, a multi-scale lossless compression model consisting of two main\nmodules: the warping module and the probability estimation module. The warping\nmodule takes advantage of two view feature maps from the same domain to\ngenerate a disparity map, which is used to reconstruct the right view so as to\nimprove the confidence of the probability estimate of the right view. The\nprobability estimation module provides pixel-wise logistic mixture\ndistributions for adaptive arithmetic coding.

In the case of smooth films, the systems\nare also studied using solutions to the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE).\nInterestingly, the resistivity of $(1 \\bar{1}00)$ surfaces exhibits a\nsignificant size effect even in the absence of surface steps. When\nmonolayer-high steps are spaced $\\sim 10$ nm apart, the resistivity is shown to\nincrease due to scattering from the steps.

Current\nmethods mainly focus on instance-wise comparisons to learn the global\ndiscriminative features, however, pretermitting the local details to\ndistinguish tiny anatomical structures, lesions, and tissues. To address this\nchallenge, in this paper, we propose a general unsupervised representation\nlearning framework, named local discrimination (LD), to learn local\ndiscriminative features for medical images by closely embedding semantically\nsimilar pixels and identifying regions of similar structures across different\nimages. Specifically, this model is equipped with an embedding module for\npixel-wise embedding and a clustering module for generating segmentation. And\nthese two modules are unified through optimizing our novel region\ndiscrimination loss function in a mutually beneficial mechanism, which enables\nour model to reflect structure information as well as measure pixel-wise and\nregion-wise similarity.

The technique works by sending a low-intensity\nbeam of protons through the patient and measuring the position, direction, and\nenergy loss of each exiting proton. The pCT technique allows reconstruction of\nthe volumetric distribution of the relative stopping power (RSP) of the patient\ntissues for use in treatment planning and pre-treatment range verification.

We\ndemonstrate enhancement (suppression) of the trapping effect in the case of\ncounter-rotating (co-rotating) null geodesics due to the behavior of the\neffective potentials and escape cones of the null geodesics in the linearised\nHartle--Thorne--Tolman VII spacetimes. In dependence on the parameters of these\nspacetimes we determine the \"local\" and \"global\" coefficients of efficiency of\nthe trapping and compare the results to those related to the rotating\nspacetimes based on the internal Schwarzschild spacetimes. We demonstrate that\nin the Tolman VII spacetimes the trapping is more efficient, being allowed in\nobjects with radii larger than those of the trapping internal Schwarzschild\nspacetimes, occurring even for $R>3.3M$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2021 09:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

We\npresent a broadly applicable complementary measurement framework that\nquantifies resilience similarly to basin stability by estimating a \"resilience\nbasin\" which represents the extent of adverse influences that the system can\nrecover from in a sufficient manner.\n  As a proof of concept, the resilience measurement framework is applied to a\nstochastic low-voltage DC power grid model which faces the unregulated rise of\ndecentralized energy supply by solar-powered prosumers. Two response options\nare examined regarding their resilience effect and efficiency: Upgrading the\nload capacity of existing power lines and installing batteries in the prosumer\nhouseholds.\n  The framework is able to show that line upgrades, while being more laborious\nto execute, can provide potentially unlimited resilience against energy\ndecentralization. Household batteries, on the other hand, are simpler to\nrealize but also inherently limited in terms of their resilience benefit\n(achieving only 70% of the resilience of line upgrades in our scenario). This\nis explained by considering that they can only reduce fluctuations in the power\nflows, but not the mean flow magnitude.

Unlike the common case in which the leader's speed is constant\nand different kinds of Proportional-Integral-Derivative controllers are\nimplemented, in this case, the fact that the leader has a time-varying speed\nnecessitates the design of an observer. First, in order to estimate its\nposition, speed and acceleration error with respect to the leader, each\nfollower designs an observer. The observer is designed by means of constructing\nan observer matrix whose parameters should be determined. We simplifies the\ndesign of the matrix of the observer in such a way that the design boils down\nto choosing a scalar value. The resulting observer turns out to have a third\norder integrator dynamics, which provides an advantage of simplifying the\ncontroller structure and, hence, derive conditions for string stability using a\nfrequency response method.

A multi-antenna base station\n(BS) and multiple single-antenna users are considered in these systems. A huge\nportion of the system resources is dedicated as orthogonal pilots for accurate\nchannel estimation which imposes a huge training overhead. This overhead can be\nhighly mitigated by exploiting intrinsic angular domain sparsity of massive\nMIMO channels and the sporadic traffic of users, i.e., few number of users are\nactive to sent or receive data in each coherence interval. In fact, the angles\nof arrivals (AoAs) coming from active users are continuous parameters and can\ntake any arbitrary values. Besides, the AoAs corresponding to each active user\nare alongside each other forming a specific cluster. This work revolves around\nexploiting these features. Specifically, a blind clustering-based algorithm is\nproposed that not only recovers the transmitted data by users in grant free\nrandom access and primary pilots in random access blocks of coherent\ntransmission, but also provides accurate channel estimation.

First, we show that curvature\nharms test performance through two new mechanisms, the shift-curvature and\nbias-curvature, in addition to a known parameter-covariance mechanism. The\nthree curvature-mediated contributions to test performance are\nreparametrization-invariant although curvature is not. The shift in the\nshift-curvature is the line connecting train and test local minima, which\ndiffer due to dataset sampling or distribution shift. Although the shift is\nunknown at training time, the shift-curvature can still be mitigated by\nminimizing overall curvature. Second, we derive a new, explicit SGD\nsteady-state distribution showing that SGD optimizes an effective potential\nrelated to but different from train loss, and that SGD noise mediates a\ntrade-off between deep versus low-curvature regions of this effective\npotential. Third, combining our test performance analysis with the SGD steady\nstate shows that for small SGD noise, the shift-curvature may be the most\nsignificant of the three mechanisms.

However, GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing\nworks mainly focus on attacking GNNs for node classification; nevertheless, the\nattacks against GNNs for graph classification have not been well explored.\n  In this work, we conduct a systematic study on adversarial attacks against\nGNNs for graph classification via perturbing the graph structure. In\nparticular, we focus on the most challenging attack, i.e., hard label black-box\nattack, where an attacker has no knowledge about the target GNN model and can\nonly obtain predicted labels through querying the target model.To achieve this\ngoal, we formulate our attack as an optimization problem, whose objective is to\nminimize the number of edges to be perturbed in a graph while maintaining the\nhigh attack success rate. The original optimization problem is intractable to\nsolve, and we relax the optimization problem to be a tractable one, which is\nsolved with theoretical convergence guarantee. We also design a coarse-grained\nsearching algorithm and a query-efficient gradient computation algorithm to\ndecrease the number of queries to the target GNN model. Our experimental\nresults on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our attack can\neffectively attack representative GNNs for graph classification with less\nqueries and perturbations. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our attack\nunder two defenses: one is well-designed adversarial graph detector and the\nother is that the target GNN model itself is equipped with a defense to prevent\nadversarial graph generation. Our experimental results show that such defenses\nare not effective enough, which highlights more advanced defenses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2021 14:01:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 03:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

Current mmW technologies rely on analog\nphased arrays to realize beamforming gain and overcome high path loss. However,\ndue to a limited number of simultaneous beams that can be created with\nanalog/hybrid phased antenna arrays, the overheads of beam training and beam\nscheduling become a bottleneck for emerging networks that need to support a\nlarge number of users and low latency applications. This paper introduces\nrainbow-link, a novel multiple access protocol, that can achieve low latency\nand massive connectivity by exploiting wide bandwidth at mmW frequencies and\nnovel analog true-time-delay array architecture with frequency dependent\nbeamforming capability. In the proposed design, the network infrastructure is\nequipped with the true-time-delay array to simultaneously steer different\nfrequency resource blocks towards distinct directions covering the entire cell\nsector. Users or devices, equipped with a narrowband receiver and either a\nsingle antenna or small phased antenna array, connect to the network based on\ntheir angular positions by selecting frequency resources within their rainbow\nbeam allocation. Rainbow-link is combined with a contention-based grant-free\naccess to eliminate the explicit beam training and user scheduling. The\nproposed design and analysis show that rainbow-link grant-free access is a\npotential candidate for latency-critical use cases within massive connectivity.\nOur results show that, given less than 1e-5 probability of packet loss, a\nrainbow-link cell, over 1 GHz bandwidth using 64 element antenna array, attains\nsub-millisecond user-plane latency and Mbps user rates with an approximate 400m\nline-of-sight coverage and a density of up to 5 active single antenna users per\nsecond per meter square.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2021 11:46:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 04:24:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2022 03:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Typically, the production hall is\nequipped with satellites which receive position data of sensors that can be\npinned on components, load carriers or industrial trucks. This enables a\ncompany e.g. to reduce search efforts and to optimize individual system\nprocesses. In our research context, a sensor only sends position information\nwhen it is moved. However, various circumstances frequently affect that data is\nundesirably sent, e.g. due to disrupting factors nearby. This has a negative\nimpact on the data quality, the energy consumption, and the reliability of the\nwhole system. Motivated by this, we aim to distinguish between actual movements\nand signals that were undesirably sent which is in particular challenging due\nto the susceptibility of indoor systems in terms of noise and measuring errors.\nTherefore, we propose two novel unsupervised classification algorithms suitable\nfor this task. Depending on the question of interest, they rely either on a\ndistance-based or on a time-based criterion, which allows to make use of all\nessential information. Furthermore, we propose an approach to combine both\nclassifications and to aggregate them on spatial production areas. This enables\nus to generate a comprehensive map of the underlying production hall with the\nsole usage of the position data. Aside from the analysis and detection of the\nunderlying movement structure, the user benefits from a better understanding of\nown system processes and from the detection of problematic system areas which\nleads to a more efficient usage of positioning systems. Since all our\napproaches are constructed with unsupervised techniques, they are handily\napplicable in practice and do not require more information than the output data\nof the positioning system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2021 10:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

This paper aims at improving the\nperformance of FDO, thus, the chaotic theory is used inside FDO to propose\nChaotic FDO (CFDO). Ten chaotic maps are used in the CFDO to consider which of\nthem are performing well to avoid local optima and finding global optima.
