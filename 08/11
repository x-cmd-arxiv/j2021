Since precision medicine focuses on the\nuse of patient characteristics to guide treatment, contextual bandit algorithms\nare especially useful since they are designed to take such information into\naccount. The role of bandit algorithms in areas of precision medicine such as\nmobile health and digital phenotyping has been reviewed before (Tewari and\nMurphy, 2017; Rabbi et al., 2019). Since these reviews were published, bandit\nalgorithms have continued to find uses in mobile health and several new topics\nhave emerged in the research on bandit algorithms. This chapter is written for\nquantitative researchers in fields such as statistics, machine learning, and\noperations research who might be interested in knowing more about the\nalgorithmic and mathematical details of bandit algorithms that have been used\nin mobile health.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 16:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Modular verification of programs that make use of these\nlibraries naturally rely on specifications that capture important properties\nabout how the library expects these data structures to be accessed and\nmanipulated. However, these specifications are often missing or incomplete,\nmaking it hard for clients to be confident they are using the library safely.\nWhen library source code is also unavailable, as is often the case, the\nchallenge to infer meaningful specifications is further exacerbated. In this\npaper, we present a novel data-driven abductive inference mechanism that infers\nspecifications for library methods sufficient to enable verification of the\nlibrary's clients. Our technique combines a data-driven learning-based\nframework to postulate candidate specifications, along with SMT-provided\ncounterexamples to refine these candidates, taking special care to prevent\ngenerating specifications that overfit to sampled tests. The resulting\nspecifications form a minimal set of requirements on the behavior of library\nimplementations that ensures safety of a particular client program. Our\nsolution thus provides a new multi-abduction procedure for precise\nspecification inference of data structure libraries guided by client-side\nverification tasks.

This\nphysical picture accounts for interactions among propagating (i.e., plane wave\nmodulated) vibrational modes in an ideal crystal, but it becomes problematic\nwhen describing non-propagating modes arising in realistic non-idealized\nsystems. Here, we introduce a more general formalism for studying phonon\ntransport, which involves projection of the interatomic interactions themselves\n(i.e., not just the atom motion), onto the normal modes of the system. This\nshows, for the first time, how energy is exchanged between modes in real-time\nduring molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, as opposed to other MD methods\nwhich use inferences based on correlations, or other time averaged schemes that\ndo not preserve specific features in the real-time dynamics. Applying this\nformalism to the example case of modes interacting in a superlattice, we\nillustrate a new perspective on how phonon transport occurs, whereby individual\nnormal modes share energy through specific channels of interaction with other\nmodes. We also highlight that while a myriad of interaction pathways exist,\nonly a tiny fraction of these pathways actually transfer significant amounts of\nenergy, which is surprising. The approach allows for the prediction and\nsimulation of these mode/phonon interactions, thus unveiling the real-time\ndynamics of phonon behavior and advancing our ability to understanding and\nengineer phonon transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 17:13:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Inflation produces a cold vector condensate\nconsisting of an enormous number of bosons, which via interesting processes -\nSchwinger pair production, strong field electromagnetic cascades, and plasma\ndynamics - transfers its energy to a small number of \"dark electrons\" and\ntriggers thermalization of the dark sector.

In view of the great potential\nof this effect for applications in those fields of science and industry, where\nliquids occur under strong confinement (e.g., nano-technology), the number of\nresearchers studying various aspects and consequences of this non-monotonic\nbehaviour has been rapidly growing. This review aims at providing an overview\nof the research activity in this newly emerging field. We first briefly discuss\nhow competing mechanisms such as packing effects and short-range attraction may\nlead to a non-monotonic glass transition scenario in the bulk. We then analyse\nconfinement effects on the dynamics of fluids using a thermodynamic route which\nrelates the single particle dynamics to the excess entropy. Moreover, relating\nthe diffusive dynamics to the Widom's insertion probability, the oscillations\nof the local dynamics with density at moderate densities are fairly well\ndescribed. At high densities belonging to the supercooled regime, however, this\napproach breaks down signaling the onset of strongly collective effects.\nIndeed, confinement introduces a new length scale which in the limit of high\ndensities and small pore sizes competes with the short-range local order of the\nfluid. This gives rise to a non-monotonic dependence of the packing structure\non confinement, with a corresponding effect on the dynamics of structural\nrelaxation. This non-monotonic effect occurs also in the case of a cone-plate\ntype channel, where the degree of confinement varies with distance from the\napex.

We considered two\ninverse probability weighted (IPW) estimators to quantify the population-level\neffects of non-randomized interventions on subsequent health outcomes. We\ndemonstrated that these two IPW estimators are consistent, asymptotically\nnormal, and derived a closed-form estimator for the asymptotic variance, while\nallowing for overlapping interference sets (groups of individuals in which the\ninterference is assumed possible).

Several works show that in general low-mass and\nintermediate-mass planets migrate towards the central star, unless corotation\ntorques become dominant. Recently, a new kind of torque, called the thermal\ntorque, was proposed as a new source that can generate outward migration of\nlow-mass planets. While the Lindblad and corotation torques depend mostly on\nthe properties of the protoplanetary disc and on the planet mass, the thermal\ntorque depends also on the luminosity of the planet, arising mainly from the\naccretion of solids. Thus, the accretion of solids plays an important role not\nonly in the formation of the planet but also in its migration process. In a\nprevious work, we evaluated the thermal torque effects on planetary growth and\nmigration mainly in the planetesimal accretion paradigm. In this new work, we\nstudy the role of the thermal torque within the pebble accretion paradigm.\nComputations are carried out consistently in the framework of a global model of\nplanet formation that includes disc evolution, dust growth and evolution, and\npebble formation. We also incorporate updated prescriptions of the thermal\ntorque derived from high resolution hydrodynamical simulations. Our simulations\nshow that the thermal torque generates extended regions of outward migration in\nlow viscosity discs. This has a significant impact in the formation of the\nplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 19:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Marriage is implemented in the model by adding\nthe decision of stopping searching for a better mate when the affinity between\na couple is higher than a certain fixed amount. We show that the average\nutility in the system with marriage can be higher than in the system without\nit. Part of our results can be summarized in what sounds like a piece of\nadvice: don't marry the first person you like and don't search for the love of\nyour life, but get married if you like your partner more than a sigma above\naverage.

In a multidimensional model, a subset of attributes\ncalled the quasi-identifiers (QI) are used to define the space and a\ngeneralization scheme corresponds to a partitioning of the data space. The\nprocess of sanitization can be modeled as a constrained optimization problem\nwhere the information loss metric is to be minimized while ensuring that the\nprivacy criteria are enforced. The privacy requirements translate into\nconstraints on the partitions (bins), like minimum occupancy constraints for\nk-anonymity, value diversity constraint for l-diversity etc. Most algorithms\nproposed till date use some greedy search heuristic to search for a locally\noptimal generalization scheme. The performance of such algorithms degrade\nrapidly as the constraints are made more complex and numerous. To address this\nissue, in this paper we develop a complete enumeration based systematic search\nframework that searches for the globally optimal generalization scheme amongst\nall feasible candidates. We employ a novel enumeration technique that\neliminates duplicates and develop effective pruning heuristics that cut down\nthe solution space in order to make the search tractable. Our scheme is\nversatile enough to accommodate multiple constraints and information loss\nfunctions satisfying a set of generic properties (that are usually satisfied by\nmost metrics proposed in literature). Additionally, our approach allows the\nuser to specify various stopping criteria and can give a bound on the\napproximation factor achieved by any candidate solution. Finally, we carry out\nextensive experimentation whose results illustrate the power of our algorithm\nand its advantage over other competing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 19:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

I demonstrate that, by choosing the\nright parameters for the oscillator bath model such that it induces the same\nrate and amount of bias energy fluctuations as those of the spin bath, the\noscillator bath model can produce a relaxation rate equivalent to that of the\nspin bath model. This result implies that, as far as the relaxation rate is\nconcerned, the distinction between the oscillator bath model and the spin bath\nmodel is far less than has been previously recognized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 20:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

We evaluate the performance of the proposed design in\nseveral scenarios and show that the introduced technique performs similar to a\nlarge array of antennas while attaining a much simpler hardware architecture.\nResults show that the spectrum shaping with only two antennas placed 0.5 mm, 5\nmm, and 1 cm apart performs direction of arrival estimation similar to a much\nmore complex uniform linear array equipped with 7, 60, and 120 antennas,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 21:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

In line with our\nfindings, it has recently been demonstrated that conventional fully connected\nneural networks (FCNN) are incapable of making accurate predictions of force\nvariations in a static bed of spheres. The problem arises due to the large\nnumber of input variables (i.e., the locations of individual neighboring\nparticles) leading to an overwhelmingly large number of training parameters in\na fully connected architecture. Given the typically limited size of training\ndatasets that can be generated by particle-resolved simulations, the NN becomes\nprone to missing true patterns in the data, ultimately leading to overfitting.\nInspired by our observations in developing the microstructure-informed\nprobability-driven point-particle (MPP) model, we incorporate two main features\nin the architecture of the present PINN model: 1) superposition of pairwise\nhydrodynamic interactions between particles, and 2) sharing training parameters\nbetween NN blocks that model neighbor influences. These strategies helps to\nsubstantially reduce the number of free parameters and thereby control the\nmodel complexity without compromising accuracy. We demonstrate that direct\nforce and torque prediction using NNs is indeed possible, provided that the\nmodel structure corresponds to the underlying physics of the problem. For a\nReynolds number range of 2 <= Re <= 150 and solid volume fractions of 0.1 <=\nphi <= 0.4, the PINN's predictions prove to be as accurate as those of other\nmicrostructure-informed models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 23:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

Watermarking should be robust against watermark\nremoval attacks that derive a surrogate model that evades provenance\nverification. Many watermarking schemes that claim robustness have been\nproposed, but their robustness is only validated in isolation against a\nrelatively small set of attacks. There is no systematic, empirical evaluation\nof these claims against a common, comprehensive set of removal attacks. This\nuncertainty about a watermarking scheme's robustness causes difficulty to trust\ntheir deployment in practice. In this paper, we evaluate whether recently\nproposed watermarking schemes that claim robustness are robust against a large\nset of removal attacks. We survey methods from the literature that (i) are\nknown removal attacks, (ii) derive surrogate models but have not been evaluated\nas removal attacks, and (iii) novel removal attacks. Weight shifting and smooth\nretraining are novel removal attacks adapted to the DNN watermarking schemes\nsurveyed in this paper. We propose taxonomies for watermarking schemes and\nremoval attacks. Our empirical evaluation includes an ablation study over sets\nof parameters for each attack and watermarking scheme on the CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet datasets. Surprisingly, none of the surveyed watermarking schemes is\nrobust in practice. We find that schemes fail to withstand adaptive attacks and\nknown methods for deriving surrogate models that have not been evaluated as\nremoval attacks. This points to intrinsic flaws in how robustness is currently\nevaluated. We show that watermarking schemes need to be evaluated against a\nmore extensive set of removal attacks with a more realistic adversary model.\nOur source code and a complete dataset of evaluation results are publicly\navailable, which allows to independently verify our conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 00:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

In particular, such attacks cause serious problems in medical\nimaging. Given that computer-based systems are generally operated under a\nblack-box condition in which only queries on inputs are allowed and outputs are\naccessible, the impact of UAPs seems to be limited because well-used algorithms\nfor generating UAPs are limited to a white-box condition in which adversaries\ncan access the model weights and loss gradients. Nevertheless, we demonstrate\nthat UAPs are easily generatable using a relatively small dataset under\nblack-box conditions.

Black-box UAPs can be used to conduct both non-targeted\nand targeted attacks. Overall, the black-box UAPs showed high attack success\nrates (40% to 90%), although some of them had relatively low success rates\nbecause the method only utilizes limited information to generate UAPs. The\nvulnerability of black-box UAPs was observed in several model architectures.\nThe results indicate that adversaries can also generate UAPs through a simple\nprocedure under the black-box condition to foil or control DNN-based medical\nimage diagnoses, and that UAPs are a more realistic security threat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 00:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

However, demographic bias\namong different racial cohorts still challenges the practical face recognition\nsystem. The race factor has been proven to be a dilemma for fair FR (FFR) as\nthe subject-related specific attributes induce the classification bias whilst\ncarrying some useful cues for FR. To mitigate racial bias and meantime preserve\nrobust FR, we abstract face identity-related representation as a signal\ndenoising problem and propose a progressive cross transformer (PCT) method for\nfair face recognition. Originating from the signal decomposition theory, we\nattempt to decouple face representation into i) identity-related components and\nii) noisy/identity-unrelated components induced by race. As an extension of\nsignal subspace decomposition, we formulate face decoupling as a generalized\nfunctional expression model to cross-predict face identity and race\ninformation. The face expression model is further concretized by designing dual\ncross-transformers to distill identity-related components and suppress racial\nnoises. In order to refine face representation, we take a progressive face\ndecoupling way to learn identity/race-specific transformations, so that\nidentity-unrelated components induced by race could be better disentangled. We\nevaluate the proposed PCT on the public fair face recognition benchmarks (BFW,\nRFW) and verify that PCT is capable of mitigating bias in face recognition\nwhile achieving state-of-the-art FR performance.

The log-mel feature\nand convolutional neural network (CNN) have recently become the most popular\ntime-frequency (TF) feature representation and classifier in ASC. An audio\nsignal recorded in a scene may include various sounds overlapping in time and\nfrequency. The previous study suggests that separately considering the\nlong-duration sounds and short-duration sounds in CNN may improve ASC accuracy.\nThis study addresses the problem of the generalization ability of acoustic\nscene classifiers. In practice, acoustic scene signals' characteristics may be\naffected by various factors, such as the choice of recording devices and the\nchange of recording locations. When an established ASC system predicts scene\nclasses on audios recorded in unseen scenarios, its accuracy may drop\nsignificantly. The long-duration sounds not only contain domain-independent\nacoustic scene information, but also contain channel information determined by\nthe recording conditions, which is prone to over-fitting. For a more robust ASC\nsystem, We propose a robust feature learning (RFL) framework to train the CNN.\nThe RFL framework down-weights CNN learning specifically on long-duration\nsounds. The proposed method is to train an auxiliary classifier with only\nlong-duration sound information as input. The auxiliary classifier is trained\nwith an auxiliary loss function that assigns less learning weight to poorly\nclassified examples than the standard cross-entropy loss. The experimental\nresults show that the proposed RFL framework can obtain a more robust acoustic\nscene classifier towards unseen devices and cities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 03:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

So far, much effort has been devoted to\ndeveloping effective neural ranking models that can generalize well on new\ndata. There has been less attention paid to the robustness perspective. Unlike\nthe effectiveness which is about the average performance of a system under\nnormal purpose, robustness cares more about the system performance in the worst\ncase or under malicious operations instead. When a new technique enters into\nthe real-world application, it is critical to know not only how it works in\naverage, but also how would it behave in abnormal situations. So we raise the\nquestion in this work: Are neural ranking models robust? To answer this\nquestion, firstly, we need to clarify what we refer to when we talk about the\nrobustness of ranking models in IR. We show that robustness is actually a\nmulti-dimensional concept and there are three ways to define it in IR: 1) The\nperformance variance under the independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.)\nsetting; 2) The out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability; and 3) The\ndefensive ability against adversarial operations. The latter two definitions\ncan be further specified into two different perspectives respectively, leading\nto 5 robustness tasks in total. Based on this taxonomy, we build corresponding\nbenchmark datasets, design empirical experiments, and systematically analyze\nthe robustness of several representative neural ranking models against\ntraditional probabilistic ranking models and learning-to-rank (LTR) models. The\nempirical results show that there is no simple answer to our question.

The field of analysing\nthe data is called data mining. Unfortunately, the amount of data is quite\nlarge: the data do not fit into main memory and the processing time can become\nquite huge. Therefore, we need parallel data mining algorithms. One of the\npopular and important data mining algorithm is the algorithm for generation of\nso called frequent itemsets. The problem of mining of frequent itemsets can be\nexplained on the following example: customers goes in a store put into theirs\nbaskets some goods; the owner of the store collects the baskets and wants to\nknow the set of goods that are bought together in at least p% of the baskets.\nCurrently, the sequential algorithms for mining of frequent itemsets are quite\ngood in the means of performance. However, the parallel algorithms for mining\nof frequent itemsets still do not achieve good speedup. In this thesis, we\ndevelop a parallel method for mining of frequent itemsets that can be used for\nan arbitrary depth first search sequential algorithms on a distributed memory\nparallel computer. Our method achieves speedup of ~ 6 on 10 processors. The\nmethod is based on an approximate estimation of processor load from a database\nsample - however it always computes the set of frequent itemsets from the whole\ndatabase. In this thesis, we show a theory underlying our method and show the\nperformance of the estimation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 05:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

Due to periodical tidal and daily climatic variation, underwater\nnoise is periodically fluctuating, which result in the periodical changing of\nacoustic channel quality in long-term. Also, time-variant channel quality leads\nto routing failure. Routing protocols with acoustic channel estimation, namely\nunderwater channel-aware routing protocols are recently proposed to maintain\nthe routing performance. However, channel estimation algorithms for these\nrouting protocols are mostly linear and rarely consider periodicity of acoustic\nchannels. In this paper, we introduce acoustic channel estimation based on\nnearest neighbor regression for underwater acoustic networks. We extend nearest\nneighbor regression for SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) time series prediction,\nproviding an outstanding prediction accuracy for intricately periodical and\nfluctuating received SNR time series. Moreover, we propose a quick search\nalgorithm and use statistical storage compression to optimize the time and\nspace complexity of the algorithm. In contrast with linear methods, this\nalgorithm significantly improves channel prediction accuracy (over three times\nat most) on both simulation and sea trial data sets. With this channel\nestimation method, we then propose a Depth-Based Channel-Aware Routing protocol\n(DBCAR). Taking advantage of depth-greedy forwarding and channel-aware reliable\ncommunication, DBCAR has an outstanding network performance on packet delivery\nratio, average energy consumption and average transmission delay which is\nvalidated through extensive simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 06:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 12:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

In this work, we turn to a\ndramatically different way to address this problem with a top-down design\nphilosophy. Instead of explicitly formulating and fusing different masking\neffects in a bottom-up way, the proposed JND estimation model dedicates to\nfirst predicting a critical perceptual lossless (CPL) counterpart of the\noriginal image and then calculating the difference map between the original\nimage and the predicted CPL image as the JND map. We conduct subjective\nexperiments to determine the critical points of 500 images and find that the\ndistribution of cumulative normalized KLT coefficient energy values over all\n500 images at these critical points can be well characterized by a Weibull\ndistribution.

On\none hand, modern QA methods rely on deep learning models which are typically\ndata-hungry. Therefore, it is expected to collect and fuse all the available QA\ndatasets together in a common site for developing a powerful QA model. On the\nother hand, real-world QA datasets are typically distributed in the form of\nisolated islands belonging to different parties. Due to the increasing\nawareness of privacy security, it is almost impossible to integrate the data\nscattered around, or the cost is prohibited. A possible solution to this\ndilemma is a new approach known as federated learning, which is a\nprivacy-preserving machine learning technique over distributed datasets. In\nthis work, we propose to adopt federated learning for QA with the special\nconcern on the statistical heterogeneity of the QA data.

The shared backbone is to distill the common\nknowledge of all the participants while the private patch is a compact and\nefficient module to retain the domain information for each participant. To\nfacilitate the evaluation, we build a benchmark collection based on several QA\ndatasets from different domains to simulate the heterogeneous situation in\npractice.

Existing studies on unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) can\nbe generalized into two families-algorithms that attain unbiasedness with\nlogged data, offline learning, and algorithms that achieve unbiasedness by\nestimating unbiased parameters with real-time user interactions, namely online\nlearning. While there exist many algorithms from both families, there lacks a\nunified way to compare and benchmark them. As a result, it can be challenging\nfor researchers to choose the right technique for their problems or for people\nwho are new to the field to learn and understand existing algorithms.

They share common observational properties\nand belong to a family of objects similar to the prototypical ILRT SN~2008S.\nThese events have a rise time that is less than 15 days and absolute peak\nmagnitudes of between $-11.5$ and $-14.5$ mag. Their pseudo-bolometric light\ncurves peak in the range $0.5$ - $9.0 \\times10^{40}~\\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$ and\ntheir total radiated energies are on the order of (0.3 - 3)\n$\\times$~10$^{47}$~erg. After maximum brightness, the light curves show a\nmonotonic decline or a plateau, resembling those of faint supernovae IIL or\nIIP, respectively. At late phases, the light curves flatten, roughly following\nthe slope of the $^{56}$Co decay. If the late-time power source is indeed\nradioactive decay, these transients produce $^{56}$Ni masses on the order of\n$10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$~\\msun. The spectral energy distribution of our ILRT\nsample, extending from the optical to the mid-infrared (MIR) domain, reveals a\nclear IR excess soon after explosion and non-negligible MIR emission at very\nlate phases. The spectra show prominent H lines in emission with a typical\nvelocity of a few hundred km~s$^{-1}$, along with Ca~II features. In\nparticular, the [Ca~II] $\\lambda$7291,7324 doublet is visible at all times,\nwhich is a characteristic feature for this family of transients. The identified\nprogenitor of SN~2008S, which is luminous in archival Spitzer MIR images,\nsuggests an intermediate-mass precursor star embedded in a dusty cocoon. We\npropose the explosion of a super-asymptotic giant branch star forming an\nelectron-capture supernova as a plausible explanation for these events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 08:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

However, the\nline-of-sight dominant air-to-ground channels along with the antenna pattern of\nthe cellular ground base stations (GBSs) introduce critical interference issues\nin cellular-connected UAV communications. In particular, the complex antenna\npattern and the ground reflection (GR) from the down-tilted antennas create\nboth coverage holes and patchy coverage for the UAVs in the sky, which leads to\nunreliable connectivity from the underlying cellular network. To overcome these\nchallenges, in this paper, we propose a new cellular architecture that employs\nan extra set of co-channel antennas oriented towards the sky to support UAVs on\ntop of the existing down-tilted antennas for ground user equipment (GUE). To\nmodel the GR stemming from the down-tilted antennas, we propose a path-loss\nmodel, which takes both antenna radiation pattern and configuration into\naccount. Next, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the minimum\nsignal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the UAVs by tuning the up-tilt (UT)\nangles of the up-tilted antennas. Since this is an NP-hard problem, we propose\na genetic algorithm (GA) based heuristic method to optimize the UT angles of\nthese antennas. After obtaining the optimal UT angles, we integrate the 3GPP\nRelease-10 specified enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC) to\nreduce the interference stemming from the down-tilted antennas.

As the mass differences of the dark matter with the neutral and charged\nstates are found to be small, the new scalars and fermions of the theory will\nhave macroscopic lifetimes, and could thus be potentially detected with\nlong-lived particle signatures at colliders.

Based on these, we construct a general theory that\nexplains the stability of magnetic orders in the ground states despite the\ninteraction of electrons with the environment. Methodologically, the theory\npresented in this paper is formulated using von Neumann algebras and their\nassociated standard forms. A benefit of working in such an algebraic setting is\nthat we can define operator inequalities that preserve the ordered structures\nthat naturally follow from the standard forms; by exploiting these operator\ninequalities, we can develop new descriptions of the magnetic structures of the\nground states. As specific applications of the proposed theory, we first\nanalyze the Marshall--Lieb--Mattis theorem, Lieb's theorem, and their\nstabilities under various perturbations. Next, the Nagaoka--Thouless theorem\nand its stability are addressed. In addition, we interpret various other\nexamples from the new theory and give a unified perspective on existing\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 09:04:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 03:32:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 04:32:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

Here we study the\nfusion coefficients of the Ising model in the lattice slit-strip, with locally\nmonochromatic boundary conditions. The fusion coefficients are certain\nrenormalized limits of boundary correlation functions at the three extremities\nof the truncated lattice slit-strips, in a basis of random variables whose\ncorrelation functions have an essentially exponential dependence on the\ntruncation heights. The key technique is to associate operator valued discrete\n1-forms to certain discrete holomorphic functions. This provides a direct\nanalogy with currents in boundary conformal field theory. For two specific\napplications of this technique, we use distinguished discrete holomorphic\nfunctions from the first article of the series. First, we rederive the known\ndiagonalization of the Ising transfer matrix in a form that parallels boundary\nconformal field theory. Second, we characterize the Ising model fusion\ncoefficients by a recursion written purely in terms of inner products of the\ndistinguished discrete holomorphic functions. The convergence result for the\ndiscrete holomorphic functions proven in the first part can then be used to\nderive the convergence of the fusion coefficients in the scaling limit. In the\nthird article of the series, it will be shown that up to a transformation that\naccounts for our chosen slit-strip geometry, the scaling limits of the fusion\ncoefficients become the structure constants of the vertex operator algebra of a\nfermionic conformal field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 09:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

The prototype LST (LST-1)\nproposed for CTA was inaugurated in October 2018 in the northern hemisphere\nsite, La Palma (Spain), and is currently in its commissioning phase. MAGIC is a\nsystem of two gamma-ray Cherenkov telescopes of the current generation, located\napproximately 100 m away from LST-1, that have been operating in stereoscopic\nmode since 2009. Since LST-1 and MAGIC can observe the same air shower events,\nwe can compare the brightness of showers, estimated energies of gamma rays, and\nother parameters event by event, which can be used to cross-calibrate the\ntelescopes. Ultimately, by performing combined analyses of the events\ntriggering the three telescopes, we can reconstruct the shower geometry more\naccurately, leading to better energy and angular resolutions, and a better\ndiscrimination of the background showers initiated by cosmic rays. For that\npurpose, as part of the commissioning of LST-1, we performed joint observations\nof established gamma-ray sources with LST-1 and MAGIC. Also, we have developed\nMonte Carlo simulations for such joint observations and an analysis pipeline\nwhich finds event coincidence in the offline analysis based on their\ntimestamps.

However, as a direct representation of flow in\ngeological pore networks, conventional microfluidics face several challenges.\nOne is that simultaneous two-phase flow is not possible in a 2D network without\nfluctuation occupancy of pores. Nonetheless, such flow is possible in a\nmicrofluidic network if wetting phase can form a bridge across the gap between\nsolid surfaces at a pore constriction while non-wetting phase flows through the\nconstriction. We call this phenomenon \"bridging\". Here we consider the\nconditions under which this is possible as a function of capillary pressure and\ngeometry of the constriction. Using the Surface Evolver program, we determine\nconditions for stable interfaces in a constriction, the range of capillary\npressures at which bridging can occur, and those where the wetting phase would\ninvade and block the constriction to the flow of the non-wetting phase\n(\"snap-off\"). We assume that the channels have uniform depth, vertical walls,\nand flat bottom and top surfaces, and that one phase perfectly wets the solid\nsurfaces. If the constriction is long and straight, snap-off occurs at the same\ncapillary pressure as bridging. For long, curved channels, snap-off happens as\nliquid imbibes before bridging can occur. For constrictions between cylindrical\npillars, however, there is a range of capillary pressures at which bridging is\nstable; the range is greater the narrower the diameter of the cylinders\nrelative to the width of the constriction. For smaller-diameter pillars,\nsnap-off as non-wetting phase invades a downstream pore body is not possible.\nWe relate these results to the shape of pore networks commonly used in\nmicrofluidic studies of two-phase flow to consider whether two-phase flow is\npossible in these networks without fluctuating pore occupancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 10:41:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 07:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-16"}

Current EA approaches suffer from scalability issues, limiting\ntheir usage in real-world EA scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose\nLargeEA to align entities between large-scale KGs. LargeEA consists of two\nchannels, i.e., structure channel and name channel. For the structure channel,\nwe present METIS-CPS, a memory-saving mini-batch generation strategy, to\npartition large KGs into smaller mini-batches. LargeEA, designed as a general\ntool, can adopt any existing EA approach to learn entities' structural features\nwithin each mini-batch independently. For the name channel, we first introduce\nNFF, a name feature fusion method, to capture rich name features of entities\nwithout involving any complex training process. Then, we exploit a name-based\ndata augmentation to generate seed alignment without any human intervention.\nSuch design fits common real-world scenarios much better, as seed alignment is\nnot always available.

Specifically, we show that\njointly learning to predict the two DP views from a single blurry input image\nimproves the network's ability to learn to deblur the image. Our experiments\nshow this multi-task strategy achieves +1dB PSNR improvement over\nstate-of-the-art defocus deblurring methods. In addition, our multi-task\nframework allows accurate DP-view synthesis (e.g., ~39dB PSNR) from the single\ninput image. These high-quality DP views can be used for other DP-based\napplications, such as reflection removal. As part of this effort, we have\ncaptured a new dataset of 7,059 high-quality images to support our training for\nthe DP-view synthesis task. Our dataset, code, and trained models are publicly\navailable at\nhttps://github.com/Abdullah-Abuolaim/multi-task-defocus-deblurring-dual-pixel-nimat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 14:45:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 15:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

Both the columns and\nrows of the tabular data carry useful patterns that could improve the model\nprediction performance. However, most existing models focus on the cross-column\npatterns yet overlook the cross-row patterns as they deal with single samples\nindependently. In this work, we propose a general learning framework named\nRetrieval & Interaction Machine (RIM) that fully exploits both cross-row and\ncross-column patterns among tabular data. Specifically, RIM first leverages\nsearch engine techniques to efficiently retrieve useful rows of the table to\nassist the label prediction of the target row, then uses feature interaction\nnetworks to capture the cross-column patterns among the target row and the\nretrieved rows so as to make the final label prediction. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on 11 datasets of three important tasks, i.e., CTR prediction\n(classification), top-n recommendation (ranking) and rating prediction\n(regression).

We\naim at (i) understanding its peculiar size distribution, and (ii) setting an\nupper limit on the characteristic dispersal velocity at subkilometer sizes\ncorresponding to the smallest visible Hobson members. We identified the Hobson\nfamily using an up-to-date asteroid catalog.

Backward\norbital integrations of the heliocentric orbits allowed us to confirm the\npreviously suggested age of Hobson and helped to estimate limits of the\nejection speed. The Hobson family has an unusual size distribution: two nearly\nequal-size bodies, followed by a population of smaller asteroids, whose\ndistribution takes a characteristic power law. There are two possibilities to\nexplain these data. Either a canonical impact onto a single parent body,\nrequiring fine-tuned impact conditions that have not been studied so far, or an\nunconventional model for the parent object of the Hobson family, namely a\nbinary with $\\simeq 7-9$ km primary and a $\\simeq 2.5$ km secondary.

The second largest\nasteroid, (57738) 2001 UZ160, is the nearly intact satellite of the parent\nbinary. The excellent convergence of nominal orbits of Hobson members sets an\nupper limit of $\\simeq (10-20)$ m s$^{-1}$ for the initial dispersal velocity\nof the known members, which is consistent with both formation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 14:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

They arise in various contexts, e.g. in the asymptotic study\nof certain nonlinear partial differential equations and in the asymptotic\nanalysis of orthogonal polynomials. Matrix-valued Riemann-Hilbert problems were\nconsidered by Deift et al. in the 1990s with a noncommutative adaptation of the\nsteepest descent method. For orthogonal polynomials on the line or on the\ncircle with respect to exponentially varying weights, this led to a strong\nasymptotic expansion in the given parameters. For orthogonal polynomials with\nrespect to planar exponentially varying weights, the corresponding asymptotics\nwas obtained by Hedenmalm and Wennman (2017), using a technically involved\nconstruction of an invariant foliation for the orthogonality. Planar orthogonal\npolynomials are characterized in terms of a matrix dbar-problem (Its,\nTakhtajan), which we call a soft Riemann-Hilbert problem. Here, we use this\nperspective to offer a simplified approach based not on foliations but instead\non the ad hoc insertion of an algebraic ansatz for the Cauchy potential in the\nsoft Riemann-Hilbert problem. This allows the problem to decompose into a\nhierarchy of scalar Riemann-Hilbert problems along the interface, which appears\nas the free boundary for an obstacle problem. Inspired by microlocal analysis,\nthe method allows for control of the solution in such a way that for\nreal-analytic weights, the asymptotics holds in the $L^2$ sense with error\n$O(e^{-\\delta\\sqrt{m}})$ in a fixed neighborhood of the closed exterior of the\ninterface, for some constant $\\delta>0$, where $m\\to+\\infty$. Here, $m$ is the\ndegree of the polynomial, and in terms of pointwise asymptotics, the expansion\ndominates the error term in the exterior domain and across the interface a\ndistance proportional to $m^{-\\frac14}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 14:28:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2021 10:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

Our results reveal new\ntrajectory types that have not been observed for pairs of rigid particles.\nWhile particle softness increases the likelihood of a stable pair forming, the\npair stability is determined by the lateral position of the particles. A key\nfinding is that stabilisation of the axial distance occurs after lateral\nmigration of the particles. During the later phase of pair formation, particles\nundergo damped oscillations that are independent of initial conditions. These\ndamped oscillations are driven by a strong hydrodynamic coupling of the\nparticle dynamics, particle inertia and viscous dissipation. While the\nfrequency and damping coefficient of the oscillations depend on particle\nsoftness, the pair formation time is largely determined by the initial particle\npositions: the time to form a stable pair grows exponentially with the initial\naxial distance.

In the open literature, one can find several databases for the\npolynomial coefficients with variation in the number of species included or the\nrange of temperature covered, and this raises a question of whether the choice\nof a database to use has an important impact on these evaluated thermodynamic\nproperties.

Knowledge distillation (KD) is among such\nmethodologies and it functions by using data samples to transfer the knowledge\ncaptured by a large model (teacher) to a smaller one(student).

We\ndetermine the field strength via i) electrical transport measurements and ii)\ndirect measurements of electrochemical potentials of the ILs using\nsemiconducting 2DM, WSe2. The field strength across the material reaches more\nthan 3.5 V/nm, the largest static electric field through any electronic device\nto date. We demonstrate that this field is strong enough to close the bandgap\nof trilayer WSe2 driving a semiconductor-to-metal transition. Our approach\ngrants access to previously-inaccessible phenomena occurring in ultrastrong\nelectric fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 13:54:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 21:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

When the underlying probability distribution is unknown and\nobserved from data, DRO suggests to compute the worst-case distribution within\na so-called uncertainty set that captures the involved statistical uncertainty.\nIn particular, DRO with uncertainty set constructed as a statistical divergence\nneighborhood ball has been shown to provide a tool for constructing valid\nconfidence intervals for nonparametric functionals, and bears a duality with\nthe empirical likelihood (EL). In this paper, we show how adjusting the ball\nsize of such type of DRO can reduce higher-order coverage errors similar to the\nBartlett correction. Our correction, which applies to general von Mises\ndifferentiable functionals, is more general than the existing EL literature\nthat only focuses on smooth function models or $M$-estimation. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate a higher-order \"self-normalizing\" property of DRO regardless of the\nchoice of divergence.

In this thesis, we develop\nCTAB-GAN, a novel conditional table GAN architecture that can effectively model\ndiverse data types with complex distributions. CTAB-GAN is extensively\nevaluated with the state of the art GANs that generate synthetic tables, in\nterms of data similarity and analysis utility. The results on five datasets\nshow that the synthetic data of CTAB-GAN remarkably resembles the real data for\nall three types of variables and results in higher accuracy for five machine\nlearning algorithms, by up to 17%.\n  Additionally, to ensure greater security for training tabular GANs against\nmalicious privacy attacks, differential privacy (DP) is studied and used to\ntrain CTAB-GAN with strict privacy guarantees.

Such a treatment\ninvites compatibility of the fields with base-space (configurations of the\nbody), so that the configuration can be realised as a subset of the Euclidean\nspace. We first rewrite the metric and connection using differential forms,\nwhich are further utilised to write the deformation gradient and Cauchy-Green\ndeformation tensor in terms of frame and co-frame fields. The geometric\nunderstanding of stress as a co-vector valued 2-form fits squarely within our\noverall program. We show that, for a hyperelastic solid, an equation similar to\nthe Doyle-Erciksen formula may be written for the co-vector part of stress.\nUsing these, we write a mixed energy functional in terms of differential forms,\nwhose extremum leads to the compatibility of deformation, constitutive rules\nand equations of equilibrium. Finite element exterior calculus is then utilised\nto construct a finite dimensional approximation for the differential forms\nappearing in the variational principle. These approximations are then used to\nconstruct a discrete functional which is then numerically extremised. This\ndiscertization leads to a mixed method as it uses independent approximations\nfor differential forms related to stress and deformation gradient. The mixed\nvariational principle is then specialized for 2D case, whose discrete\napproximation is applied to problems in nonlinear elasticity. An important\nfeature of our FE technique is the lack of additional stabilization. From the\nnumerical study, it is found that the present discretization also does not\nsuffer form locking and related convergence issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 11:01:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}
