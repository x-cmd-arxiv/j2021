These frameworks, however, fail to capture\nkey characteristics of the growing subfield of VAM-HRI and can be difficult to\nconsistently apply due to continuous scales. This work builds upon these prior\nframeworks through the creation of a Tool for Organizing Key Characteristics of\nVAM-HRI Systems (TOKCS). TOKCS discretizes the continuous scales used within\nprior works for more consistent classification and adds additional\ncharacteristics related to a robot's internal model, anchor locations,\nmanipulability, and the system's software and hardware. To showcase the tool's\ncapability, TOKCS is applied to the ten papers from the fourth VAM-HRI workshop\nand examined for key trends and takeaways. These trends highlight the\nexpressive capability of TOKCS while also helping frame newer trends and future\nwork recommendations for VAM-HRI research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2021 16:01:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 16:00:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 19:03:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

We begin the study by estimating\nthe undercooling vs. spacing variation for the simplest possible configurations\nof pattern lengths 3 and 4, where phase-field simulations are utilized to\nquantify the influence of the solid-solid interfacial energy and the contrast\nin the component diffusivities. Subsequently, extended simulations consisting\nof multiple periods of ${\\alpha}{\\beta}{\\delta}$... as well as\n${\\alpha}{\\beta}{\\delta}{\\beta}$... are carried out for assessing the stability\nof the configurations to long-wavelength perturbations in spacing.

This paper departs from the parametric model,\nusing a semiparametric formulation that reveals the explicit role that\nsingularity of the long run conditional covariance matrix plays in determining\nmulticointegration. The semiparametric framework has the advantage that short\nrun dynamics do not need to be modeled and estimation by standard techniques\nsuch as fully modified least squares (FM-OLS) on the original I(1) system is\nstraightforward.

So far, memory\ndisaggregation research has all taken one of two approaches: building/emulating\nmemory nodes using regular servers or building them using raw memory devices\nwith no processing power. The former incurs higher monetary cost and faces tail\nlatency and scalability limitations, while the latter introduces performance,\nsecurity, and management problems.\n  Server-based memory nodes and memory nodes with no processing power are two\nextreme approaches.

To\ninvestigate the potential new definitions of impact subtypes based on\nkinematics, 3,161 head impacts from various sources including simulation,\ncollege football, mixed martial arts, and car racing were collected. We applied\nthe K-means clustering to cluster the impacts on 16 standardized temporal\nfeatures from head rotation kinematics.

Our primary goal is to make the\ntraining procedure less sensitive to distortions that humans cannot detect and\nfocus on penalizing perceptually important artifacts.

We propose\npsychophysical experiments, a dataset, and a procedure for training foveated\nimage reconstruction. The proposed strategy renders the generator network\nflexible by penalizing only perceptually important deviations in the output. As\na result, the method emphasized the recovery of perceptually important image\nfeatures.

To empower conventional CNNs in learning geometric clues of\nlanes, we propose a deep network named ContinuityLearner to better learn\ngeometric prior within lane. Specifically, our proposed CNN-based paradigm\ninvolves a novel Context-encoding image feature learning network to generate\nclass-dependent image feature maps and a new encoding layer to exploit the\ngeometric continuity feature representation by fusing both spatial and visual\ninformation of lane together. The ContinuityLearner, performing on the\ngeometric continuity feature of lanes, is trained to directly predict the lane\nin traffic scenarios with integrated and continuous instance semantic.

This provides a flexible framework for the rapid design of new IP forms.\nTrained IPs are compatible with the Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models (KIM)\napplication programming interface (API) and can be readily used in major\nmaterials simulation packages compatible with KIM, including ASE, DL_POLY,\nGULP, LAMMPS, and QC.

As the nature of peer-to- peer(P2P) networks is open and\ndynamic, the security risk within that environment is greatly increased mostly\nbecause nodes can join and leave the network at will. Thus, it is important to\nhave a system that can check against malicious behaviour. In this work, we\npropose a reputation-based consensus mechanism for blockchain-based systems,\nProof-of-Reputation(PoR) where the nodes with the highest reputation values\neventually become part of a consensus group that determines the state of the\nblockchain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2021 23:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Coming to the era of high resolution, SOD methods are\nfacing new challenges. The major limitation of previous methods is that they\ntry to identify the salient regions and estimate the accurate objects\nboundaries simultaneously with a single regression task at low-resolution. This\npractice ignores the inherent difference between the two difficult problems,\nresulting in poor detection quality. In this paper, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework for high-resolution SOD task, which disentangles the task\ninto a low-resolution saliency classification network (LRSCN) and a\nhigh-resolution refinement network (HRRN). As a pixel-wise classification task,\nLRSCN is designed to capture sufficient semantics at low-resolution to identify\nthe definite salient, background and uncertain image regions. HRRN is a\nregression task, which aims at accurately refining the saliency value of pixels\nin the uncertain region to preserve a clear object boundary at high-resolution\nwith limited GPU memory. It is worth noting that by introducing uncertainty\ninto the training process, our HRRN can well address the high-resolution\nrefinement task without using any high-resolution training data.

Some 21 cm IM experiments aiming at measuring\ndark energy in the redshift range of $0<z<3$ have been proposed and performed,\nin which the typical ones using single-dish mode include e.g., BINGO, FAST, and\nSKA1-MID, and those using interferometric mode include e.g., HIRAX, CHIME, and\nTianlai. In this work, we make a forecast for these typical 21 cm IM\nexperiments on their capability of measuring parameters of dark energy. We find\nthat the interferometers have great advantages in constraining cosmological\nparameters. In particular, the Tianlai cylinder array alone can achieve the\nstandard of precision cosmology for the $\\Lambda$CDM model (i.e., the precision\nof parameters is better than 1%). However, for constraining dynamical dark\nenergy, we find that SKA1-MID performs very well. We show that the simulated 21\ncm IM data can break the parameter degeneracies inherent in the CMB data, and\nCMB+SKA1-MID offers $\\sigma(w)=0.013$ in the $w$CDM model, and\n$\\sigma(w_0)=0.080$ and $\\sigma(w_a)=0.25$ in the CPL model.

In this paper, we study a practical setting\ncalled Specific Domain Adaptation (SDA) that aligns the source and target\ndomains in a demanded-specific dimension. Within this setting, we observe the\nintra-domain gap induced by different domainness (i.e., numerical magnitudes of\ndomain shifts in this dimension) is crucial when adapting to a specific domain.\nTo address the problem, we propose a novel Self-Adversarial Disentangling (SAD)\nframework. In particular, given a specific dimension, we first enrich the\nsource domain by introducing a domainness creator with providing additional\nsupervisory signals. Guided by the created domainness, we design a\nself-adversarial regularizer and two loss functions to jointly disentangle the\nlatent representations into domainness-specific and domainness-invariant\nfeatures, thus mitigating the intra-domain gap.

Compared to cloud computing, edge/fog servers have fewer\nresources, but they can be accessed with higher bandwidth and less\ncommunication latency. Thus, integrating edge/fog and cloud infrastructures can\nsupport the execution of diverse latency-sensitive and computation-intensive\nIoT applications. Although some frameworks attempt to provide such integration,\nthere are still several challenges to be addressed, such as dynamic scheduling\nof different IoT applications, scalability mechanisms, multi-platform support,\nand supporting different interaction models. To overcome these challenges, we\npropose a lightweight and distributed container-based framework, called\nFogBus2. It provides a mechanism for scheduling heterogeneous IoT applications\nand implements several scheduling policies. Also, it proposes an optimized\ngenetic algorithm to obtain fast convergence to well-suited solutions. Besides,\nit offers a scalability mechanism to ensure efficient responsiveness when\neither the number of IoT devices increases or the resources become\noverburdened. Also, the dynamic resource discovery mechanism of FogBus2 assists\nnew entities to quickly join the system. We have also developed two IoT\napplications, called Conway's Game of Life and Video Optical Character\nRecognition to demonstrate the effectiveness of FogBus2 for handling real-time\nand non-real-time IoT applications. Experimental results show FogBus2's\nscheduling policy improves the response time of IoT applications by 53\\%\ncompared to other policies. Also, the scalability mechanism can reduce up to\n48\\% of the queuing waiting time compared to frameworks that do not support\nscalability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 2021 03:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

Fast prevention means lower repair costs and\nlosses. The amount of sensors in novel industry systems makes the anomaly\ndetection process quite difficult for humans. Algorithms which automates the\nprocess of detecting anomalies are crucial in modern failure-prevention\nsystems. Therefore, many machine and deep learning models have been designed to\naddress this problem. Mostly, they are autoencoder-based architectures with\nsome generative adversarial elements. In this work, a framework is shown which\nincorporates neuroevolution methods to boost the anomaly-detection scores of\nnew and already known models.

These\nmodels learn to compute a ranking score between the given query and document.\nThe majority of existing models are trained in pairwise fashion using\nhuman-judged labels directly without further calibration. The traditional\npairwise schemes can be time-consuming and require pre-defined\npositive-negative document pairs for training, potentially leading to learning\nbias due to document distribution mismatch between training and test\nconditions. Some popular existing listwise schemes rely on the strong\npre-defined probabilistic assumptions and stark difference between relevant and\nnon-relevant documents for the given query, which may limit the model potential\ndue to the low-quality or ambiguous relevance labels. To address these\nconcerns, we turn to a physics-inspired ranking balance scheme and propose\nPoolRank, a pooling-based listwise learning framework. The proposed scheme has\nfour major advantages: (1) PoolRank extracts training information from the best\ncandidates at the local level based on model performance and relative ranking\namong abundant document candidates. (2) By combining four pooling-based loss\ncomponents in a multi-task learning fashion, PoolRank calibrates the ranking\nbalance for the partially relevant and the highly non-relevant documents\nautomatically without costly human inspection. (3) PoolRank can be easily\ngeneralized to any neural retrieval model without requiring additional\nlearnable parameters or model structure modifications. (4) Compared to pairwise\nlearning and existing listwise learning schemes, PoolRank yields better ranking\nperformance for all studied retrieval models while retaining efficient\nconvergence rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 2021 08:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

We propose a\nmeasure named Rank Stability, which evaluates how much the rankings of an\nexperiment differ in between similar datasets, when the models and errors are\nconstant. We use this to study the evaluation setup of the M5. We find that the\nevaluation setup of the M5 is less reliable than other measures. The main\ndrivers of instability are hierarchical aggregation and scaling.\nPrice-weighting reduces the stability of all tested error measures. Scale\nnormalization of the M5 error measure results in less stability than other\nscale-free errors. Hierarchical levels taken separately are less stable with\nmore aggregation, and their combination is even less stable than individual\nlevels.

Here we demonstrate a new approach to soft\nclamping which exploits vibrations in the perimeter of polygon-shaped\nresonators tethered at their vertices. In contrast to previous approaches,\nwhich rely on cascaded elements to achieve soft clamping, perimeter modes are\nsoft clamped due to symmetry and the boundary conditions at the polygon\nvertices. Perimeter modes reach $Q$ of 3.6 billion at room temperature while\nspanning only two acoustic wavelengths -- a 4-fold improvement over the\nstate-of-the-art mechanical $Q$ with 10-fold smaller devices. The small size of\nour devices makes them well-suited for near-field integration with\nmicrocavities for quantum optomechanical experiments. Moreover, their\ncompactness allows the realization of phononic lattices. We demonstrate a\none-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain of high-$Q$ perimeter modes coupled\nvia nearest-neighbour interaction and characterize the localized edge modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 2021 11:42:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 12:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

However, action detection requires not\nonly categorizing actions, but also localizing them in untrimmed videos.\nTherefore, transferring knowledge pertaining to temporal relations is critical\nfor this task which is missing in the previous cross-modal KD frameworks. To\nthis end, we aim at learning an augmented RGB representation for action\ndetection, taking advantage of additional modalities at training time through\nKD. We propose a KD framework consisting of two levels of distillation. On one\nhand, atomic-level distillation encourages the RGB student to learn the\nsub-representation of the actions from the teacher in a contrastive manner. On\nthe other hand, sequence-level distillation encourages the student to learn the\ntemporal knowledge from the teacher, which consists of transferring the Global\nContextual Relations and the Action Boundary Saliency. The result is an\nAugmented-RGB stream that can achieve competitive performance as the two-stream\nnetwork while using only RGB at inference time.

It is arduous for such methods to track targets with\nvarious appearance variations. To address this limitation, another type of\nmethods adopts a part-based tracking strategy which divides the target into\nequal patches and tracks all these patches in parallel. The target state is\ninferred by summarizing the tracking results of these patches. A potential\nlimitation of such trackers is that not all patches are equally informative for\ntracking. Some patches that are not discriminative may have adverse effects. In\nthis paper, we propose to track the salient local parts of the target that are\ndiscriminative for tracking. In particular, we propose a fine-grained saliency\nmining module to capture the local saliencies. Further, we design a\nsaliency-association modeling module to associate the captured saliencies\ntogether to learn effective correlation representations between the exemplar\nand the search image for state estimation. Extensive experiments on five\ndiverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably\nagainst state-of-the-art trackers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 2021 13:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

The basic model of these curves is logistic function. From the\nlogistic model of fractal dimension curves, we can derive the growth rate\nformula and acceleration formula of city development. Using the inflexions of\nthe fractal parameter curves, we can identify the different phases of urban\nevolution. The main results are as follows. (1) Based on the curve of fractal\ndimension of urban form, urban growth can be divided into four stages: initial\nslow growth, accelerated fast growth, decelerated fast growth, and terminal\nslow growth. The three dividing points are 0.2113Dmax, 0.5Dmax, and 0.7887Dmax,\nwhere Dmax is the capacity of fractal dimension. When the fractal dimension\nreaches half of its capacity value, 0.5Dmax, the urban growth rate reaches its\npeak. (2) Based on the curve of fractal dimension odds, urban growth can also\nbe divided into four stages: initial slow filling, accelerated fast filling,\ndecelerated fast filling, terminal slow filling. The three dividing points are\n0.2113Zmax, 0.5Zmax, and 0.7887Zmax, where Zmax=/(2-Dmax) denotes the capacity\nof fractal dimension odds (Dmax<2). Empirical analyses show that the first\nscheme based fractal dimension is suitable for the young cities and the second\nscheme based on fractal dimension odds can be applied to mature cities. A\nconclusion can be reached that logistic function is one of significant model\nfor the stage division of urban growth based on fractal parameters of cities.\nThe results of this study provide a new way of understanding the features and\nmechanism of urban phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 2021 14:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

Existing solutions either attentively fuse deep style\nfeature into deep content feature without considering feature distributions, or\nadaptively normalize deep content feature according to the style such that\ntheir global statistics are matched. Although effective, leaving shallow\nfeature unexplored and without locally considering feature statistics, they are\nprone to unnatural output with unpleasing local distortions. To alleviate this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a novel attention and normalization module,\nnamed Adaptive Attention Normalization (AdaAttN), to adaptively perform\nattentive normalization on per-point basis. Specifically, spatial attention\nscore is learnt from both shallow and deep features of content and style\nimages. Then per-point weighted statistics are calculated by regarding a style\nfeature point as a distribution of attention-weighted output of all style\nfeature points. Finally, the content feature is normalized so that they\ndemonstrate the same local feature statistics as the calculated per-point\nweighted style feature statistics. Besides, a novel local feature loss is\nderived based on AdaAttN to enhance local visual quality.

The latter study of the author is\nfound to be consistent with the recent requirement (on the basis of vortex\nunpinning model of the glitch generation) which refers: The minimum fractional\ncrustal moment of inertia of the Vela pulsar should be about 7\\% for a mass\nhigher than about 1$M_\\odot$. However, an important study which requires\ninvestigation of pulsational stability and gravitational binding of the models\nof Negi et al. (1989) has not been carried out so far. The present paper deals\nwith such a study of the models (Negi et al. 1989) for all permissible values\nof the compactness parameter $u (\\equiv M/a$, total mass to size ratio in\ngeometrized units) and compressibility factor $Q$ (defined in Tolman's VII\nsolution as: $ x = r^2/K^2 = r^2/a^2Q)$. It is seen that the configurations\nremain pulsationally stable and gravitationally bound for all permissible\nvalues of $u (\\leq 0.25)$ and $Q$ ($0 < Q \\leq 1.2$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 2021 14:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-21"}

In dilute, 3-dimensional suspensions,\nthese phenomena have typically been explained by the hydrodynamic advection of\npoint tracers by isolated microswimmers, while, at higher concentrations,\ncorrelations between pusher microswimmers such as E. coli can increase the\neffective diffusivity even further. Anisotropic tracers in active suspensions\ncan be expected to exhibit even more complex behaviour than spherical ones, due\nto the presence of a nontrivial translation-rotation coupling. Using\nlarge-scale lattice Boltzmann simulations of model microswimmers described by\nextended force dipoles, we study the motion of ellipsoidal point tracers\nimmersed in 3-dimensional microswimmer suspensions. We find that the rotational\ndiffusivity of tracers is much less affected by swimmer-swimmer correlations\nthan the translational diffusivity. We furthermore study the anisotropic\ntranslational diffusion in the particle frame and find that, in pusher\nsuspensions, the diffusivity along the ellipsoid major axis is higher than in\nthe direction perpendicular to it, albeit with a smaller ratio than for\nBrownian diffusion. Thus, we find that far field hydrodynamics cannot account\nfor the anomalous coupling between translation and rotation observed in\nexperiments, as was recently proposed. Finally, we study the probability\ndistributions (PDFs) of translational and rotational displacements.

Towards tackling this problem, the first main\ncontribution is the construction of impact invariance to ensure all desired\ntrajectories respect the foot-landing impact dynamics, which is a necessary\ncondition for realizing asymptotic tracking of hybrid walking systems.

Rather than requiring prior\nknowledge of the agent or environment, the planner learns to model the state\ntransitions and rewards. To avoid the potentially hazardous trial-and-error of\nreinforcement learning, we focus on differentiable planners such as Value\nIteration Networks (VIN), which are trained offline from safe expert\ndemonstrations. Although they work well in small simulations, we address two\nmajor limitations that hinder their deployment. First, we observed that current\ndifferentiable planners struggle to plan long-term in environments with a high\nbranching complexity. While they should ideally learn to assign low rewards to\nobstacles to avoid collisions, we posit that the constraints imposed on the\nnetwork are not strong enough to guarantee the network to learn sufficiently\nlarge penalties for every possible collision. We thus impose a structural\nconstraint on the value iteration, which explicitly learns to model any\nimpossible actions. Secondly, we extend the model to work with a limited\nperspective camera under translation and rotation, which is crucial for real\nrobot deployment. Many VIN-like planners assume a 360 degrees or overhead view\nwithout rotation. In contrast, our method uses a memory-efficient lattice map\nto aggregate CNN embeddings of partial observations, and models the rotational\ndynamics explicitly using a 3D state-space grid (translation and rotation). Our\nproposals significantly improve semantic navigation and exploration on several\n2D and 3D environments, succeeding in settings that are otherwise challenging\nfor this class of methods. As far as we know, we are the first to successfully\nperform differentiable planning on the difficult Active Vision Dataset,\nconsisting of real images captured from a robot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 2021 11:29:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 15:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

When this paradox is applied to\n3-dimensional space it does go against our intuition, but very often our\nintuition is flawed.\n  The aim of the paper is to provide a comprehensive proof of the Banach-Tarski\nparadox, expanding in between the lines of the original volume. We explore the\nnotions of paradoxical and equidecomposable sets which are phrased in terms of\ngroup actions. Finally, provided we have the Axiom of Choice at our disposal,\nwe can construct sets that are nonmeasurable (not Lebesgue measurable) and the\nproof of the Banach-Tarski Paradox follows naturally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 2021 04:30:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 09:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

Many novel methods have been proposed, ranging from classical matrix\nfactorization to recent graph convolutional network-based approaches. After\nrecent fierce debates, researchers started to focus on linear graph\nconvolutional networks (GCNs) with a layer combination, which show\nstate-of-the-art accuracy in many datasets. In this work, we extend them based\non neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), because the linear GCN\nconcept can be interpreted as a differential equation, and present the method\nof Learnable-Time ODE-based Collaborative Filtering (LT-OCF). The main novelty\nin our method is that after redesigning linear GCNs on top of the NODE regime,\ni) we learn the optimal architecture rather than relying on manually designed\nones, ii) we learn smooth ODE solutions that are considered suitable for CF,\nand iii) we test with various ODE solvers that internally build a diverse set\nof neural network connections. We also present a novel training method\nspecialized to our method. In our experiments with three benchmark datasets,\nGowalla, Yelp2018, and Amazon-Book, our method consistently shows better\naccuracy than existing methods, e.g., a recall of 0.0411 by LightGCN vs. 0.0442\nby LT-OCF and an NDCG of 0.0315 by LightGCN vs. 0.0341 by LT-OCF in\nAmazon-Book.
