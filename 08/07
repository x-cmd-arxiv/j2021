Within this scope, in this paper we present a new scheme,\nnamed as Precoding-aided Transmitter side Generalized Space-Frequency Index\nModulation (PT-GSFIM), where part of the information bits select the active\nantennas and subcarriers which then carry amplitude and phase modulated\nsymbols. The proposed scheme is designed for multiuser multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MU-MIMO) scenarios and incorporates a precoder which removes\nmultiuser interference (MUI) at the receivers. Furthermore, the proposed\nPT-GSFIM also integrates signal space diversity (SSD) techniques for tackling\nthe typical poor performance of uncoded orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) based schemes. By combining complex rotation matrices (CRM)\nand subcarrier-level interleaving, PT-GSFIM can exploit the inherent diversity\nin frequency selective channels and improve the performance without additional\npower or bandwidth. To support reliable detection of the multidimensional\nPT-GSFIM we also propose three different detection algorithms which can provide\ndifferent tradeoffs between performance and complexity. Simulation results\nshows that proposed PT-GSFIM scheme, can provide significant gains over\nconventional MU-MIMO and GSM schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 17:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-09"}

To date, the\npublic's attitudes towards AVs were mostly estimated through traditional survey\ndata with high labor costs and a low quantity of samples, which also might be\none of the reasons why the influencing factors on the public's attitudes of AVs\nhave not been studied from multiple aspects in a comprehensive way yet. To\naddress the issue, this study aims to propose a method by using large-scale\nsocial media data to investigate key factors that affect the public's attitudes\nand acceptance of AVs. A total of 954,151 Twitter data related to AVs and 53\ncandidate independent variables from seven categories were extracted using the\nweb scraping method. Then, sentiment analysis was used to measure the public\nattitudes towards AVs by calculating sentiment scores. Random forests algorithm\nwas employed to preliminarily select candidate independent variables according\nto their importance, while a linear mixed model was performed to explore the\nimpacting factors considering the unobserved heterogeneities caused by the\nsubjectivity level of tweets. The results showed that the overall attitude of\nthe public on AVs was slightly optimistic. Factors like \"drunk\", \"blind spot\",\nand \"mobility\" had the largest impacts on public attitudes. In addition, people\nwere more likely to express positive feelings when talking about words such as\n\"lidar\" and \"Tesla\" that relate to high technologies. Conversely, factors such\nas \"COVID-19\", \"pedestrian\", \"sleepy\", and \"highway\" were found to have\nsignificantly negative effects on the public's attitudes. The findings of this\nstudy are beneficial for the development of AV technologies, the guidelines for\nAV-related policy formulation, and the public's understanding and acceptance of\nAVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 17:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-09"}

A\ncommon principle is that fitted or predicted distributions ought to be\ncalibrated or reliable, ideally in the sense of auto-calibration, where the\noutcome is a random draw from the posited distribution. For binary responses,\nthis is the universal concept of reliability. For real-valued outcomes, a\ngeneral theory of calibration has been elusive, despite a recent surge of\ninterest in distributional regression and machine learning. We develop a\nframework rooted in probability theory, which gives rise to hierarchies of\ncalibration, and applies to both predictive distributions and stand-alone point\nforecasts. In a nutshell, a prediction - distributional or single-valued - is\nconditionally T-calibrated if it can be taken at face value in terms of the\nfunctional T. Whenever T is defined via an identification function - as in the\ncases of threshold (non) exceedance probabilities, quantiles, expectiles, and\nmoments - auto-calibration implies T-calibration. We introduce population\nversions of T-reliability diagrams and revisit a score decomposition into\nmeasures of miscalibration (MCB), discrimination (DSC), and uncertainty (UNC).\nIn empirical settings, stable and efficient estimators of T-reliability\ndiagrams and score components arise via nonparametric isotonic regression and\nthe pool-adjacent-violators algorithm. For in-sample model diagnostics, we\npropose a universal coefficient of determination, $$\\text{R}^\\ast =\n\\frac{\\text{DSC}-\\text{MCB}}{\\text{UNC}},$$ that nests and reinterprets the\nclassical $\\text{R}^2$ in least squares (mean) regression and its natural\nanalogue $\\text{R}^1$ in quantile regression, yet applies to T-regression in\ngeneral, with MCB $\\geq 0$, DSC $\\geq 0$, and $\\text{R}^\\ast \\in [0,1]$ under\nmodest conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 17:21:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 19:27:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 20:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

By a~{\\em multiorder}\non a~countable group we mean any probability measure $\\nu$ on the collection\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}$ of linear orders of type $\\mathbb Z$ on $G$, invariant\nunder the natural action of $G$ on such orders. Every free measure-preserving\n$G$-action $(X,\\mu,G)$ has a~multiorder $(\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}},\\nu,G)$ as a\nfactor and has the same orbits as the $\\mathbb Z$-action $(X,\\mu,S)$, where $S$\nis the \\emph{successor map} determined by the multiorder factor. Moreover, the\nsub-sigma-algebra $\\Sigma_{\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}}$ associated with the multiorder\nfactor is invariant under $S$, which makes the corresponding $\\mathbb Z$-action\n$(\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}},\\nu,\\tilde S)$ a factor of $(X,\\mu,S)$.

On the other hand, verification of labels by\nannotators is not cost-efficient. For this purpose, active learning (AL) could\npotentially improve the annotation procedure by including an annotator/expert\nin an efficient way. In this study, we develop a generic active learning\nframework to annotate driving trajectory time series data. We first compute an\nembedding of the trajectories into a latent space in order to extract the\ntemporal nature of the data. Given such an embedding, the framework becomes\ntask agnostic since active learning can be performed using any classification\nmethod and any query strategy, regardless of the structure of the original time\nseries data. Furthermore, we utilize our active learning framework to discover\nunknown driving scenario trajectories. This will ensure that previously unknown\ntrajectory types can be effectively detected and included in the labeled\ndataset. We evaluate our proposed framework in different settings on novel\nreal-world datasets consisting of driving trajectories collected by Volvo Cars\nCorporation.

Existing traffic engineering (TE) schemes operate at much coarser\ngranularity than services, which we show necessitates unduly conservative\ndecisions. To tackle this, we present FloMore, which directly considers the\nbandwidth needs of individual services and ensures they are met a desired\npercentage of time. Rather than meet the requirements for all services over the\nsame set of failure states, FloMore exploits a key opportunity that each\nservice could meet its bandwidth requirements over a different set of failure\nstates. FloMore consists of an offline phase that identifies the critical\nfailure states of each service, and on failure allocates traffic in a manner\nthat prioritizes those services for which that failure state is critical. We\npresent a novel decomposition scheme to handle FloMore's offline phase in a\ntractable manner.

Direct detection of the light dark matter in our galaxy by\nobserving DM scattering off a target system requires new approaches compared to\nprior searches. Lighter DM particles have less available kinetic energy, and\nachieving a kinematic match between DM and the target mandates the proper\ntreatment of collective excitations in condensed matter systems, such as\ncharged quasiparticles or phonons. In this context, the condensed matter\nphysics of the target material is crucial, necessitating an interdisciplinary\napproach. In this review, we provide a self-contained introduction to direct\ndetection of keV--GeV DM with condensed matter systems. We give a brief survey\nof dark matter models and basics of condensed matter, while the bulk of the\nreview deals with the theoretical treatment of DM-nucleon and DM-electron\ninteractions. We also review recent experimental developments in detector\ntechnology, and conclude with an outlook for the field of sub-GeV DM detection\nover the next decade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 13:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

An interplay of\ndifferent acceleration processes along with various radiation losses is\ntypically observed in astrophysical sources. While DSA is a systematic\nacceleration process that energizes particles in the vicinity of shocks,\nstochastic turbulent acceleration (STA) is a random energizing process, where\nthe interaction between cosmic ray particles and electromagnetic fluctuations\nresults in particle acceleration. This process is usually interpreted as a\nbiased random walk in energy space, modelled through a Fokker-Planck equation.\nIn the present work, we describe a novel Eulerian algorithm, adopted to\nincorporate turbulent acceleration in the presence of DSA and radiative\nprocesses like synchrotron and Inverse-Compton emission.

From our validation tests\nand case studies, we showcase the competing and complementary nature of both\nacceleration processes.

Of these models, the standard Chaplygin gas is\ntheoretically motivated, but faces problems in explaining large scale structure\nif linear perturbations are directly imposed on the homogeneous fluid. However,\nearly formation of a clustered component of small halos is sufficient (and\nnecessary) for hierarchical clustering to proceed in a CDM-like component as in\nthe standard scenario, with the remaining homogeneous component acting as dark\nenergy.

A linear analysis shows that a critical\nPress-Schecter threshold for collapse can generally only be reached for\ngeneralized Chaplygin gas models that mimic $\\Lambda$CDM, or ones where\nsuperluminal sound speeds occur. But the standard Chaplygin gas case turns out\nto be marginal, with overdensities reaching order one in the linear regime.\nThis motivates a nonlinear analysis. A simple infall model suggests that\ncollapse is indeed possible for perturbations of order 1~kpc and above; for, as\nopposed to standard gases, pressure forces decrease with increasing densities,\nallowing for the collapse of linearly stable systems.

We compute photo-z\nwith a customised version of LePhare, using a set of templates optimised for\nthe J-PAS filter-set. We analyse the accuracy of miniJPAS photo-z and their\ndependence on multiple quantities using a subsample of 5,266 galaxies with\nspectroscopic redshifts from SDSS and DEEP, that we find to be representative\nof the whole r<23 miniJPAS sample. Formal uncertainties for the photo-z that\nare calculated with the \\delta\\chi^2 method underestimate the actual redshift\nerrors. The odds parameter has the stronger correlation with |Dz|, and\naccurately reproduces the probability of a redshift outlier (|Dz|>0.03)\nirrespective of the magnitude, redshift, or spectral type of the sources. We\nshow that the two main summary statistics characterising the photo-z accuracy\nfor a population of galaxies (snmad and \\eta) can be predicted by the\ndistribution of odds in such population, and use this to estimate them for the\nwhole miniJPAS sample. At r<23 there are 17,500 galaxies/deg^2 with valid\nphoto-z estimates, of which 4,200 are expected to have |Dz|<0.003 (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 18:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

However, the use\nof simulation has skewed the attention to tasks that only require what robotics\nsimulators can simulate: motion and physical contact. We present iGibson 2.0,\nan open-source simulation environment that supports the simulation of a more\ndiverse set of household tasks through three key innovations. First, iGibson\n2.0 supports object states, including temperature, wetness level, cleanliness\nlevel, and toggled and sliced states, necessary to cover a wider range of\ntasks. Second, iGibson 2.0 implements a set of predicate logic functions that\nmap the simulator states to logic states like Cooked or Soaked. Additionally,\ngiven a logic state, iGibson 2.0 can sample valid physical states that satisfy\nit. This functionality can generate potentially infinite instances of tasks\nwith minimal effort from the users. The sampling mechanism allows our scenes to\nbe more densely populated with small objects in semantically meaningful\nlocations. Third, iGibson 2.0 includes a virtual reality (VR) interface to\nimmerse humans in its scenes to collect demonstrations. As a result, we can\ncollect demonstrations from humans on these new types of tasks, and use them\nfor imitation learning. We evaluate the new capabilities of iGibson 2.0 to\nenable robot learning of novel tasks, in the hope of demonstrating the\npotential of this new simulator to support new research in embodied AI. iGibson\n2.0 and its new dataset are publicly available at\nhttp://svl.stanford.edu/igibson/.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 18:41:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 04:06:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 23:27:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 18:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-05"}

An attractive alternative is to learn control\npolicies directly from raw input data. However, this approach is time-consuming\nand expensive since learning the policy requires many trials with robot actions\nin the physical environment. To reduce the training cost, the policy can be\nlearned in simulation with a large set of synthetic images. The limit of this\napproach is the domain gap between the simulation and the robot workspace. In\nthis paper, we propose to learn a policy for robot reaching movements from a\nsingle image captured directly in the robot workspace from a camera placed on\nthe end-effector (a hand-eye camera). The idea behind the proposed policy\nlearner is that view changes seen from the hand-eye camera produced by actions\nin the robot workspace are analogous to locating a region-of-interest in a\nsingle image by performing sequential object localisation. This similar view\nchange enables training of object reaching policies using\nreinforcement-learning-based sequential object localisation. To facilitate the\nadaptation of the policy to view changes in the robot workspace, we further\npresent a dynamic filter that learns to bias an input state to remove\nirrelevant information for an action decision. The proposed policy learner can\nbe used as a powerful representation for robotic tasks, and we validate it on\nstatic and moving object reaching tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 22:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

In this paper, our goal is\nto recognize actions from limited examples in non-RGB video modalities, by\nlearning from large-scale labeled RGB data.

Secondly, a correlation between the\ndifferent modes of oscillations of the impinging jet and the production of\nimpinging tones is studied using Modal Decomposition techniques. This analysis\nalso sheds some light on the number of concurrent cycles for different nozzle\nto plate distance. Lastly, the relation between the phase lag term and the\ndistance between the plate and the nozzle exit is highlighted using a vortex\ntracking method. This observation can serve to provide a better understanding\nof the sound generation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2021 06:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

Furthermore, existing real-world benchmarks and datasets do not\ncategorize image data based on the types and appearances of reflection (e.g.,\nsmoothness, intensity), making it hard to analyze reflection removal methods.\nHence, we construct a new reflection removal dataset that is categorized,\ndiverse, and real-world (CDR). A pipeline based on RAW data is used to capture\nperfectly aligned input images and transmission images. The dataset is\nconstructed using diverse glass types under various environments to ensure\ndiversity. By analyzing several reflection removal methods and conducting\nextensive experiments on our dataset, we show that state-of-the-art reflection\nremoval methods generally perform well on blurry reflection but fail in\nobtaining satisfying performance on other types of real-world reflection.

Here, we investigate the coherent interaction\nlength $l_{c}$ of optical second-harmonic (SH) microscopy in such samples, that\nare purposely prepared into a wedge shape, in order to elegantly tune the\ngeometrical confinement from bulk thicknesses down to $\\approx$ 50 nm. SH\nmicroscopy is a very powerful and non-invasive tool for the investigation of\nstructural properties in the biological and solid-state sciences, especially\nalso for visualizing and analyzing ferroelectric domains and domain walls.\nHowever, unlike bulk LN, SH microscopy in TFLN is largely affected by\ninterfacial reflections and resonant enhancement that both rely on film\nthickness and substrate material. In this paper we show that the dominant SHG\ncontribution measured in back-reflection, is the co-propagating phase-matched\nSH signal and \\textit{not} the counter-propagating SH portion as is the case\nfor bulk LN samples. Moreover, $l_{c}$ dramatically depends also on the\nincident pump laser wavelength (sample dispersion) but even more on the\nnumerical aperture of the focussing objective in use.

This paper proposes a modified\nversion of a very recent and powerful deep learning technique, the Vision\nTransformer (ViT), outperforming CNNs based approaches and consequently\nincreasing specialists' diagnosis accuracy. 4207 manually annotated images were\nused and distributed, by following the AO/OTA classification, in different\nfracture types, the largest labeled dataset of proximal femur fractures used in\nliterature. The ViT architecture was used and compared with a classic CNN and a\nmultistage architecture composed of successive CNNs in cascade. To demonstrate\nthe reliability of this approach, 1) the attention maps were used to visualize\nthe most relevant areas of the images, 2) the performance of a generic CNN and\nViT was compared through unsupervised learning techniques, and 3) 11\nspecialists were asked to evaluate and classify 150 proximal femur fractures'\nimages with and without the help of the ViT, then results were compared for\npotential improvement. The ViT was able to correctly predict 83% of the test\nimages. Precision, recall and F1-score were 0.77 (CI 0.64-0.90), 0.76 (CI\n0.62-0.91) and 0.77 (CI 0.64-0.89), respectively. The average specialists'\ndiagnostic improvement was 29% when supported by ViT's predictions,\noutperforming the algorithm alone. This paper showed the potential of Vision\nTransformers in bone fracture classification. For the first time, good results\nwere obtained in sub-fractures classification, with the largest and richest\ndataset ever. Accordingly, the assisted diagnosis yielded the best results,\nproving once again the effectiveness of a coordinated work between neural\nnetworks and specialists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2021 10:12:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 11:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

This kind of selectivity acts\nas an 'Information Bottleneck (IB)', which seeks a trade-off between\ninformation compression and predictive accuracy. However, such information\nconstraints are rarely explored in the attention mechanism for deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose an IB-inspired spatial attention\nmodule for DNN structures built for visual recognition. The module takes as\ninput an intermediate representation of the input image, and outputs a\nvariational 2D attention map that minimizes the mutual information (MI) between\nthe attention-modulated representation and the input, while maximizing the MI\nbetween the attention-modulated representation and the task label. To further\nrestrict the information bypassed by the attention map, we quantize the\ncontinuous attention scores to a set of learnable anchor values during\ntraining. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IB-inspired spatial\nattention mechanism can yield attention maps that neatly highlight the regions\nof interest while suppressing backgrounds, and bootstrap standard DNN\nstructures for visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification,\nfine-grained recognition, cross-domain classification). The attention maps are\ninterpretable for the decision making of the DNNs as verified in the\nexperiments.

Therefore, it is a great challenge to\ndisentangle and extract these characteristics from facial images, especially in\nan unsupervised manner. In this work, we introduce cycle-consistency in facial\ncharacteristics as free supervisory signal to learn facial representations from\nunlabeled facial images. The learning is realized by superimposing the facial\nmotion cycle-consistency and identity cycle-consistency constraints. The main\nidea of the facial motion cycle-consistency is that, given a face with\nexpression, we can perform de-expression to a neutral face via the removal of\nfacial motion and further perform re-expression to reconstruct back to the\noriginal face. The main idea of the identity cycle-consistency is to exploit\nboth de-identity into mean face by depriving the given neutral face of its\nidentity via feature re-normalization and re-identity into neutral face by\nadding the personal attributes to the mean face. At training time, our model\nlearns to disentangle two distinct facial representations to be useful for\nperforming cycle-consistent face reconstruction. At test time, we use the\nlinear protocol scheme for evaluating facial representations on various tasks,\nincluding facial expression recognition and head pose regression. We also can\ndirectly apply the learnt facial representations to person recognition,\nfrontalization and image-to-image translation.

The central purposes of this Post-Doctoral\nConcluding Report are (1) to reveal the core position of energy viewpoint in\nthe realm of electromagnetic modal analysis; (2) to show how to do\nenergy-viewpoint-based modal analysis for various electromagnetic structures.\nThe major conclusions of this report are that: energy conservation law governs\nthe energy utilization processes of various electromagnetic structures, and its\nenergy source term sustains the steady energy utilization processes; the whole\nmodal space of an electromagnetic structure is spanned by a series of\nenergy-decoupled modes (DMs), which don't have net energy exchange in any\nintegral period; the DMs can be effectively constructed by orthogonalizing\nenergy source operator, which is just the operator form of the energy source\nterm. Specifically speaking: in classical electromagnetism, energy conservation\nlaw has five different manifestation forms, that are power transport theorem\n(PTT), partial-structure-oriented work-energy theorem (PS-WET),\nentire-structure-oriented work-energy theorem (ES-WET), Poynting's theorem\n(PtT), and Lorentz's reciprocity theorem (LRT) forms; the energy source terms\nin the first four forms are formulated as input power operator (IPO),\npartial-structure-oriented driving power operator (PS-DPO),\nentire-structure-oriented driving power operator (ES-DPO), and Poynting's flux\noperator (PtFO); the DMs of wave-port-fed, lumped-port-driven,\nexternally-incident-field-driven, and energy-dissipating/self-oscillating\nelectromagnetic structures can be constructed by orthogonalizing IPO, PS-DPO,\nES-DPO, and PtFO; LRT guarantees that the obtained DMs satisfy some useful\nEm-Hn orthogonality relations, where the Em and Hn represent the electric field\nof the m-th DM and the magnetic field of the n-th DM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2021 11:55:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 03:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Moreover, in cloud computing or GPU clusters where the tasks\narrive sequentially in a stream, faster online fine-tuning is a more desired\nand realistic strategy for saving money, energy consumption, and CO2 emission.\nIn this paper, we propose a joint Neural Architecture Search and Online\nAdaption framework named NASOA towards a faster task-oriented fine-tuning upon\nthe request of users. Specifically, NASOA first adopts an offline NAS to\nidentify a group of training-efficient networks to form a pretrained model zoo.\nWe propose a novel joint block and macro-level search space to enable a\nflexible and efficient search.

Previous methods typically follow a two-stage optimization pipeline,\nwhere the network is first pre-trained on source and then fine-tuned on target\nwith pseudo labels created by feature clustering. Such methods sustain two main\nlimitations. (1) The label noise may hinder the learning of discriminative\nfeatures for recognizing target classes. (2) The domain gap may hinder\nknowledge transferring from source to target. We propose three types of\ntechnical schemes to alleviate these issues. First, we propose a cluster-wise\ncontrastive learning algorithm (CCL) by iterative optimization of feature\nlearning and cluster refinery to learn noise-tolerant representations in the\nunsupervised manner. Second, we adopt a progressive domain adaptation (PDA)\nstrategy to gradually mitigate the domain gap between source and target data.\nThird, we propose Fourier augmentation (FA) for further maximizing the class\nseparability of re-ID models by imposing extra constraints in the Fourier\nspace.

This is\nespecially problematic when bias is amplified over time as a few popular items\nare repeatedly over-represented in recommendation lists. This phenomenon can be\nviewed as a recommendation feedback loop: the system repeatedly recommends\ncertain items at different time points and interactions of users with those\nitems will amplify bias towards those items over time. This issue has been\nextensively studied in the literature on model-based or neighborhood-based\nrecommendation algorithms, but less work has been done on online recommendation\nmodels such as those based on multi-armed Bandit algorithms. In this paper, we\nstudy exposure bias in a class of well-known bandit algorithms known as Linear\nCascade Bandits. We analyze these algorithms on their ability to handle\nexposure bias and provide a fair representation for items and suppliers in the\nrecommendation results. Our analysis reveals that these algorithms fail to\ntreat items and suppliers fairly and do not sufficiently explore the item space\nfor each user. To mitigate this bias, we propose a discounting factor and\nincorporate it into these algorithms that controls the exposure of items at\neach time step. To show the effectiveness of the proposed discounting factor on\nmitigating exposure bias, we perform experiments on two datasets using three\ncascading bandit algorithms and our experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod improves the exposure fairness for items and suppliers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2021 12:40:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

While existing methods for portrait shadow removal\nrequire training on a large-scale synthetic dataset, we propose the first\nunsupervised method for portrait shadow removal without any training data. Our\nkey idea is to leverage the generative facial priors embedded in the\noff-the-shelf pretrained StyleGAN2. To achieve this, we formulate the shadow\nremoval task as a layer decomposition problem: a shadowed portrait image is\nconstructed by the blending of a shadow image and a shadow-free image. We\npropose an effective progressive optimization algorithm to learn the\ndecomposition process. Our approach can also be extended to portrait tattoo\nremoval and watermark removal. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on a\nreal-world portrait shadow dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves\ncomparable performance with supervised shadow removal methods.

This task is studied in the context of Answer Set Programming (ASP)\nwhere (optimal) solutions of a problem are captured with the answer sets of a\nlogic program encoding the problem. Existing answer-set solvers already support\nthe enumeration of all (optimal) answer sets.

In this paper, we\nprovide an overview of possible solutions for the design of UAVs of low\ncomplexity, showing some of the needs of the UAVs for running efficient\nlocalization operations, performed either as a team or individually. Further,\nwe focus on different network configurations, which possibly include assistance\nwith edge computing. We also discuss open problems and future perspectives for\nthese settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2021 08:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

It has the characteristics of low cost, low\ncomplexity, and easy deployment, which provides a new opportunity to develop\nintelligent high-speed railway communications. The typical applications of\nRIS-assisted smart high-speed railway communications are introduced in detail,\nincluding suppressing the Doppler shift effect, solving frequent handoff\nproblems, overcoming high penetration loss problems, and supporting\nhigh-precision train positioning. The key technologies of RIS-assisted smart\nhigh-speed railway communications are discussed in-depth, including channel\nmeasurement and modeling, channel estimation and feedback, beamforming, network\narchitecture, and network deployment. It is believed that the combination of\nthe new intelligent high-speed railway infrastructure and the new\nelectromagnetic infrastructure built by RIS will bring broad industrial\nprospects to the intelligent high-speed railway in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2021 09:05:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 15:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

Propaganda, in\nthe form we know it today, can be dated back to the beginning of the 17th\ncentury. However, it is with the advent of the Internet and the social media\nthat it has started to spread on a much larger scale than before, thus becoming\nmajor societal and political issue. Nowadays, a large fraction of propaganda in\nsocial media is multimodal, mixing textual with visual content. With this in\nmind, here we propose a new multi-label multimodal task: detecting the type of\npropaganda techniques used in memes. We further create and release a new corpus\nof 950 memes, carefully annotated with 22 propaganda techniques, which can\nappear in the text, in the image, or in both. Our analysis of the corpus shows\nthat understanding both modalities together is essential for detecting these\ntechniques. This is further confirmed in our experiments with several\nstate-of-the-art multimodal models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2021 11:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

We used\nthis concept earlier to study zero sets of holomorphic functions in weighted\nclasses of holomorphic functions. The second type is based on the concept of\nseparatedness for subsets in domain, which is introduced in this note. The\nlatter concept, generally speaking, can be more subtle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 22:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}
