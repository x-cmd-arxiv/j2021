As an exact breather solution of the\none-dimensional focusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with nonzero boundary\nconditions, the PS can be viewed as a soliton on finite background, i.e. a\nnonlinear superposition of a soliton and a monochromatic wave. A recent\nmathematical work showed that both nonzero boundary conditions and solitonic\ncontent are not pre-requisites for the PS occurrence. Instead, it has been\ndemonstrated that PS can emerge locally, as an asymptotic structure arising\nfrom the propagation of an arbitrary large decaying pulse, independently of its\nsolitonic content. This mathematical discovery has changed the widely accepted\nparadigm of the solitonic nature of rogue waves by enabling the PS to emerge\nfrom a partially radiative or even completely solitonless initial data. In this\nwork, we realize the mathematically predicted universal mechanism of the local\nPS emergence in a water tank experiment with a particular aim to control the\npoint of the PS occurrence in space-time by imposing an appropriately chosen\ninitial chirp. By employing the inverse scattering transform for the synthesis\nof the initial data, we are able to engineer a localized wave packet with a\nprescribed solitonic and radiative content.

Although mmWave\ncellular systems can carry a larger volume of traffic, dense deployment, in\nturn, increases the BS installation and maintenance cost, which has been\nlargely ignored in their utilization. In this paper, we present an approach to\nthe problem of mmWave BS deployment in urban environments by minimizing BS\ndeployment cost subject to BS association and user equipment (UE) outage\nconstraints. By exploiting the macro diversity, which enables each UE to be\nassociated with multiple BSs, we derive an expression for UE outage that\nintegrates physical blockage, UE access-limited blockage, and\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) outage into its expression. The\nminimum-cost BS deployment problem is then formulated as integer non-linear\nprogramming (INP). The combinatorial nature of the problem motivates the\npursuit of the optimal solution by decomposing the original problem into the\ntwo separable subproblems, i.e., cell coverage optimization and minimum subset\nselection subproblems. We provide the optimal solution and theoretical\njustifications for each subproblem. The simulation results demonstrating UE\noutage guarantees of the proposed method are presented.

As\ncorrelation with other detectors is not possible for LISA, discrimination of\nsuch a GW background from the instrumental noise requires a good estimate of\nthe latter. To this purpose we have revisited Time Delay Interferometry (TDI)\nto look for new TDI signal combinations that fulfill the laser frequency noise\nsuppression requirements.

We introduce a\ncontinuum model of vWF unfolding that is developed within the framework of our\nmulti-constituent model of platelet-mediated thrombosis. The model considers\ntwo interconvertible vWF species corresponding to the collapsed and stretched\nconformational states. vWF unfolding takes place via two regimes: tumbling in\nsimple shear and strong unfolding in flows with dominant extensional component.\nThese two regimes were demonstrated in a Couette flow between parallel plates\nand an extensional flow in a cross-slot geometry. The vWF unfolding model was\nthen verified in several microfluidic systems designed for inducing high-shear\nvWF-mediated thrombosis and screening for von Willebrand Disease.

Strong unfolding caused by the\nextensional flow was limited to the center axis or middle plane of the\nchannels, whereas vWF unfolding near the channel walls relied upon the shear\ntumbling mechanism.

The high-redshift data, from the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB), crucially relies on recombination physics\nfor its interpretation. Here we study how small-scale baryon inhomogeneities\n(i.e., clumping) can affect recombination and consider whether they can relieve\nboth the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. Such small-scale clumping, which may be\ncaused by primordial magnetic fields or baryon isocurvature below kpc scales,\nenhances the recombination rate even when averaged over larger scales, shifting\nrecombination to earlier times. We introduce a flexible clumping model,\nparametrized via three spatial zones with free densities and volume fractions,\nand use it to study the impact of clumping on CMB observables. We find that\nincreasing $H_0$ decreases both $\\Omega_m$ and $S_8$, which alleviates the\n$S_8$ tension. On the other hand, the shift in $\\Omega_m$ is disfavored by the\nlow-$z$ baryon-acoustic-oscillations measurements. We find that the clumping\nparameters that can change the CMB sound horizon enough to explain the $H_0$\ntension also alter the damping tail, so they are disfavored by current Planck\n2018 data. We test how the CMB damping-tail information rules out changes to\nrecombination by first removing $\\ell>1000$ multipoles in Planck data, where we\nfind that clumping could resolve the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, we make\npredictions for future CMB experiments, as their improved damping-tail\nprecision can better constrain departures from standard recombination.

Moreover,\nHP are only lock-free in the general case. Recently, several new memory\nreclamation approaches such as WFE and Hyaline have been proposed. WFE achieves\nwait-freedom, but is less memory efficient and suffers from suboptimal\nperformance in oversubscribed scenarios; Hyaline achieves higher performance\nand memory efficiency, but lacks wait-freedom.\n  We present a new wait-free memory reclamation scheme, Crystalline, that\nsimultaneously addresses the challenges of high performance, high memory\nefficiency, and wait-freedom. Crystalline guarantees complete wait-freedom even\nwhen threads are dynamically recycled, asynchronously reclaims memory in the\nsense that any thread can reclaim memory retired by any other thread, and\nensures (an almost) balanced reclamation workload across all threads.

Strongly\nlensed Type Ia supernovae (LSNe Ia) are an independent and direct way to\nmeasure $H_0$, where a time-delay measurement between the multiple supernova\n(SN) images is required. In this work, we present two machine learning\napproaches for measuring time delays in LSNe Ia, namely, a fully connected\nneural network (FCNN) and a random forest (RF). For the training of the FCNN\nand the RF, we simulate mock LSNe Ia from theoretical SN Ia models that include\nobservational noise and microlensing. We test the generalizability of the\nmachine learning models by using a final test set based on empirical LSN Ia\nlight curves not used in the training process, and we find that only the RF\nprovides a low enough bias to achieve precision cosmology; as such, RF is\ntherefore preferred over our FCNN approach for applications to real systems.\nFor the RF with single-band photometry in the $i$ band, we obtain an accuracy\nbetter than 1\\% in all investigated cases for time delays longer than 15 days,\nassuming follow-up observations with a 5$\\sigma$ point-source depth of 24.7, a\ntwo day cadence with a few random gaps, and a detection of the LSNe Ia 8 to 10\ndays before peak in the observer frame. In terms of precision, we can achieve\nan approximately 1.5-day uncertainty for a typical source redshift of $\\sim$0.8\non the $i$ band under the same assumptions. To improve the measurement, we find\nthat using three bands, where we train a RF for each band separately and\ncombine them afterward, helps to reduce the uncertainty to $\\sim$1.0 day.

An important aspect of LoL is competitive\nranked play, which utilizes a skill-based matchmaking system to form fair\nteams. However, players' skill levels vary widely depending on which champion,\nor hero, that they choose to play as. In this paper, we propose a method for\npredicting game outcomes in ranked LoL games based on players' experience with\ntheir selected champion. Using a deep neural network, we found that game\noutcomes can be predicted with 75.1% accuracy after all players have selected\nchampions, which occurs before gameplay begins. Our results have important\nimplications for playing LoL and matchmaking. Firstly, individual champion\nskill plays a significant role in the outcome of a match, regardless of team\ncomposition. Secondly, even after the skill-based matchmaking, there is still a\nwide variance in team skill before gameplay begins. Finally, players should\nonly play champions that they have mastered, if they want to win games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 18:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-09"}

Over the last decade, many quantum machine learning\n(QML) algorithms have been proposed as candidates for such exponential\nimprovements.

A third issue, namely the\nfault-tolerance requirements of most QML algorithms, has further hindered their\npractical realization. The quantum topological data analysis (QTDA) algorithm\nof Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi was one of the first QML algorithms that\nconvincingly offered an expected exponential speedup. From the outset, it did\nnot suffer from the data-loading problem. A recent result has also shown that\nthe generalized problem solved by this algorithm is likely classically\nintractable, and would therefore be immune to any dequantization efforts.\nHowever, the QTDA algorithm of Lloyd et~al. has a time complexity of\n$O(n^4/(\\epsilon^2 \\delta))$ (where $n$ is the number of data points,\n$\\epsilon$ is the error tolerance, and $\\delta$ is the smallest nonzero\neigenvalue of the restricted Laplacian) and requires fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputing, which has not yet been achieved.

Two-population networks with\ndistinct intra - and inter-population coupling have served as simple model\nsystems for chimera states since they possess an invariant synchronized\nmanifold, in contrast to networks on a spatial structure. Here, we study\ndynamical and spectral properties of finite-sized chimeras on two-population\nnetworks.

These findings suggest that it is suitable to\nclassify the chimera states according to their order parameter dynamics, and\ntherefore we define Poisson and Non-Poisson chimera states. We then perform a\nLyapunov analysis of these two types of chimera states which yields insight\ninto the full stability properties of the chimera trajectories as well as of\ncollective modes.

Due to the small electron-to-ion mass ratio and\nthe large electron transit frequency, it is conventionally assumed that passing\nelectrons respond adiabatically in ion-gyroradius-scale modes. However, in\ngyrokinetic simulations of ion-gyroradius-scale modes in axisymmetric toroidal\nmagnetic fields, the nonadiabatic response of passing electrons can drive the\nmode, and generate fluctuations with narrow radial layers, which may have\nconsequences for turbulent transport in a variety of circumstances. In flux\ntube simulations, in the ballooning representation, these instabilities reveal\nthemselves as modes with extended tails. The small electron-to-ion mass ratio\nlimit of linear gyrokinetics for electrostatic instabilities is presented, in\naxisymmetric toroidal magnetic geometry, including the nonadiabatic response of\npassing electrons and associated narrow radial layers. This theory reveals the\nexistence of ion-gyroradius-scale modes driven solely by the nonadiabatic\npassing electron response, and recovers the usual ion-gyroradius-scale modes\ndriven by the response of ions and trapped electrons, where the nonadiabatic\nresponse of passing electrons is small. The collisionless and collisional\nlimits of the theory are considered, demonstrating parallels in structure and\nphysical processes to neoclassical transport theory. By examining initial-value\nsimulations of fastest-growing eigenmodes, the predictions for mass-ratio\nscaling are tested and verified numerically for a range of collision\nfrequencies. Insights from the small electron-to-ion mass ratio theory may lead\nto a computationally efficient treatment of extended modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 19:22:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 09:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

Strikingly,\nwith the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the easy-axis (H||c),\nmagnetization of CrOCl does not follow the prevalent spin rotation and\nsaturation pattern, but rather exhibits an easy-axis flipping from the in-plane\nto out-of-plane directions.

Despite their remarkable performance, these\nmethods make a prior assumption that the low-resolution video is obtained by\ndown-scaling the high-resolution video using a known degradation kernel, which\ndoes not hold in practical settings. Another problem with these methods is that\nthey cannot exploit instance-specific internal information of video at testing\ntime. Recently, deep internal learning approaches have gained attention due to\ntheir ability to utilize the instance-specific statistics of a video. However,\nthese methods have a large inference time as they require thousands of gradient\nupdates to learn the intrinsic structure of the data.

However, due to the complexity and diversity of actions, it remains\nchallenging to semantically represent action classes and transfer knowledge\nfrom seen data. In this work, we propose an ER-enhanced ZSAR model inspired by\nan effective human memory technique Elaborative Rehearsal (ER), which involves\nelaborating a new concept and relating it to known concepts. Specifically, we\nexpand each action class as an Elaborative Description (ED) sentence, which is\nmore discriminative than a class name and less costly than manual-defined\nattributes. Besides directly aligning class semantics with videos, we\nincorporate objects from the video as Elaborative Concepts (EC) to improve\nvideo semantics and generalization from seen actions to unseen actions.

However, simulating bulk materials fully at these scales is not\nfeasible, so that typically homogenized continuum descriptions are used\ninstead. A seamless and lossless transition of the constitutive description of\nthe elastic response of materials between these two scales has been so far\nelusive. Here we show how this problem can be overcome by using Artificial\nIntelligence (AI). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained, by\ntaking the structure image of a nanoporous material as input and the\ncorresponding elasticity tensor, calculated from Molecular Statics (MS), as\noutput. Trained with the atomistic data, the CNN model captures the size- and\npore-dependency of the material's elastic properties which, on the physics\nside, can stem from surfaces and non-local effects. Such effects are often\nignored in upscaling from atomistic to classical continuum theory. To\ndemonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the trained CNN model, a Finite\nElement Method (FEM) based result of an elastically deformed nanoporous beam\nequipped with the CNN as constitutive law is compared with that by a full\natomistic simulation. The good agreement between the atomistic simulations and\nthe FEM-AI combination for a system with size and surface effects establishes a\nnew lossless scale bridging approach to such problems.

Thereby, the procedure only makes use of\nbasic linear algebra operations, such as solving a least squares problem. In\nparticular, it is proved that the resulting least squares cubature formulas are\nensured to be positive and exact if a sufficiently large number of\nequidistributed data points is used. We also discuss the application of\nprovable positive and exact least squares cubature formulas to construct nested\nstable high-order rules and positive interpolatory formulas. Finally, our\nfindings shed new light on some existing methods for multivariate numerical\nintegration and under which restrictions these are ensured to be successful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 21:03:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 20:30:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 16:41:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

The net cash flow of private equity funds typically follow\na J-curve pattern, however the timing and the size of the contributions and\ndistributions depend on the investment opportunities. In this paper, we develop\na benchmark model and present two novel approaches (direct vs. indirect) to\npredict the cash flows of private equity funds. We introduce a sliding window\napproach to apply on our cash flow data because different vintage year funds\ncontain different lengths of cash flow information. We then pass the data to an\nLSTM/ GRU model to predict the future cash flows either directly or indirectly\n(based on the benchmark model). We further integrate macroeconomic indicators\ninto our data, which allows us to consider the impact of market environment on\ncash flows and to apply stress testing. Our results indicate that the direct\nmodel is easier to implement compared to the benchmark model and the indirect\nmodel, but still the predicted cash flows align better with the actual cash\nflows. We also show that macroeconomic variables improve the performance of the\ndirect model whereas the impact is not obvious on the indirect model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 21:08:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-09"}

We determine the inner radius of the dust emission and place\nMYSOs with K-band measurements in a size-luminosity diagram for the first time,\nand compare our findings to T Tauris and Herbig AeBes. We also compare the\nobserved K-band sizes to the sublimation radius predicted by three different\ndisc scenarios. Lastly, we apply binary geometries to trace close binarity\namong MYSOs. The inner sizes of MYSOs, Herbig AeBe and T Tauri stars appear to\nfollow a universal trend at which the sizes scale with the square-root of the\nstellar luminosity. The Brgamma emission originates from somewhat smaller and\nco-planar area compared to the 2.2 {\\mu}m continuum emission. We discuss this\nnew finding with respect to disc-wind or jet origin. Finally, we report an MYSO\nbinary fraction of 17-25% at milli-arcsecond separations (2-300 au). The\nsize-luminosity diagram indicates that the inner regions of discs around young\nstars scale with luminosity independently of the stellar mass. At the targeted\nscales (2-300 au), the MYSO binary fraction is lower than what was previously\nreported for the more evolved main sequence massive stars, which, if further\nconfirmed, could implicate the predictions from massive binary formation\ntheories. Lastly, we spatially resolve the crucial star/disc interface in a\nsample of MYSOs, showing that au-scale discs are prominent in high-mass star\nformation and similar to their low-mass equivalents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 22:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

This understanding can help to inhibit virus replication, prolong\nadaptive immune response, accelerated virus clearance, and tissue recovery, a\nkey milestone to propose a vaccine to combat coronaviruses (CoVs), e.g.,\nCovid-19. Although an innate immune system triggers inflammatory responses\nagainst CoVs upon recognition of viruses, however, a vaccine is the ultimate\nprotection against CoV spread. The development of this vaccine is\ntime-consuming and requires a deep understanding of the innate immune response\nsystem. In this work, we propose a graph neural network-based model that\nexploits the interactions between pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), i.e.,\nthe human immune response system. These interactions can help to recognize\npathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to predict the activation\nrequirements of each PRR. The immune response information of each PRR is\nderived from combining its historical PAMPs activation coupled with the modeled\neffect on the same from PRRs in its neighborhood. On one hand, this work can\nhelp to understand how long Covid-19 can confer immunity where a strong immune\nresponse means people already been infected can safely return to work. On the\nother hand, this GNN-based understanding can also abode well for vaccine\ndevelopment efforts.

The generated face image given a target age code is expected to\nbe age-sensitive reflected by bio-plausible transformations of shape and\ntexture, while being identity preserving. This is extremely challenging because\nthe shape and texture characteristics of a face undergo separate and highly\nnonlinear transformations w.r.t. age. Most recent LFS models are based on\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) whereby age code conditional\ntransformations are applied to a latent face representation. They benefit\ngreatly from the recent advancements of GANs. However, without explicitly\ndisentangling their latent representations into the texture, shape and identity\nfactors, they are fundamentally limited in modeling the nonlinear age-related\ntransformation on texture and shape whilst preserving identity. In this work, a\nnovel LFS model is proposed to disentangle the key face characteristics\nincluding shape, texture and identity so that the unique shape and texture age\ntransformations can be modeled effectively. This is achieved by extracting\nshape, texture and identity features separately from an encoder. Critically,\ntwo transformation modules, one conditional convolution based and the other\nchannel attention based, are designed for modeling the nonlinear shape and\ntexture feature transformations respectively. This is to accommodate their\nrather distinct aging processes and ensure that our synthesized images are both\nage-sensitive and identity preserving.

We show that in the limit of perfect model\nspectra and observed spectra with S/N of 100, precise estimates are possible\nfor a wide range of stellar labels: not only the effective temperature Teff,\nsurface gravity logg, and projected rotation velocity vsini, but also the\nmicro-turbulence velocity, Helium abundance and the elemental abundances [C/H],\n[N/H], [O/H], [Si/H], [S/H], and [Fe/H].

Due to its fundamental significance,\ninterest in SBP has in recent years enticed a broad spectrum of disciplines.\nYet, while the mathematics and applications of SBP have been developing at a\nconsiderable pace, accounting for marginals of unequal mass has received scant\nattention; the problem to interpolate between unbalanced marginals has been\napproached by introducing source/sink terms in an Adhoc manner. Nevertheless,\nlosses are inherent in many physical processes and, thereby, models that\naccount for lossy transport may also need to be reconciled with observed\nmarginals following Schrodinger's dictum; that is, to adjust the probability of\ntrajectories of particles, including those that do not make it to the terminal\nobservation point, so that the updated law represents the most likely way that\nparticles may have been transported, or vanished, at some intermediate point.\nThus, the purpose of this work is to develop such a natural generalization of\nthe SBP for stochastic evolution with losses, whereupon particles are \"killed\"\naccording to a probabilistic law.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm that\ntransforms the convolutional weights into the subspaces of orthonormal bases\nwhere a model is pruned. Using singular value decomposition, we decompose a\nconvolutional layer into two layers: a convolutional layer with the orthonormal\nbasis vectors as the filters, and a layer that we name \"BasisScalingConv\",\nwhich is responsible for rescaling the features and transforming them back to\nthe original space. As the filters in each transformed layer are linearly\nindependent with known relative importance, pruning can be more effective and\nstable, and fine tuning individual weights is unnecessary. Furthermore, as the\nnumbers of input and output channels of the original convolutional layer remain\nunchanged, basis pruning is applicable to virtually all network architectures.\nBasis pruning can also be combined with existing pruning algorithms for double\npruning to further increase the pruning capability. With less than 1% reduction\nin the classification accuracy, we can achieve pruning ratios up to 98.9% in\nparameters and 98.6% in FLOPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 00:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-09"}

Such phase-folded transits have become a standard\ndata visualisation in modern transit discovery papers. There is no analogous\nfolding mechanism for exomoons, which would have to represent some kind of\ndouble-fold; once for the planet and then another for the moon. Folding with\nthe planet term only, a moon imparts a small decrease in the surrounding\nout-of-transit averaged intensity, but its incoherent nature makes it far less\nconvincing than the crisp stacks familiar to exoplanet hunters. Here, a new\napproach is introduced that can be used to achieve the transit origami needed\nto double fold an exomoon, in the case where a planet exhibits TTVs. This\ndouble fold has just one unknown parameter, the satellite-to-planet mass ratio,\nand thus a simple one-dimensional grid search can be used to rapidly identify\npower associated with candidate exomoons. The technique is demonstrated on\nsimulated light curves, exploring the breakdown limits of close-in and/or\ninclined satellites. As an example, the method is deployed on Kepler-973b, a\nwarm mini-Neptune exhibiting an 8 minute TTV, where the possibility that the\nTTVs are caused by a single exomoon is broadly excluded, with upper limits\nprobing down to a Ganymede-sized moon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 01:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

Moreover, real-world\npolicies should be explainable and robust to simulation-to-reality gaps, e.g.,\ndue to calibration issues. Existing approaches are often limited to a narrow\nset of policy levers or objectives that are hard to measure, do not yield\nexplicit optimal policies, or do not consider strategic behavior, for example.\nHence, it remains challenging to optimize policy in real-world scenarios. Here\nwe show that the AI Economist framework enables effective, flexible, and\ninterpretable policy design using two-level reinforcement learning (RL) and\ndata-driven simulations.

Slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars are main-sequence multi-periodic\noscillators that display non-radial gravity modes.

In this inference, any direct resonant mode coupling\nhas usually been ignored so far.\n  Aims. We re-analysed the light curves of a sample of 38 known Kepler SPB\nstars. For 26 of those, the internal structure, including rotation and mixing,\nwas recently inferred from their dipole prograde oscillation modes. Our aim is\nto detect direct nonlinear resonant mode coupling among the largest-amplitude\ngravity modes.\n  Methods. We extract up to 200 periodic signals per star with five different\niterative prewhitening strategies based on linear and nonlinear regression\napplied to the light curves.

To\nsolve this complex problem, we use an iterative method, in which when we\noptimize one variable, we fix the other three variables.

In these applications,\ncontinuously targeting the moving animal is a crucial requirement. Due to the\nunderactuated characteristics of the quadrotor and the coupled kinematics with\nthe animal, nonlinear optimal tracking approaches, other than smooth feedback\ncontrol, are required. However, with severe nonlinearities, it would be\ntime-consuming to evaluate control inputs, and real-time tracking may not be\nachieved with generic optimizers onboard. To tackle this problem, a novel\nefficient egocentric regulation approach with high computational efficiency is\nproposed in this paper. Specifically, it directly formulates the optimal\ntracking problem in an egocentric manner regarding the quadrotor's body\ncoordinates. Meanwhile, the nonlinearities of the system are peeled off through\na mapping of the feedback states as well as control inputs, between the\ninertial and body coordinates. In this way, the proposed efficient egocentric\nregulator only requires solving a quadratic performance objective with linear\nconstraints and then generate control inputs analytically. Comparative\nsimulations and mimic biological experiment are carried out to verify the\neffectiveness and computational efficiency. Results demonstrate that the\nproposed control approach presents the highest and stablest computational\nefficiency than generic optimizers on different platforms.

Bonding interface is a technique that can\nfacilitate the network to serve services that require network stability and\nreliability.

If a frame is\nsent from the sender to the receiver, but in the process of sending one of the\nlinks there is an interruption, then the link that is still connected will be\nable to maintain the connection so that frame transmission continues, this\nworking system is called link redundancy. To monitor the condition of the link\nwhether it is connected or broken, a mechanism called link-monitoring is used.\nThe monitoring link used in this final project is Media Independent Interface\n(MII). The test step is to implement a Bonding Interface network for the use of\nvideo streaming, VoIP, and file transfer. The analysis carried out is a\nfailover test that uses a connection switching time parameter and a QoS test\nwith packet loss, delay, jitter, and throughput parameters. The results will\nthen be compared with a network that does not use a Bonding Interface, which is\na network that is only connected using one link. From the results of the\nresearch conducted is that the Bonding Interface system is able to perform a\nredundancy mechanism when one of the links is broken/down to an\nactive/connected link and the services that are run are not interrupted.\nBonding Interface is also able to provide network stability compared to\nnetworks that do not use a Bonding Interface, this is characterized by a\nsmaller jitter value than the use of a network with one link.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 04:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-22"}

The absorbed 2-10 keV flux stays nearly constant at\naround 4e-11 erg/s/cm2 during the monitoring timespan, showing only a slight\ngradual decline. A 3.86-s periodicity is detected, and the time derivative of\nthis period is measured to be 3.05(7)e-11 s/s.

Specifically, recent studies have\ndemonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in\ndetection precision of deep learning-based 3D object detection models. Although\ndriving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no\ncomprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning\nmodels and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks.\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial\nattacks, perturbation attacks and patch attacks, on the driving safety of\nvision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep\nlearning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in\nvision-based 3D object detection, Stereo R-CNN and DSGN. To evaluate driving\nsafety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving\nsafety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive\nevaluation experiments, we find that (1) the attack's impact on the driving\nsafety of autonomous vehicles and the attack's impact on the precision of 3D\nobject detectors are decoupled, and (2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger\nrobustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we\nfurther investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study.\nThe findings of this paper provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial\nattacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 04:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

An\nindispensable part of the health diet is dietary assessment. Traditional manual\nrecording methods are not only burdensome but time-consuming, and contain\nsubstantial biases and errors. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI),\nespecially computer vision technologies, have made it possible to develop\nautomatic dietary assessment solutions, which are more convenient, less\ntime-consuming and even more accurate to monitor daily food intake. Scope and\napproach: This review presents Vision-Based Dietary Assessment (VBDA)\narchitectures, including multi-stage architecture and end-to-end one. The\nmulti-stage dietary assessment generally consists of three stages: food image\nanalysis, volume estimation and nutrient derivation. The prosperity of deep\nlearning makes VBDA gradually move to an end-to-end implementation, which\napplies food images to a single network to directly estimate the nutrition. The\nrecently proposed end-to-end methods are also discussed. We further analyze\nexisting dietary assessment datasets, indicating that one large-scale benchmark\nis urgently needed, and finally highlight critical challenges and future trends\nfor VBDA. Key findings and conclusions: After thorough exploration, we find\nthat multi-task end-to-end deep learning approaches are one important trend of\nVBDA. Despite considerable research progress, many challenges remain for VBDA\ndue to the meal complexity.

Key to this transition are intrinsic fluctuations of\nachiral-to-chiral reactions and tight matching of system configurations to the\nenvironmental drives, which together amplify and sustain diverged enantiomer\ndistributions.

In this setting, the source domain data are labelled, but with\nfew-shot per category, while the target domain data are unlabelled. To address\nthe FS-UDA setting, we develop a general UDA model to solve the following two\nkey issues: the few-shot labeled data per category and the domain adaptation\nbetween support and query sets. Our model is general in that once trained it\nwill be able to be applied to various FS-UDA tasks from the same source and\ntarget domains. Inspired by the recent local descriptor based few-shot learning\n(FSL), our general UDA model is fully built upon local descriptors (LDs) for\nimage classification and domain adaptation. By proposing a novel concept called\nsimilarity patterns (SPs), our model not only effectively considers the spatial\nrelationship of LDs that was ignored in previous FSL methods, but also makes\nthe learned image similarity better serve the required domain alignment.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel IMage-to-class sparse Similarity Encoding\n(IMSE) method. It learns SPs to extract the local discriminative information\nfor classification and meanwhile aligns the covariance matrix of the SPs for\ndomain adaptation. Also, domain adversarial training and multi-scale local\nfeature matching are performed upon LDs.

Recently, several methods have been proposed for\nsemi-supervised crowd counting to reduce the labeling efforts. Given a limited\nlabeling budget, they typically select a few crowd images and densely label all\nindividuals in each of them. Despite the promising results, we argue the\nNone-or-All labeling strategy is suboptimal as the densely labeled individuals\nin each crowd image usually appear similar while the massive unlabeled crowd\nimages may contain entirely diverse individuals. To this end, we propose to\nbreak the labeling chain of previous methods and make the first attempt to\nreduce spatial labeling redundancy for semi-supervised crowd counting. First,\ninstead of annotating all the regions in each crowd image, we propose to\nannotate the representative ones only. We analyze the region representativeness\nfrom both vertical and horizontal directions, and formulate them as cluster\ncenters of Gaussian Mixture Models. Additionally, to leverage the rich\nunlabeled regions, we exploit the similarities among individuals in each crowd\nimage to directly supervise the unlabeled regions via feature propagation\ninstead of the error-prone label propagation employed in the previous methods.\nIn this way, we can transfer the original spatial labeling redundancy caused by\nindividual similarities to effective supervision signals on the unlabeled\nregions.

A\nfinite Fourier transform in the plane normal to the flow direction is used to\nsolve for the leading order axial velocity. The corresponding pressure and\ntransverse velocity are obtained via a hybrid analytic-numerical scheme based\non recursion. The channel geometry is such that one of the transverse velocity\ncomponents is negligible, and the other component, in the plane of variation of\nchannel height, is obtained from combination of the corresponding momentum\nequation and the continuity equations, assuming a low degree polynomial Ansatz\nof the pressure forcing.

We then give three applications of the construction of\ngeometric generalized Wronskians: one in intermediate hyperbolicity, and two in\nfoliation theory.

In the\nfront line, on-call engineers (OCEs) have to quickly assess the degree of\nseverity of an incident and decide which service to contact for corrective\nactions. To automate these decisions, several predictive models have been\nproposed, but the most efficient models are opaque (say, black box), strongly\nlimiting their adoption. In this paper, we propose an efficient black box model\nbased on 170K incidents reported to our company over the last 7 years and\nemphasize on the need of automating triage when incidents are massively\nreported on thousands of servers running our product, an ERP. Recent\ndevelopments in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) help in providing\nglobal explanations to the model, but also, and most importantly, with local\nexplanations for each model prediction/outcome. Sadly, providing a human with\nan explanation for each outcome is not conceivable when dealing with an\nimportant number of daily predictions. To address this problem, we propose an\noriginal data-mining method rooted in Subgroup Discovery, a pattern mining\ntechnique with the natural ability to group objects that share similar\nexplanations of their black box predictions and provide a description for each\ngroup. We evaluate this approach and present our preliminary results which give\nus good hope towards an effective OCE's adoption.

ELPs thus deliver multiple collections\nof answer sets, known as world views. Employing ELPs for reasoning problems so\nfar has mainly been restricted to standard decision problems (complexity\nanalysis) and enumeration (development of systems) of world views. In this\npaper, we take a next step and contribute to epistemic logic programming in two\nways: First, we establish quantitative reasoning for ELPs, where the acceptance\nof a certain set of literals depends on the number (proportion) of world views\nthat are compatible with the set.

Studying this regime for a model crystal, we\nextend previously obtained analytical results and confirm them quantitatively\nvia particle based computer simulations. Accessing the subtle regime of weak\ncoupling in simulations is possible via use of Green-Kubo relations. The\nanalysis allows to extract and compare the two paradigmatic mechanisms that\nhave been found to lead to dissipation: phonon radiation, prevailing even in a\npurely elastic solid, and phonon damping, e.g., caused by viscous motion of\ncrystal atoms. While phonon radiation is dominant at large probe-surface\ndistances, phonon damping dominates at small distances. Phonon radiation is\nfurthermore a pairwise additive phenomenon so that the dissipation due to\ninteraction with different parts (areas) of the surface adds up. This additive\nscaling results from a general one-to-one mapping between the mean\nprobe-surface force and the friction due to phonon radiation, irrespective of\nthe nature of the underlying pair interaction. In contrast, phonon damping is\nstrongly nonadditive, and no such general relation exists. We show that for\ncertain cases, the dissipation can even {\\it decrease} with increasing surface\narea the probe interacts with. The above properties, which are rooted in the\nspatial correlations of surface fluctuations, are expected to have important\nconsequences when interpreting experimental measurements, as well as scaling\nwith system size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 10:02:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 14:02:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 10:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

Interface diversity helps to\ncombat the problems suffered by single-interface systems due to error bursts in\nthe link, which are a consequence of temporal correlation in the wireless\nchannel. The length of an error burst is an essential performance indicator for\ncyber-physical control applications with periodic traffic, as these define the\nperiod in which the control link is unavailable.

There\nare however slight deviations from the SM that are worth investigating. The CMS\ncollaboration has reported, in a search for heavy resonances decaying in $t\n\\bar t$ with a 13-TeV center-of-mass energy and a luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$,\ndeviations from the SM predictions at the 3.5$\\sigma$ level locally\n(1.9$\\sigma$ after the look-elsewhere effect).

Interestingly, both slight excesses are compatible with a\nnew pseudoscalar boson with a mass around 400 GeV that couples at least to\nfermions of the third generation and gluons.

Therefore, as a generalization, the inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\n(iLLG) equation is proposed to model the ultrafast magnetization dynamics.\nMathematically, the LLG equation is a nonlinear system of parabolic type with\n(possible) degeneracy. However, the iLLG equation is a nonlinear system of\nmixed hyperbolic-parabolic type with degeneracy, and exhibits more complicated\nstructures. It behaves like a hyperbolic system at the sub-picosecond scale\nwhile behaves like a parabolic system at larger timescales. Such hybrid\nbehaviors impose additional difficulties on designing numerical methods for the\niLLG equation. In this work, we propose a second-order semi-implicit scheme to\nsolve the iLLG equation.

By doing so,\nit is observed that the EMC ratios do not significantly depend on the hard\nscale $Q^2$, and the outcomes are consistent with the various experimental data\nsuch as HERMES, BCDMS, JLab, SLAC, NMC, and EMC. Especially, in the mid-range\nof Bjorken $x$ values, the results are so desirable. Like our previous works\nfor the $^4He$ and $^6Li$ nuclei, we again observe that at a fixed scale $Q^2$,\nthe LO and the NLO EMC ratios with high precision are approximately the same.\nTherefore, one can conclude that at a given hard scale, the LO approximation is\ngood enough for calculating the EMC ratios of light nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 12:15:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-09"}

Consequently, besides enjoying\nthe virtues of k-means such as simplicity and scalability to large data sets,\nEulerK is also robust to noises and outliers. Although so, the centroids\ncaptured by EulerK deviate from the unit hyper-sphere surface and thus in\nstrict distributional sense, actually are outliers.

On the\nother hand, the policy controls the sensing operation in a closed-loop manner\nto switch between processes when necessary to guarantee reliable inference.

The CKR framework caters for reasoning with defeasible axioms and\nexceptions in contexts, which was extended to knowledge inheritance across\ncontexts in a coverage (specificity) hierarchy. However, the approach supports\nonly this single type of contextual relation and the reasoning procedures work\nonly for restricted hierarchies, due to non-trivial issues with model\npreference under exceptions. In this paper, we overcome these limitations and\npresent a generalization of CKR hierarchies to multiple contextual relations,\nalong with their interpretation of defeasible axioms and preference. To support\nreasoning, we use ASP with algebraic measures, which is a recent extension of\nASP with weighted formulas over semirings that allows one to associate\nquantities with interpretations depending on the truth values of propositional\natoms. Notably, we show that for a relevant fragment of CKR hierarchies with\nmultiple contextual relations, query answering can be realized with the popular\nasprin framework.

We obtain ratios between the integrated disk\npolarization flux and total system flux of 0.43% for the R' band and 0.55% for\nthe I' band. This indicates a reddish color for the light reflection by the\ndust. The inner disk ring contributes about 75% to the total disk flux.

This work explores the physics behind the splitting of a granular\ndroplet that is composed of smaller and denser particles in a bed of larger and\nlighter particles. During its sinking motion, a granular droplet undergoes a\nseries of binary splits resembling the fragmentation of a liquid droplet\nfalling in a miscible fluid. However, different physical mechanisms cause a\ngranular droplet to split. By applying particle-image-velocimetry and numerical\nsimulations, we demonstrate that the droplet of high-density particles causes\nthe formation of an immobilized zone underneath the droplet. This zone\nobstructs the downwards motion of the droplet and causes the droplet to spread\nand ultimately to split. The resulting fragments sink at inclined trajectories\naround the immobilized zone until another splitting event is initiated. The\noccurrence of consecutive splitting events is explained by the re-formation of\nan immobilized zone underneath the droplet fragments. Our investigations\nidentified three requirements for a granular droplet to split: 1) frictional\ninter-particle contacts, 2) a higher density of the particles composing the\ngranular droplet compared to the bulk particles and 3) and a minimal granular\ndroplet diameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 13:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-09"}

However, image datasets captured at low-altitude\nareas also should be concerned, such as drone-based datasets. So we present a\nlow-altitude dronebased dataset, named UAV-ROD, aiming to promote the research\nand development in rotating object detection and UAV applications. The UAV-ROD\nconsists of 1577 images and 30,090 instances of car category annotated by\noriented bounding boxes. In particular, The UAV-ROD can be utilized for the\nrotating object detection, vehicle orientation recognition and object counting\ntasks.

The ARM can convert preseted\nhorizontal anchors into high-quality rotated anchors through twostage anchor\nrefinement. The TS4 module utilizes different constrained sample selective\nstrategies to allocate positive and negative samples, which is adaptive to the\nregression task in different stages.

Motivated by this, we\nintroduce COVID-Net US, a highly efficient, self-attention deep convolutional\nneural network design tailored for COVID-19 screening from lung POCUS images.\nExperimental results show that the proposed COVID-Net US can achieve an AUC of\nover 0.98 while achieving 353X lower architectural complexity, 62X lower\ncomputational complexity, and 14.3X faster inference times on a Raspberry Pi.\nClinical validation was also conducted, where select cases were reviewed and\nreported on by a practicing clinician (20 years of clinical practice)\nspecializing in intensive care (ICU) and 15 years of expertise in POCUS\ninterpretation. To advocate affordable healthcare and artificial intelligence\nfor resource-constrained environments, we have made COVID-Net US open source\nand publicly available as part of the COVID-Net open source initiative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 16:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-09"}

If we do not\nhave a model of the dynamics of the world, which is often the case in complex\ndomains, we may need to approximate a performance function of the robot based\non its interaction with the environment. Such a performance function gives us\ninsights into the behaviour of the robot, allowing us to fine-tune the\ncontroller with manual interventions. In high-dimensionality systems, where the\nactionstate space is large, fine-tuning a controller is non-trivial. To\novercome this problem, we propose a performance function whose domain is\ndefined by external features and parameters of the controller. Attainment\nregions are defined over such a domain defined by feature-parameter pairs, and\nserve the purpose of enabling prediction of successful execution of the task.\nThe use of the feature-parameter space -in contrast to the action-state space-\nallows us to adapt, explain and finetune the controller over a simpler (i.e.,\nlower dimensional space). When the robot successfully executes the task, we use\nthe attainment regions to gain insights into the limits of the controller, and\nits robustness. When the robot fails to execute the task, we use the regions to\ndebug the controller and find adaptive and counterfactual changes to the\nsolutions. Another advantage of this approach is that we can generalise through\nthe use of Gaussian processes regression of the performance function in the\nhigh-dimensional space. To test our approach, we demonstrate learning an\napproximation to the performance function in simulation, with a mobile robot\ntraversing different terrain conditions. Then, with a sample-efficient method,\nwe propagate the attainment regions to a physical robot in a similar\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 14:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-09"}

Most common DA techniques require\nconcurrent access to the input images of both the source and target domains.\nHowever, in practice, privacy concerns often impede the availability of source\nimages in the adaptation phase. This is a very frequent DA scenario in medical\nimaging, where, for instance, the source and target images could come from\ndifferent clinical sites. We introduce a source-free domain adaptation for\nimage segmentation. Our formulation is based on minimizing a label-free entropy\nloss defined over target-domain data, which we further guide with a\ndomain-invariant prior on the segmentation regions. Many priors can be derived\nfrom anatomical information. Here, a class ratio prior is estimated from\nanatomical knowledge and integrated in the form of a Kullback Leibler (KL)\ndivergence in our overall loss function. Furthermore, we motivate our overall\nloss with an interesting link to maximizing the mutual information between the\ntarget images and their label predictions. We show the effectiveness of our\nprior aware entropy minimization in a variety of domain-adaptation scenarios,\nwith different modalities and applications, including spine, prostate, and\ncardiac segmentation. Our method yields comparable results to several state of\nthe art adaptation techniques, despite having access to much less information,\nas the source images are entirely absent in our adaptation phase. Our\nstraightforward adaptation strategy uses only one network, contrary to popular\nadversarial techniques, which are not applicable to a source-free DA setting.\nOur framework can be readily used in a breadth of segmentation problems, and\nour code is publicly available: https://github.com/mathilde-b/SFDA\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 14:56:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 20:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Over this period, the power density spectrum\nshowed a stable morphology, with broad $\\sim25\\%$ rms band-limited noise below\n16 Hz. Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) were occasionally observed, with the\nmost notably detections including a low-frequency QPO centered at 2.7 Hz and a\nsharp QPO centered at 115 Hz that may be a 2:3 resonance with the spin\nfrequency. Further, the energy dependence of the band-limited noise is studied\nthrough a spectroscopic analysis of the complex covariance in two frequency\nintervals. It is found that the power law continuum is the primary driver for\nthe observed variability, although the thermal (blackbody) emission also\nappears to be intrinsically variable in area ($5\\%$ rms) and temperature ($1\\%$\nrms).

In this paper, we propose\nRadioMic, a radio-based sound sensing system to mitigate these issues and\nenrich sound applications. RadioMic constructs sound based on tiny vibrations\non active sources (e.g., a speaker or human throat) or object surfaces (e.g.,\npaper bag), and can work through walls, even a soundproof one. To convert the\nextremely weak sound vibration in the radio signals into sound signals,\nRadioMic introduces radio acoustics, and presents training-free approaches for\nrobust sound detection and high-fidelity sound recovery. It then exploits a\nneural network to further enhance the recovered sound by expanding the\nrecoverable frequencies and reducing the noises. RadioMic translates massive\nonline audios to synthesized data to train the network, and thus minimizes the\nneed of RF data. We thoroughly evaluate RadioMic under different scenarios\nusing a commodity mmWave radar. The results show RadioMic outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art systems significantly.

MCSP is a problem to compute the circuit\ncomplexity of Boolean functions.

We show that these problems are not\ntrivially in NP but in QCMA (or have QCMA protocols). Next, we explore the\nrelations between the three quantum MCSPs and their variants. We discover that\nsome reductions that are not known for classical MCSP exist for quantum MCSPs\nfor unitaries and states, e.g., search-to-decision reduction and\nself-reduction. Finally, we systematically generalize results known for\nclassical MCSP to the quantum setting (including quantum cryptography, quantum\nlearning theory, quantum circuit lower bounds, and quantum fine-grained\ncomplexity) and also find new connections to tomography and quantum gravity.\nDue to the fundamental differences between classical and quantum circuits, most\nof our results require extra care and reveal properties and phenomena unique to\nthe quantum setting.

To study the impact the Efimov effect can\nhave in such scenarios, we consider a light impurity immersed in a weakly\ninteracting BEC, forming a Bose polaron. In this case, the higher-order\ncorrelations are localized around the impurity, making it more feasible to\ndevelop a theoretical description. Specifically, we employ a Gaussian state\nvariational Ansatz in the reference frame of the impurity, capable of both\ncapturing the Efimov effect and the formation of the polaron cloud. We find\nthat the Efimov effect leads to a cooperative binding of bosons to the impurity\nand the formation of a many-body bound state. As a result, the polaron is not\nthe ground state, but rendered a metastable excited state which can decay into\nthese Efimov clusters. While this decay is slow for small interaction\nstrengths, it becomes more prominent as the attractive scattering length\nincreases, up to the point where the polaron becomes completely unstable. This\ncritical scattering length can be interpreted as a many-body shifted Efimov\nresonance, where the scattering of two excitations of the bath with the polaron\ncan lead to bound state formation. Compared to the few-body case, the resonance\nis shifted to smaller attractive scattering lengths due to the participation of\nthe polaron cloud in the cooperative binding process. This corresponds to an\nintriguing scenario of polaron-assisted chemistry, where many-body effects lead\nto enhanced signal of the chemical recombination process, which can be directly\nprobed in state-of-the-art experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 15:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

The design of\npolicies aimed at addressing these inequities would be better informed by\ndescriptive models of segregation that are able to predict neighborhood scale\nracial sorting dynamics. While coarse regional population projections are\nwidely accessible, small area population changes remain challenging to predict\nbecause granular data on migration is limited and mobility behaviors are driven\nby complex social and idiosyncratic dynamics. Consequently, to account for such\ndrivers, it is necessary to develop methods that can extract effective\ndescriptions of their impacts on population dynamics based solely on\nstatistical analysis of available data.

Overall, we intend to extend the current Hawkes process to a wider\nrange of scenarios and, in particular, create a more realistic simulation of\nTwitter activities by incorporating the actual user status and\nfollowing-follower interactions between users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 05:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

We employ transformation-based techniques, commonly\nused to study metamaterials, to determine the require thermal conductivity for\nthe spreaders. The obtained materials, although strongly anisotropic and\ninhomogeneous, can be accurately approximated by assembling isotropic,\nhomogeneous layers, rendering them realisable. An alternative approach is then\nconsidered for the conical and trapezoidal spreaders by dividing them into two\nor three isotropic, homogeneous components respectively. We refer to these\nsimple configurations as neutral layers. All designs are validated numerically\nboth with and without the effects of thermal contact resistance between\ninterfaces. Such novel designs pave the way for future materials that can\nmanipulate and control the flow of heat, helping to solve traditional heat\ntransfer problems such as controlling the temperature of an object and energy\nharvesting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 09:38:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 14:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

The two most common arguments for\ndenying the existence of free will come from philosophy and neuroscience. The\nfirst argument is the Consequence Argument. The second asserts that our\ndecisions are first made by the brain and only then become conscious to the\nsubject, taking away the control of the decision. The purpose of these two\narguments is to demonstrate that an individual cannot be the source or primary\ncause of his or her choices. It is shown in this work that the concepts of\nprimary cause and primary source are not adequate to state a solid\ncharacterisation of free will. A new formulation of this property is proposed\nin which it is seen as a three-stage decision-making process implemented by an\nindividual to escape his or her own real or supposed alienation. This\ndecision-making process is represented in the form of a computer model called\nthe PSU (Predictability - Suspension - Unpredictability) model. The\ncompatibility of this new formulation of free will with the feeling it provides\nand the analysis of various situations are then discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 16:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

To achieve the goal of aiding BVI to\nread any text not written in Braille through this portable system, in this\nwork, a Rapid Optical Character Recognition (R-OCR) method is firstly developed\nfor real-time processing text information based on a Fisheye imaging device\nmounted at the finger-wearable electro-tactile display. This allows real-time\ntranslation of printed text to electro-Braille along with natural movement of\nuser's fingertip as if reading any Braille display or book.
