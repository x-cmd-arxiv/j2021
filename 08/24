However, they may suffer from accuracy degradation if their\nprocessing is performed under the presence of hardware-induced faults in\nmemories, which can come from manufacturing defects or voltage-induced\napproximation errors. Since recent works still focus on the fault-modeling and\nrandom fault injection in SNNs, the impact of memory faults in SNN hardware\narchitectures on accuracy and the respective fault-mitigation techniques are\nnot thoroughly explored. Toward this, we propose ReSpawn, a novel framework for\nmitigating the negative impacts of faults in both the off-chip and on-chip\nmemories for resilient and energy-efficient SNNs. The key mechanisms of ReSpawn\nare: (1) analyzing the fault tolerance of SNNs; and (2) improving the SNN fault\ntolerance through (a) fault-aware mapping (FAM) in memories, and (b)\nfault-aware training-and-mapping (FATM). If the training dataset is not fully\navailable, FAM is employed through efficient bit-shuffling techniques that\nplace the significant bits on the non-faulty memory cells and the insignificant\nbits on the faulty ones, while minimizing the memory access energy. Meanwhile,\nif the training dataset is fully available, FATM is employed by considering the\nfaulty memory cells in the data mapping and training processes. The\nexperimental results show that, compared to the baseline SNN without\nfault-mitigation techniques, ReSpawn with a fault-aware mapping scheme improves\nthe accuracy by up to 70% for a network with 900 neurons without retraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 16:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

While inferring\nknowledge from all explicitly stored experience has lead to a tremendous gain\nin data-efficiency, the question of how this data is collected has been vastly\nunderstudied. We argue that data-efficiency can only be achieved through\ncareful consideration of both aspects.

This approach balances the flexibility\nof the non-parametric GP approach with a rigid structure of physical knowledge\nencoded into the parametric model. The fully Bayesian treatment of the latter\nallows additional control over the optimization via the selection of priors for\nthe model parameters. The method is demonstrated for a noisy version of the\nclassical objective function used to evaluate optimization algorithms and\nfurther extended to physical lattice models. This methodology is expected to be\nuniversally suitable for injecting prior knowledge in the form of physical\nmodels and past data in the Bayesian optimization framework\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 16:43:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 06:05:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 20:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

While\npossibly caused by a range of processes, detailed pattern analysis points at\nclose stellar flybys as cause for some of them. Surprisingly, these discs\nreside in young low-mass clusters, where close stellar flybys are expected to\nbe rare. This fact motivated us to take a fresh look at the frequency of close\nflybys in low-mass clusters. In the solar neighbourhood, low-mass clusters have\nsmaller half-mass radii than their more massive counterparts. We show that this\nobservational fact results in the mean and central stellar density of low-mass\nclusters being approximately the same as in high-mass clusters, which is rarely\nreflected in theoretical studies. We perform N-body simulations of the stellar\ndynamics in young clusters obeying the observed mass-radius relation.

Even the fraction of small\ndiscs($<$ 10 au) is nearly identical. Our main conclusion is that the frequency\nof close flybys seems to have been severely underestimated for low-mass\nclusters.

Extended\nField Theories do not live on spacetime, but on an extended spacetime, locally\nmodelled on the space underlying the fundamental representation of the duality\ngroup. Despite its importance in M-theory, however, the global understanding of\nExtended Field Theories is still an open problem. In this thesis we propose a\nglobal geometric formulation of Extended Field Theory. Recall that ordinary\nKaluza-Klein theory unifies a metric with a gauge field on a principal bundle.\nWe propose a generalisation of the Kaluza-Klein principle which unifies a\nmetric and a higher gauge field on a principal infinity-bundle. This is\nachieved by introducing an atlas for the principal infinity-bundle, whose local\ncharts can be naturally identified with the ones of Extended Field Theory.\nThus, DFT is interpreted as a higher Kaluza-Klein theory set on the total space\nof a bundle gerbe underlying Kalb-Ramond field. As first application, we define\nthe higher Kaluza-Klein monopole by naturally generalising the ordinary\nGross-Perry monopole. Then we show that this monopole is exactly the NS5-brane\nof String Theory. Secondly, we show that our higher geometric formulation gives\nautomatically rise to global abelian T-duality and global Poisson-Lie\nT-duality. In particular, we globally recover the abelian T-fold and we define\nthe notion of Poisson-Lie T-fold. Crucially, we will investigate the global\ngeometric formulation of tensor hierarchies and gauged supergravity. In\nparticular, we will provide a global formulation of generalised Scherk-Schwarz\nreductions and we will discuss their global non-geometric properties.

We propose C5T5, a novel self-supervised pretraining method that\nenables transformers to make zero-shot select-and-replace edits, altering\norganic substances towards desired property values. C5T5 operates on IUPAC\nnames -- a standardized molecular representation that intuitively encodes rich\nstructural information for organic chemists but that has been largely ignored\nby the ML community. Our technique requires no edited molecule pairs to train\nand only a rough estimate of molecular properties, and it has the potential to\nmodel long-range dependencies and symmetric molecular structures more easily\nthan graph-based methods. C5T5 also provides a powerful interface to domain\nexperts: it grants users fine-grained control over the generative process by\nselecting and replacing IUPAC name fragments, which enables experts to leverage\ntheir intuitions about structure-activity relationships. We demonstrate C5T5's\neffectiveness on four physical properties relevant for drug discovery, showing\nthat it learns successful and chemically intuitive strategies for altering\nmolecules towards desired property values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 17:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

While this\napproximation is appropriate for superconductors with high carrier density (for\nwhich the chemical potential vastly exceeds the pairing gap), it breaks down\nfor low-carrier-density superconductors, such as topological superconductors,\ndoped semiconductors, or superfluid quantum gases. Here, we present a general\n$analytical$ framework for transport in superconducting junctions that does not\nrely on this limiting Andreev approximation. We apply our framework to describe\ntransport in junctions between $s$-wave superconductors along the BCS-BEC\ncrossover, which interpolates between the conventional high-carrier-density\n(BCS-)regime and moderate- as well as low-carrier-density regimes (unitary and\nBEC regimes), for which the Andreev approximation is not valid. As the system\nis tuned from the BCS to the BEC regime, the magnitude of a subgap current due\nto multiple Andreev reflections (MAR) decreases. However, nonlinearities in the\ncurrent-voltage characteristic become more pronounced near the intermediate\nunitary limit, giving rise to sharp peaks and dips in the differential\nconductance with even $negative$ differential conductance at specific voltages.\nMicroscopically, the negative differential conductance is related to the van\nHove points in the band structures, at which enhanced normal reflection occurs\nand that become accessible only when the chemical potential is comparable to or\nsmaller than the pairing gap. The subgap current due to MAR vanishes at a\ncritical interaction strength on the BEC side, which we identify as the\nsplitting point where the particle dispersion changes curvature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 18:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 22:36:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 16:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

This paper is devoted in studying quantum circuit\ncomplexity of PGW for various cosmological models, such as de Sitter,\ninflation, radiation, reheating, matter, bouncing, cyclic and black hole gas\nmodel etc. We compute complexity measure using both Covariance and Nielsen's\nwave function method for three different choices of quantum initial vacua:\nMotta-Allen, $\\alpha$ and Bunch-Davies.

Because entanglement entropy is independent of the squeezing angle, we\nare able to understand more details of the system using Nielsen's measure of\ncomplexity which is dependent on both squeezing parameter and angle.

Its implementation is ubiquitous in all display\ndevices and image processing software. In the last decade deep learning systems\nhave been introduced for the task of image super-resolution (SR), using several\nconvolutional layers and numerous filters. These methods have taken over the\nbenchmarks of image quality for upscaling tasks. Would it be possible to\nreplace classic upscalers with deep learning architectures on edge devices such\nas display panels, tablets, laptop computers, etc.? On one hand, the current\ntrend in Edge-AI chips shows a promising future in this direction, with rapid\ndevelopment of hardware that can run deep-learning tasks efficiently. On the\nother hand, in image SR only few architectures have pushed the limit to extreme\nsmall sizes that can actually run on edge devices at real-time. We explore\npossible solutions to this problem with the aim to fill the gap between classic\nupscalers and small deep learning configurations. As a transition from classic\nto deep-learning upscaling we propose edge-SR (eSR), a set of one-layer\narchitectures that use interpretable mechanisms to upscale images. Certainly, a\none-layer architecture cannot reach the quality of deep learning systems.\nNevertheless, we find that for high speed requirements, eSR becomes better at\ntrading-off image quality and runtime performance. Filling the gap between\nclassic and deep-learning architectures for image upscaling is critical for\nmassive adoption of this technology. It is equally important to have an\ninterpretable system that can reveal the inner strategies to solve this problem\nand guide us to future improvements and better understanding of larger\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 18:00:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2021 15:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

To this end, we made\nuse of the Flagship mock catalog, a state-of-the-art simulation of the data\nexpected to be observed with Euclid. We arranged the data into four adjacent\nredshift bins, each of which contains about 11000 voids and estimated the\nstacked void-galaxy cross-correlation function in every bin.

Such models\nresult in non-linear field equations, which can be solved analytically only in\nsimple highly symmetric systems. In this work we study the equation of motion\nof a scalar-tensor theory with chameleon screening using the finite element\nmethod. More specifically, we solve the field equation for spherical and\ntriaxial NFW cluster-sized halos. This allows a detailed investigation of the\nrelationship between the NFW concentration and the virial mass parameters and\nthe magnitude of the chameleon acceleration, as measured at the virial radius.\nIn addition, we investigate the effects on the chameleon acceleration due to\nhalo triaxiality. We focus on the parameter space regions that are still\nallowed by the observational constraints. We find that given our dataset, the\nlargest allowed value for the chameleon-to-NFW acceleration ratio at the virial\nradius is $\\sim 10^{-7}$. This result strongly indicates that the chameleon\nmodels that are still allowed by the observational constraints would not lead\nto any measurable effects on galaxy cluster scales. Nonetheless, we also find\nthat there is a direct relationship between the NFW potential and the\nchameleon-to-NFW acceleration ratio at the virial radius.

Due to\nlocal minimum of their potential energy at finite amplitude of the density\nfluctuations, the Q-balls provide greater binding energy of fermions into\nlocal/Cooper pairs than an exchange with infinitesimal lattice/charge/spin\nquasiparticles in the usual Frohlich mechanism.

Two methods for the setting of filter electrode voltages are detailed.\nThe challenges of low-energy electron transport in cases of low field are\ndiscussed, such as the growth of the cyclotron radius with decreasing magnetic\nfield, which puts a ceiling on filter performance relative to fixed filter\ndimensions.

In detail,\nthe proposed scheme consists of two new aspects, i.e., selection of a tailored\nmultiple access mode for each UE while considering the UE-specific radio\nresource utilization cost; and multi-dimensional radio resource allocation\namong coexisting UEs under dynamic network conditions. To reduce the\nUE-specific resource utilization cost, the base station (BS) organizes UEs with\ndisparate multi-domain resource constraints as UE coalition by considering each\nUE's specific resource availability, perceived quality, and utilization\ncapability. Each UE within a coalition could utilize its preferred radio\nresources, which leads to low utilization cost while avoiding resource-sharing\nconflicts with remaining UEs. Furthermore, to meet UE-specific QoS requirements\nand varying resource conditions at the UE side, the multi-dimensional radio\nresource allocation among coexisting UEs is formulated as an optimization\nproblem to maximize the summation of cost-aware utility functions of all UEs.

Recently, a number of SSL methods for graph\nrepresentation learning have achieved performance comparable to SOTA\nsemi-supervised GNNs. A Siamese network, which relies on data augmentation, is\nthe popular architecture used in these methods. However, these methods rely on\nheuristically crafted data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, they use\neither contrastive terms or other tricks (e.g., asymmetry) to avoid trivial\nsolutions that can occur in Siamese networks. In this study, we propose,\nGraphSurgeon, a novel SSL method for GNNs with the following features. First,\ninstead of heuristics we propose a learnable data augmentation method that is\njointly learned with the embeddings by leveraging the inherent signal encoded\nin the graph. In addition, we take advantage of the flexibility of the\nlearnable data augmentation and introduce a new strategy that augments in the\nembedding space, called post augmentation. This strategy has a significantly\nlower memory overhead and run-time cost. Second, as it is difficult to sample\ntruly contrastive terms, we avoid explicit negative sampling. Third, instead of\nrelying on engineering tricks, we use a scalable constrained optimization\nobjective motivated by Laplacian Eigenmaps to avoid trivial solutions. To\nvalidate the practical use of GraphSurgeon, we perform empirical evaluation\nusing 14 public datasets across a number of domains and ranging from small to\nlarge scale graphs with hundreds of millions of edges.

These improvements\nreduce both the time and money required to run VQAs on current cloud platforms.\nWe analytically prove that in a convex setting gCANS achieves geometric\nconvergence to the optimum. Further, we numerically investigate the performance\nof gCANS on some chemical configuration problems. We also consider finding the\nground state for an Ising model with different numbers of spins to examine the\nscaling of the method. We find that for these problems, gCANS compares\nfavorably to all of the other optimizers we consider.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 22:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

This paper explores how equality\nsaturation, a promising technique that uses e-graphs to apply rewrite rules,\ncan also be used to infer rewrite rules. E-graphs can compactly represent the\nexponentially large sets of enumerated terms and potential rewrite rules. We\nshow that equality saturation efficiently shrinks both sets, leading to faster\nsynthesis of smaller, more general rulesets.\n  We prototyped these strategies in a tool dubbed ruler.

State-of-the-art online cluster job schedulers\nuse history-based learning, which uses past job execution information to\nestimate the runtime properties of newly arrived jobs. However, with fast-paced\ndevelopment in cluster technology (in both hardware and software) and changing\nuser inputs, job runtime properties can change over time, which lead to\ninaccurate predictions. In this paper, we explore the potential and limitation\nof real-time learning of job runtime properties, by proactively sampling and\nscheduling a small fraction of the tasks of each job. Such a\ntask-sampling-based approach exploits the similarity among runtime properties\nof the tasks of the same job and is inherently immune to changing job behavior.\nOur study focuses on two key questions in comparing task-sampling-based\nlearning (learning in space) and history-based learning (learning in time): (1)\nCan learning in space be more accurate than learning in time? (2) If so, can\ndelaying scheduling the remaining tasks of a job till the completion of sampled\ntasks be more than compensated by the improved accuracy and result in improved\njob performance? Our analytical and experimental analysis of 3 production\ntraces with different skew and job distribution shows that learning in space\ncan be substantially more accurate.

We present a general framework in which the RIS, referred to as\nmodulating intelligent surface (MIS) in this paper, is used to: i) beamform the\nsignals for a set of users whose data modulation is already performed by the\nbase station (BS), and at the same time, ii) embed the data of a different set\nof users by passively modulating the deliberately sent carrier signals from the\nBS to the RIS. To maximize each user's spectral efficiency, a joint non-convex\noptimization problem is formulated under the sum minimum mean-square error\n(MMSE) criterion. Alternating optimization is used to divide the original joint\nproblem into two tasks of: i) separately optimizing the MIS phase-shifts for\npassive beamforming along with data embedding for the BS- and MIS-served users,\nrespectively, and ii) jointly optimizing the active precoder and the receive\nscaling factor for the BS- and MIS-served users, respectively. While the\nsolution to the latter joint problem is found in closed-form using traditional\noptimization techniques, the optimal phase-shifts at the MIS are obtained by\nderiving the appropriate optimization-oriented vector approximate message\npassing (OOVAMP) algorithm. Moreover, the original joint problem is solved\nunder both ideal and practical constraints on the MIS phase shifts, namely, the\nunimodular constraint and assuming each MIS element to be terminated by a\nvariable reactive load. The proposed MIS-assisted scheme is compared against\nstate-of-the-art RIS-assisted wireless communication schemes and simulation\nresults reveal that it brings substantial improvements in terms of system\nthroughput while supporting a much higher number of users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 03:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

In this paper, we investigate the problem from a perspective of\ndistillation, hence we call Label Assignment Distillation (LAD). Our initial\nmotivation is very simple, we use a teacher network to generate labels for the\nstudent. This can be achieved in two ways: either using the teacher's\nprediction as the direct targets (soft label), or through the hard labels\ndynamically assigned by the teacher (LAD). Our experiments reveal that: (i) LAD\nis more effective than soft-label, but they are complementary. (ii) Using LAD,\na smaller teacher can also improve a larger student significantly, while\nsoft-label can't.

Although numerous efforts\nare proposed to address these limitations, such as various forms of skip\nconnections, graph normalization, and random dropping, it is difficult to\ndisentangle the advantages brought by a deep GNN architecture from those\n\"tricks\" necessary to train such an architecture.

Existing methods mostly employ homogeneous convolution operators to\nconsume the RGB and depth features, ignoring their intrinsic differences. In\nfact, the RGB values capture the photometric appearance properties in the\nprojected image space, while the depth feature encodes both the shape of a\nlocal geometry as well as the base (whereabout) of it in a larger context.\nCompared with the base, the shape probably is more inherent and has a stronger\nconnection to the semantics, and thus is more critical for segmentation\naccuracy. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a Shape-aware\nConvolutional layer (ShapeConv) for processing the depth feature, where the\ndepth feature is firstly decomposed into a shape-component and a\nbase-component, next two learnable weights are introduced to cooperate with\nthem independently, and finally a convolution is applied on the re-weighted\ncombination of these two components. ShapeConv is model-agnostic and can be\neasily integrated into most CNNs to replace vanilla convolutional layers for\nsemantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on three challenging indoor RGB-D\nsemantic segmentation benchmarks, i.e., NYU-Dv2(-13,-40), SUN RGB-D, and SID,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our ShapeConv when employing it over five\npopular architectures. Moreover, the performance of CNNs with ShapeConv is\nboosted without introducing any computation and memory increase in the\ninference phase. The reason is that the learnt weights for balancing the\nimportance between the shape and base components in ShapeConv become constants\nin the inference phase, and thus can be fused into the following convolution,\nresulting in a network that is identical to one with vanilla convolutional\nlayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 05:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

DIBs, ERE, and UIBs are observed\npredominantly at the edge of HI clouds, are manifestly related, and remain\npoorly understood. Their salient properties correspond to two major\ncharacteristics of HI Raman scattering: unusual line broadenings and a\nconcentration of the Raman scattered ultraviolet continuum in the vicinity of\nhydrogen's optical and infrared transitions. Raman scattering by atomic\nhydrogen has now been detected in several object classes where the spectral\nfeatures are observed, and I argue that it can account for all three features.\nI further identify three factors that condition observation of Raman scattering\nin HI clouds, and thus of DIBs, ERE, and UIBs: the hardness of the radiation\nfield, interstellar dust extinction, and the geometry of the observation. The\ngeometry determines whether complete forward scattering, yielding DIBs, or\nscattering at large angles, yielding ERE in the vicinity of H{\\alpha} and UIBs\nin the infrared spectrum, will be observed.

In this paper, we propose Counterfactual\nExplainable Recommendation (CountER), which takes the insights of\ncounterfactual reasoning from causal inference for explainable recommendation.\nCountER is able to formulate the complexity and the strength of explanations,\nand it adopts a counterfactual learning framework to seek simple (low\ncomplexity) and effective (high strength) explanations for the model decision.\nTechnically, for each item recommended to each user, CountER formulates a joint\noptimization problem to generate minimal changes on the item aspects so as to\ncreate a counterfactual item, such that the recommendation decision on the\ncounterfactual item is reversed. These altered aspects constitute the\nexplanation of why the original item is recommended. The counterfactual\nexplanation helps both the users for better understanding and the system\ndesigners for better model debugging. Another contribution of the work is the\nevaluation of explainable recommendation, which has been a challenging task.\nFortunately, counterfactual explanations are very suitable for standard\nquantitative evaluation. To measure the explanation quality, we design two\ntypes of evaluation metrics, one from user's perspective (i.e. why the user\nlikes the item), and the other from model's perspective (i.e. why the item is\nrecommended by the model). We apply our counterfactual learning algorithm on a\nblack-box recommender system and evaluate the generated explanations on five\nreal-world datasets.

This contrasts with and can be more performant than value-based joins\nin RDBMSs and has lead researchers to investigate ways to integrate predefined\njoins directly into RDBMSs. Existing approaches adopt a strict separation of\ngraph and relational data and processors, where a graph-specific processor uses\nleft-deep and index nested loop joins for a subset of joins. This may be\nsuboptimal, and may lead to non-sequential scans of data in some queries. We\npropose a purely relational approach to integrate predefined joins in columnar\nRDBMSs that uses row IDs (RIDs) of tuples as pointers. Users can predefine\nequality joins between any two tables, which leads to materializing RIDs in\nextended tables and optionally in RID indices. Instead of using the RID index\nto perform the join directly, we use it primarily in hash joins to generate\nsemi-join filters that can be passed to scans using sideways information\npassing, ensuring sequential scans. In some settings, we also use RID indices\nto reduce the number of joins in query plans. Our approach does not introduce\nany graph-specific system components, can execute predefined joins on any join\nplan, and can improve performance on any workload that contains equality joins\nthat can be predefined. We integrated our approach to DuckDB and call the\nresulting system {\\em GRainDB}. We demonstrate that GRainDB far improves the\nperformance of DuckDB on relational and graph workloads with large many-to-many\njoins, making it competitive with a state-of-the-art GDBMS, and incurs no major\noverheads otherwise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 06:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

A remarkable theorem of Newman-Sohler (SICOMP\n2013) asserts that all properties of planar graphs (more generally hyperfinite)\nare testable with query complexity only depending on $\\varepsilon$. Recent\nadvances in testing minor-freeness have proven that all additive and monotone\nproperties of planar graphs can be tested in $poly(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ queries.\nSome properties falling outside this class, such as Hamiltonicity, also have a\nsimilar complexity for planar graphs. Motivated by these results, we ask: can\nall properties of planar graphs can be tested in $poly(\\varepsilon^{-1})$\nqueries? Is there a uniform query complexity upper bound for all planar\nproperties, and what is the \"hardest\" such property to test? We discover a\nsurprisingly clean and optimal answer.

Compared with other recommendation\nparadigms, session-based recommendation suffers more from the problem of data\nsparsity due to the very limited short-term interactions. Self-supervised\nlearning, which can discover ground-truth samples from the raw data, holds vast\npotentials to tackle this problem. However, existing self-supervised\nrecommendation models mainly rely on item/segment dropout to augment data,\nwhich are not fit for session-based recommendation because the dropout leads to\nsparser data, creating unserviceable self-supervision signals. In this paper,\nfor informative session-based data augmentation, we combine self-supervised\nlearning with co-training, and then develop a framework to enhance\nsession-based recommendation. Technically, we first exploit the session-based\ngraph to augment two views that exhibit the internal and external\nconnectivities of sessions, and then we build two distinct graph encoders over\nthe two views, which recursively leverage the different connectivity\ninformation to generate ground-truth samples to supervise each other by\ncontrastive learning. In contrast to the dropout strategy, the proposed\nself-supervised graph co-training preserves the complete session information\nand fulfills genuine data augmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmark datasets show that, session-based recommendation can be remarkably\nenhanced under the regime of self-supervised graph co-training, achieving the\nstate-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 07:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

In particular, we study the different aspects of controlling\ngenerative dialogue systems, including controlling styles and topics and\ncontinuously adding and combining dialogue skills. In the three decades since\nthe first dialogue system was commercialized, the basic architecture of such\nsystems has remained substantially unchanged, consisting of four pipelined\nbasic components, namely, natural language understanding (NLU), dialogue state\ntracking (DST), a dialogue manager (DM) and natural language generation (NLG).\nThe dialogue manager, which is the critical component of the modularized\nsystem, controls the response content and style. This module is usually\nprogrammed by rules and is designed to be highly controllable and easily\nextendable. With the emergence of powerful \"deep learning\" architectures,\nend-to-end generative dialogue systems have been proposed to optimize overall\nsystem performance and simplify training. However, these systems cannot be\neasily controlled and extended as the modularized dialogue manager can.

Radio halos are megaparsec-scale diffuse radio sources{ mostly}\nlocated at the centres of merging galaxy clusters. The common mechanism invoked\nto explain their origin is the re-acceleration of relativistic particles caused\nby large-scale turbulence. Aims. Current re-acceleration models predict that a\nsignificant number of halos at high redshift should be characterised by very\nsteep spectra ($\\alpha<-1.5$) because of increasing inverse Compton energy\nlosses.

When vehicles can offer\nhitching plus charging, the UAV may hitch on a vehicle that carries it farther\naway from its destination and hitch a longer distance. The UAV may also prefer\nto hitch on a slower vehicle for the benefit of battery recharging. For\nmultiple UAVs in need of hitching, we develop the max-saving algorithm (MSA) to\noptimally match UAV-vehicle collaboration. We prove that the MSA globally\noptimizes the total hitching benefits for the UAVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 08:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

We propose to represent\nthe effect of these fluctuations by a \"FUll-Spinwave-Scaled Stochastic LLG\", or\nFUSSS LLG method. In FUSSS LLG, the intrinsic parameters of the sLLG\nsimulations are first scaled by scaling factors that integrate out the spin\nwave fluctuations up to the mesh size, and the sLLG simulation is then\nperformed with these scaled parameters. We developed FUSSS LLG by studying the\nFerromagnetic Resonance (FMR) in Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B cubes. The nominal scaling\ngreatly reduced the mesh size dependence relative to sLLG. We further\ndiscovered that adjusting one scaling exponent by less than 10% delivered fully\nmesh-size-independent results for the FMR peak. We then performed three tests\nand validations of our FUSSS LLG with this modified scaling. 1) We studied the\nsame FMR but with magnetostatic fields included. 2) We simulated the total\nmagnetization of the Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B cube. 3) We studied the effective,\ntemperature- and sweeping rate-dependent coercive field of the cubes.

In this work, a\ntwo-dimensional single-fluid discrete Boltzmann model is proposed to\ninvestigate the physical structure of ion shock. The electron is assumed\ninertialess and always in thermodynamic equilibrium. The Rankine-Hugoniot\nrelations for single fluid theory of plasma shock wave is derived. It is found\nthat the physical structure of shock wave in plasma is significantly different\nfrom that in normal fluid and somewhat similar to that of detonation wave from\nthe sense that a peak appears in the front. The non-equilibrium effects around\nthe shock front become stronger with increasing Mach number. The charge of\nelectricity deviates oppositely from neutrality in upstream and downstream of\nthe shock wave.

Unfortunately,\nsolution of PDEs is non-trivial and often involves significant computational\ntime. With recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning, the solution of PDEs using neural network has emerged as a\ndomain with huge potential. However, most of the developments in this field are\nbased on either fully connected neural networks (FNN) or convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN). While FNN is computationally inefficient as the number of\nnetwork parameters can be potentially huge, CNN necessitates regular grid and\nsimpler domain. In this work, we propose a novel framework referred to as the\nGraph Attention Differential Equation (GrADE) for solving time dependent\nnonlinear PDEs. The proposed approach couples FNN, graph neural network, and\nrecently developed Neural ODE framework. The primary idea is to use graph\nneural network for modeling the spatial domain, and Neural ODE for modeling the\ntemporal domain. The attention mechanism identifies important inputs/features\nand assign more weightage to the same; this enhances the performance of the\nproposed framework. Neural ODE, on the other hand, results in constant memory\ncost and allows trading of numerical precision for speed. We also propose depth\nrefinement as an effective technique for training the proposed architecture in\nlesser time with better accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed framework\nis illustrated using 1D and 2D Burgers' equations.

Precise outdoor localization is important\nfor Telco operators to manage, operate and optimize Telco networks. Differing\nfrom GPS, Telco localization is a technique employed by Telco operators to\nlocalize outdoor mobile devices by using measurement report (MR) data. When\ngiven MR samples containing noisy signals (e.g., caused by Telco signal\ninterference and attenuation), Telco localization often suffers from high\nerrors. To this end, the main focus of this paper is how to improve Telco\nlocalization accuracy via the algorithms to detect and repair outlier positions\nwith high errors. Specifically, we propose a context-aware Telco localization\ntechnique, namely RLoc, which consists of three main components: a\nmachine-learning-based localization algorithm, a detection algorithm to find\nflawed samples, and a repair algorithm to replace outlier localization results\nby better ones (ideally ground truth positions). Unlike most existing works to\ndetect and repair every flawed MR sample independently, we instead take into\naccount spatio-temporal locality of MR locations and exploit trajectory context\nto detect and repair flawed positions. Our experiments on the real MR data sets\nfrom 2G GSM and 4G LTE Telco networks verify that our work RLoc can greatly\nimprove Telco location accuracy. For example, RLoc on a large 4G MR data set\ncan achieve 32.2 meters of median errors, around 17.4% better than\nstate-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 11:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

It is a field in which the machines still cannot beat human\nperformance. The main motivation for automatic music transcription is to make\nit possible for anyone playing a musical instrument, to be able to generate the\nmusic notes for a piece of music quickly and accurately. It does not matter if\nthe person is a beginner and simply struggles to find the music score by\nsearching, or an expert who heard a live jazz improvisation and would like to\nreproduce it without losing time doing manual transcription. We propose\nScorpiano -- a system that can automatically generate a music score for simple\nmonophonic piano melody tracks using digital signal processing. The system\nintegrates multiple digital audio processing methods: notes onset detection,\ntempo estimation, beat detection, pitch detection and finally generation of the\nmusic score. The system has proven to give good results for simple piano\nmelodies, comparable to commercially available neural network based systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 12:47:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

However, for capturing sub-200 fs\ndynamics, efficient, high-fidelity, and high-stability pulse compression\ntechniques are essential. Spectral broadening using an all-solid-state\nfree-space geometry is particularly attractive, as it is simple, robust, and\nlow-cost. However, spatial and temporal losses caused by spatio-spectral\ninhomogeneities have been a major challenge to date, due to coupled space-time\ndynamics associated with unguided nonlinear propagation. In this work, we use\nall-solid-state free-space compressors to demonstrate compression of 170 fs\npulses at a wavelength of 1030nm from a Yb:KGW laser to ~9.2 fs, with a highly\nspatially homogeneous mode. This is achieved by ensuring that the nonlinear\nbeam propagation in periodic layered Kerr media occurs in soliton modes and\nconfining the nonlinear phase through each material layer to less than 1.0 rad.\nA remarkable spatio-spectral homogeneity of ~0.87 can be realized, which yields\na high efficiency of >50% for few-cycle compression. The universality of the\nmethod is demonstrated by implementing high-quality pulse compression under a\nwide range of laser conditions. The high spatiotemporal quality and the\nexceptional stability of the compressed pulses are further verified by\nhigh-harmonic generation.

While this tool has been employed in experiments with pulsed laser\ndriving of a cavity mode, it has not been readily accessible to experiments\nwith continuous and constant laser driving. To address this, we present a study\nof a standard optomechanical system where the cavity mode is continuously\ndriven at two different frequencies, and where sideband photons are detected by\nsingle photon detectors after frequency filtering the output from the cavity\nmode around its resonance frequency. We first derive the normalized second\norder coherence associated with the detected photons, and show that it contains\nsignatures of the quantum nature of the mechanical mode which would be absent\nwith only single-tone driving. To identify model-independent nonclassical\nfeatures, we derive two inequalities for the sideband photon statistics that\nshould be valid in any classical model of the system. We show that these\ninequalities are violated in the proposed setup. This is provided that the\naverage phonon occupation number of the mechanical mode is sufficiently small,\nwhich in principle can be achieved through sideband cooling intrinsic to the\nsetup. Violation of the first inequality means that there is no well-defined\nprobability distribution of the Glauber-Sudarshan type for the cavity mode. In\ncontrast, a violation of the second inequality means that there is no joint\nprobability distribution for the cavity mode at two times separated by a finite\ninterval, which originates from the noncommutativity of the motional\nquadratures of the mechanical mode.

The rigid-beam model is a\nreduction of the problem geometry to cylindrical coordinates and\nsimplifications to Maxwell's equations that are driven by a prescribed electron\nbeam current density. The model is convenient for comparing various reductions\nof the plasma dynamics and plasma chemistry while maintaining a good\napproximation to the overall magnitude of the beam-created electric field. The\nusefulness of this model is demonstrated by coupling the rigid-beam model to a\nfluid plasma model and a simplified nitrogen plasma chemistry. The dynamics of\nthis coupled system are computed for a range of background gas pressures, and\nthe results are compared with experimental measurements. At pressures 1 Torr\nand above, the simulated line-integrated electron densities are within a factor\nof two of measurements, and show the same trend with pressure as observed in\nexperiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 13:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

However, unlike real tables,\nthese synthetic tables lack associated metadata, such as, column-headers,\ncaptions, etc; this is because synthetic tables are created out of KGs that do\nnot store such metadata. Meanwhile, previous works have shown that metadata is\nimportant for accurate RE from tables. To address this issue, we propose\nmethods to artificially create some of this metadata for synthetic tables.\nAfterward, we experiment with a BERT-based model, in line with recently\npublished works, that takes as input a combination of proposed artificial\nmetadata and table content.

It is necessary to frequently shift the laser position on the\ntarget to selectively ablate materials in a controlled manner, and to mitigate\ndegradation of the target surface caused by ablation. An alternative to\nmounting the target onto a rotation wheel or $x-y$ translation stage, is to\nshift the laser position with a final reflection from a motorized kinematic\nmirror mount. Such a system has been developed, assembled and characterized\nwith a two axis motorized mirror and various metal targets. In the system\npresented here, ions are ablated from the target surface and guided by a 90\ndegree quadrupole bender to a Faraday cup where the ion current is measured.\nSpatially resolved scans of the target are produced by actuating the mirror\nmotors, thus moving the laser spot across the target, and performing\nsynchronous measurements of the ion current to construct 2D images of a target\nsurface which can be up to 50~mm in diameter. The spatial resolution of the\nsystem has been measured by scanning the interfaces between metals such as\nsteel and niobium, where it was demonstrated that the LAS can selectively\nablate an area of diameter $\\approx$50 $\\mu$m. This work informs the\ndevelopment of subsequent LAS systems, that are intended to serve as\nmulti-element ion sources for commercial and custom-built time-of-flight mass\nspectrometers, or to selectively study surface specific regions of samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 17:24:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 18:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Reducing\nthe radiation dose, however, decreases the quality of the reconstructed images,\nwhich consequently compromises the diagnostic performance. Various deep\nlearning techniques have been introduced to improve the image quality of LDCT\nimages through denoising. GANs-based denoising methods usually leverage an\nadditional classification network, i.e. discriminator, to learn the most\ndiscriminate difference between the denoised and normal-dose images and, hence,\nregularize the denoising model accordingly; it often focuses either on the\nglobal structure or local details. To better regularize the LDCT denoising\nmodel, this paper proposes a novel method, termed DU-GAN, which leverages U-Net\nbased discriminators in the GANs framework to learn both global and local\ndifference between the denoised and normal-dose images in both image and\ngradient domains. The merit of such a U-Net based discriminator is that it can\nnot only provide the per-pixel feedback to the denoising network through the\noutputs of the U-Net but also focus on the global structure in a semantic level\nthrough the middle layer of the U-Net. In addition to the adversarial training\nin the image domain, we also apply another U-Net based discriminator in the\nimage gradient domain to alleviate the artifacts caused by photon starvation\nand enhance the edge of the denoised CT images. Furthermore, the CutMix\ntechnique enables the per-pixel outputs of the U-Net based discriminator to\nprovide radiologists with a confidence map to visualize the uncertainty of the\ndenoised results, facilitating the LDCT-based screening and diagnosis.\nExtensive experiments on the simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate\nsuperior performance over recently published methods both qualitatively and\nquantitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 14:37:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 13:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

Our simulations span 25,000 years,\nthus covering the free-expansion and the Sedov-Taylor phase of the SNR's\nevolution.\n  We find a strong difference in the morphology of the gamma-ray emission from\nSNRs at later stages dependent on the emission process. At early times, both\nthe inverse-Compton and the Pion-decay morphology are shell-like. However, as\nsoon as the maximum-energy of the freshly accelerated particles starts to fall,\nthe inverse-Compton morphology starts to become center-filled, whereas the\nPion-decay morphology keeps its shell-like structure. Escaping high-energy\nelectrons start to form an emission halo around the SNR at this time. There are\ngood prospects for detecting this spectrally hard emission with the future\nCerenkov Telescope Array, as there are for detecting variations in the\ngamma-ray spectral index across the interior of the SNR. Further, we find a\nconstantly decreasing nonthermal X-ray flux that makes a detection of X-ray\nunlikely after the first few thousand years of the SNR's evolution. The radio\nflux is increasing throughout the SNR's lifetime and changes from a shell-like\nto a more center-filled morphology later on.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 14:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

This contribution summarizes the efforts of cleaning and\ncomplementing the catalogs developed by the gravitational-wave and\nnear-infrared communities, in order to obtain a cosmographic view on stellar\nmass ($M_*$) and star formation rate (SFR). Unprecedented cosmography is\noffered by a sample of about 400,000 galaxies within 350 Mpc, with a 50-50\nratio of spectroscopic and photometric distances, $M_*$, SFR and corrections\nfor incompleteness with increasing distance and decreasing Galactic latitude.\nThe inferred 3D distribution of $M_*$ and SFR is consistent with Cosmic Flows.\nThe $M_*$ and SFR densities converge towards values compatible with deep-field\nobservations beyond 100 Mpc, suggesting a close-to-isotropic distribution of\nmore distant sources. In addition to highlighting relevant applications for the\nfour astroparticle communities, this contribution explores the distribution of\n$B$-fields at Mpc scales deduced from the 3D distribution of matter, which is\nbelieved to be crucial in shaping the ultra-high-energy sky.

Consistently, the Seebeck coefficient S can be\nfinely tuned by a factor of almost 2 from 127 microV/K (compressive strain) to\n208 microV/K (tensile strain). Interestingly, we show that the thermoelectric\npower factor can consequently be tuned by almost 2 orders of magnitude. The\ncompressive strain yields a remarkable enhancement by a factor of 3 for 2%\ncompressive strain with respect to almost relaxed films. These results\ndemonstrate that epitaxial strain is a powerful lever to control the electric\nproperties of LSCO and enhance its thermoelectric properties, which is of high\ninterest for various devices and key applications such as thermal energy\nharvesters, coolers, transparent conductors, photocatalyzers, and spintronic\nmemories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 15:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

Given a set of polylines, which may\nshare line segments and points, PBS asks for the smallest consistent\nsimplification of these polylines with respect to a given distance threshold.\nHere, consistent means that each point is either kept in or discarded from all\npolylines containing it.

This\nhardness result holds even for two polylines. In this paper we first study the\npractically relevant setting of planar inputs. While for many combinatorial\noptimization problems the restriction to planar settings makes the problem\nsubstantially easier, we show that the inapproximability bound known for\ngeneral inputs continues to hold even for planar inputs.

The development trend of deep\nlearning models tends to results in a more complex and larger model. Although\nit leads to a better and more accurate prediction, the resulting model becomes\neven more costly, as it requires weeks of training with a huge amount of GPU\nresources. Particularly, the size and computational cost of transformer-based\nmodels have increased tremendously since its first debut in 2017 from ~100\nmillion parameters up to ~1.6 trillion parameters in early 2021. This\ncomputationally hungry model also incurs a substantial cost to the environment\nand even reaches an alarming level of carbon footprint. Some of these models\nare so massive that it is even impossible to run the model without a GPU\ncluster.\n  Greenformers improve the model efficiency of transformer models by applying\nlow-rank approximation approaches. Specifically, we propose a low-rank\nfactorization approach to improve the efficiency of the transformer model\ncalled Low-Rank Transformer. We further compare our model with an existing\nlow-rank factorization approach called Linformer. Based on our analysis, the\nLow-Rank Transformer model is suitable for improving both the time and memory\nefficiency in processing short-sequence (<= 512) input data, while the\nLinformer model is suitable for improving the efficiency in processing\nlong-sequence input data (>= 512). We also show that Low-Rank Transformer is\nmore suitable for on-device deployment, as it significantly reduces the model\nsize. Additionally, we estimate that applying LRT to the existing BERT-base\nmodel can significantly reduce the computational, economical, and environmental\ncosts for developing such models by more than 30% of its original costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 15:51:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

In most\nCNN-based detectors, these two pillars are optimized independently. Without\ndirect interactions between them, the classification loss and the regression\nloss can not be optimized synchronously toward the optimal direction in the\ntraining phase. This clearly leads to lots of inconsistent predictions with\nhigh classification score but low localization accuracy or low classification\nscore but high localization accuracy in the inference phase, especially for the\nobjects of irregular shape and occlusion, which severely hurts the detection\nperformance of existing detectors after NMS. To reconcile prediction\nconsistency for balanced object detection, we propose a Harmonic loss to\nharmonize the optimization of classification branch and localization branch.\nThe Harmonic loss enables these two branches to supervise and promote each\nother during training, thereby producing consistent predictions with high\nco-occurrence of top classification and localization in the inference phase.\nFurthermore, in order to prevent the localization loss from being dominated by\noutliers during training phase, a Harmonic IoU loss is proposed to harmonize\nthe weight of the localization loss of different IoU-level samples.\nComprehensive experiments on benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate the\ngenerality and effectiveness of our model for facilitating existing object\ndetectors to state-of-the-art accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 15:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 01:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

It is generally\nadmirable to have larger-sized datasets for higher network training accuracies.\nHowever, the impact of dataset quality has not to be involved. It is reasonable\nto assume the near-duplicate images exist in the datasets. For instance, the\nStreet View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset having cropped house plate digits from\n0 to 9 are likely to have repetitive digits from the same/similar house plates.\nRedundant images may take up a certain portion of the dataset without\nconsciousness. While contributing little to no accuracy improvement for the\nCNNs training, these duplicated images unnecessarily pose extra resource and\ncomputation consumption. To this end, this paper proposes a framework to assess\nthe impact of the near-duplicate images on CNN training performance, called\nCE-Dedup. Specifically, CE-Dedup associates a hashing-based image deduplication\napproach with downstream CNNs-based image classification tasks. CE-Dedup\nbalances the tradeoff between a large deduplication ratio and a stable accuracy\nby adjusting the deduplication threshold. The effectiveness of CE-Dedup is\nvalidated through extensive experiments on well-known CNN benchmarks. On one\nhand, while maintaining the same validation accuracy, CE-Dedup can reduce the\ndataset size by 23%. On the other hand, when allowing a small validation\naccuracy drop (by 5%), CE-Dedup can trim the dataset size by 75%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 19:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

Also,\nSasakian manifolds are locally isometric to a unit sphere under several\ncurvature and critical conditions. So, a natural question is: Does there exist\nany curvature or critical condition under which a Sasakian 3-manifold\nrepresents a geometrical object other than the unit sphere? In this regard, as\nan extension of the $\\ast$-Ricci soliton, the notion of $\\ast$-Ricci-Yamabe\nsoliton is introduced and studied on two classes contact metric manifolds. A\n$(2n + 1)$-dimensional non-Sasakian $N(k)$-contact metric manifold admitting\n$\\ast$-Ricci-Yamabe soliton is completely classified. Further, it is proved\nthat if a Sasakian 3-manifold $M$ admits $\\ast$-Ricci-Yamabe soliton\n$(g,V,\\lambda,\\alpha,\\beta)$ under certain conditions on the soliton vector\nfield $V$, then $M$ is $\\ast$-Ricci flat, positive Sasakian and the transverse\ngeometry of $M$ is Fano. In addition, the Sasakian 3-metric $g$ is homothetic\nto a Berger sphere and the soliton is steady. Also, the potential vector field\n$V$ is an infinitesimal automorphism of the contact metric structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 08:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology is one of the leading\nplatforms for upcoming wireless generation. The degradation of performance due\nto substrate coupling is a key problem to address for telecommunication\ncircuits, especially for the high throw count switches in RF frontends. In this\ncontext, a novel technique for local substrate removal is developed to\nfabricate membranes of mm-sized RF switch which allows for total etching of\nsilicon handler. RF characterization of membranes reveal a superior linearity\nperformance with lowering of 2nd harmonic by 17.7 dB and improvement in\ninsertion losses by 0.38 dB in comparison with High-Resistivity SOI substrates.\nThis improvement leads to a significant increase in frontend efficiency. These\nresults demonstrate a new route for optimization of circuit performance using\npost-fabrication substrate processing techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 10:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

But all physicists became to consider this transition\nas reversible after 1933 because of the obvious contradiction of the Meissner\neffect with the second law of thermodynamics if this transition is considered\nas a irreversible process. This radical change of the opinion contradicted\nlogic since the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the surface screening\ncurrent into Joule heat in the normal state cannot depend on how this current\nappeared in the superconducting state. The inconsistency of the conventional\ntheory of superconductivity, created in the framework of the equilibrium\nthermodynamics, with Joule heating, on which Jorge Hirsch draws reader's\nattention, is a consequence of this history. In order to avoid contradiction\nwith the second law of thermodynamics, physicists postulated in the thirties of\nthe last century that the surface screening current is damped without the\ngeneration of Joule heat. This postulate contradicts not only logic and the\nconventional theory of superconductivity but also experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 16:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}
