It is now further extended to simulate fluid\nflow problems on deformable surfaces using curvilinear moving grids.

Adequate emphasis is provided to\napproximate grid metrics up to the desired level of accuracy and freestream\npreserving property has been numerically examined. As we discretize the\nnon-conservative form of the N-S equation, the importance of accurate\nsatisfaction of geometric conservation law (GCL) is investigated. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first higher order compact method that can\ndirectly tackle non-conservative form of N-S equation in single and multi-block\ntime dependent complex regions.

Current models do not take\nfull advantage of cancer domain-specific corpus, whether pre-training\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer model on cancer-specific\ncorpus could improve the performances of extracting breast cancer phenotypes\nfrom texts data remains to be explored. The objective of this study is to\ndevelop and evaluate the CancerBERT model for extracting breast cancer\nphenotypes from clinical texts in electronic health records.

However, due to the potentially large number of items, the\nover-parameterised item embedding matrix of a sequential recommender has become\na memory bottleneck for efficient deployment in resource-constrained\nenvironments, e.g., smartphones and other edge devices. Furthermore, we observe\nthat the widely-used multi-head self-attention, though being effective in\nmodelling sequential dependencies among items, heavily relies on redundant\nattention units to fully capture both global and local item-item transition\npatterns within a sequence.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel lightweight self-attentive network (LSAN)\nfor sequential recommendation. To aggressively compress the original embedding\nmatrix, LSAN leverages the notion of compositional embeddings, where each item\nembedding is composed by merging a group of selected base embedding vectors\nderived from substantially smaller embedding matrices. Meanwhile, to account\nfor the intrinsic dynamics of each item, we further propose a temporal\ncontext-aware embedding composition scheme. Besides, we develop an innovative\ntwin-attention network that alleviates the redundancy of the traditional\nmulti-head self-attention while retaining full capacity for capturing long- and\nshort-term (i.e., global and local) item dependencies. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that LSAN significantly advances the accuracy and\nmemory efficiency of existing sequential recommenders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 16:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

Despite being built of the same fundamental\ncomputational unit, radically different approaches have emerged for\ncharacterizing the performance of qubits in gate-based and quantum annealing\ncomputers, limiting and complicating consistent cross-platform comparisons. To\nfill this gap, this work proposes a single-qubit protocol (Q-RBPN) for\nmeasuring some basic performance characteristics of individual qubits in both\nmodels of quantum computation. The proposed protocol scales to large quantum\ncomputers with thousands of qubits and provides insights into the distribution\nof qubit properties within a particular hardware device and across families of\ndevices. The efficacy of the Q-RBPN protocol is demonstrated through the\nanalysis of more than 300 gate-based qubits spanning eighteen machines and 2000\nannealing-based qubits from one machine, revealing some unexpected differences\nin qubit performance. Overall, the proposed Q-RBPN protocol provides a new\nplatform-agnostic tool for assessing the performance of a wide range of\nemerging quantum computing devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 16:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

The pre-change distribution is assumed to\nbe stationary, while the post-change distributions are allowed to be\nnon-stationary. The case where the pre-change distribution is known is studied\nfirst, and then the extension where only the mean and variance of the\npre-change distribution are known. No knowledge of the post-change\ndistributions is assumed other than that their means are above some\npre-specified threshold larger than the pre-change mean. For the case where the\npre-change distribution is known, a test is derived that asymptotically\nminimizes the worst-case detection delay over all possible post-change\ndistributions, as the false alarm rate goes to zero. Towards deriving this\nasymptotically optimal test, some new results are provided for the general\nproblem of asymptotic minimax robust quickest change detection in\nnon-stationary settings. Then, the limiting form of the optimal test is studied\nas the gap between the pre- and post-change means goes to zero, called the\nMean-Change Test (MCT). It is shown that the MCT can be designed with only\nknowledge of the mean and variance of the pre-change distribution.

In TDD, while a joint design is not\nstrictly necessary, it can significantly reduce feedback overhead, power\nconsumption, and configuration periods associated with updating the IRS. To\ncompute the trade-off between uplink and downlink rates achieved by a joint\ndesign, a weighted-sum problem is formulated and optimized using a developed\nblock-coordinate descent algorithm. The resulting uplink-downlink trade-off\nregions are investigated by numerical simulation to gain insights into\ndifferent scenarios. In all FDD scenarios and some TDD scenarios, the jointly\noptimized design significantly outperforms the fixed-uplink (fixed-downlink)\nheuristic of using the IRS configuration optimized for uplink (downlink) to\nassist downlink (uplink) transmissions. Moreover, the joint design\nsubstantially bridges the gap to the individual design upper bound of allowing\ndifferent IRS configurations in uplink and downlink.

Despite its immense computing capacity, it is often underused by\nthe robotics and automation community due to lack of expertise in cloud\ncomputing and cloud-based infrastructure. Fog Robotics balances computing and\ndata between cloud edge devices. We propose a software framework, FogROS, as an\nextension of the Robot Operating System (ROS), the de-facto standard for\ncreating robot automation applications and components. It allows researchers to\ndeploy components of their software to the cloud with minimal effort, and\ncorrespondingly gain access to additional computing cores, GPUs, FPGAs, and\nTPUs, as well as predeployed software made available by other researchers.\nFogROS allows a researcher to specify which components of their software will\nbe deployed to the cloud and to what type of computing hardware. We evaluate\nFogROS on 3 examples: (1) simultaneous localization and mapping (ORB-SLAM2),\n(2) Dexterity Network (Dex-Net) GPU-based grasp planning, and (3) multi-core\nmotion planning using a 96-core cloud-based server. In all three examples, a\ncomponent is deployed to the cloud and accelerated with a small change in\nsystem launch configuration, while incurring additional latency of 1.2 s, 0.6\ns, and 0.5 s due to network communication, the computation speed is improved by\n2.6x, 6.0x and 34.2x, respectively.

One way to overcome these limitations is to expand the available\ngate set from single- and two-qubit gates to multi-qubit gates, which entangle\nthree or more qubits in a single step. Here, we show that such multi-qubit\ngates can be realized by the simultaneous application of multiple two-qubit\ngates to a group of qubits where at least one qubit is involved in two or more\nof the two-qubit gates. Multi-qubit gates implemented in this way are as fast\nas, or sometimes even faster than, the constituent two-qubit gates.\nFurthermore, these multi-qubit gates do not require any modification of the\nquantum processor, but are ready to be used in current quantum-computing\nplatforms.

This tower can consist of low-spin states, as in\nKaluza-Klein theory, or high-spin states, as with weakly-coupled strings. We\nprovide a suggestive bottom-up argument based on the mild $p$-form WGC that,\nfor any gauge theory coupled to a fundamental axion through a $\\theta F \\wedge\nF$ term, the tower is a stringy one. The charge-carrying string states at or\nbelow the WGC scale $g M_\\mathrm{Pl}$ are simply axion strings for $\\theta$,\nwith charged modes arising from anomaly inflow. Kaluza-Klein theories evade\nthis conclusion and postpone the appearance of high-spin states to higher\nenergies because they lack a $\\theta F \\wedge F$ term. For abelian Kaluza-Klein\ntheories, modified arguments based on additional abelian groups that interact\nwith the Kaluza-Klein gauge group sometimes pinpoint a mass scale for charged\nstrings.

We emphasize the unproven assumptions and weak points of\nthe arguments, which provide interesting targets for further work.

In our setup, the\nhidden sector contains an identical copy of Standard Model (SM) fields, but has\na smaller Higgs vacuum expectation value (VEV) and a lower temperature. The\nbaryon asymmetries and reheating temperatures in both sectors arise from the\ndecays of an Affleck-Dine scalar field, whose branching ratios automatically\nensure that the reheating temperature in each sector is proportional to the\ncorresponding Higgs VEV. The same setup also naturally ensures that the\nHydrogen binding energy in each sector is proportional to the corresponding\nVEV, so the ratios of binding energy to temperature are approximately equal in\nthe two sectors. Furthermore, our scenario predicts a correlation between the\nSM/hidden temperature ratio and the atomic dark matter abundance and\nautomatically yields values for these quantities favored by concordant early-\nand late-universe measurements of $H_0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 04:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

The planet orbits a\nfast-rotating F0 host star ($T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\simeq 7300$ K) in 1.9 days and\nexperiences intense irradiation. Notably, the TESS data show a clear secondary\neclipse with a depth of $364\\pm28$ ppm and a significant phase curve signal,\nfrom which we obtain a relative day-night planetary flux difference of roughly\n320 ppm and a 5.2$\\sigma$ detection of ellipsoidal distortion on the host star.\nPrompted by recent detections of atomic and ionized species in ultra-hot\nJupiter atmospheres, we conduct an atmospheric cross-correlation analysis. We\ndetect neutral iron (${5.2\\sigma}$), at $K_p = 157^{+68}_{-44}$ km s$^{-1}$ and\n$V_{\\rm sys} = -16^{+2}_{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$, adding another object to the small\nsample of highly irradiated gas-giant planets with Fe detections in\ntransmission. Detections so far favor particularly inflated gas giants with\nradii $\\gtrsim 1.78\\,R_{\\rm J}$; although this may be due to observational\nbias. With an equilibrium temperature of $T_{\\rm eq}=2492\\pm38$ K and a\nmeasured dayside brightness temperature of $3237\\pm59$ K (assuming zero\ngeometric albedo), TOI-1518b is a promising candidate for future emission\nspectroscopy to probe for a thermal inversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 18:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

In\nparticular, for temperatures $T\\gtrsim t$ the electrical resistivity is nearly\nlinear in temperature despite the fact that the quasiparticle scattering rate\nis non-linear and changes by nearly an order of magnitude.

The model is able to achieve\nthis with faster synthesis time and greatly reduced parameter count compared to\nthe pipeline system, illustrating some of the potential benefits of treating\nspeech and gesture synthesis together as a single, unified problem.

Interestingly, their combination is inefficient: Computational patterns\nof depthwise separable convolutions do not exhibit a rhythmic systolic flow and\nlack sufficient data reuse to saturate systolic arrays. We formally analyse\nthis inefficiency and propose an efficient operator, an optimal hardware\ndataflow, and a superior training methodology towards alleviating this. The\nefficient operator, called FuSeConv, is a drop-in replacement for depthwise\nseparable convolutions. FuSeConv factorizes convolution fully along their\nspatial and depth dimensions. The resultant computation efficiently maps to\nsystolic arrays. The optimal dataflow, called Spatial-Tiled Output Stationary\n(ST-OS), maximizes the efficiency of FuSeConv on systolic arrays. It maps\nindependent convolutions to rows of the array to maximize resource utilization\nwith negligible VLSI overheads. Neural Operator Scaffolding (NOS) scaffolds the\ntraining of FuSeConv by distilling knowledge from the expensive depthwise\nseparable convolutions. This bridges the accuracy gap between FuSeConv networks\nand baselines. Additionally, NOS can be combined with Neural Architecture\nSearch (NAS) to trade-off latency and accuracy. The HW/SW co-design of FuSeConv\nwith ST-OS achieves a significant speedup of 4.1-9.25X with state-of-the-art\nefficient networks for ImageNet. The parameter efficiency of FuSeConv and its\nsignificant out-performance over depthwise separable convolutions on systolic\narrays illustrates their promise as a strong solution on the edge. Training\nFuSeConv networks with NOS achieves accuracy comparable to the baselines.\nFurther, by combining NOS with NAS, we design networks that define\nstate-of-the-art models improving on both accuracy and latency on systolic\narrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-27"}

Notably, there have been multiple attempts to leverage Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAVs) to disinfect surfaces. Although recent research suggests\nthat surface transmission is less significant than airborne transmission in the\nspread of Covid-19, surfaces and fomites can play, and have played, critical\nroles in the transmission of Covid-19 and many other viruses, especially in\nsettings such as child daycares, schools, offices, and hospitals. Employing\nUAVs for mass spray disinfection offers several potential advantages, including\nhigh-throughput application of disinfectant, large scale deployment, and the\nminimization of health risks to sanitation workers. Despite these potential\nbenefits and preliminary usage of UAVs for disinfection, there has been little\nresearch into their design and effectiveness. In this work, we present an\nautonomous UAV capable of effectively disinfecting indoor surfaces.

Specifically,\nin adaptive BA, a wide bandwidth is divided into chunks of smaller bandwidths\nand the number of bandwidth chunks allocated to a user depends on its needs or\ntype. Although BWP in 5G NR mandates allocation of a set of contiguous\nbandwidth chunks, our BA model also allows other assumptions on chunk\nallocation such as the allocation of any set of bandwidth chunks, as in, e.g.,\nLTE resource allocation, where chunks are selected uniformly at random. The BA\nmodel studied here is probabilistic in that the user locations are assumed to\nform a realization of a Poisson point process and each user decides\nindependently to be of a certain type with some probability. This model allows\none to quantify spectrum sharing and service differentiation in this context,\nnamely to predict what performance a user gets depending on its type as well as\nthe overall performance. This is based on exact representations of key\nperformance metrics for each user type, namely its success probability, the\nmeta distribution of its signal-to-interference ratio, and its Shannon\nthroughput. We show that, surprisingly, the higher traffic variability stemming\nfrom adaptive BA is beneficial: when comparing two networks using adaptive BA\nand having the same mean signal and the same mean interference powers, the\nnetwork with higher traffic variability performs better for all these\nperformance metrics. With respect to Shannon throughput, we observe that our BA\nmodel is roughly egalitarian per Hertz and leads to a linear service\ndifferentiation in aggregated throughput value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 20:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-27"}

It allows a node to use part of memory in remote\nnodes in the same cluster. Recent studies have improved RDMA-based memory\ndisaggregation systems, supporting lower latency and higher bandwidth than the\nprior generation of disaggregated memory. However, the current disaggregated\nmemory systems manage remote memory only at coarse granularity due to the\nlimitation of the access validation mechanism of RDMA. In such systems, to\nsupport fine-grained remote page allocation, the trustworthiness of all\nparticipating systems needs to be assumed, and thus a security breach in a node\ncan propagate to the entire cluster. From the security perspective, the\nmemory-providing node must protect its memory from memory-requesting nodes. On\nthe other hand, the memory-requesting node requires the confidentiality and\nintegrity protection of its memory contents even if they are stored in remote\nnodes. To address the weak isolation support in the current system, this study\nproposes a novel hardware-assisted memory disaggregation system. Based on the\nsecurity features of FPGA, the logic in each per-node FPGA board provides a\nsecure memory disaggregation engine. With its own networks, a set of FPGA-based\nengines form a trusted memory disaggregation system, which is isolated from the\nprivileged software of each participating node.

The Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM)\nis a type of unsupervised artificial neural network for visualizing and\nclustering complex data, reducing the dimensionality of data, and selecting\ninfluential features. Like all clustering methods, the SOM requires a measure\nof similarity between input data (in this work time series). Dynamic time\nwarping (DTW) is one such measure, and a top performer given that it\naccommodates the distortions when aligning time series.

To address this, we present\na new DTW-based clustering method, called SOMTimeS (a Self-Organizing Map for\nTIME Series), that scales better and runs faster than other DTW-based\nclustering algorithms, and has similar performance accuracy. The computational\nperformance of SOMTimeS stems from its ability to prune unnecessary DTW\ncomputations during the SOM's training phase.

These data\nwere processed using the MIT SuperCloud to create several thousand Google Earth\nand Microsoft Excel files representative of many advanced analytics. The fast\nmapping of census data using Google Earth and Microsoft Excel has the potential\nto give emergency responders a powerful tool to improve emergency preparedness.\nOur approach displays relevant census data (total population, population under\n15, population over 65, median age) per census block, sorted by county, through\na Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (xlsx file) and Google Earth map (kml file). The\nspreadsheet interface includes features that allow users to convert between\ndifferent longitude and latitude coordinate units. For the Google Earth files,\na variety of absolute and relative colors maps of population density have been\nexplored to provide an intuitive and meaningful interface. Using several\nhundred cores on the MIT SuperCloud, new analytics can be generated in a few\nminutes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 00:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

Based on the analytical expansion,\nthe Hamiltonian model of mean motion resonances is formulated, and the\nresulting analytical developments are applied to Jupiter's inner and co-orbital\nresonances and Neptune's exterior resonances. Analytical expansion is validated\nby comparing the analytical results with the associated numerical outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 01:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

The goal is to maintain certain information under updates, so that\nthe $StrClu$ clustering result on~$G$ can be retrieved in $O(|V| + |E|)$ time,\nupon request. The state-of-the-art worst-case cost is $O(|V|)$ per update; we\nimprove this update-time bound significantly with the $\\rho$-approximate\nnotion. Specifically, for a specified failure probability, $\\delta^*$, and\nevery sequence of $M$ updates (no need to know $M$'s value in advance), our\nalgorithm, $DynELM$, achieves $O(\\log^2 |V| + \\log |V| \\cdot \\log\n\\frac{M}{\\delta^*})$ amortized cost for each update, at all times in linear\nspace.

Moreover, based on\nthe approximation property of networks, we establish estimates on the error\nmade by the deep Ritz method. Numerical results are reported to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method for solving fractional Laplacian equations\nup to ten dimensions. Technically, in this method, we design a special\nnetwork-based structure to adapt to the singularity and exponential decaying of\nthe true solution. Also, A hybrid integration technique combining Monte Carlo\nmethod and sinc quadrature is developed to compute the loss function with\nhigher accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 06:06:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 07:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

The analysis of the determinants of green behavior by\nEuropean SMEs is completed by a study of heterogeneity across firms and within\ncountries with a multilevel latent class model, a hierarchical clustering\nmethod. Findings: A general important evidence is that having no workers\ndedicated to green jobs is strongly correlated to the probability of adopting\nresource efficiency practices, while perceiving the need of extra environmental\nskills has a positive effect on the intention to implement actions in the\nfuture. Other characteristics of the firms play a significant impact on\nresource efficiency: in general, older and bigger firms, with larger yearly\nturnover, are more prone to implement actions. The type of chosen action varies\nacross activity sectors. What is original/value of paper: In the reference\nliterature, the relationship between green jobs, environmental skills, workers\nemployed in CE practices, and resource efficiency has received limited\nattention so far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 07:07:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-27"}

Of particular interest is the presence of suprathermal\npopulations and their influence on these transport coefficients.

In this paper, we set out to mitigate\nthe adverse effects of accent variety in building an L2 English MDD system with\nend-to-end (E2E) neural models. To this end, we first propose an effective\nmodeling framework that infuses accent features into an E2E MDD model, thereby\nmaking the model more accent-aware. Going a step further, we design and present\ndisparate accent-aware modules to perform accent-aware modulation of acoustic\nfeatures in a finer-grained manner, so as to enhance the discriminating\ncapability of the resulting MDD model. Extensive sets of experiments conducted\non the L2-ARCTIC benchmark dataset show the merits of our MDD model, in\ncomparison to some existing E2E-based strong baselines and the celebrated\npronunciation scoring based method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 07:45:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 13:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

While the pixelative format lacks intuitive\nexploitation of structural cues, sketches in vector format are absent in most\ncases limiting their practical usage. Hence, in this paper, we propose a\nlattice structured sketch representation that not only removes the bottleneck\nof requiring vector data but also preserves the structural cues that vector\ndata provides.

However, managers are faced with some challenges in finding appropriate\ncontrol strategies for crop growth, since the decision space of the greenhouse\ncontrol problem is an astronomical number. Therefore, an intelligent\nclosed-loop control framework is highly desired to generate an automatic\ncontrol policy. As a powerful tool for optimal control, reinforcement learning\n(RL) algorithms can surpass human beings' decision-making and can also be\nseamlessly integrated into the closed-loop control framework. However, in\ncomplex real-world scenarios such as agricultural automation control, where the\ninteraction with the environment is time-consuming and expensive, the\napplication of RL algorithms encounters two main challenges, i.e., sample\nefficiency and safety. Although model-based RL methods can greatly mitigate the\nefficiency problem of greenhouse control, the safety problem has not got too\nmuch attention. In this paper, we present a model-based robust RL framework for\nautonomous greenhouse control to meet the sample efficiency and safety\nchallenges. Specifically, our framework introduces an ensemble of environment\nmodels to work as a simulator and assist in policy optimization, thereby\naddressing the low sample efficiency problem. As for the safety concern, we\npropose a sample dropout module to focus more on worst-case samples, which can\nhelp improve the adaptability of the greenhouse planting policy in extreme\ncases. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can learn a more\neffective greenhouse planting policy with better robustness than existing\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 08:27:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 15:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

However, it is found ODFT has the\nproblem of phase aliasing. Moreover, ODFT does not have many FT properties,\nsuch as symmetry, integration, and interpolation. When compared with ODFT, SDFT\nhas more FT properties. Theoretically, the more properties a transformation\nhas, the wider its application range.

Because of the\noff-center distribution of energy density, these spacetimes are warped in such\na way that not all metric functions behave monotonically on the equatorial\nplane as in the exterior region of Kerr black holes (KBHs). This has great\nimpact on the orbital parameters, which in turn affects the imprints on signals\ndescendant from EMRIs in a adiabatic evolution. By investigating circular obit\nparameters, we unveil what qualitative features could be present in the signals\nthat are new and distinct compared to KBHs, and we evolve some inspirals by\nemploying the usual quadrupole formula approximation. We show that the\nfrequencies of the emitted signals behave nonmonotonically, i.e. they can\nbackward chirp, and for some particular cases they can become arbitrarily\nsmall, falling below LISA's sensibility range. Finally, we present two sets of\nwaveforms produced by a noncircular EMRI in which the compact object (CO)\nfollows a type of geodesic motion typically present in spacetimes with a static\nring (SR), in which the compact object is periodically momentarily at rest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 08:55:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 07:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

When the building blocks are mixed at large ionic\nstrength (1M NH4Cl), the electrostatic interaction is screened and complexation\ndoes not occur.

If salt is added\nback up to 1M, the transition is not reversible and persistent\nout-of-equilibrium aggregates are formed. The lifetimes of such aggregates\ndepends on Itarget: the closer Itarget to Ic is, the more difficult it is to\ndissolve the aggregates. Such peculiar behavior is driven by the inner\nstructure of the complexes that are formed after desalting. When Itarget is far\nbelow Ic, strong electrostatic interactions induce the formation of dense,\ncompact and frozen aggregates. Such aggregates can only poorly reorganize\nfurther on with time, which makes their dissolution upon resalting almost\nreversible.

Thus, semi-supervised FSS for medical images is accordingly\nproposed to utilize unlabeled data for further performance improvement.\nNevertheless, existing semi-supervised FSS methods has two obvious defects: (1)\nneglecting the relationship between the labeled and unlabeled data; (2) using\nunlabeled data directly for end-to-end training leads to degenerated\nrepresentation learning. To address these problems, we propose a novel\nsemi-supervised FSS framework for medical image segmentation.

The APM captures dependencies along the\nprojection direction of volumes and learns a series of pooling coefficients for\nfeature fusion, which efficiently reduces feature dimension. In addition, the\nQAM reweights the features by capturing four-group cross-dimension\ndependencies, which makes maximum use of 4D feature tensors. In the\ntwo-dimensional segmentation path, to acquire more detailed information, we\npropose a Feature Fusion Module (FFM) to inject 3D information into the 2D\npath. Meanwhile, we adopt the Polarized Self-Attention (PSA) block to model the\nsemantic interdependencies in spatial and channel dimensions respectively.\nExperimentally, our extensive experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset show that our\nproposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with previous\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 10:27:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 14:47:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 08:29:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 06:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 13:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

Manual\nsegmentation of tear and muscle portion is hard, time-consuming, and subjective\nto pathological expertise. This work proposes a new Region and Edge-based Deep\nAuto-Encoder (RE-DAE) for shoulder muscle MRI segmentation. The proposed RE-DAE\nharmoniously employs average and max-pooling operation in the encoder and\ndecoder blocks of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Region-based\nsegmentation incorporated in the Deep Auto-Encoder (DAE) encourages the network\nto extract smooth and homogenous regions. In contrast, edge-based segmentation\ntries to learn the boundary and anatomical information. These two concepts,\nsystematically combined in a DAE, generate a discriminative and sparse hybrid\nfeature space (exploiting both region homogeneity and boundaries). Moreover,\nthe concept of static attention is exploited in the proposed RE-DAE that helps\nin effectively learning the tear region. The performances of the proposed MRI\nsegmentation based DAE architectures have been tested using a 3D MRI shoulder\nmuscle dataset using the hold-out cross-validation technique.

Together with archival\nmulti-wavelength data, our new far-infrared continuum observations for a sample\nof 25 OB stars (including 13 B Supergiants) uniquely constrain the clumping\nproperties of the intermediate wind region. We derive the minimum radial\nstratification of the clumping factor through the stellar wind, fclmin(r), and\nthe corresponding maximum mass-loss rate, Mdotmax, normalising clumping factors\nto the outermost wind region (clfar=1). The clumping degree for r>~2 R*\ndecreases or stays constant with increasing radius for almost the whole sample.\nThere is a dependence on luminosity class and spectral type at the intermediate\nregion relative to the outer ones: O Supergiants (OSGs) present a factor 2\nlarger clumping factors than B Supergiants (BSGs). The maximum clumping of\nroughly 1/3 of the OB Supergiants occurs close to the wind base (r<~2 R*) and\nthen decreases monotonically. This contrasts with the more frequent case where\nthe lowermost clumping increases towards a maximum, and needs to be addressed\nby theoretical models. Additionally, the estimated Mdotmax for BSGs is at least\none order of magnitude lower than theoretical values, whereas for OSGs our\nresults and predictions agree within errors. Assuming values of clfar=4-9 from\nhydrodynamical models would imply a reduction of mass-loss rates included in\nstellar evolution models by a factor 2-3 for OSGs and by factors 6-200 for BSGs\nbelow the first bi-stability jump. This implies large reductions of mass-loss\nrates applied in evolution-models for BSGs, independently of the actual\nclumping properties of these winds, and a thorough re-investigation of BSG\nmass-loss rates and their effects on stellar evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 12:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

Even within the\nrecent direct approach, the multipole basis used in MPE to express the\ndielectric response still solves the electrostatic problem inefficiently or not\nat all for solutes larger than $\\approx 10$ non-hydrogen atoms. In existing MPE\nparameterizations, the resulting systematic underestimation of the\nelectrostatic solute-solvent interaction is presently compensated for by a\nsystematic overestimation of non-electrostatic attractive interactions. Even\nthough the MPE model can thus reproduce experimental free energies of solvation\nof small molecules remarkably well, the inherent error cancellation makes it\nhard to assign physical meaning to the individual free energy terms in the\nmodel, raising concerns about transferability. Here, we resolve this issue by\nsolving the electrostatic problem piece-wise in 3D regions centered around all\nnon-hydrogen nuclei of the solute, ensuring reliable convergence of the\nmultipole series. The resulting method, which we call MPE-$n$c, thus allows for\na much improved reproduction of the dielectric response of a medium to a\nsolute.

In this problem, the system comprises multiple agents each with local\ndata, and a trusted centralized coordinator. In fault-free setting, the agents\ncollaborate with the coordinator to find a minimizer of the aggregate of their\nlocal cost functions defined over their local data. We consider a scenario\nwhere some agents ($f$ out of $N$) are Byzantine faulty. Such agents need not\nfollow a prescribed algorithm correctly, and may communicate arbitrary\nincorrect information to the coordinator. In the presence of Byzantine agents,\na more reasonable goal for the non-faulty agents is to find a minimizer of the\naggregate cost function of only the non-faulty agents. This particular goal is\ncommonly referred as exact fault-tolerance. Recent work has shown that exact\nfault-tolerance is achievable if only if the non-faulty agents satisfy the\nproperty of $2f$-redundancy. Now, under this property, techniques are known to\nimpart exact fault-tolerance to the distributed implementation of the classical\nstochastic gradient-descent (SGD) algorithm. However, we do not know of any\nsuch techniques for the federated local SGD algorithm - a more commonly used\nmethod for federated machine learning. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel technique named comparative elimination (CE). We show that, under\n$2f$-redundancy, the federated local SGD algorithm with CE can indeed obtain\nexact fault-tolerance in the deterministic setting when the non-faulty agents\ncan accurately compute gradients of their local cost functions. In the general\nstochastic case, when agents can only compute unbiased noisy estimates of their\nlocal gradients, our algorithm achieves approximate fault-tolerance with\napproximation error proportional to the variance of stochastic gradients and\nthe fraction of Byzantine agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 13:04:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-27"}

A similar ansatz was later\nproposed for the D-dimensional model by using the same functional form of the\n2D ansatz and adjusting its parameters. In this paper we develop a constructive\nmethod to find the ansatz, similarly to the procedure used in 2D. The method is\nbased on our previous work for the 3D Kuramoto model where the ansatz was\nconstructed using the spherical harmonics decomposition of the distribution\nfunction. In the case of motion in a D-dimensional sphere the ansatz is based\non the hyperspherical harmonics decomposition. Our result differs from the\npreviously proposed ansatz and provides a simpler and more direct connection\nbetween the order parameter and the ansatz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 13:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

We discuss such factors in the\ncontext of the two main approaches being pursued for high efficiency\ntransduction. The first approach uses one-dimensional nanobeam optomechanical\ncrystals excited by interdigitated transducers, and is characterized by large\nsingle-photon optomechanical coupling strength, limited intracavity pump photon\npopulation to avoid absorption-induced heating, and low phonon injection\nefficiency from the transducer to the optomechanical cavity. The second\napproach uses (quasi) bulk acoustic wave resonators integrated into photonic\nFabry-Perot cavity geometries, and is characterized by low single-photon\noptomechanical coupling strength, high intracavity pump photon population\nwithout significant heating, and high phonon injection efficiency. After\nreviewing the current status of both approaches, we discuss the need for\nco-designing the electromechanical and optomechanical sub-systems in order to\nachieve high transduction efficiencies, taking the GaAs piezo-optomechanical\nplatform as an example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 13:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

The advantage of these models is their ability\nto handle high-dimensional state-space and learn compact surrogate\nrepresentations of the operational state spaces. However, the problem is that\nthe sampled observations used for training the model may never cover the entire\nstate space of the physical environment, and as a result, the system will\nlikely operate in conditions that do not belong to the training distribution.\nThese conditions that do not belong to training distribution are referred to as\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD). Detecting OOD conditions at runtime is critical for\nthe safety of CPS. In addition, it is also desirable to identify the context or\nthe feature(s) that are the source of OOD to select an appropriate control\naction to mitigate the consequences that may arise because of the OOD\ncondition. In this paper, we study this problem as a multi-labeled time series\nOOD detection problem over images, where the OOD is defined both sequentially\nacross short time windows (change points) as well as across the training data\ndistribution. A common approach to solving this problem is the use of\nmulti-chained one-class classifiers. However, this approach is expensive for\nCPSs that have limited computational resources and require short inference\ntimes. Our contribution is an approach to design and train a single\n$\\beta$-Variational Autoencoder detector with a partially disentangled latent\nspace sensitive to variations in image features. We use the feature sensitive\nlatent variables in the latent space to detect OOD images and identify the most\nlikely feature(s) responsible for the OOD. We demonstrate our approach using an\nAutonomous Vehicle in the CARLA simulator and a real-world automotive dataset\ncalled nuImages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 14:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-27"}

Computer\nvision models for person pixel-based segmentation and body-keypoints detection\nare needed to better understand the clinical activities and the spatial layout\nof the OR. This is challenging, not only because OR images are very different\nfrom traditional vision datasets, but also because data and annotations are\nhard to collect and generate in the OR due to privacy concerns. To address\nthese concerns, we first study how joint person pose estimation and instance\nsegmentation can be performed on low resolutions images with downsampling\nfactors from 1x to 12x. Second, to address the domain shift and the lack of\nannotations, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method, called\nAdaptOR, to adapt a model from an in-the-wild labeled source domain to a\nstatistically different unlabeled target domain. We propose to exploit explicit\ngeometric constraints on the different augmentations of the unlabeled target\ndomain image to generate accurate pseudo labels and use these pseudo labels to\ntrain the model on high- and low-resolution OR images in a self-training\nframework.

Molecular subtyping\nhas enabled precision medicine to overcome these challenges and provide\nsignificant biological insights to predict prognosis and improve clinical\ndecision making. Over the past decade, conventional ML algorithms and DL-based\nCNNs have been espoused for the classification of cancer subtypes from gene\nexpression datasets. However, these methods are potentially biased toward\nidentification of cancer biomarkers. Recently proposed transformer-based\narchitectures that leverage the self-attention mechanism encode high throughput\ngene expressions and learn representations that are computationally complex and\nparametrically expensive. However, compared to the datasets for natural\nlanguage processing applications, gene expression consists of several hundreds\nof thousands of genes from a limited number of observations, making it\ndifficult to efficiently train transformers for bioinformatics applications.\nHence, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach, Gene Transformer, which\naddresses the complexity of high-dimensional gene expression with a multi-head\nself-attention module by identifying relevant biomarkers across multiple cancer\nsubtypes without requiring feature selection as a prerequisite for the current\nclassification algorithms. The proposed architecture achieved an overall\nimproved performance for all evaluation metrics and had fewer misclassification\nerrors than the commonly used traditional classification algorithms. The\nclassification results show that Gene Transformer can be an efficient approach\nfor classifying cancer subtypes, indicating that any improvement in deep\nlearning models in computational biology can also be reflected well in this\ndomain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 15:02:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 08:44:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 09:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

As non-trivial mixtures of pure states do not\noccur in finite size, in a recent paper [Phys. Rev.

In the present paper, the\ncomplexity of a metastate is defined likewise in terms of the mutual\ninformation between the Gibbs state and the spin configuration.

In a certain sense,\nshadow prices are an optimal way of congestion pricing: users are charged\nshadow prices, i.e., the expectations of future losses because of blocked\nconnections. The shadow prices can be calculated exactly from the Howard\nequation, but this method is difficult. The paper presents simple\napproximations to the solution of the Howard equation and a way to derive more\nexact approximations. If users do not react by lowering their demand, they will\nreceive higher bills to pay. Many users do not react to increased prices but\nwould want to know how the congestion pricing mechanism affects the bills. The\ndistribution of the price of a connection follows from knowing the shadow\nprices and the probability of a congestion state. There is another interesting\ndistribution. The network produces profit to the operator, or equivalently,\nblocked connections produce a cost to the operator. The average cost rate can\nbe calculated from the Howard equation, but the costs have some distribution.\nThe distribution gives the risk that the actual costs exceed the average costs,\nand the operator should include this risk in the prices. The main result of\nthis paper shows how to calculate the distribution of the costs in the future\nfor congestion pricing by shadow prices and for congestion pricing with a more\nsimple pricing scheme that produces the same average costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 12:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

One of the possible physical explanations is that a supernova in\na compact binary system results in a high recoil velocity of the system.

If such a system is traced back to its parent\ncluster, binary evolution models can be tested in great detail. The Gaia proper\nmotions and parallaxes are used to demonstrate that the high-mass X-ray binary\nHD153919/4U 1700-37 originates from NGC6231, the nucleus of the OB association\nSco OB1. The O supergiant and its compact companion, of which the physical\nnature (a neutron star or a black hole) is unknown, move with a space velocity\nof 63 km/s with respect to NGC6231. The kinematical age of the system is 2.2\nMyr. The parallaxes and accurate proper motions in Gaia DR2 were used to\nperform a membership analysis of NGC 6231. The distance to NGC6231 is 1.63 kpc.\nIsochrone fitting results in an age of 4.7 Myr. With the identification of\nNGC6231 as the parent cluster, the upper limit on the age of the progenitor of\n4U1700-37 at the moment of the supernova explosion is 3.0 Myr. With these\nconstraints, the evolutionary history of the system can be reconstructed with\nan initial mass of the progenitor of the compact object >60 Msun. Given its\ncurrent high space velocity and the derived evolutionary history, the compact\nobject in the system is more likely to have received a large natal kick, which\nsuggests that it is more likely a neutron star than a black hole.\nHD153919/4U1700-37 might be a prototype in the Milky Way for the progenitor of\ngravitational wave events such as GW190412\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 14:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

The applications use\nmultiple TEEs (enclaves) communicating through software-encrypted memory\nchannels. Such execution model requires bi-directional protection: protecting\nthe rest of the system from the enclave module with sandboxing and protecting\nthe enclave module from a third-part module and operating systems. However, the\ncurrent TEE model, such as Intel SGX, cannot efficiently represent such\ndistributed sandbox applications. To overcome the lack of hardware supports for\nsandboxed TEEs, this paper proposes an extended enclave model called Stockade,\nwhich supports distributed sandboxes hardened by hardware. Stockade proposes\nnew three key techniques. First, it extends the hardware-based memory isolation\nin SGX to confine a user software module only within its enclave. Second, it\nproposes a trusted monitor enclave that filters and validates systems calls\nfrom enclaves. Finally, it allows hardware-protected memory sharing between a\npair of enclaves for efficient protected communication without software-based\nencryption. Using an emulated SGX platform with the proposed extensions, this\npaper shows that distributed sandbox applications can be effectively supported\nwith small changes of SGX hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 03:16:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 07:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

Despite presenting very promising results, the\ngeneralization of such models to the multivariate case has yet to be studied.\nMoreover, very few papers have examined the ability of neural networks to\npredict the covariance matrix of asset returns, and all use a rather small\nnumber of assets, thus not addressing what is known as the curse of\ndimensionality. The goal of this paper is to investigate the ability of hybrid\nmodels, mixing GARCH processes and neural networks, to forecast covariance\nmatrices of asset returns. To do so, we propose a new model, based on\nmultivariate GARCHs that decompose volatility and correlation predictions. The\nvolatilities are here forecast using hybrid neural networks while correlations\nfollow a traditional econometric process. After implementing the models in a\nminimum variance portfolio framework, our results are as follows. First, the\naddition of GARCH parameters as inputs is beneficial to the model proposed.\nSecond, the use of one-hot-encoding to help the neural network differentiate\nbetween each stock improves the performance. Third, the new model proposed is\nvery promising as it not only outperforms the equally weighted portfolio, but\nalso by a significant margin its econometric counterpart that uses univariate\nGARCHs to predict the volatilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 23:41:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

The modal split management directly reflects on TDM of\neach transport subsystem, including parking. In developing countries, the\npolicy-makers have largely focused on supply-side measures, yet demand-side\nmeasures have remained unaddressed in policy implications. Ample literature is\navailable presenting responses of TDM strategies, but most studies account mode\nchoice and parking choice behaviour separately rather than considering\ntrade-offs between them. Failing to do so may lead to biased model estimates\nand impropriety in policy implications. This paper seeks to fill this gap by\nadmitting parking choice as an endogenous decision within the model of mode\nchoice behaviour. This study integrates attitudinal factors and\nbuilt-environment variables in addition to parking and travel attributes for\ndeveloping comprehensive estimation results. A mixed logit model with random\ncoefficients is estimated using hierarchical Bayes approach based on the Markov\nChain Monte Carlo simulation method. The results reveal significant influence\nof mode/parking specific attitudes on commuters choice behaviour in addition to\nthe built-environment factors and mode/parking related attributes. It is\nidentified that considerable shift is occurring between parking-types in\npreference to switching travel mode with hypothetical changes in parking\nattributes. Besides, study investigates the heterogeneity in the\nwillingness-to-pay through a follow-up regression model, which provides\nimportant insights for identifying possible sources of this heterogeneity among\nrespondents.

Thus a fast and automated selection\nprocedure for experimental parameters could greatly improve the usability of\nBCIs.\n  We evaluate a standalone random search and a combined Bayesian optimization\nwith random search in a closed-loop auditory event-related potential protocol.\nWe aimed at finding the individually best stimulation speed -- also known as\nstimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) -- that maximizes the classification\nperformance of a regularized linear discriminant analysis. To make the Bayesian\noptimization feasible under noise and the time pressure posed by an online BCI\nexperiment, we first used offline simulations to initialize and constrain the\ninternal optimization model.
