Few studies have\nfocused on segmenting and tracking all humans in a complex video, including\npedestrians and humans of other states (e.g., seated, riding, or occluded). In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework, abbreviated as HVISNet, that segments\nand tracks all presented people in given videos based on a one-stage detector.\nTo better evaluate complex scenes, we offer a new benchmark called HVIS (Human\nVideo Instance Segmentation), which comprises 1447 human instance masks in 805\nhigh-resolution videos in diverse scenes. Extensive experiments show that our\nproposed HVISNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy\nat a real-time inference speed (30 FPS), especially on complex video scenes. We\nalso notice that using the center of the bounding box to distinguish different\nindividuals severely deteriorates the segmentation accuracy, especially in\nheavily occluded conditions. This common phenomenon is referred to as the\nambiguous positive samples problem. To alleviate this problem, we propose a\nmechanism named Inner Center Sampling to improve the accuracy of instance\nsegmentation. Such a plug-and-play inner center sampling mechanism can be\nincorporated in any instance segmentation models based on a one-stage detector\nto improve the performance. In particular, it gains 4.1 mAP improvement on the\nstate-of-the-art method in the case of occluded humans.

The RS effect\nleads to image distortion upon relative motion between a camera and the scene.\nThis effect needs to be considered in video stabilization, structure from\nmotion, and vision-aided odometry, for which recent studies have improved\nearlier global shutter (GS) methods by accounting for the RS effect. However,\nit is still unclear how the RS affects spatiotemporal calibration of the camera\nin a sensor assembly, which is crucial to good performance in aforementioned\napplications.\n  This work takes the camera-IMU system as an example and looks into the RS\neffect on its spatiotemporal calibration. To this end, we develop a calibration\nmethod for a RS-camera-IMU system with continuous-time B-splines by using a\ncalibration target. Unlike in calibrating GS cameras, every observation of a\nlandmark on the target has a unique camera pose fitted by continuous-time\nB-splines. With simulated data generated from four sets of public calibration\ndata, we show that RS can noticeably affect the extrinsic parameters, causing\nerrors about 1$^\\circ$ in orientation and 2 $cm$ in translation with a RS\nsetting as in common smartphone cameras. With real data collected by two\nindustrial camera-IMU systems, we find that considering the RS effect gives\nmore accurate and consistent spatiotemporal calibration. Moreover, our method\nalso accurately calibrates the inter-line delay of the RS.

The recent estimates of the 3D shape of the M/Xe-type triple\nasteroid system (216) Kleopatra indicated a density of 5 g.cm$^{-3}$. Such a\nhigh density implies a high metal content and a low porosity which is not easy\nto reconcile with its peculiar dumbbell shape. Aims. Given the unprecedented\nangular resolution of the VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL camera, we aim to constrain the\nmass and the shape of Kleopatra with high accuracy, hence its density. Methods.\nWe combined our new VLT/SPHERE observations of Kleopatra recorded in 2017 and\n2018 with archival data, as well as lightcurve, occultation, and delay-Doppler\nimages, to derive its 3D shape model using two different algorithms (ADAM,\nMPCD). Furthermore, an N-body dynamical model allowed us to retrieve the\norbital elements of the two moons as explained in the accompanying paper.\nResults. The shape of Kleopatra is very close to an equilibrium dumbbell figure\nwith two lobes and a thick neck. Its volume equivalent diameter\n(118.75$\\pm$1.40) km and mass (2.97$\\pm$0.32) 10$^{18}$ kg imply a bulk density\nof (3.38$\\pm$0.50) g cm$^{-3}$. Such a low density for a supposedly metal-rich\nbody indicates a substantial porosity within the primary. This porous structure\nalong with its near-equilibrium shape is compatible with a formation scenario\nincluding a giant impact followed by reaccumulation. Kleopatra's current\nrotation period and dumbbell shape imply that it is in a critically rotating\nstate. The low effective gravity along the equator of the body, together with\nthe equatorial orbits of the moons and possibly rubble-pile structure, opens\nthe possibility that the moons formed via mass shedding.

Kleopatra\nis a puzzling multiple system due to the unique characteristics of the primary.\nIt deserves particular attention in the future, with the Extremely Large\nTelescopes and possibly a dedicated space mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

A new approach is\ndeveloped to compute the expected information gain, when the posterior\ndistribution is multimodal - a situation previously ignored by the methods\naiming at accelerating the nested numerical integrations.

Conventional onsite spot trading\ncould facilitate this paradigm with proper incentives, which, however, incurs\nexcessive decision-making latency/energy consumption, and further leads to\nunderutilization of dynamic resources. Motivated by this, a hybrid market\nunifying futures and spot is proposed to facilitate resource trading among an\nedge server (seller) and multiple smart devices (buyers) by encouraging some\nbuyers to sign a forward contract with seller in advance, while leaving the\nremaining buyers to compete for available resources with spot trading.\nSpecifically, overbooking is adopted to achieve substantial utilization and\nprofit advantages owing to dynamic resource demands. By integrating overbooking\ninto futures market, mutually beneficial and risk-tolerable forward contracts\nwith appropriate overbooking rate can be achieved relying on analyzing\nhistorical statistics associated with future resource demand and communication\nquality, which are determined by an alternative optimization-based negotiation\nscheme. Besides, spot trading problem is studied via considering\nuniform/differential pricing rules, for which two bilateral negotiation schemes\nare proposed by addressing both non-convex optimization and knapsack problems.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves mutually\nbeneficial players' utilities, while outperforming baseline methods on critical\nindicators, e.g., decision-making latency, resource usage, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

For this reason, it is usually believed that the\nenhancement of the interaction with environment inevitably leads to a\ntransition of the system from the strong to weak coupling regime. In this\npaper, we refute this common opinion. We demonstrate the interaction of the\ncoupled system with environment induces an additional coupling between the\nsubsystems that contribute to retention the system in the strong coupling\nregime. We show that the environmental-induced coupling strength is\nproportional to the product of the Rabi coupling strength by the gradient of\nthe density of states of the reservoir. There is a critical Rabi coupling\nstrength above which the environmental-induced coupling ensures that the system\nremains in the strong coupling regime at any relaxation rate. In this case, the\nstrong coupling regime takes place even when the relaxation rate is\nsignificantly above the Rabi coupling strength between the subsystems.

In this work, we explore a simple\nmodel for such an interface and demonstrate a mechanism by which a metallic\nferroelectric substrate may be switched by a bias voltage. This finding is in\ncontrast to the reasonable expectation that hysteresis is prevented by\nscreening of external fields in ferroelectric metals. Instead, the electron gas\nbinds to polarization gradients to form a compensated state. Uncompensated\nelectrons, which may screen external fields, are generated either when the\nelectron density exceeds the ferroelectric polarization or when the bias\nvoltage exceeds a \"spillover\" threshold. We propose that switchable thin films\nmay be optimized by choosing an electron density that is slightly less than the\nlattice polarization. In addition to the high-polarization states, we find that\nthin metallic films also have a low-polarization state with average\npolarization near zero. Unlike in insulating films, where the polarization is\nsmall everywhere in this state, the low-polarization state in the metallic\nfilms consists of two head-to-head domains of opposite polarization.

Though foundation models are based on standard deep\nlearning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent\ncapabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes\nhomogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution,\nas the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models\ndownstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models,\nwe currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and\nwhat they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these\nquestions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will\nrequire deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their\nfundamentally sociotechnical nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 17:50:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 17:07:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 23:45:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

In this paper, we investigate the\nprospects for the occurrence of fast flavor conversion by diagnosing electron\nneutrino lepton number (ELN) crossing in more than a dozen state-of-the-art\nthree-dimensional CCSN models. ELN crossings is a necessary condition for\ntriggering flavor conversion.

Our analysis suggests that fast flavor conversion\ngenerally occurs in the post-shock region of CCSNe, and that explosive models\nprovide more favorable conditions for the flavor conversion than failed CCSNe.\nWe also find that there are both common and progenitor-dependent\ncharacteristics. Classifying ELN crossings into two types, we analyze the\ngeneration mechanism of each case by scrutinizing the neutrino radiation field\nand matter interactions. We find key ingredients of CCSN dynamics driving the\nELN crossings: proto-neutron star (PNS) convection, asymmetric neutrino\nemission, neutrino absorptions and scatterings.

Here we\npresent a calibration strategy that builds on previous high-resolution work\nwith LOFAR. We give an overview of the calibration strategy and discuss the\nspecial challenges inherent to enacting high-resolution imaging with LOFAR, and\ndescribe the pipeline, which is publicly available, in detail. We demonstrate\nthe calibration strategy by using the pipeline on P205+55, a typical LOFAR\nTwo-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) pointing. We perform in-field delay calibration,\nsolution referencing to other calibrators, self-calibration, and imaging of\nexample directions of interest in the field. For this specific field and these\nionospheric conditions, dispersive delay solutions can be transferred between\ncalibrators up to ~1.5 degrees away, while phase solution transferral works\nwell over 1 degree. We demonstrate a check of the astrometry and flux density\nscale. Imaging in 17 directions, the restoring beam is typically 0.3\" x 0.2\"\nalthough this varies slightly over the entire 5 square degree field of view.

Seventy percent of processed sources\nare detected, and from this we estimate that we should be able to image ~900\nsources per LoTSS pointing. This equates to ~3 million sources in the northern\nsky, which LoTSS will entirely cover in the next several years. Future\noptimisation of the calibration strategy for efficient post-processing of LoTSS\nat high resolution (LoTSS-HR) makes this estimate a lower limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 18:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Use of the VLBA calibrator list, together with\nstatistical arguments by comparison with flux densities from lower-resolution\ncatalogues, allow us to establish a rough flux density scale for the LBCS\nobservations, so that LBCS statistics can be used to estimate compact flux\ndensities on scales between 300 mas and 2 arcsec, for sources observed in the\nsurvey. The LBCS can be used to assess the structures of point sources in\nlower-resolution surveys, with significant reductions in the degree of\ncoherence in these sources on scales between 2 arcsec and 300 mas. The LBCS\nsurvey sources show a greater incidence of compact flux density in quasars than\nin radio galaxies, consistent with unified schemes of radio sources.

Observations in the MHz regime have\ntraditionally lacked the resolution required to explore small-scale structures\nthat are key to understanding the processes that result in the observed\nemission.

Using the International LOFAR telescope (ILT) we\nprobed spatial scales as fine as ~0.2\" at 144 MHz, and to constrain the\nspectrum we combined these data with Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer\nNetwork (MERLIN) and Very Large Array (VLA) archival data. In the inner lobes\n(~2 kpc), we detect the presence of a spectral turnover that peaks at ~225 MHz\nand is most likely caused by free-free absorption from the rich surrounding\nmedium. We confirm that these inner lobes are part of a jet-dominated young\nradio source (spectral age $\\lesssim$0.17 Myr), which is strongly interacting\nwith the rich interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy.

We propose that intermittent fuelling and jet\nflow disruptions are powering the mechanisms that keep the spectral index in\nthe outer lobes from steepening and maintain the spatial uniformity of the\nspectral index. Overall, it appears that 3C 293 has gone through multiple (two\nto three) epochs of activity. This study adds 3C 293 to the new sub-group of\nrestarted galaxies with short interruption time periods.

We find that\nthe 321.2257 GHz (10(2,9) - 9(3,6)) line detection towards AS 205 is\ninconsistent with a normal inner disk temperature structure and that the\nobserved line must be masing. Furthermore, the emitting area derived from the\nline width, together with published analyses on water in disks around T-Tauri\nstars implies that the water snowline in the disk surface is at the same\nlocation as the snowline in the mid-plane. We propose that this is caused by\nvertical mixing continuously sequestering water from the warm surface layers\ninto the cold disk midplane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 18:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

The WFs\nfor a square aperture and for a circular aperture match with relative\ndifference less than 0.01 if the circular aperture diameter is 1.15 times\nlarger than the square aperture side.\n  A linear digital filter can be applied to the scintillation signal from an\nimage detector. As an example of digital filtering, we considered the power law\nfilter $\\propto f^{5/3}$ with the WF being constant in a wide range of\naltitudes. We discuss the main limitations of this approach for measuring OT\nintegral: finite pixel size, aliasing, and finite image detector size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 19:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

An\nobstacle to establishing a link between these statements is that the multipole\nmoments of individual bodies are not defined in general relativity, when the\nbodies are subjected to a mutual gravitational interaction. In a previous\npublication [Phys. Rev. D 103, 064023 (2021)] I promoted the view that\nindividual multipole moments can be defined when the mutual interaction is\nsufficiently weak to be described by a post-Newtonian expansion. In this view,\na compact body is perceived far away as a skeletonized post-Newtonian object\nwith a multipole structure, and the multipole moments can then be related to\nthe body's Love numbers. I expand on this view, and demonstrate that all\nstatic, tidally induced, mass multipole moments of a nonrotating black hole\nvanish to all post-Newtonian orders. The proof rests on a perturbative solution\nto the Einstein-Maxwell equations that describes an electrically charged\nparticle placed in the presence of a charged black hole. The gravitational\nattraction between particle and black hole is balanced by electrostatic\nrepulsion, and the system is in an equilibrium state. The particle provides a\ntidal environment to the black hole, and the multipole moments vanish for this\nenvironment. I argue that the vanishing is robust, and applies to all\nslowly-varying tidal environments. The black hole's charge can be as small as\ndesired (though not identically zero); by continuity, the multipole moments of\nan electrically neutral black hole will continue to vanish.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 19:52:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 20:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

The mass-loading of a wind by the cool medium\nmodifies the bulk velocity, temperature, density, entropy, and abundance\nprofiles of the hot phase relative to an un-mass-loaded outflow. We provide\ngeneral equations and limits for this physics that can be used to infer the\nrate of cool gas entrainment from X-ray observations, accounting for\nnon-spherical expansion. In general, mass-loading flattens the density and\ntemperature profiles, decreases the velocity and increases the entropy if the\nMach number is above a critical value. We first apply this model to a recent\nhigh-resolution galactic outflow simulation where the mass-loading can be\ndirectly inferred.

We then model the diffuse X-ray emission from the local\nstarburst M82. The non-spherical (more cylindrical) outflow geometry is\ndirectly taken from the observed X-ray surface brightness profile.

This asteroseismic \"surface\nterm\" must be corrected when mode frequencies are used to infer stellar\nstructure. Subgiants exhibit oscillations of mixed acoustic ($p$-mode) and\ngravity ($g$-mode) character, which defy description by the traditional\n$p$-mode asymptotic relation. Since nonparametric diagnostics of the surface\nterm rely on this description, they cannot be applied to subgiants directly. In\nPaper I, we generalised such nonparametric methods to mixed modes, and showed\nthat traditional surface-term corrections only account for mixed-mode coupling\nto, at best, first order in a perturbative expansion. Here, we apply those\nresults, modelling subgiants using asteroseismic data. We demonstrate that, for\ngrid-based inference of subgiant properties using individual mode frequencies,\nneglecting higher-order effects of mode coupling in the surface term results in\nsignificant systematic differences in the inferred stellar masses, and\nmeasurable systematics in other fundamental properties. While these systematics\nare smaller than those resulting from other choices of model construction, they\npersist for both parametric and nonparametric formulations of the surface term.\nThis suggests that mode coupling should be fully accounted for when correcting\nfor the surface term in seismic modelling with mixed modes, irrespective of the\nchoice of correction used. The inferred properties of subgiants, in particular\nmasses and ages, also depend on the choice of surface-term correction, in a\ndifferent manner from both main-sequence and red giant stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 23:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

In this work, we propose to exploit this linear-filter\nstructure within a deep learning based monaural speech dereverberation\nframework. The key idea is to first estimate the direct-path signal of the\ntarget speaker using a DNN and then identify signals that are decayed and\ndelayed copies of the estimated direct-path signal, as these can be reliably\nconsidered as reverberation. They can be either directly removed for\ndereverberation, or used as extra features for another DNN to perform better\ndereverberation. To identify the copies, we estimate the underlying filter (or\nRIR) by efficiently solving a linear regression problem per frequency in the\ntime-frequency domain.

However, crowdsourced testing\nalso brings some problem. The crowdworkers involved are with different\nexpertise, and they are not professional testers. Therefore, the reports they\nmay submit are numerous and with uneven quality. App developers have to\ndistinguish high-quality reports from low-quality ones to help the bug\nrevealing and fixing. Some crowdworkers would submit inconsistent test reports,\nwhich means the textual descriptions are not focusing on the attached bug\noccurring screenshots. Such reports cause the waste on both time and human\nresources of app developing and testing.\n  To solve such a problem, we propose ReCoDe in this paper, which is designed\nto detect the consistency of crowdsourced test reports via deep image-and-text\nfusion understanding. First, according to a pre-conducted survey, ReCoDe\nclassifies the crowdsourced test reports into 10 categories, which covers the\nvast majority of reported problems in the test reports. Then, for each category\nof bugs, we have distinct processing models. The models have a deep fusion\nunderstanding on both image information and textual descriptions.

In this work, the particle curved trajectory between two recordings\nis firstly explained with the streamline segment of a steady flow\n(diffeomorphic transformation) instead of a single vector, and this idea is\ntermed as diffeomorphic PIV. Specifically, a deformation field is introduced to\ndescribe the particle displacement, i.e., we try to find the optimal velocity\nfield, of which the corresponding deformation vector field agrees with the\nparticle displacement. Because the variation of the deformation function can be\napproximated with the variation of the velocity function, the diffeomorphic PIV\ncan be implemented as iterative PIV. That says, the diffeomorphic PIV warps the\nimages with deformation vector field instead of the velocity, and keeps the\nrest as same as iterative PIVs. Two diffeomorphic deformation schemes --\nforward diffeomorphic deformation interrogation (FDDI) and central\ndiffeomorphic deformation interrogation (CDDI) -- are proposed. Tested on\nsynthetic images, the FDDI achieves significant accuracy improvement across\ndifferent one-pass displacement estimators (cross-correlation, optical flow,\ndeep learning flow). Besides, the results on three real PIV image pairs\ndemonstrate the non-negligible curvature effect for CDI-based PIV, and our FDDI\nprovides larger velocity estimation (more accurate) in the fast curvy\nstreamline areas. The accuracy improvement of the combination of FDDI and\naccurate dense estimator means that our diffeomorphic PIV paves a new way for\ncomplex flow measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 04:26:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

Further, it is demonstrated how \"pseudo\"-attentions can also be\nemployed during training when teacher and student networks are trained on\ndifferent domains which share some similarities.

In this\npaper, we propose a mono-color image enhancement algorithm that colorizes the\nmonochrome image with the color one. Based on the assumption that adjacent\nstructures with similar luminance values are likely to have similar colors, we\nfirst perform dense scribbling to assign colors to the monochrome pixels\nthrough block matching. Two types of outliers, including occlusion and color\nambiguity, are detected and removed from the initial scribbles. We also\nintroduce a sampling strategy to accelerate the scribbling process. Then, the\ndense scribbles are propagated to the entire image. To alleviate incorrect\ncolor propagation in the regions that have no color hints at all, we generate\nextra color seeds based on the existed scribbles to guide the propagation\nprocess.

While promising, they\nhave the shortcomings that (1) the second step is not supervised by the main\nobjective of instance segmentation, and (2) their point-wise feature learning\nand grouping are less effective to deal with data irregularities, possibly\nresulting in fragmented segmentations.

We\nshow that, for the stars with multi-epoch spectra, the systematic bias which is\ninduced from the exposures of different nights can be well corrected for LAMOST\nMRS in each spectrograph. And the precision of radial velocity zero-point of\nmulti-epoch time-domain observations reaches below 0.5 km/s . As a by-product,\nwe also give the constant star candidates, which can be the secondary\nradial-velocity standard star candidates of LAMOST MRS time-domain surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 07:44:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 07:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

An area of 20 x 20 pixels was irradiated with an average\nphoton flux of approx. 7 x $10^{9}$ photons/s to a dose of approximately\n760$\\pm$65 kGy at the location of the Si/SiO$_2$ interfaces in the sensor. A\ndose dependent increase in both offset and noise of the ePix100a detector have\nbeen observed originating from an increase of the sensor leakage current.\nMoreover, we observed an effect directly after irradiation resulting in the\nsaturation of individual pixels by their dark current. Changes in gain are\nevaluated one and half hours post irradiation and suggest damage to occur also\non the ASIC level. Based on the obtained results, thresholds for beam\nparameters are deduced and the detector lifetime is estimated with respect to\nthe requirements to the data quality in order to satisfy the scientific\nstandards defined by the experiments.

The nuclear\nmatter is modeled in a relativistic density functional approach with two\ndifferent parametrizations which predict neutrino dominated matter (DDME2\nmodel) and antineutrino dominated matter (NL3 model) at temperatures for which\nneutrinos/antineutrinos are trapped.

We assess the performance of our SPMoE on the paraphrase generation\ntask and the experiment results prove that SPMoE can achieve a good balance in\nterms of quality, pattern-level diversity, and corpus-level diversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 09:37:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 02:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

The mechanisms of the insect brain apparently responsible for odor\nlearning form a relatively shallow neuronal architecture. Olfactory inputs are\nreceived by the antennal lobe (AL) of the brain, which produces an encoding of\neach odor mixture across ~50 sub-units known as glomeruli. Each of these\nglomeruli then project its component of this feature vector to several of ~2000\nso-called Kenyon Cells (KCs) in a region of the brain known as the mushroom\nbody (MB). Fly responses to odors are generated by small downstream neuropils\nthat decode the higher-order representation from the MB. Research has shown\nthat there is no recognizable pattern in the glomeruli--KC connections (and\nthus the particular higher-order representations); they are akin to\nfingerprints~-- even isogenic flies have different projections. Leveraging\ninsights from this architecture, we propose KCNet, a single-hidden-layer neural\nnetwork that contains sparse, randomized, binary weights between the input\nlayer and the hidden layer and analytically learned weights between the hidden\nlayer and the output layer. Furthermore, we also propose a dynamic optimization\nalgorithm that enables the KCNet to increase performance beyond its structural\nlimits by searching a more efficient set of inputs. For odorant-perception\ntasks that predict perceptual properties of an odorant, we show that KCNet\noutperforms existing data-driven approaches, such as XGBoost. For\nimage-classification tasks, KCNet achieves reasonable performance on benchmark\ndatasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and EMNIST) without any data-augmentation\nmethods or convolutional layers and shows particularly fast running time. Thus,\nneural networks inspired by the insect brain can be both economical and perform\nwell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 10:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

Two places are suspect for the formation of a CRSF: the\nsurface of the neutron star and the radiative shock in the accretion column.\nHere we explore the first possibility: reflection at the neutron-star surface\nof the continuum produced at the radiative shock. It has been proposed that for\nhigh-luminosity sources, as the luminosity increases, the height of the\nradiative shock increases, thus a larger polar area is illuminated, and as a\nconsequence the energy of the CRSF decreases because the dipole magnetic field\ndecreases by a factor of two from the pole to the equator. We used a Monte\nCarlo code to compute the reflected spectrum from the atmosphere of a magnetic\nneutron star, when the incident spectrum is a power-law one. We restricted\nourselves to cyclotron energies $\\ll m_ec^2$ and used polarization-dependent\nscattering cross sections, allowing for polarization mode change. As expected,\na prominent CRSF is produced in the reflected spectra if the incident photons\nare in a pencil beam, which hits the neutron-star surface at a point with a\nwell-defined magnetic field strength. However, the incident beam from the\nradiative shock has a finite width and thus various magnetic field strengths\nare sampled. As a result of overlap, the reflected spectra have a CRSF, which\nis close to that produced at the magnetic pole, independent of the height of\nthe radiative shock. Reflection at the surface of a magnetic neutron star\ncannot explain the observed decrease in the CRSF energy with luminosity in the\nhigh-luminosity X-ray pulsar V 0332+53.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 11:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

To realize efficient hybrid precoding, it is\nessential to obtain accurate channel state information. Existing channel\nestimation algorithms with low pilot overhead heavily rely on the channel\nsparsity in the angle domain, which is achieved by the classical far-field\nplanar wavefront assumption. However, due to the non-negligible near-field\nspherical wavefront property in XL-MIMO systems, this channel sparsity in the\nangle domain is not available anymore, and thus existing far-field channel\nestimation schemes will suffer from severe performance loss. To address this\nproblem, in this paper we study the near-field channel estimation by exploiting\nthe polar-domain sparse representation of the near-field XL-MIMO channel.\nSpecifically, unlike the classical angle-domain representation that only\nconsiders the angle information of the channel, we propose a new polar-domain\nrepresentation, which simultaneously accounts for both the angle and distance\ninformation. In this way, the near-field channel also exhibits sparsity in the\npolar domain. By exploiting the channel sparsity in the polar domain, we\npropose the on-grid and off-grid near-field channel estimation schemes for\nXL-MIMO. Firstly, an on-grid polar-domain simultaneous orthogonal matching\npursuit (P-SOMP) algorithm is proposed to efficiently estimate the near-field\nchannel. Furthermore, to solve the resolution limitation of the on-grid P-SOMP\nalgorithm, an off-grid polar-domain simultaneous iterative gridless weighted\n(P-SIGW) algorithm is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy, where the\nparameters of the near-field channel are directly estimated. Finally, numerical\nresults are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 12:13:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 2021 02:41:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 04:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

Here,\ndeformed sessile drops due to gravity and surface tension with various\ninterfacial profiles are realised by tilting flat substrates. The symmetry\nbroken of the sessile drop geometry leads to a different evaporation behavior\ncompared to a drop with a symmetric cap on a horizontal substrate. Rather than\nthe vapour-diffusion mechanism, heat-diffusion regime is defined here to\ncalculate the local evaporation flux along the deformed drop interface. A local\nheat resistance, characterised by the liquid layer thickness perpendicular to\nthe substrate, is proposed to relate the local evaporation flux. We find that\nthe drops with and without deformation evaporate with a minimum flux at the\ndrop apex, while up to a maximum one with a significantly larger but finite\nvalue at the contact line. Counterintuitively, the deviation from the symmetric\nshape due to the deformation on a slope, surprisingly enhances the total\nevaporation rate; and the smaller contact angle, the more significant\nenhancement. Larger tilt quickens the overall evaporation process and induces a\nmore heterogeneous distribution of evaporative flux under gravity.\nInterestingly, with this concept of heat flux, an intrinsic heat resistance is\nconceivable around the contact line, which naturally removes the singularity of\nthe evaporation flux showing in the vapour-diffusion model. The detailed\nnon-uniform evaporation flux suggests ways to control the self-assembly,\nmicrostructures of deposit with engineering applications particularly in three\ndimensional printing where drying on slopes is inevitable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 12:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

A TM represents patterns as\nconjunctive clauses in propositional logic (AND-rules), each clause voting for\nor against a particular output. While efficient for single-output problems, one\nneeds a separate TM per output for multi-output problems. Employing multiple\nTMs hinders pattern reuse because each TM then operates in a silo. In this\npaper, we introduce clause sharing, merging multiple TMs into a single one.\nEach clause is related to each output by using a weight. A positive weight\nmakes the clause vote for output $1$, while a negative weight makes the clause\nvote for output $0$. The clauses thus coalesce to produce multiple outputs. The\nresulting coalesced Tsetlin Machine (CoTM) simultaneously learns both the\nweights and the composition of each clause by employing interacting Stochastic\nSearching on the Line (SSL) and Tsetlin Automata (TA) teams. Our empirical\nresults on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Kuzushiji-MNIST show that CoTM obtains\nsignificantly higher accuracy than TM on $50$- to $1$K-clause configurations,\nindicating an ability to repurpose clauses. E.g., accuracy goes from $71.99$%\nto $89.66$% on Fashion-MNIST when employing $50$ clauses per class (22 Kb\nmemory). While TM and CoTM accuracy is similar when using more than $1$K\nclauses per class, CoTM reaches peak accuracy $3\\times$ faster on MNIST with\n$8$K clauses. We further investigate robustness towards imbalanced training\ndata. Our evaluations on imbalanced versions of IMDb- and CIFAR10 data show\nthat CoTM is robust towards high degrees of class imbalance. Being able to\nshare clauses, we believe CoTM will enable new TM application domains that\ninvolve multiple outputs, such as learning language models and auto-encoding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 12:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

Besides introducing the reaction mechanism\ninto the kinetic equations for the species, the proposed LBM also features a\nnew realization of the compressible flow by using a concept of extended\nequilibrium on a standard lattice in three dimensions. The full thermodynamic\nconsistency of the original non-reactive multicomponent LBM enables to extend\nthe temperature dynamics to the reactive mixtures by merely including the\nenthalpy of formation in addition to the previously considered sensible energy.\nFurthermore, we describe in detail the boundary conditions to be used for\nreactive flows of practical interest. The model is validated against a direct\nnumerical simulation of various burning regimes of a hydrogen/air mixture in a\nmicrochannel, in two and three dimensions. Excellent comparison in these\ndemanding benchmarks indicates that the proposed LBM can be a valuable and\nuniversal model for complex reactive flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 13:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

Recent surface anomaly detection\nmethods rely on generative models to accurately reconstruct the normal areas\nand to fail on anomalies.

However, most of these approaches can only handle either\nday-time or night-time images, while their performance degrades for all-day\nimages due to large domain shift and the variation of illumination between day\nand night images. To relieve these limitations, we propose a domain-separated\nnetwork for self-supervised depth estimation of all-day images. Specifically,\nto relieve the negative influence of disturbing terms (illumination, etc.), we\npartition the information of day and night image pairs into two complementary\nsub-spaces: private and invariant domains, where the former contains the unique\ninformation (illumination, etc.) of day and night images and the latter\ncontains essential shared information (texture, etc.). Meanwhile, to guarantee\nthat the day and night images contain the same information, the\ndomain-separated network takes the day-time images and corresponding night-time\nimages (generated by GAN) as input, and the private and invariant feature\nextractors are learned by orthogonality and similarity loss, where the domain\ngap can be alleviated, thus better depth maps can be expected. Meanwhile, the\nreconstruction and photometric losses are utilized to estimate complementary\ninformation and depth maps effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour approach achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation results for all-day\nimages on the challenging Oxford RobotCar dataset, proving the superiority of\nour proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 13:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

Frequentist learning, however, is known to be problematic in the regime\nof limited data as it fails to quantify epistemic uncertainty in prediction.\nBayesian learning provides a principled solution to this problem by shifting\nthe optimization domain to the space of distribution in the model parameters.\n{\\color{black}This paper proposes a novel mechanism for the efficient\nimplementation of Bayesian learning in wireless systems. Specifically, we focus\non a standard gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, namely\nLangevin Monte Carlo (LMC), and we introduce a novel protocol, termed Wireless\nFederated LMC (WFLMC), that is able to repurpose channel noise for the double\nrole of seed randomness for MCMC sampling and of privacy preservation.} To this\nend, based on the analysis of the Wasserstein distance between sample\ndistribution and global posterior distribution under privacy and power\nconstraints, we introduce a power allocation strategy as the solution of a\nconvex program. The analysis identifies distinct operating regimes in which the\nperformance of the system is power-limited, privacy-limited, or limited by the\nrequirement of MCMC sampling. Both analytical and simulation results\ndemonstrate that, if the channel noise is properly accounted for under suitable\nconditions, it can be fully repurposed for both MCMC sampling and privacy\npreservation, obtaining the same performance as in an ideal communication\nsetting that is not subject to privacy constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 14:26:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 23:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

Radar scattering from meteor trails depends on several poorly\nconstrained quantities, such as electron line density, q, initial trail radius,\nr0, and ambipolar diffusion coefficient, D. Aims. The goal is to apply a\nnumerical model of full wave backscatter to triple frequency echo measurements\nto validate theory and constrain estimates of electron radial distribution,\ninitial trail radius, and the ambipolar diffusion coefficient. Methods. A\nselection of 50 transversely polarized and 50 parallel polarized echoes with\ncomplete trajectory information were identified from simultaneous tri-frequency\nechoes recorded by the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR). The amplitude-time\nprofile of each echo was fit to our model using three different choices for the\nradial electron distribution assuming a Gaussian, parabolicexponential, and\n1-by-r2 electron line density model. The observations were manually fit by\nvarying, q, r0, and D per model until all three synthetic echo-amplitude\nprofiles at each frequency matched observation. Results. The Gaussian radial\nelectron distribution was the most successful at fitting echo power profiles,\nfollowed by the 1-by-r2. We were unable to fit any echoes using a profile where\nelectron density varied from the trail axis as an exponential-parabolic\ndistribution. While fewer than 5% of all examined echoes had self-consistent\nfits, the estimates of r0 and D as a function of height obtained were broadly\nsimilar to earlier studies, though with considerable scatter.

However, state-of-the-art DL\napproaches require large and high-resolution training data to learn accurate\nmodels. The size and availability of such datasets are a major limitation for\nthe development of next-generation data-driven surrogate models for turbulent\nflows. This paper introduces SURFNet, a transfer learning-based\nsuper-resolution flow network. SURFNet primarily trains the DL model on\nlow-resolution datasets and transfer learns the model on a handful of\nhigh-resolution flow problems - accelerating the traditional numerical solver\nindependent of the input size. We propose two approaches to transfer learning\nfor the task of super-resolution, namely one-shot and incremental learning.\nBoth approaches entail transfer learning on only one geometry to account for\nfine-grid flow fields requiring 15x less training data on high-resolution\ninputs compared to the tiny resolution (64x256) of the coarse model,\nsignificantly reducing the time for both data collection and training. We\nempirically evaluate SURFNet's performance by solving the Navier-Stokes\nequations in the turbulent regime on input resolutions up to 256x larger than\nthe coarse model. On four test geometries and eight flow configurations unseen\nduring training, we observe a consistent 2-2.1x speedup over the OpenFOAM\nphysics solver independent of the test geometry and the resolution size (up to\n2048x2048), demonstrating both resolution-invariance and generalization\ncapabilities.

Recently, SeFa tries to find latent\ndisentangled directions by performing SVD on the first projection of a\npre-trained GAN. However, it is only applied to the first layer and works in a\npost-processing way. Hessian Penalty minimizes the off-diagonal entries of the\noutput's Hessian matrix to facilitate disentanglement, and can be applied to\nmulti-layers.However, it constrains each entry of output independently, making\nit not sufficient in disentangling the latent directions (e.g., shape, size,\nrotation, etc.) of spatially correlated variations. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple Orthogonal Jacobian Regularization (OroJaR) to encourage deep generative\nmodel to learn disentangled representations. It simply encourages the variation\nof output caused by perturbations on different latent dimensions to be\northogonal, and the Jacobian with respect to the input is calculated to\nrepresent this variation. We show that our OroJaR also encourages the output's\nHessian matrix to be diagonal in an indirect manner. In contrast to the Hessian\nPenalty, our OroJaR constrains the output in a holistic way, making it very\neffective in disentangling latent dimensions corresponding to spatially\ncorrelated variations.

The\ntransport of icy pebbles has been suggested to alter the local elemental\nabundances in protoplanetary disks, through settling, drift and trapping in\npressure bumps resulting in a depletion of volatiles in the surface and an\nincrease of the elemental C/O. We combine all disks with spatially resolved\nALMA C$_2$H observations with high-resolution continuum images and constraints\non the CO snowline to determine if the C$_2$H emission is indeed related to the\nlocation of the icy pebbles. We report a possible correlation between the\npresence of a significant CO-icy dust reservoir and high C$_2$H emission, which\nis only found in disks with dust rings outside the CO snowline. In contrast,\ncompact dust disks (without pressure bumps) and warm transition disks (with\ntheir dust ring inside the CO snowline) are not detected in C$_2$H, suggesting\nthat such disks may never have contained a significant CO ice reservoir. This\ncorrelation provides evidence for the regulation of the C/O profile by the\ncomplex interplay of CO snowline and pressure bump locations in the disk. These\nresults demonstrate the importance of including dust transport in chemical disk\nmodels, for a proper interpretation of exoplanet atmospheric compositions, and\na better understanding of volatile depletion in disks, in particular the use of\nCO isotopologues to determine gas surface densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 15:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

The\npurpose of this work is to reveal the influence of the degree of the source\nnonlinearity on the well-posedness of the solution. By considering four\ndifferent types of nonlinearities, we derive the global well-posedness of mild\nsolutions to the problem corresponding to the four cases of the nonlinear\nsource terms. For the advection source function case, we apply a nontrivial\nlimit technique for singular integral and some appropriate choices of weighted\nBanach space to prove the global existence result. For the gradient\nnonlinearity as a local Lipschitzian, we use the Cauchy sequence technique to\nshow that the solution either exists globally in time or blows up at finite\ntime. For the polynomial form nonlinearity, by assuming the smallness of the\ninitial data we derive the global well-posed results. And for the case of\nexponential nonlinearity in two-dimensional space, we derive the global\nwell-posedness by additionally use of Orlicz space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 15:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

Our approach aims to represent and predict foreground things and\nbackground stuff in a unified fully convolutional pipeline, which can be\noptimized with point-based fully or weak supervision. In particular, Panoptic\nFCN encodes each object instance or stuff category with the proposed kernel\ngenerator and produces the prediction by convolving the high-resolution feature\ndirectly. With this approach, instance-aware and semantically consistent\nproperties for things and stuff can be respectively satisfied in a simple\ngenerate-kernel-then-segment workflow. Without extra boxes for localization or\ninstance separation, the proposed approach outperforms the previous box-based\nand -free models with high efficiency. Furthermore, we propose a new form of\npoint-based annotation for weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation. It only\nneeds several random points for both things and stuff, which dramatically\nreduces the annotation cost of human. The proposed Panoptic FCN is also proved\nto have much superior performance in this weakly-supervised setting, which\nachieves 82% of the fully-supervised performance with only 20 randomly\nannotated points per instance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of Panoptic FCN on COCO, VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and\nMapillary Vistas datasets. And it sets up a new leading benchmark for both\nfully- and weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation.

We selected a sample of 1275 BLAGN in the XMM-XXL\nfield, with optical to infrared photometric data. These AGN are seen along\ntheir polar direction and we expect a maximal impact of dust located around the\npoles when it is present. We used X-CIGALE, which introduces a dust component\nto account for obscuration along the polar directions, modeled as a foreground\nscreen, and an extinction curve that is chosen as it steepens significantly at\nshort wavelengths or is much grayer. By comparing the results of different\nfits, we are able to define subsamples of sources with positive statistical\nevidence in favor of or against polar obscuration and described using the gray\nor steep extinction curve.\n  We find a similar fraction of sources with positive evidence for and against\npolar dust. Applying statistical corrections, we estimate that half of our\nsample could contain polar dust and among them, 60% exhibit a steep extinction\ncurve and 40% a flat extinction curve; although these latter percentages are\nfound to depend on the adopted extinction curves. The obscuration in the V-band\nis not found to correlate with the X-ray column density, while A_V/N_H ratios\nspan a large range of values and higher dust temperatures are found with the\nflat, rather than with the steep extinction curve. Ignoring this polar dust\ncomponent in the fit of the spectral energy distribution of these composite\nsystems leads to an overestimation of the stellar contribution. A single fit\nwith a polar dust component described with an SMC extinction curve efficiently\novercomes this issue but it fails at identifying all the AGN with polar dust\nobscuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 15:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

In this thesis we take a\nsystematic approach to address the algorithmic and methodological limitations\nat the root of these costs. We first demonstrate that DL training and pruning\nare predictable and governed by scaling laws -- for state of the art models and\ntasks, spanning image classification and language modeling, as well as for\nstate of the art model compression via iterative pruning. Predictability, via\nthe establishment of these scaling laws, provides the path for principled\ndesign and trade-off reasoning, currently largely lacking in the field. We then\ncontinue to analyze the sources of the scaling laws, offering an\napproximation-theoretic view and showing through the exploration of a noiseless\nrealizable case that DL is in fact dominated by error sources very far from the\nlower error limit. We conclude by building on the gained theoretical\nunderstanding of the scaling laws' origins.

While a similarity measure metric, like the cosine\nsimilarity, can be used to endow groups of the client with a specialized model,\nthis process can be arduous as the server should involve all clients in each of\nthe federated learning rounds. Therefore, it is imperative that a subset of\nclients is selected periodically due to the limited bandwidth and latency\nconstraints at the network edge. To this end, this paper proposes a new client\nselection algorithm that aims to accelerate the convergence rate for obtaining\nspecialized machine learning models that achieve high test accuracies for all\nclient groups. Specifically, we introduce a client selection approach that\nleverages the devices' heterogeneity to schedule the clients based on their\nround latency and exploits the bandwidth reuse for clients that consume more\ntime to update the model. Then, the server performs model averaging and\nclusters the clients based on predefined thresholds. When a specific cluster\nreaches a stationary point, the proposed algorithm uses a greedy scheduling\nalgorithm for that group by selecting the clients with less latency to update\nthe model. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach lowers the\ntraining time and accelerates the convergence rate by up to 50% while imbuing\neach client with a specialized model that is fit for its local data\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 21:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

A compromise can be given, the Best Order Score\nSearch, which gives results as accurate as SP but for much larger and denser\ngraphs. BOSS (Best Order Score Search) is more accurate for two reason: (a) It\nassumes the \"brute faithfuness\" assumption, which is weaker than faithfulness,\nand (b) it uses a different traversal of permutations than the depth first\ntraversal used by GSP, obtained by taking each variable in turn and moving it\nto the position in the permutation that optimizes the model score. Results are\ngiven comparing BOSS to several related papers in the literature in terms of\nperformance, for linear, Gaussian data.

However, deep learning models usually need large labelled datasets to\nbe effective. Semi-supervised deep learning is an attractive alternative, where\nunlabelled data is leveraged to improve the overall model's accuracy. However,\nin real-world usage settings, an unlabelled dataset might present a different\ndistribution than the labelled dataset (i.e. the labelled dataset was sampled\nfrom a target clinic and the unlabelled dataset from a source clinic). This\nresults in a distribution mismatch between the unlabelled and labelled\ndatasets. In this work, we assess the impact of the distribution mismatch\nbetween the labelled and the unlabelled datasets, for a semi-supervised model\ntrained with chest X-ray images, for COVID-19 detection. Under strong\ndistribution mismatch conditions, we found an accuracy hit of almost 30\\%,\nsuggesting that the unlabelled dataset distribution has a strong influence in\nthe behaviour of the model. Therefore, we propose a straightforward approach to\ndiminish the impact of such distribution mismatch. Our proposed method uses a\ndensity approximation of the feature space.

Traditionally, popular\nregularization methods are the penalized Variational approaches. In recent\nyears, the classical regularization approaches have been outclassed by the\nso-called plug-and-play (PnP) algorithms, which copy the proximal gradient\nminimization processes, such as ADMM or FISTA, but with any general denoiser.\nHowever, unlike the traditional proximal gradient methods, the theoretical\nunderpinnings, convergence, and stability results have been insufficient for\nthese PnP-algorithms. Hence, the results obtained from these algorithms, though\nempirically outstanding, can't always be completely trusted, as they may\ncontain certain instabilities or (hallucinated) features arising from the\ndenoiser, especially when using a pre-trained learned denoiser. In fact, in\nthis paper, we show that a PnP-algorithm can induce hallucinated features, when\nusing a pre-trained deep-learning-based (DnCNN) denoiser. We show that such\ninstabilities are quite different than the instabilities inherent to an\nill-posed problem.

The WCD is implemented via modular code on an off-the-shelf\nfield-programmable gate-array (FPGA, Intel/Altera Cyclone V), and incorporates\nboth time-to-digital converter (TDC) and digital storage oscilloscope (DSO)\nfunctionality. The device captures a waveform by taking snapshots of a signal\nas it propagates down an ultra-fast transmission line known as a carry chain\n(CC). It is calibrated via a novel dynamic phase-shifting (DPS) method that\nrequires substantially less data and resources than the state-of-the-art. Using\nDPS, we find the measurement resolution - or mean propagation delay from one CC\nelement to the next - to be 4.91 +/- 0.04 ps (4.54 +/- 0.02 ps) for a pulse of\nlogic high (low). Similarly, we find the single-shot precision - or mean error\non the timing of the waveform - to be 29.52 ps (27.14 ps) for pulses of logic\nhigh (low). We verify these findings by reproducing commercial oscilloscope\nmeasurements of asynchronous ring-oscillators on FPGAs, finding the mean pulse\nwidth to be 0.240 +/- 0.002 ns per inverter gate. Finally, we present a careful\nanalysis of design constraints, introduce a novel error correction algorithm,\nand sketch a simple extension to the analog domain. We also provide the Verilog\ncode instantiating the our design on an FPGA in an Appendix, and make our\nmethods available as an open-source Python library at\nhttps://github.com/Noeloikeau/fpyga.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 20:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

However, the rain attenuation is severe\nin these bands. Before installing an earth station, the estimation of the rain\nattenuation is a prerequisite task to know the required fade margin to ensure a\ncertain availability of the network. In this paper, we estimate the rain\nattenuation for different regions of Nepal. The R-H and ITU models are used for\nrain rate and rain attenuation estimation, respectively. A significant temporal\nand spatial variation in rain attenuation is observed. Among three different\nregions of Nepal, namely Terai, Hilly, and Himalaya, while the maximum rain\nattenuation is found in Terai region, the minimum is in Himalaya. Jhapa of the\nTerai region experiences the highest attenuation and requires 80 dB and 24 dB\nfade margin for Ka and Ku bands, respectively. Solukhumbu of Himalaya region,\non the other hand, is found to be the least rain attenuation affected site. The\nrequired fade margin for an earth station site in Solukhumbu for using Ku and\nKa bands are 12 dB and 40 dB, respectively. The minimum attenuation, which is\nobserved in November and December, is several times lower compared to the\nhighest rain attenuation, observed in July. The minimum attenuation caused by\nthe Ka band is higher than the maximum attenuation caused by the Ku band\nirrespective of the locations of the earth station sites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 12:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

It allows to tune the heat flux, by means of\nelectroluminescence, to a spectral range matching better the gap of a\nphotovoltaic cell. The concept is extended to near-field thermophotonics\n(NF-TPX), where enhanced energy conversion is due to both electric control and\nwave tunneling. We perform a thorough numerical analysis of a GaAs-based NF-TPX\ndevice, by coupling a near-field radiative heat transfer solver based on\nfluctuational electrodynamics with an algorithm based on a simplified version\nof the drift-diffusion equations in 1D. This allows for the investigation of\nthe emission and absorption profiles in the LED and the photovoltaic (PV) cell,\nand for the scrutiny of the impact of key parameters. We also demonstrate that\nthe performance obtained with this algorithm can approach idealized cases for\nimproved devices. For the considered simplified architecture and 300 K\ntemperature difference, we find a power density output of 1 W.cm--2 ,\nunderlining the potential for waste heat harvesting close to ambient\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 07:12:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 08:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}
