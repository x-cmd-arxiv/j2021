Thus, it has the\npotential to provide uncertainty estimates that are highly correlated with the\npresence of out of distribution data. We demonstrated the added-value of\nNPBDREG, compared to the baseline probabilistic VoxelMorph model (PrVXM), on\nbrain MRI image registration using $390$ image pairs from four publicly\navailable databases: MGH10, CMUC12, ISBR18 and LPBA40.

One of the computationally\nefficient ways to solve it is to build a geometric path first and then\ntransform this path into a kinematically feasible one. Gradient-informed Path\nSmoothing (GRIPS) is a recently introduced method for such transformation.\nGRIPS iteratively deforms the path and adds/deletes the waypoints while trying\nto connect each consecutive pair of them via the provided steering function\nthat respects the kinematic constraints. The algorithm is relatively fast but,\nunfortunately, does not provide any guarantees that it will succeed. In\npractice, it often fails to produce feasible trajectories for car-like robots\nwith large turning radius. In this work, we introduce a range of modifications\nthat are aimed at increasing the success rate of GRIPS for car-like robots. The\nmain enhancement is adding the additional step that heuristically samples\nwaypoints along the bottleneck parts of the geometric paths (such as sharp\nturns). The results of the experimental evaluation provide a clear evidence\nthat the success rate of the suggested algorithm is up to 40% higher compared\nto the original GRIPS and hits the bar of 90%, while its runtime is lower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 18:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

We develop a novel method to infer the level of conformity between\nthe stellar mass of the brightest central galaxies~(BCGs) $M_*^{BCG}$ and the\nsatellite richness $\\lambda$, defined as their correlation coefficient\n$\\rho_{cc}$ at fixed halo mass, using the abundance and weak lensing of SDSS\nclusters as functions of $M_*^{BCG}$ and $\\lambda$. We detect a halo\nmass-dependent conformity as\n$\\rho_{cc}{=}0.60{+}0.08\\ln(M_h/3{\\times}10^{14}M_{\\odot}/h)$. The strong\nconformity successfully resolves the \"halo mass equality\" conundrum discovered\nin Zu et al. 2021 -- when split by $M_*^{BCG}$ at fixed $\\lambda$, the low and\nhigh-$M_*^{BCG}$ clusters have the same average halo mass despite having a\n$0.34$ dex discrepancy in average $M_*^{BCG}$. On top of the best-fitting\nconformity model, we develop a cluster assembly bias~(AB) prescription\ncalibrated against the CosmicGrowth simulation, and build a conformity+AB model\nfor the cluster weak lensing measurements. Our model predicts that with a\n${\\sim}20\\%$ lower halo concentration $c$, the low-$M_*^{BCG}$ clusters are\n${\\sim}10\\%$ more biased than the high-$M_*^{BCG}$ systems, in excellent\nagreement with the observations. We also show that the observed conformity and\nassembly bias are unlikely due to projection effects. Finally, we build a toy\nmodel to argue that while the early-time BCG-halo co-evolution drives the\n$M_*^{BCG}$-$c$ correlation, the late-time dry merger-induced BCG growth\nnaturally produces the $M_*^{BCG}$-$\\lambda$ conformity despite the well-known\nanti-correlation between $\\lambda$ and $c$.

This annotation issue is more concerned for aerial\nimages: Aerial data collected from sensors naturally cover a relatively large\nland area with multiple labels, while annotated aerial datasets, which are\npublicly available (e.g., UCM, AID), are single-labeled. As manually annotating\nmulti-label aerial images would be time/labor-consuming, we propose a novel\nself-correction integrated domain adaptation (SCIDA) method for automatic\nmulti-label learning. SCIDA is weakly supervised, i.e., automatically learning\nthe multi-label image classification model from using massive, publicly\navailable single-label images. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel\nLabel-Wise self-Correction (LWC) module to better explore underlying label\ncorrelations. This module also makes the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)\nfrom single- to multi-label data possible. For model training, the proposed\nmodel only uses single-label information yet requires no prior knowledge of\nmulti-labeled data; and it predicts labels for multi-label aerial images. In\nour experiments, trained with single-labeled MAI-AID-s and MAI-UCM-s datasets,\nthe proposed model is tested directly on our collected Multi-scene Aerial Image\n(MAI) dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 20:38:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 23:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

In the giant permittivity regime of these\nengineered membranes governed by attractive polarization forces, multivalent\nions adsorbed by the membrane nanopore trigger a monovalent ion separation and\nset an electroosmotic counterion flow. The drag force exerted by this flow is\nsufficiently strong to suppress and invert the electrophoretic velocity of\nanionic polymers, and also to generate the mobility of neutral polymers whose\nspeed and direction can be solely adjusted by the charge and concentration of\nthe added multivalent ions. These features identify the dielectrically\ngenerated transport mechanism as an efficient mean to drive overall neutral or\nweakly charged analytes that cannot be controlled by an external voltage. We\nalso reveal that in anionic polymer translocation, multivalent cation addition\ninto the monovalent salt solution amplifies the electric current signal by\nseveral factors.

To mitigate this problem, caching popular content\ncloser to the end-users has emerged as an effective method for reducing network\ncongestion and improving user experience. To find the optimal locations for\ncontent caching, many conventional approaches construct various mixed integer\nlinear programming (MILP) models. However, such methods may fail to support\nonline decision making due to the inherent curse of dimensionality. In this\npaper, a novel framework for proactive caching is proposed. This framework\nmerges model-based optimization with data-driven techniques by transforming an\noptimization problem into a grayscale image. For parallel training and simple\ndesign purposes, the proposed MILP model is first decomposed into a number of\nsub-problems and, then, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained to\npredict content caching locations of these sub-problems. Furthermore, since the\nMILP model decomposition neglects the internal effects among sub-problems, the\nCNNs' outputs have the risk to be infeasible solutions. Therefore, two\nalgorithms are provided: the first uses predictions from CNNs as an extra\nconstraint to reduce the number of decision variables; the second employs CNNs'\noutputs to accelerate local search. Numerical results show that the proposed\nscheme can reduce 71.6% computation time with only 0.8% additional performance\ncost compared to the MILP solution, which provides high quality decision making\nin real-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 21:32:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 07:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

Two complementary types of approaches have\nbeen developed to address this obstacle. An extensive line of work is based on\ntaking advantage of fortuitous external aids (such as the presence of an\ninstrumental variable or other proxy), along with additional assumptions to\nensure identification. A recent line of work of proximal causal inference (Miao\net al., 2018a) has aimed to provide a novel approach to using proxies to deal\nwith unobserved confounding without relying on stringent parametric\nassumptions. On the other hand, a complete characterization of identifiability\nof a large class of causal parameters in arbitrary causal models with hidden\nvariables has been developed using the language of graphical models, resulting\nin the ID algorithm and related extensions (Tian and Pearl, 2002; Shpitser and\nPearl, 2006a,b). Celebrated special cases of this approach, such as the\nfront-door model, are able to obtain non-parametric identification in seemingly\ncounter-intuitive situations when a treatment and an outcome share an\narbitrarily complicated unobserved common cause.\n  In this paper we aim to develop a synthesis of the proximal and graphical\napproaches to identification in causal inference to yield the most general\nidentification algorithm in multi- variate systems currently known - the\nproximal ID algorithm. In addition to being able to obtain non-parametric\nidentification in all cases where the ID algorithm succeeds, our approach\nallows us to systematically exploit proxies to adjust for the presence of\nunobserved confounders that would have otherwise prevented identification.\n  In addition, we outline a class of estimation strategies for causal\nparameters identified by our method in an important special case.

However, more recent studies (Cao and Bickel, 2020; Shi et\nal., 2021b) showed that independence tests based on Chatterjee's rank\ncorrelation are unfortunately rate-inefficient against various local\nalternatives and they call for variants. We answer this call by proposing\nrevised Chatterjee's rank correlations that still consistently estimate the\nsame dependence measure but provably achieve near-parametric efficiency in\ntesting against Gaussian rotation alternatives. This is possible via\nincorporating many right nearest neighbors in constructing the correlation\ncoefficients. We thus overcome the \"only one disadvantage\" of Chatterjee's rank\ncorrelation (Chatterjee, 2021, Section 7).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 22:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

One way to accelerate such a\nsimulation is to use field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware to\nefficiently compute the matrix multiplications.

In this paper, we propose a novel model to address the NR-IQA task by\nleveraging a hybrid approach that benefits from Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) and self-attention mechanism in Transformers to extract both local and\nnon-local features from the input image. We capture local structure information\nof the image via CNNs, then to circumvent the locality bias among the extracted\nCNNs features and obtain a non-local representation of the image, we utilize\nTransformers on the extracted features where we model them as a sequential\ninput to the Transformer model. Furthermore, to improve the monotonicity\ncorrelation between the subjective and objective scores, we utilize the\nrelative distance information among the images within each batch and enforce\nthe relative ranking among them.

We demonstrate that twist can induce higher level motions of\nvalley electrons around the moire superlattice of bilayer systems. Such larger\nscale collective movement of the valley electron, can be regarded as the\nself-rotation (spin) of a higher-level quasiparticle, or what we call\nsuper-valley electron.

The carved ROI then\nreplaces the corresponding voxels in a second labeled image, and the annotation\nof the second image is replaced accordingly as well.

A feasible way to gain insight into a\nblack-box model is to distill it into an interpretable model such as a decision\ntree, which consists of if-then rules and is easy to grasp and be verified.\nHowever, the traditional model distillation is usually a supervised learning\ntask under a stationary data distribution assumption, which is violated in\nreinforcement learning. Therefore, a typical policy distillation that clones\nmodel behaviors with even a small error could bring a data distribution shift,\nresulting in an unsatisfied distilled policy model with low fidelity or low\nperformance.

High-fidelity numerical solvers that reliably estimate these\nrelevant quantities exist but they are computationally demanding requiring a\nhigh resolution of the crack. Moreover, independent intensive simulations need\nto be carried out even for a small change in domain parameters and/or material\nproperties. Therefore, fast and generalizable surrogate models are needed to\nalleviate the computational burden but the discontinuous nature of fracture\nmechanics presents a major challenge to developing such models. We propose a\nphysics-informed variational formulation of DeepONet (V-DeepONet) for brittle\nfracture analysis. V-DeepONet is trained to map the initial configuration of\nthe defect to the relevant fields of interests (e.g., damage and displacement\nfields). Once the network is trained, the entire global solution can be rapidly\nobtained for any initial crack configuration and loading steps on that domain.\nWhile the original DeepONet is solely data-driven, we take a different path to\ntrain the V-DeepONet by imposing the governing equations in variational form\nand we also use some labelled data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nV-DeepOnet through two benchmarks of brittle fracture, and we verify its\naccuracy using results from high-fidelity solvers. Encoding the physical laws\nand also some data to train the network renders the surrogate model capable of\naccurately performing both interpolation and extrapolation tasks, considering\nthat fracture modeling is very sensitive to fluctuations. The proposed hybrid\ntraining of V-DeepONet is superior to state-of-the-art methods and can be\napplied to a wide array of dynamical systems with complex responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 05:31:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 06:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

The\nresulting networks develop a completely different visual acuity that can be\nused to complement physician findings of time series. This can lead to a more\nenriched analysis, reduced error, more accurate diagnosis of the disease, and\nincreased accuracy and speed of the treatment process. The mapping process may\ncause the loss of essential data from the time series and not retain all the\ntime series features. As a result, achieving an approach that can provide a\ngood representation of the time series while maintaining essential features is\ncrucial. This paper proposes a new approach to network development named\nGraphTS to overcome the limited accuracy of existing methods through EMG time\nseries using the visibility graph method. For this purpose, EMG signals are\npre-processed and mapped to a complex network by a standard visibility graph\nalgorithm. The resulting networks can differentiate between healthy and patient\nsamples. In the next step, the properties of the developed networks are given\nin the form of a feature matrix as input to classifiers after extracting\noptimal features. Performance evaluation of the proposed approach with deep\nneural network shows 99.30% accuracy for training data and 99.18% for test\ndata. Therefore, in addition to enriched network representation and covering\nthe features of time series for healthy, myopathy, and neuropathy EMG, the\nproposed technique improves accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 06:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

Here, we report the search for short-time fast optical bursts in the\nGWAC archived data associated with FRB 20181130B, which were detected by the\nFive Hundred Meter Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) and recently reported. No\nnew credible sources were detected in all single GWAC images with an exposure\ntime of 10 s, including image with coverage of the expected arrival time in\noptical wavelength by taking the high dispersion measurements into account. Our\nresults provide a limiting magnitude of 15.43$\\pm0.04$ mag in R band,\ncorresponding to a flux density of 1.66 Jy or 8.35 mag in AB system by assuming\nthat the duration of the optical band is similar to that of the radio band of\nabout 10 ms.

A dual description is found where the theory is defined\neither in terms of the usual vector gauge field or, alternatively, in terms of\nhigher derivatives of a symmetric tensor field.

State-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods usually follow a\nclustering-based strategy, which generates pseudo labels by clustering and\nmaintains a memory to store instance features and represent the centroid of the\nclusters for contrastive learning. This approach suffers two problems. First,\nthe centroid generated by unsupervised learning may not be a perfect prototype.\nForcing images to get closer to the centroid emphasizes the result of\nclustering, which could accumulate clustering errors during iterations. Second,\nprevious methods utilize features obtained at different training iterations to\nrepresent one centroid, which is not consistent with the current training\nsample, since the features are not directly comparable. To this end, we propose\nan unsupervised re-ID approach with a stochastic learning strategy.\nSpecifically, we adopt a stochastic updated memory, where a random instance\nfrom a cluster is used to update the cluster-level memory for contrastive\nlearning. In this way, the relationship between randomly selected pair of\nimages are learned to avoid the training bias caused by unreliable pseudo\nlabels. The stochastic memory is also always up-to-date for classifying to keep\nthe consistency. Besides, to relieve the issue of camera variance, a unified\ndistance matrix is proposed during clustering, where the distance bias from\ndifferent camera domain is reduced and the variances of identities is\nemphasized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 07:23:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 08:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

Many deep learning\nmethods have been widely used in surface defect detection tasks, and have been\nproven to perform well in defects classification and location. However, deep\nlearning-based detection methods often require plenty of data for training,\nwhich fail to apply to the real industrial scenarios since the distribution of\ndefect categories is often imbalanced. In other words, common defect classes\nhave many samples but rare defect classes have extremely few samples, and it is\ndifficult for these methods to well detect rare defect classes. To solve the\nimbalanced distribution problem, in this paper we propose TL-SDD: a novel\nTransfer Learning-based method for Surface Defect Detection. First, we adopt a\ntwo-phase training scheme to transfer the knowledge from common defect classes\nto rare defect classes. Second, we propose a novel Metric-based Surface Defect\nDetection (M-SDD) model. We design three modules for this model: (1) feature\nextraction module: containing feature fusion which combines high-level semantic\ninformation with low-level structural information. (2) feature reweighting\nmodule: transforming examples to a reweighting vector that indicates the\nimportance of features. (3) distance metric module: learning a metric space in\nwhich defects are classified by computing distances to representations of each\ncategory. Finally, we validate the performance of our proposed method on a real\ndataset including surface defects of aluminum profiles. Compared to the\nbaseline methods, the performance of our proposed method has improved by up to\n11.98% for rare defect classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 07:24:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

One fundamental problem for\nCKM-enabled communication is how to efficiently construct the CKM based on\nfinite measurement data points at limited user locations. Towards this end,\nthis paper proposes a novel map construction method based on the\n\\emph{expectation maximization} (EM) algorithm, by utilizing the available\nmeasurement data, jointly with the expert knowledge of well-established\nstatistic channel models. The key idea is to partition the available data\npoints into different groups, where each group shares the same modelling\nparameter values to be determined. We show that determining the modelling\nparameter values can be formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation problem\nwith latent variables, which is then efficiently solved by the classic EM\nalgorithm. Compared to the pure data-driven methods such as the nearest\nneighbor based interpolation, the proposed method is more efficient since only\na small number of modelling parameters need to be determined and stored.\nFurthermore, the proposed method is extended for constructing a specific type\nof CKM, namely, the channel gain map (CGM), where closed-form expressions are\nderived for the E-step and M-step of the EM algorithm. Numerical results are\nprovided to show the effectiveness of the proposed map construction method as\ncompared to the benchmark curve fitting method with one single model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 08:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

Quantization\nmethods use a rounding function to map full-precision values to the nearest\nquantized ones, but this operation is not differentiable. There are mainly two\napproaches to training quantized networks with gradient-based optimizers.\nFirst, a straight-through estimator (STE) replaces the zero derivative of the\nrounding with that of an identity function, which causes a gradient mismatch\nproblem. Second, soft quantizers approximate the rounding with continuous\nfunctions at training time, and exploit the rounding for quantization at test\ntime. This alleviates the gradient mismatch, but causes a quantizer gap\nproblem. We alleviate both problems in a unified framework. To this end, we\nintroduce a novel quantizer, dubbed a distance-aware quantizer (DAQ), that\nmainly consists of a distance-aware soft rounding (DASR) and a temperature\ncontroller. To alleviate the gradient mismatch problem, DASR approximates the\ndiscrete rounding with the kernel soft argmax, which is based on our insight\nthat the quantization can be formulated as a distance-based assignment problem\nbetween full-precision values and quantized ones. The controller adjusts the\ntemperature parameter in DASR adaptively according to the input, addressing the\nquantizer gap problem. Experimental results on standard benchmarks show that\nDAQ outperforms the state of the art significantly for various bit-widths\nwithout bells and whistles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 09:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

Despite the\nencouraging results achieved, prior ZSL approaches focus on improving the\ndiscriminant power of seen-class features, yet have largely overlooked the\ngeometric structure of the samples and the prototypes. The subsequent\nattribute-based generative adversarial network (GAN), as a result, also\nneglects the topological information in sample generation and further yields\ninferior performances in classifying the visual features of unseen classes. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel structure-aware feature generation scheme,\ntermed as SA-GAN, to explicitly account for the topological structure in\nlearning both the latent space and the generative networks. Specifically, we\nintroduce a constraint loss to preserve the initial geometric structure when\nlearning a discriminative latent space, and carry out our GAN training with\nadditional supervising signals from a structure-aware discriminator and a\nreconstruction module. The former supervision distinguishes fake and real\nsamples based on their affinity to class prototypes, while the latter aims to\nreconstruct the original feature space from the generated latent space. This\ntopology-preserving mechanism enables our method to significantly enhance the\ngeneralization capability on unseen-classes and consequently improve the\nclassification performance. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that the\nproposed approach consistently outperforms the state of the art.

The application of building metadata simplifies the creation of digital\nrepresentations and provides portable data analytics. Typical metadata\nstandards such as Brick and Haystack are used to describe the data of the\nbuilding system. Brick uses standard ontologies to create building metadata.\nHowever, neither Haystack nor Brick has provided definitions about the Variable\nRefrigerant Flow (VRF) system so far.

Misconceptions often lead to recurring patterns\nof similar bugs, enabling automated tools to provide this support in terms of\nhints on occurrences of common bug patterns. In this paper, we investigate to\nwhat extent the hints improve the effectiveness and efficiency of teachers in\ndebugging learners' programs using a cohort of 163 primary school teachers in\ntraining, tasked to correct buggy Scratch programs, with and without hints on\nbug patterns. Our experiment suggests that automatically generated hints can\nreduce the effort of finding and fixing bugs from 8.66 to 5.24 minutes, while\nincreasing the effectiveness by 34% more correct solutions.

However, most models are black\nboxes and it is hard to understand what happened in the matching process, due\nto the poor interpretability of deep learning. This paper aims at tackling this\nproblem. The key idea is to test whether existing deep text matching methods\nsatisfy some fundamental heuristics in information retrieval. Specifically,\nfour heuristics are used in our study, i.e., term frequency constraint, term\ndiscrimination constraint, length normalization constraints, and TF-length\nconstraint. Since deep matching models usually contain many parameters, it is\ndifficult to conduct a theoretical study for these complicated functions. In\nthis paper, We propose an empirical testing method. Specifically, We first\nconstruct some queries and documents to make them satisfy the assumption in a\nconstraint, and then test to which extend a deep text matching model trained on\nthe original dataset satisfies the corresponding constraint. Besides, a famous\nattribution based interpretation method, namely integrated gradient, is adopted\nto conduct detailed analysis and guide for feasible improvement. Experimental\nresults on LETOR 4.0 and MS Marco show that all the investigated deep text\nmatching methods, both representation and interaction based methods, satisfy\nthe above constraints with high probabilities in statistics. We further extend\nthese constraints to the semantic settings, which are shown to be better\nsatisfied for all the deep text matching models.

To tackle the above challenges, we employ\ngradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) to handle data heterogeneity and\nintroduce multi-task learning (MTL) to solve data insufficiency.

Mechanisms of skyrmion collapse are identified and\ncorresponding energy barriers and thermal collapse rates are evaluated as\nfunctions of the interlayer exchange coupling and mutual stacking of the\nmonolayers using transition state theory and an atomistic spin Hamiltonian. In\norder to contrast the results to monolayer systems, the magnetic interactions\nwithin each layer are chosen so as to mimic the well-established Pd/Fe/Ir(111)\nsystem. Even bilayer systems demonstrate a rich diversity of skyrmion collapse\nmechanisms that sometimes co-exist. For very weakly coupled layers, the\nskyrmions in each layer decay successively via radially-symmetric shrinking.\nSlightly larger coupling leads to an asymmetric chimera collapse stabilized by\ninterlayer exchange. When the interlayer exchange coupling reaches a certain\ncritical value, the skyrmions collapse simultaneously. Interestingly, the\noverall energy barrier for the skyrmion collapse does not always converge to a\nmultiple of that for a monolayer system in the strongly coupled regime. For a\ncertain stacking of the magnetic layers, the energy barrier as a function of\nthe interlayer exchange coupling features a maximum and then decreases with the\ncoupling strength in the strong coupling regime.

Objective: We investigate image\nreconstruction with minimized LAR artifacts from low- and high-kVp data over\nLARs of $\\le 180^\\circ$ by using a directional-total-variation (DTV) algorithm.\nMethods: Image reconstruction from LAR data is formulated as a convex\noptimization problem in which data-$\\ell_2$ is minimized with constraints on\nimage's DTVs along orthogonal axes.

Monitoring stations have been established to continuously\nobtain air quality information, but they do not cover all areas.

In this\npaper, we first study the air quality inference in unmonitored cities. To\naccurately infer air quality in unmonitored cities, we propose a neural\nnetwork-based approach AIREX. The novelty of AIREX is employing a\nmixture-of-experts approach, which is a machine learning technique based on the\ndivide-and-conquer principle, to learn correlations of air quality between\nmultiple cities. To further boost the performance, it employs attention\nmechanisms to compute impacts of air quality inference from the monitored\ncities to the locations in the unmonitored city.

In this work, we present a learning-based method for PM that produces\naccurate and reliable reachability predictions despite partial observability\n(PO). We build on Neural Predictive Monitoring (NPM), a PM method that uses\ndeep neural networks for approximating hybrid systems reachability, and extend\nit to the PO case. We propose and compare two solutions, an end-to-end\napproach, which directly operates on the rough observations, and a two-step\napproach, which introduces an intermediate state estimation step. Both\nsolutions rely on conformal prediction to provide 1) probabilistic guarantees\nin the form of prediction regions and 2) sound estimates of predictive\nuncertainty. We use the latter to identify unreliable (and likely erroneous)\npredictions and to retrain and improve the monitors on these uncertain inputs\n(i.e., active learning). Our method results in highly accurate reachability\npredictions and error detection, as well as tight prediction regions with\nguaranteed coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 15:08:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 12:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

It\nis known that listing all simplicial vertices can be done in $O(nm)$ time or\n$O(n^{\\omega})$ time, where $O(n^{\\omega})$ is the time needed to perform a\nfast matrix multiplication. The notion of avoidable vertices generalizes the\nconcept of simplicial vertices in the following way: a vertex $u$ is avoidable\nif every induced path on three vertices with middle vertex $u$ is contained in\nan induced cycle. We present algorithms for listing all avoidable vertices of a\ngraph through the notion of minimal triangulations and common neighborhood\ndetection. In particular we give algorithms with running times $O(n^{2}m)$ and\n$O(n^{1+\\omega})$, respectively. Additionally, based on a simplified graph\ntraversal we propose a fast algorithm that runs in time $O(n^2 + m^2)$ and\nmatches the corresponding running time of listing all simplicial vertices on\nsparse graphs with $m=O(n)$. Moreover, we show that our algorithms cannot be\nimproved significantly, as we prove that under plausible complexity assumptions\nthere is no truly subquadratic algorithm for recognizing an avoidable vertex.\nTo complement our results, we consider their natural generalizations of\navoidable edges and avoidable paths.

Although the Floquet\nquasi-Hamiltonians are time-independent, however, these continuously driven\nsystems can still suffer from heating due to a secular growth in the\nexpectation value of the time-dependent physical Hamiltonian. Here we use an\nexact space-time mapping to construct a class of many-body systems with rapid\nperiodic driving which we nonetheless prove to be completely free of heating,\nby mapping them exactly onto time-independent systems. The absence of heating\ndespite the periodic driving occurs in these cases of harmonically trapped\ndilute Bose gas because the driving is a certain periodic but anharmonic\nmodulation of the gas's two-body contact interaction, at a particular\nfrequency. Although we prove that the absence of heating is exact within full\nquantum many-body theory, we then use mean-field theory to simulate 'Floquet\nheating spectroscopy' and compute the heating rate when the driving frequency\nis varied away from the critical value for zero heating. In both weakly and\nstrongly non-linear regimes, the heating rate as a function of driving\nfrequency appears to show a number of Fano resonances, suggesting that the\nexactly proven absence of heating at the critical frequency may be explained in\nterms of destructive interferences between excitation modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 15:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

We\nevaluate a collection of such models (with between 244M and 137B parameters) on\ntwo new benchmarks, MBPP and MathQA-Python, in both the few-shot and\nfine-tuning regimes. Our benchmarks are designed to measure the ability of\nthese models to synthesize short Python programs from natural language\ndescriptions. The Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP) dataset contains 974\nprogramming tasks, designed to be solvable by entry-level programmers. The\nMathQA-Python dataset, a Python version of the MathQA benchmark, contains 23914\nproblems that evaluate the ability of the models to synthesize code from more\ncomplex text. On both datasets, we find that synthesis performance scales\nlog-linearly with model size. Our largest models, even without finetuning on a\ncode dataset, can synthesize solutions to 59.6 percent of the problems from\nMBPP using few-shot learning with a well-designed prompt. Fine-tuning on a\nheld-out portion of the dataset improves performance by about 10 percentage\npoints across most model sizes. On the MathQA-Python dataset, the largest\nfine-tuned model achieves 83.8 percent accuracy. Going further, we study the\nmodel's ability to engage in dialog about code, incorporating human feedback to\nimprove its solutions. We find that natural language feedback from a human\nhalves the error rate compared to the model's initial prediction. Additionally,\nwe conduct an error analysis to shed light on where these models fall short and\nwhat types of programs are most difficult to generate. Finally, we explore the\nsemantic grounding of these models by fine-tuning them to predict the results\nof program execution. We find that even our best models are generally unable to\npredict the output of a program given a specific input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 03:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

In this paper, we study the virality of\nanimated GIFs by analyzing over 10 months of complete data logs (more than 1B\nposts and 12B reblogs) on Tumblr, one of the largest repositories of animated\nGIFs on the Internet. We conduct a series of quantitative and comparative\nstudies on Tumblr data, comparing major types of online content -- text,\nimages, videos, and animated GIFs.

Even so, measuring quality presents many methodological\nchallenges. The most widely used systems use labels on discrete ordinal scales\nwhen assessing quality, but such labels can be inconvenient for statistics and\nmachine learning. Prior work handles this by assuming that different levels of\nquality are \"evenly spaced\" from one another. This assumption runs counter to\nintuitions about the relative degrees of effort needed to raise Wikipedia\nencyclopedia articles to different quality levels. Furthermore, models from\nprior work are fit to datasets that oversample high-quality articles. This\nlimits their accuracy for representative samples of articles or revisions. I\ndescribe a technique extending the Wikimedia Foundations' ORES article quality\nmodel to address these limitations.

It is challenging to find knob settings that optimize the run-time\nperformance of such applications because the optimal knob settings are usually\nfunctions of inputs, computing platforms, time as well as user's requirements,\nwhich can be very diverse.\n  Most prior works address this problem by offline profiling followed by\ntraining models for control. However, profiling-based approaches incur large\noverhead before execution; it is also difficult to redeploy them in other\nrun-time configurations.\n  In this paper, we propose Sonic, a sampling-based online controller for\nlong-running streaming applications that does not require profiling ahead of\ntime. Within each phase of a streaming application's execution, Sonic utilizes\nthe beginning portion to sample the knob space strategically and aims to pick\nthe optimal knob setting for the rest of the phase, given a user-specified\nconstrained optimization problem. A hybrid approach of machine learning\nregressions and Bayesian optimization are used for better overall sampling\nchoices.\n  Sonic is implemented independent of application, device, input, performance\nobjective and constraints. We evaluate Sonic on traditional parallel benchmarks\nas well as on deep learning inference benchmarks across multiple platforms. Our\nexperiments show that when using Sonic to control knob settings, application\nrun-time performance is only 5.3% less than if optimal knob settings were used,\ndemonstrating that Sonic is able to find near-optimal knob settings under\ndiverse run-time configurations without prior knowledge quickly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 18:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}
