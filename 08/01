The existing deep learning based methods only focus on the\nbasic cases of skill sequences, and the model relies on the training data\nheavily. The sequences in real clinical practice are a mix of diverse skills\nand have complex scanning paths. Besides, deep models should adapt themselves\nto the testing cases with prior knowledge for better robustness, rather than\nonly fit to the training cases. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to\nsensorless freehand 3D US reconstruction considering the complex skill\nsequences. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we advance a novel online\nlearning framework by designing a differentiable reconstruction algorithm. It\nrealizes an end-to-end optimization from section sequences to the reconstructed\nvolume. Second, a self-supervised learning method is developed to explore the\ncontext information that reconstructed by the testing data itself, promoting\nthe perception of the model. Third, inspired by the effectiveness of shape\nprior, we also introduce adversarial training to strengthen the learning of\nanatomical shape prior in the reconstructed volume. By mining the context and\nstructural cues of the testing data, our online learning methods can drive the\nmodel to handle complex skill sequences. Experimental results on developmental\ndysplasia of the hip US and fetal US datasets show that, our proposed method\ncan outperform the start-of-the-art methods regarding the shift errors and path\nsimilarities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 16:06:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 13:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

Contrastive learning algorithms have\nrecently been proposed to train physical systems, such as fluidic, mechanical,\nor electrical networks, to perform machine learning tasks from local evolution\nrules. However, to date such systems have only been implemented in silico due\nto the engineering challenge of creating elements that autonomously evolve\nbased on their own response to two sets of global boundary conditions. Here we\nintroduce and implement a physics-driven contrastive learning scheme for a\nnetwork of variable resistors, using circuitry to locally compare the response\nof two identical networks subjected to the two different sets of boundary\nconditions. Using this innovation, our system effectively trains itself,\noptimizing its resistance values without use of a central processor or external\ninformation storage. Once the system is trained for a specified allostery,\nregression, or classification task, the task is subsequently performed rapidly\nand automatically by the physical imperative to minimize power dissipation in\nresponse to the given voltage inputs. We demonstrate that, unlike typical\ncomputers, such learning systems are robust to extreme damage (and thus\nmanufacturing defects) due to their decentralized learning. Our twin-network\napproach is therefore readily scalable to extremely large or nonlinear networks\nwhere its distributed nature will be an enormous advantage; a laboratory\nnetwork of only 500 edges will already outpace its in silico counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 16:07:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 16:29:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 21:26:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 19:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Learning from\ndemonstration has been shown to be advantageous for navigation tasks as it\nallows for machine learning non-experts to quickly provide information needed\nto learn complex traversal behaviors. However, a minimal set of demonstrations\nis unlikely to capture all relevant information needed to achieve the desired\nbehavior in every possible future operational environment. Due to\ndistributional shift among environments, a robot may encounter features that\nwere rarely or never observed during training for which the appropriate reward\nvalue is uncertain, leading to undesired outcomes. This paper proposes a\nBayesian technique which quantifies uncertainty over the weights of a linear\nreward function given a dataset of minimal human demonstrations to operate\nsafely in dynamic environments. This uncertainty is quantified and incorporated\ninto a risk averse set of weights used to generate cost maps for planning.\nExperiments in a 3-D environment with a simulated robot show that our proposed\nalgorithm enables a robot to avoid dangerous terrain completely in two out of\nthree test scenarios and accumulates a lower amount of risk than related\napproaches in all scenarios without requiring any additional demonstrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 16:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

The FSO laser beams incident on the optical IRSs have a\nGaussian power intensity profile and a nonlinear phase profile, whereas the\nplane waves in radio frequency (RF) systems have a uniform power intensity\nprofile and a linear phase profile. Given these substantial differences, the\nresults available for IRS-assisted RF systems are not applicable to\nIRS-assisted FSO systems. Therefore, we develop a new analytical channel model\nfor point-to-point IRS-assisted FSO systems based on the Huygens-Fresnel\nprinciple. Our analytical model captures the impact of the size, position, and\norientation of the IRS as well as its phase shift profile on the end-to-end\nchannel. To allow the sharing of the optical IRS by multiple FSO links, we\npropose three different protocols, namely the time division (TD), IRS-division\n(IRSD), and IRS homogenization (IRSH) protocols. The proposed protocols address\nthe specific characteristics of FSO systems including the non-uniformity and\npossible misalignment of the laser beams.

To address the former, we\npropose the method FRIED, Fair Representation learning using Interpolation\nEnabled Disentanglement. In our architecture, by imposing a critic-based\nadversarial framework, we enforce the interpolated points in the latent space\nto be more realistic. This helps in capturing the data manifold effectively and\nenhances the utility of the learned representation for downstream prediction\ntasks. We address the latter question by developing a theory on\nfairness-accuracy trade-offs using classifier-based conditional mutual\ninformation estimation.

The variable topology truss (VTT) is a class of\nmodular truss robot. As self-reconfigurable modular robots, variable topology\ntrusses are composed of many edge modules that can be rearranged into various\nstructures with respect to different activities and tasks. These robots are\nable to change their shapes by not only controlling joint positions which is\nsimilar to robots with fixed morphologies, but also reconfiguring the\nconnections among modules in order to change their morphologies. Motion\nplanning is the fundamental to apply a VTT robot, including reconfiguration to\nalter its shape, and non-impact locomotion on the ground. This problem for VTT\nrobots is difficult due to their non-fixed morphologies, high dimensionality,\nthe potential for self-collision, and complex motion constraints. In this\npaper, a new motion planning framework to dramatically alter the structure of a\nVTT is presented. It can also be used to solve locomotion tasks much more\nefficient compared with previous work. Several test scenarios are used to show\nits effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 19:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

The\nessence of this study is to model and decipher the mechanism of emergence of a\ntask-specific functional connectivity among a population of neurons. We have\nused our proposed neuron activity pattern (NAP) model to define an assorted\nrange of interactions and simulated across a 2D lattice with two-state\n(firing/non-firing) neurons. We observed the emergence of scale-free,\nhierarchically organized ordered patterns of active neurons, that we call as\nfunctional cortical patterns (FCPs), only at the near-critical phase\ntransition. We have done extensive topological characterization of FCPs and\ntested its congruency with the functional brain networks obtained from the\nempirical electrophysiological data of a visual stimulus task. Our results of\nnetwork theory attributes, fractal analysis and functional cartography have\nconfirmed the transitioning effect while generation of FCPs. This gives us\nstrong implication that the functional neuronal system supports\nfar-from-equilibrium dynamics upon receiving a stimulus. Our investigation for\nthe long, critical and short-ranged interactions has lead to an interpretation\nthat near-critical transition phase is a spectrum of critical temperatures\n(coupling strengths) being affected by the distance between the neurons. The\nrange of interaction among neurons plays an important role in defining the\nfunctional severity of the neuronal circuitry. We propose that interaction\nrange as a function of coupling strength drives connectivity in an augmenting\nfashion as we observed an increase in coupling strength from short to\nlong-range interactions, among the population of neurons. This gives us insight\ntowards the intensity of cognitive behaviour, which is attained by multiple\nstimulus attempts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 19:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

Scrubbing is a technique for\nexcluding fMRI volumes thought to be contaminated by artifacts and generally\ncomes in two flavors. Motion scrubbing based on subject head motion-derived\nmeasures is popular but suffers from a number of drawbacks, especially high\nrates of censoring of individual volumes and entire subjects. Alternatively,\ndata-driven scrubbing methods like DVARS are based on observed noise in the\nprocessed fMRI timeseries and may avoid some of these issues.

But, how robust are they? Although it has been well-known that\nDNNs often suffer from adversarial vulnerability with a catastrophic drop in\nperformance, the situation is even worse in stereo matching. This paper first\nshows that a type of weak white-box attacks can overwhelm state-of-the-art\nmethods. The attack is learned by a proposed stereo-constrained projected\ngradient descent (PGD) method in stereo matching. This observation raises\nserious concerns for the deployment of DNN-based stereo matching. Parallel to\nthe adversarial vulnerability, DNN-based stereo matching is typically trained\nunder the so-called simulation to reality pipeline, and thus domain\ngeneralizability is an important problem. This paper proposes to rethink the\nlearnable DNN-based feature backbone towards adversarially-robust and domain\ngeneralizable stereo matching by completely removing it for matching. In\nexperiments, the proposed method is tested in the SceneFlow dataset and the\nKITTI2015 benchmark, with promising results. We compute the matching cost\nvolume using the classic multi-scale census transform (i.e., local binary\npattern) of the raw input stereo images, followed by a stacked Hourglass head\nsub-network solving the matching problem. It significantly improves the\nadversarial robustness, while retaining accuracy performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

The task becomes even more challenging\nif it is also required to identify samples from unknown categories (open-set\nclassification). Learning a good abstraction for a class with very few samples\nis extremely difficult, especially under open-set settings. As a result,\nopen-set recognition has received minimal attention in the few-shot setting.\nHowever, it is a critical task in many applications like environmental\nmonitoring, where the number of labeled examples for each class is limited.\nExisting few-shot open-set recognition (FSOSR) methods rely on thresholding\nschemes, with some considering uniform probability for open-class samples.\nHowever, this approach is often inaccurate, especially for fine-grained\ncategorization, and makes them highly sensitive to the choice of a threshold.\nTo address these concerns, we propose Reconstructing Exemplar-based Few-shot\nOpen-set ClaSsifier (ReFOCS).

The interaction between the NS magnetosphere and the accreted\nmaterial results in evolution of the spin period and the centrifugal force of\nthe NS, leading to the change of the stress in the NS crust. When the stress of\nthe crust reaches the critical value, a starquake occurs and further produces\nFRBs. The interval between starquakes is estimated to be a few days that is\nsmaller than the active window of FRB 180916B. When the NS moves out of the\ndisk of the Be star, the interval between starquakes becomes much longer than\nthe orbital period, which corresponds to the non-active phase. In this model,\ndue to the absorption of the disk of the Be star, a frequency-dependent active\nwindow would appear for the FRBs, which is consistent with the observed\nproperties of FRB 180916B.

Specifically,\nthe coarsening rates observed are unexpectedly slow for many intracellular\ncondensates. Recently, Folkmann, et al. [Science {\\bf 373}, 1218 (2021)] argued\nthat the slow coarsening rate can be caused by the slow conversion of a\ncondensate constituent between the state in the dilute phase and the condensate\nstate. A consequence of this conversion-limited picture is that standard\ntheories of coarsening in phase separation (Lifshitz-Slyozov--Wagner Ostwald\nripening and drop coalescence schemes) no longer apply. Surprisingly, I show\nhere that the model equations of conversion-limited phase separation can\ninstead be mapped onto a grain growth model in a single-phase material in three\ndimensions.

The diagnosis of MVI needs discovering the vessels that contain\nhepatocellular carcinoma cells and counting their number in each vessel, which\ndepends heavily on experiences of the doctor, is largely subjective and\ntime-consuming. However, there is no algorithm as yet tailored for the MVI\ndetection from pathological images.

The first and essential step for the\nautomatic diagnosis of MVI is the accurate segmentation of vessels. The unique\ncharacteristics of pathological liver images, such as super-large size,\nmulti-scale vessel, and blurred vessel edges, make the accurate vessel\nsegmentation challenging.

They still are heavy in terms of\nmemory size and speed for an embedded system with limited memory space. Since\nthe object detection for autonomous system is run on an embedded processor, it\nis preferable to compress the detection network as light as possible while\npreserving the detection accuracy. There are several popular lightweight\ndetection models but their accuracy is too low for safe driving applications.\nTherefore, this paper proposes a new object detection model, referred as\nYOffleNet, which is compressed at a high ratio while minimizing the accuracy\nloss for real-time and safe driving application on an autonomous system. The\nbackbone network architecture is based on YOLOv4, but we could compress the\nnetwork greatly by replacing the high-calculation-load CSP DenseNet with the\nlighter modules of ShuffleNet. Experiments with KITTI dataset showed that the\nproposed YOffleNet is compressed by 4.7 times than the YOLOv4-s that could\nachieve as fast as 46 FPS on an embedded GPU system(NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier).\nCompared to the high compression ratio, the accuracy is reduced slightly to\n85.8% mAP, that is only 2.6% lower than YOLOv4-s. Thus, the proposed network\nshowed a high potential to be deployed on the embedded system of the autonomous\nsystem for the real-time and accurate object detection applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2021 08:19:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

Many semantic segmentation methods based\non traditional deep learning insufficiently captured the semantic and\nappearance information of images, which put limit on their generality and\nrobustness for various application scenes. In this paper, we proposed a novel\nstrategy that reformulated the popularly-used convolution operation to\nmulti-layer convolutional sparse coding block to ease the aforementioned\ndeficiency. This strategy can be possibly used to significantly improve the\nsegmentation performance of any semantic segmentation model that involves\nconvolutional operations. To prove the effectiveness of our idea, we chose the\nwidely-used U-Net model for the demonstration purpose, and we designed CSC-Unet\nmodel series based on U-Net. Through extensive analysis and experiments, we\nprovided credible evidence showing that the multi-layer convolutional sparse\ncoding block enables semantic segmentation model to converge faster, can\nextract finer semantic and appearance information of images, and improve the\nability to recover spatial detail information. The best CSC-Unet model\nsignificantly outperforms the results of the original U-Net on three public\ndatasets with different scenarios, i.e., 87.14% vs. 84.71% on DeepCrack\ndataset, 68.91% vs. 67.09% on Nuclei dataset, and 53.68% vs. 48.82% on CamVid\ndataset, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2021 09:16:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

The level-1 VIVT cache becomes\neven simpler to construct if it is implemented as a direct-mapped cache\n(VIVT-DM cache). However, VIVT and VIVT-DM caches have some drawbacks. When the\nnumber of sets in the cache is larger than the smallest page size, there is a\npossibility of synonyms (two or more virtual addresses mapped to the same\nphysical address) existing in the cache. Further, maintenance of cache\ncoherence across multiple processors requires a physical to virtual translation\nmechanism in the hardware. We describe a simple, efficient reverse lookup table\nbased approach to address the synonym and the coherence problems in VIVT (both\nset associative and direct-mapped) caches. In particular, the proposed scheme\ndoes not disturb the critical memory access paths in a typical micro-processor,\nand requires a low overhead for its implementation.

We propose a deep neural network model of KiNet to\nrepresent chemical kinetics. KiNet takes the current composition states and\npredicts the evolution of the states after a fixed time step. The long-period\nevolution of the states and their gradients to model parameters can be\nefficiently obtained by recursively applying the KiNet model multiple times. To\naddress the challenges of the high-dimensional composition space and error\naccumulation in long-period prediction, the architecture of KiNet incorporates\nthe residual network model (ResNet), and the training employs backpropagation\nthrough time (BPTT) approach to minimize multi-step prediction error. In\naddition, an approach for efficiently computing the gradient of the ignition\ndelay time (IDT) to KiNet model parameters is proposed to train the KiNet\nagainst the rich database of IDT from literature, which could address the\nscarcity of time-resolved species measurements. The KiNet is first trained and\ncompared with the simulated species profiles during the auto-ignition of H2/air\nmixtures. The obtained KiNet model can accurately predict the auto-ignition\nprocesses for various initial conditions that cover a wide range of pressures,\ntemperatures, and equivalence ratios. Then, we show that the gradient of IDT to\nKiNet model parameters is parallel to the gradient of the temperature at the\nignition point. This correlation enables efficient computation of the gradient\nof IDT via backpropagation and is demonstrated as a feasible approach for\nfine-tuning the KiNet against IDT. These demonstrations shall open up the\npossibility of building data-driven kinetic models autonomously. Finally, the\ntrained KiNet could be potentially applied to kinetic model reduction and\nchemistry acceleration in turbulent combustion simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2021 13:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

This summer jet has been less explored in a broad planetary\ncontext, both due to the dominance of the winter jet and since the balances\ncontrolling it are more complex, and understanding them requires exploring a\nbroader parameter regime. To better understand the jet characteristics on\nterrestrial planets and the transition between winter- and summer-dominated jet\nregimes, we explore the jet's dependence on rotation rate and obliquity. Across\na significant portion of the parameter space, the dominant jet is in the winter\nhemisphere, and the summer jet is weaker and restricted to the boundary layer.\nHowever, we show that for slow rotation rates and high obliquities, the\nstrongest jet is in the summer rather than the winter hemisphere.

One notorious issue with these approaches is that they are weak in\ndiscriminating anomalies from normal samples due to the lack of the knowledge\nabout the anomalies. Here, we study the problem of few-shot anomaly detection,\nin which we aim at using a few labeled anomaly examples to train\nsample-efficient discriminative detection models. To address this problem, we\nintroduce a novel weakly-supervised anomaly detection framework to train\ndetection models without assuming the examples illustrating all possible\nclasses of anomaly.\n  Specifically, the proposed approach learns discriminative normality\n(regularity) by leveraging the labeled anomalies and a prior probability to\nenforce expressive representations of normality and unbounded deviated\nrepresentations of abnormality. This is achieved by an end-to-end optimization\nof anomaly scores with a neural deviation learning, in which the anomaly scores\nof normal samples are imposed to approximate scalar scores drawn from the prior\nwhile that of anomaly examples is enforced to have statistically significant\ndeviations from these sampled scores in the upper tail. Furthermore, our model\nis optimized to learn fine-grained normality and abnormality by top-K\nmultiple-instance-learning-based feature subspace deviation learning, allowing\nmore generalized representations. Comprehensive experiments on nine real-world\nimage anomaly detection benchmarks show that our model is substantially more\nsample-efficient and robust, and performs significantly better than\nstate-of-the-art competing methods in both closed-set and open-set settings.\nOur model can also offer explanation capability as a result of its prior-driven\nanomaly score learning.

However, determining whether a point in the strip is a zero of a\ncomplex function is a challenging task. Bombieri proposed an assertion in the\nOfficial Problem Description that states, ``The Riemann hypothesis is\nequivalent to the statement that all local maxima of $\\xi(t)$ (namely $\\xi(s)$\non the critical line) are positive and all local minima are negative.\" In this\npaper, we follow Bombieri's idea to study the Riemann hypothesis. First, we\nshow that on the critical line, the $\\xi(s)$ function (which is then a real\nfunction of a single real variable) obeys a special differential equation, such\nthat it satisfies Bombieri's equivalence condition. Then, since we have been\nunable to locate the original proof of Bombieri's equivalence theorem, we\nindependently provide a proof for the sufficiency part of it. Namely, if the\n$\\xi(s)$ function satisfies Bombieri's equivalence condition on the critical\nline, then by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, it has no zeros outside this\ncritical line. Thus, we can conclude that the Riemann hypothesis is true.\nFinally, we comment on P\\'olya's counterexample against using the simplified\n$\\xi(s)$ function to study the Riemann hypothesis, noting that it violates\nBombieri's equivalence theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2021 10:48:43 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 02:49:40 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 09:46:05 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 09:53:43 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 09:47:09 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 08:13:30 GMT"},{"version":"v15","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 01:53:02 GMT"},{"version":"v16","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 02:11:53 GMT"},{"version":"v17","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 07:56:21 GMT"},{"version":"v18","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 06:17:32 GMT"},{"version":"v19","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 13:46:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2021 08:26:01 GMT"},{"version":"v20","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 11:16:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2021 10:47:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 08:45:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 02:26:03 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 04:36:39 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 06:32:52 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 07:40:05 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 09:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}
