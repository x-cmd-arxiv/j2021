One of the commonly used detectors is the maximum\nlikelihood detector, which is obtained by solving a box-constrained integer\nleast squares problem, that is NP-hard. Two other popular detectors are the\nbox-constrained rounding and Babai detectors due to their high efficiency of\nimplementation. In this paper, we first present formulas for the success\nprobabilities (the probabilities of correct detection) of these three detectors\nfor two different situations: the integer parameter vector is deterministic and\nis uniformly distributed over the constraint box. Then, we give two simple\nexamples to respectively show that the success probability of the\nbox-constrained rounding detector can be larger than that of the\nbox-constrained Babai detector and the latter can be larger than the success\nprobability of the maximum likelihood detector when the parameter vector is\ndeterministic, and prove that the success probability of the box-constrained\nrounding detector is always not larger than that of the box-constrained Babai\ndetector when the parameter vector is uniformly distributed over the constraint\nbox. Some relations between the results for the box constrained and ordinary\ncases are presented, and two bounds on the success probability of the maximum\nlikelihood detector, which can easily be computed, are developed.

Better understanding these forces and the distribution is important\nfor predicting the collective behavior of granular media, the media second only\nto water as the most manipulated material in global industry. However, studies\nin this regard so far have been largely confined to granular media exhibiting\nonly geometric heterogeneity, leaving the dimension of mechanical heterogeneity\na rather uncharted area. Here, through a FEM contact mechanics model, we show\nthat a heterogeneous inter-particle force distribution can also emerge from the\ndimension of mechanical heterogeneity alone. Specifically, we numerically study\ninter-particle forces in packing of mechanically heterogeneous disks arranged\nover either a square or a hexagonal lattice and under quasi-static isotropic\ncompression. Our results show that, a hexagonal packing exhibit a more\nheterogeneous inter-particle force distribution than a square packing does. For\nboth packing lattices, preliminary analysis shows the consistent coexistence of\noutliers (i.e., softer disks sustaining larger forces while stiffer disks\nsustaining smaller forces) in comparison to their homogeneous counterparts,\nwhich implies the existence of nonlocal effect. Further analysis on the portion\nof outliers and on spatial contact force correlations suggest that the\nhexagonal packing shows more pronounced nonlocal effect over the square packing\nunder small mechanical heterogeneity. However, such trend is reversed when\nassemblies becomes more mechanically heterogeneous. Lastly, we confirm that, in\nthe absence of particle reorganization events, contact friction merely plays\nthe role of packing stabilization while its variation has little effect on\ninter-particle forces and their distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2021 17:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

Design is widely studied in artistic and industrial contexts, but its\napplication to startup culture and software startups follows its own method\nprison. In the method prison, old and conventional means are chosen instead of\nnew techniques and demanding design studies. This means that when a software\nstartup considers design as a foundation for creativity and generating better\nofferings, they can grab any industry with a disruptive agenda, making anything\nsoftware-intensive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2021 18:46:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-21"}

Stored hydrogen can\neither be converted back to electricity or it can be used as feed-stock for\nindustry, heating for built environment, and as fuel for vehicles. This\nresearch examines the optimal strategies for operating integrated energy\nsystems consisting of renewable energy production and hydrogen storage. Using\nMarkov decision process theory, we construct optimal policies for day-to-day\ndecisions on how much energy to store as hydrogen, or buy from or sell to the\nelectricity market, and on how much hydrogen to sell for use as gas.

The user only needs to provide a list with coordinates (and\ndistance) and to choose a model/map. GALExtin will then provide an output list\nwith extinction estimates. It can be implemented in any other portal or model\nthat requires interstellar extinction estimates.

As the performance\nrequirements of ML applications grow continuously, the hardware accelerators\nstart playing a central role in DNN design. This trend makes NAS even more\ncomplicated and time-consuming for most real applications. This paper proposes\nFLASH, a very fast NAS methodology that co-optimizes the DNN accuracy and\nperformance on a real hardware platform. As the main theoretical contribution,\nwe first propose the NN-Degree, an analytical metric to quantify the\ntopological characteristics of DNNs with skip connections (e.g., DenseNets,\nResNets, Wide-ResNets, and MobileNets). The newly proposed NN-Degree allows us\nto do training-free NAS within one second and build an accuracy predictor by\ntraining as few as 25 samples out of a vast search space with more than 63\nbillion configurations. Second, by performing inference on the target hardware,\nwe fine-tune and validate our analytical models to estimate the latency, area,\nand energy consumption of various DNN architectures while executing standard ML\ndatasets. Third, we construct a hierarchical algorithm based on simplicial\nhomology global optimization (SHGO) to optimize the model-architecture\nco-design process, while considering the area, latency, and energy consumption\nof the target hardware. We demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art\nNAS approaches, our proposed hierarchical SHGO-based algorithm enables more\nthan four orders of magnitude speedup (specifically, the execution time of the\nproposed algorithm is about 0.1 seconds). Finally, our experimental evaluations\nshow that FLASH is easily transferable to different hardware architectures,\nthus enabling us to do NAS on a Raspberry Pi-3B processor in less than 3\nseconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2021 23:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

Instead of an auxiliary frequency controller,\nfrequency support is provided by modifying the parametrized power versus rotor\nspeed curve, including the inertia power versus rotor speed curve and the droop\npower versus rotor speed curve. The advantage of the proposed scheme is that it\ndoes not contain any control gains and generally adapts to different wind\nspeeds. Further, the proposed scheme can work for the whole section of wind\nspeed without wind speed measurement information. The compared simulation\nresults demonstrate the scheme improves the system frequency response while\nensuring the stable operation of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs)-based\nvariable-speed wind turbines (VSWTs) under various wind conditions.\nFurthermore, the scheme prevents rotor speed overdeceleration even when the\nwind speed decreases during frequency regulation control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 01:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

In such\ncases, MTL models can use gradient-based multi-objective optimization (MOO) to\nfind one or more Pareto optimal solutions. A common requirement in MTL\napplications is to find an {\\it Exact} Pareto optimal (EPO) solution, which\nsatisfies user preferences with respect to task-specific objective functions.\nFurther, to improve model generalization, various constraints on the weights\nmay need to be enforced during training. Addressing these requirements is\nchallenging because it requires a search direction that allows descent not only\ntowards the Pareto front but also towards the input preference, within the\nconstraints imposed and in a manner that scales to high-dimensional gradients.\nWe design and theoretically analyze such search directions and develop the\nfirst scalable algorithm, with theoretical guarantees of convergence, to find\nan EPO solution, including when box and equality constraints are imposed. Our\nunique method combines multiple gradient descent with carefully controlled\nascent to traverse the Pareto front in a principled manner, making it robust to\ninitialization. This also facilitates systematic exploration of the Pareto\nfront, that we utilize to approximate the Pareto front for multi-criteria\ndecision-making. Empirical results show that our algorithm outperforms\ncompeting methods on benchmark MTL datasets and MOO problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 02:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

In such orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiple access (OFDMA) cellular systems, the inter-sector or\ninter-tower interference (ITI) makes accurate signal recovery quite challenging\nas sub-1 GHz bands only support single-input single-output (SISO) links.\nInterference-aware receiver algorithms are essential to mitigate the ITI in\nsuch low-frequency bands. Such algorithms enable ubiquitous mobile broadband\naccess over the entire homeland, say with >95% geographical coverage with\nquality of service guarantees. One element of the interference-aware signal\nrecovery is the least-squares-based joint channel estimation scheme that uses\nnon-orthogonal pilot subcarriers. This estimator is then compared with a\nvariant that uses orthogonal pilot subcarriers to bring out the advantage of\nthis joint estimator. It is shown that the proposed joint estimator requires\nfewer pilots to be well-determined when compared to its under-determined\northogonal counterpart. Moreover, it is easy to implement and does not require\nany knowledge of channel statistics. This work also derives a compensation\nfactor needed for the interference-aware detector in the presence of\ninter-carrier interference (ICI) originating from multiple transmitters.\nSimulation results show that the proposed joint channel estimator outperforms\ntraditional estimators at moderate to high frequency selectivity. The proposed\ncompensation factor to the joint detector is found to be essential for\nrecovering the transmitted signal in the absence of phase-tracking pilots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 02:14:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 06:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

Student learning data is collected from 70 online\nlearning modules assigned as both online homework and self-study material in\nboth Fall 2020 and Spring 2020 semesters, with the first 41 modules being\nassigned before campus closure in Spring 2020. Students' ability to stay on\ntrack is measured by three data indicators: percentage of modules submitted\nbefore the due date, percentage of modules submitted early for extra credit,\nand percentage of modules properly engaged with. The student population is\ndivided into two demographic groups according to each of the four demographic\nvariables: Gender, Ethnicity, Transfer Status and First generation status. All\nthree data indicators from both semesters are first compared between each pair\nof demographic groups within the same semester, and then compared within the\nsame group between the two semesters. Exam and course scores are also compared\nbetween demographics groups in Fall 2020 and against scores from the Fall 2019\nsemester. The analysis revealed that remote learning significantly reduced\non-time and early submission for first-generation students, but increased the\nfrequency of early submission for transfer students. Under-represented minority\nstudents had higher percentage of engaged modules during the pandemic, while\nnon-URM students had the same level of module engagement before and after the\npandemic. These results suggest that pandemic remote learning had very\ndifferent impact for students with different demographic background, and future\ninstructional design should strive to provide more flexible options to meet the\nvarious needs for a diverse higher-ed student population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 02:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

Pro-UIGAN iteratively (1) estimates\nfacial geometry priors for low-resolution (LR) faces and (2) acquires\nnon-occluded HR face images under the guidance of the estimated priors. Our\nmulti-stage hallucination network super-resolves and inpaints occluded LR faces\nin a coarse-to-fine manner, thus reducing unwanted blurriness and artifacts\nsignificantly.

Such a design encourages\njoint feature learning across the input facial and landmark features, and deep\nfeature correspondences will be discovered by attention. Thus, facial\nappearance features and facial geometry priors are learned in a mutual\npromotion manner.

Recently, strong\nmagneto-optical effects have been observed in magneto-optical nanophotonic\ndevices due to the electromagnetic field localization. However, most reports so\nfar have been focused on the enhancement of conventional magneto-optical\neffects. Here, we report the observation of circular displacement current\ninduced anomalous magneto-optical effects in high-index-contrast\nSi/Ce:YIG/YIG/SiO2 Mie resonators. In particular, giant modulation of light\nintensity in transverse magnetic configuration up to 6.4 % under s-polarized\nincidence appears, which is non-existent in planar magneto-optical thin films.\nApart from that, we observe a large rotation of transmitted light polarization\nin the longitudinal magnetic configuration under near normal incidence\nconditions, which is two orders of magnitude higher than for a planar\nmagneto-optical thin film. These phenomena are essentially originated from the\nunique circular displacement current when exciting the magnetic resonance modes\nin the Mie resonators, which changes the incident electric field direction\nlocally.

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel neural network solution, RINDNet, to jointly detect all four types of\nedges. Taking into consideration the distinct attributes of each type of edges\nand the relationship between them, RINDNet learns effective representations for\neach of them and works in three stages.

Additionally,\nan attention module learns attention maps for all types to capture the\nunderlying relations between them, and these maps are combined with initial\nresults to generate the final edge detection results.

Previous work has shown that\niterative algorithms are sensitive to initialization and little noise can lead\nto failure in convergence. Hence, research has focused on algebraic techniques.\nStable and efficient algebraic solvers have been proposed for some network\nconfigurations, but they do not work for smaller networks. In this paper, we\nuse homotopy continuation to solve four previously unsolved configurations in\n2D TDOA self-calibration, including a minimal one. As a theoretical\ncontribution, we investigate the number of solutions of the new minimal\nconfiguration, showing this is much lower than previous estimates.

The second\nproperty, called {\\em heterogeneously quantitative nonblockingness},\ndistinguishes individual marker states and requires that each marker state be\nreached within a given bounded number of steps from any other state and\nfollowing any trajectory of the system. Accordingly, we formulate two new\nproblems of quantitatively nonblocking supervisory control and heterogeneously\nquantitatively nonblocking supervisory control, and characterize their\nsolvabilities in terms of new concepts of quantitative language completability\nand heterogeneously quantitative language completability, respectively.

In\nparticular, the total entropy production has a lower bound corresponding to the\npositive quantity that emerges when the internal correlations of the controlled\ntarget diminish, but the correlations between the agent and target do not\nexist. Therefore, the information about the target is indispensable for\nexploiting the internal correlations to extract free energy or work.\nFurthermore, as the internal correlations can grow linearly with the number of\nthe subsystems constituting the target system, control with such correlations,\ni.e., feedback control, can yield substantial gain that exceeds the operational\ncost of performing feedback control, which is negligible in the thermodynamic\nlimit. Thus, the generalized second law presented in this paper can be\ninterpreted as a physical principle that ensures the benefit and inevitability\nof information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 09:22:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 07:37:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 06:04:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 22:02:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2023 00:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

Conventional mobile robots rely on scene recognition\nmethods that consider only the geometric information of the environment. Those\nmethods, therefore, cannot recognize paths as traversable when they are covered\nby flexible plants. In this paper, we present a novel framework of image-based\nscene recognition to realize navigation in such plant-rich environments. Our\nrecognition model exploits a semantic segmentation branch for general object\nclassification and a traversability estimation branch for estimating pixel-wise\ntraversability. The semantic segmentation branch is trained using an\nunsupervised domain adaptation method and the traversability estimation branch\nis trained with label images generated from the robot's traversal experience\nduring the data acquisition phase, coined traversability masks. The training\nprocedure of the entire model is, therefore, free from manual annotation.

We aim to investigate the effects of clumping on atmospheric structure\nfor the special case of a static, spherically symmetric atmosphere assuming\nmicroclumping and a 1-D geometry.\n  Methods. Static, spherically symmetric, non-LTE (local thermodynamic\nequilibrium) model atmospheres were calculated using the recent version of our\ncode, which includes optically thin clumping. The matter is assumed to consist\nof dense clumps and a void interclump medium. Clumping is considered by means\nof clumping and volume filling factors, assuming all clumps are optically thin.\nEnhanced opacity and emissivity in clumps is multiplied by a volume filling\nfactor to obtain their mean values. These mean values are used in the radiative\ntransfer equation. Equations of kinetic equilibrium and the thermal balance\nequation use clump values of densities. Equations of hydrostatic and radiative\nequilibrium use mean values of densities.\n  Results. The atmospheric structure was calculated for selected stellar\nparameters. Moderate differences were found in temperature structure. However,\nclumping causes enhanced continuum radiation for the Lyman-line spectral\nregion, while radiation in other parts of the spectrum is lower, depending on\nthe adopted model. The atomic level departure coefficients are influenced by\nclumping as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 10:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

In several applications, such as community detection, topic\nmodeling and Gaussian mixture learning, one must estimate a low-rank signal\nfrom a noisy tensor. Hence, understanding the fundamental limits of estimators\nof that signal inevitably calls for the study of random tensors. Substantial\nprogress has been recently achieved on this subject in the large-dimensional\nlimit. Yet, some of the most significant among these results--in particular, a\nprecise characterization of the abrupt phase transition (with respect to\nsignal-to-noise ratio) that governs the performance of the maximum likelihood\n(ML) estimator of a symmetric rank-one model with Gaussian noise--were derived\nbased of mean-field spin glass theory, which is not easily accessible to\nnon-experts. In this work, we develop a sharply distinct and more elementary\napproach, relying on standard but powerful tools brought by years of advances\nin random matrix theory. The key idea is to study the spectra of random\nmatrices arising from contractions of a given random tensor. We show how this\ngives access to spectral properties of the random tensor itself. For the\naforementioned rank-one model, our technique yields a hitherto unknown\nfixed-point equation whose solution precisely matches the asymptotic\nperformance of the ML estimator above the phase transition threshold in the\nthird-order case. A numerical verification provides evidence that the same\nholds for orders 4 and 5, leading us to conjecture that, for any order, our\nfixed-point equation is equivalent to the known characterization of the ML\nestimation performance that had been obtained by relying on spin glasses.\nMoreover, our approach sheds light on certain properties of the ML problem\nlandscape in large dimensions and can be extended to other models, such as\nasymmetric and non-Gaussian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 10:42:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 14:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

As an effective framework\nto quantify the prediction reliability, conformal prediction (CP) was developed\nwith the CPKNN (CP with kNN). However, the conventional CPKNN suffers from high\nvariance and bias and long computational time as the feature dimensionality\nincreases. To address these limitations, a new CP framework-conformal\nprediction with shrunken centroids (CPSC) is proposed. It regularizes the class\ncentroids to attenuate the irrelevant features and shrink the sample space for\npredictions and reliability quantification. To compare CPKNN and CPSC, we\nemployed them in the classification of 12 categories of alternative herbal\nmedicine with electronic nose as a case and assessed them in two tasks: 1)\noffline prediction: the training set was fixed and the accuracy on the testing\nset was evaluated; 2) online prediction with data augmentation: they filtered\nunlabeled data to augment the training data based on the prediction reliability\nand the final accuracy of testing set was compared.

We formulate simple analytical\nestimates, which indicate when the repulsion mechanism is effective. One\ncondition for a planet to be repelled is that it forms a partial gap in the\ndisk and another is that this should contain enough material to support angular\nmomentum exchange with it.

This avoids some of the challenges with h-adaptivity (adding\nand removing points): the solution does not need to be mapped between meshes,\nwhich can be expensive and introduces errors, and there are no load balancing\nproblems on parallel computers. A long standing problem with both forms of\nadaptivity has been changes in volume of the domain as resolution changes at an\nuneven boundary.

Our proposed multi-modal training framework for cross-modal knowledge\ntransfer relies on two main steps.

In this paper, we propose a simple but effective Shallow\nfeature-aware Pseudo supervised Object Localization (SPOL) model for accurate\nWSOL, which makes the utmost of low-level features embedded in shallow layers.\nIn practice, our SPOL model first generates the CAMs through a novel\nelement-wise multiplication of shallow and deep feature maps, which filters the\nbackground noise and generates sharper boundaries robustly. Besides, we further\npropose a general class-agnostic segmentation model to achieve the accurate\nobject mask, by only using the initial CAMs as the pseudo label without any\nextra annotation.

A\nchallenge faced in the practical adoption of this learning approach is that\nunder changing channel conditions (e.g. a wireless link), it requires frequent\nretraining of the autoencoder in order to maintain a low decoding error rate.\nSince retraining is both time consuming and requires a large number of samples,\nit becomes impractical when the channel distribution is changing quickly. We\npropose to address this problem using a fast and sample-efficient (few-shot)\ndomain adaptation method that does not change the encoder and decoder networks.\nDifferent from conventional training-time unsupervised or semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation, here we have a trained autoencoder from a source\ndistribution that we want to adapt (at test time) to a target distribution\nusing only a small labeled dataset, and no unlabeled data. We focus on a\ngenerative channel model based on the Gaussian mixture density network (MDN),\nand propose a regularized, parameter-efficient adaptation of the MDN using a\nset of affine transformations. The learned affine transformations are then used\nto design an optimal transformation at the decoder input to compensate for the\ndistribution shift, and effectively present to the decoder inputs close to the\nsource distribution. Experiments on many simulated distribution changes common\nto the wireless setting, and a real mmWave FPGA testbed demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method at adaptation using very few target domain samples.\nThe code for our work can be found at:\nhttps://github.com/jayaram-r/domain-adaptation-autoencoder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 13:18:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 00:19:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 14:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Whilst the approach to\nthreshold setting is metric agnostic, we show how the cost of using the popular\nquadratic time MMD estimator can be reduced from $O(N^2B)$ to $O(N^2+NB)$\nduring configuration and from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ during operation, where $N$\nand $B$ are the numbers of reference and bootstrap samples respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 13:36:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 14:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

In this work, we introduce the basis for the implementation of\nthe smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) approach to analyze heat transfer in\na nuclear reactor core. Heat transfer by means of convection is of great\nimportance in many engineering applications and especially in the analysis of\nheat transfer in nuclear reactors. As a first approach, the natural convection\nin the gap (space that exists between the fuel rod and the cladding) can be\nanalyzed helping to reduce uncertainty in such calculations that usually relies\non empirical correlations while using other numerical tools. The numerical\nmethod developed in this work was validated while comparing the results\nobtained in previous numerical simulations and experimental data reported in\nthe literature showing that our implementation is suitable for the study of\nheat transfer in nuclear reactors. Numerical simulations were done with the\nDualSPHysics open source code that allows performing parallel calculations\nusing different numbers of cores. The current implementation is a version\nwritten in CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) that allows also the use\nof GPU processors (Graphics Processor Unit) to accelerate the calculations in\nparallel using a large number of cores contained in the GPU. This makes it\npossible to analyze large systems using a reasonable computer time.

In contrast to existing data augmentation techniques only\nmodifying the speaking rate or overall shape of spectral contour, fine-grained\nspectro-temporal differences between disordered and normal speech are modelled\nusing deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) during data\naugmentation to modify normal speech spectra into those closer to disordered\nspeech.

Conjunctive query answering (QA) over the WS\nprograms has been investigated, and its tractability in data complexity has\nbeen established. However, the design and implementation of practical QA\nalgorithms and their optimizations have been open. In order to fill this gap,\nwe first study Sticky and WS programs from the point of view of the behavior of\nthe chase procedure. We extend the stickiness property of the chase to that of\ngeneralized stickiness of the chase (GSCh) modulo an oracle that selects (and\nprovides) the predicate positions where finitely values appear during the\nchase. Stickiness modulo a selection function S that provides only a subset of\nthose positions defines sch(S), a semantic subclass of GSCh. Program classes\nwith selection functions include Sticky and WS, and another syntactic class\nthat we introduce and characterize, namely JWS, of jointly-weakly-sticky\nprograms, which contains WS. The selection functions for these last three\nclasses are computable, and no external, possibly non-computable oracle is\nneeded. We propose a bottom-up QA algorithm for programs in the class sch(S),\nfor a general selection function S. As a particular case, we obtain a\npolynomial-time QA algorithm for JWS and weakly-sticky programs. Unlike WS, JWS\nturns out to be closed under magic-sets query optimization. As a consequence,\nboth the generic polynomial-time QA algorithm and its magic-set optimization\ncan be particularized and applied to WS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 13:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 02:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

Thus, infrared cameras are often\nleveraged to help enhance the visual effects via detecting infrared radiation\nin the surrounding environment, but the infrared videos are undesirable due to\nthe lack of detailed semantic information. In such a case, an effective\nvideo-to-video translation method from the infrared domain to the visible light\ncounterpart is strongly needed by overcoming the intrinsic huge gap between\ninfrared and visible fields. To address this challenging problem, we propose an\ninfrared-to-visible (I2V) video translation method I2V-GAN to generate\nfine-grained and spatial-temporal consistent visible light videos by given\nunpaired infrared videos. Technically, our model capitalizes on three types of\nconstraints: 1)adversarial constraint to generate synthetic frames that are\nsimilar to the real ones, 2)cyclic consistency with the introduced perceptual\nloss for effective content conversion as well as style preservation, and\n3)similarity constraints across and within domains to enhance the content and\nmotion consistency in both spatial and temporal spaces at a fine-grained level.\nFurthermore, the current public available infrared and visible light datasets\nare mainly used for object detection or tracking, and some are composed of\ndiscontinuous images which are not suitable for video tasks. Thus, we provide a\nnew dataset for I2V video translation, which is named IRVI. Specifically, it\nhas 12 consecutive video clips of vehicle and monitoring scenes, and both\ninfrared and visible light videos could be apart into 24352 frames.\nComprehensive experiments validate that I2V-GAN is superior to the compared\nSOTA methods in the translation of I2V videos with higher fluency and finer\nsemantic details.

This problem\nhas been studied in the literature for various special cases of the cost\nfunction $f$, and in a general setting for a submodular or supermodular cost\n$f$ [ITT2012].

We show that the most special cases of our\nproblem, graphic matroid MLOP and minimum latency vertex cover, are both\nNP-hard.\n  We further expand the toolkit for approximating MLOP variants: using the\ntheory of principal partitions, we show a $2-\\frac{1+\\ell_{f}}{1+|E|}$\napproximation to monotone submodular MLOP, where\n$\\ell_{f}=\\frac{f(E)}{\\max_{x\\in E}f(\\{x\\})}$ satisfies $1 \\leq \\ell_f \\leq\n|E|$.

This is possible due\nto the cancellation of cross terms in the nonlinear coupling. First, we show\nthat a {\\it composite} solution which is a linear combination of the two\ncomponents of a {\\it seed} solution is another solution to the same coupled\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. Then, we show that a linear combination of\ntwo composite solutions is also a solution to the same equation. With emphasis\non the case of Manakov system of two-coupled nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations,\nthe superposition is shown to be equivalent to a rotation operator in a\ntwo-dimensional function space with components of the seed solution being its\ncoordinates. Repeated application of the rotation operator, starting with a\nspecific seed solution, generates a series of composite solutions which may be\nrepresented by a generalized solution that defines a family of composite\nsolutions. Applying the rotation operator to almost all known exact seed\nsolutions of the Manakov system, we obtain for each seed solution the\ncorresponding family of composite solutions.

There are two critical\ncomponents in the common paradigm of modern recommender models: (1)\nrepresentation learning, which generates an embedding for each user and item;\nand (2) interaction modeling, which fits user preferences towards items based\non their representations. In spite of great success, when a great amount of\nusers and items exist, it usually needs to create, store, and optimize a huge\nembedding table, where the scale of model parameters easily reach millions or\neven larger. Hence, it naturally raises questions about the heavy recommender\nmodels: Do we really need such large-scale parameters? We get inspirations from\nthe recently proposed lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH), which argues that the\ndense and over-parameterized model contains a much smaller and sparser\nsub-model that can reach comparable performance to the full model. In this\npaper, we extend LTH to media recommender systems, aiming to find the winning\ntickets in deep recommender models.

Therefore, there\nhave been several proposals to underapproximate their sets of runs so that\nreachability in this underapproximation becomes decidable. One such\nunderapproximation that covers a relatively high portion of runs is scope\nboundedness. In such a run, after each push to stack $i$, the corresponding pop\noperation must come within a bounded number of visits to stack $i$. In this\nwork, we generalize this approach to a large class of infinite-state systems.\n  For this, we consider the model of valence systems, which consist of a\nfinite-state control and an infinite-state storage mechanism that is specified\nby a finite undirected graph. This framework captures pushdowns, vector\naddition systems, integer vector addition systems, and combinations thereof.\nFor this framework, we propose a notion of scope boundedness that coincides\nwith the classical notion when the storage mechanism happens to be a\nmulti-pushdown. We show that with this notion, reachability can be decided in\nPSPACE for every storage mechanism in the framework. Moreover, we describe the\nfull complexity landscape of this problem across all storage mechanisms, both\nin the case of (i) the scope bound being given as input and (ii) for fixed\nscope bounds.\n  Finally, we provide an almost complete description of the complexity\nlandscape if even a description of the storage mechanism is part of the input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 15:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

The key\ningredients to our approach are -- (a) mapping the source to the target domain\non pixel-level; (b) training a teacher network on the mapped source and the\nunannotated target domain using adversarial feature alignment; and (c) finally\ntraining a student network using the pseudo-labels obtained from the teacher.\nExperimentally, when tested on challenging scenarios involving domain shift, we\nconsistently obtain significantly large performance gains over various recent\nstate of the art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 15:24:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2021 14:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

We study the conditions\nrequired to form and preserve flotation crusts and basal cumulates, and the\nimplications for the thermal evolution of planetesimals. We calculate the\ntemperature evolution in an early accreted planetesimals internally heated by\nthe decay of $\\rm{^{26}Al}$ and $\\rm{^{60}Fe}$. For planetesimal with radius\n$R>30\\, \\rm{km}$, partial melting reaches 40%, planetesimals undergo a\nrheological transition and form a magma ocean, i.e.: a suspension from which\ncrystals can segregate and form a floating crust and/or a dense cumulate.\nBecause of the formation of an insulation floating crust, this magma ocean\nepisode is characterized by a relatively long time life, a slow cooling rate,\nand a weak surface heat flux. The model further predicts a cyclic evolution\nwhere episodes of crustal thickening alternate with episodes of melting-induced\ncrustal thinning. These cycles produce in turn an oscillating thermal history\nand prevent runaway thermal heating of the planetesimals. At the end of the\nmagma ocean episode, when the fraction of crystals becomes larger than 60\\%, a\ntransition occurs to solid-state convection in the planetesimal's mantle. This\nstage is characterized by high viscous shear stress that tends to erode\npreviously formed crystal deposits. However, the time scale of this erosion\nprocess is larger that the lifetime of the planetesimal. Hence solid-state\nevolution can be described by a well mixed mantle embedded by a metastable\ncrust and a preserved cumulate at its base.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 15:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

Next, we propose that\nexisting, powerful, computer-based steganography (CS) approaches can be adopted\nwith little effort in new contexts (SARs), while also pointing out potential\nbenefits of human-like steganography (HS): although less efficient and robust\nthan CS, HS represents a currently-unused form of RS that could also be used to\navoid requiring computers or detection by more technically advanced\nadversaries.

The\ncharging request by the human-driven EV becomes irrational when it demands more\nenergy and charging period than its actual need. Therefore, the scheduling\npolicy of each EVSE must be adaptively accumulated the irrational charging\nrequest to satisfy the charging demand of both CVs and AVs. To tackle this, we\nformulate an RDSS problem for the DSO, where the objective is to maximize the\ncharging capacity utilization by satisfying the laxity risk of the DSO. Thus,\nwe devise a rational reward maximization problem to adapt the irrational\nbehavior by CVs in a data-informed manner. We propose a novel risk adversarial\nmulti-agent learning system (RAMALS) for CAV-CI to solve the formulated RDSS\nproblem. In RAMALS, the DSO acts as a centralized risk adversarial agent (RAA)\nfor informing the laxity risk to each EVSE. Subsequently, each EVSE plays the\nrole of a self-learner agent to adaptively schedule its own EV sessions by\ncoping advice from RAA. Experiment results show that the proposed RAMALS\naffords around 46.6% improvement in charging rate, about 28.6% improvement in\nthe EVSE's active charging time and at least 33.3% more energy utilization, as\ncompared to a currently deployed ACN EVSE system, and other baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 02:38:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 11:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

Such an interplay has proved to be critical in\nBayesian inference under Gaussian SP priors, kernel regression for infinitely\nwide deep NNs trained via gradient descent, and information propagation within\ninfinitely wide NNs. Motivated by empirical analyses that show the potential of\nreplacing Gaussian distributions with Stable distributions for the NN's\nweights, in this paper we present a rigorous analysis of the large-width\nasymptotic behaviour of (fully connected) feed-forward deep Stable NNs, i.e.\ndeep NNs with Stable-distributed weights.

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased\nstress levels among people across the globe. Therefore, continuous monitoring\nand detection of stress are necessary. The recent advances in wearable devices\nhave allowed the monitoring of several physiological signals related to stress.\nAmong them, wrist-worn wearable devices like smartwatches are most popular due\nto their convenient usage. And the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is the\nmost prevalent sensor in almost all consumer-grade wrist-worn smartwatches.\nTherefore, this paper focuses on using a wrist-based PPG sensor that collects\nBlood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals to detect stress which may be applicable for\nconsumer-grade wristwatches. Moreover, state-of-the-art works have used either\nclassical machine learning algorithms to detect stress using hand-crafted\nfeatures or have used deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) which automatically extracts features. This paper proposes a\nnovel hybrid CNN (H-CNN) classifier that uses both the hand-crafted features\nand the automatically extracted features by CNN to detect stress using the BVP\nsignal. Evaluation on the benchmark WESAD dataset shows that, for 3-class\nclassification (Baseline vs. Stress vs. Amusement), our proposed H-CNN\noutperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 5% and 7% accuracy, and\n10% and 7% macro F1 score, respectively. Also for 2-class classification\n(Stress vs. Non-stress), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers\nand normal CNN by 3% and ~5% accuracy, and ~3% and ~7% macro F1 score,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 04:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-09"}

As far as the constant bias is concerned, in the Li\\'enard system,\nthe suppression occurs due to the decrease in large amplitude oscillations and\nin the non-polynomial mechanical system the suppression occurs due to the\ndestruction of chaos into a periodic orbit. As far as the second periodic\nforcing is concerned, in both the examples, extreme events get suppressed due\nto the increase in large amplitude oscillations. We also demonstrate that by\nintroducing a phase in the second periodic forcing one can decrease the\nprobability of occurrence of extreme events even further in the non-polynomial\nsystem. To provide a support to the complete suppression of extreme events, we\npresent the two parameter probability plot for all the cases.
