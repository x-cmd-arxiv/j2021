The similarities among the symptoms of these diseases precludes prompt\ndiagnosis upon the patients' arrival. In pediatrics, the patients' limited\nability in expressing their situation makes precise diagnosis even harder. This\nbecomes worse in primary hospitals, where the lack of medical imaging devices\nand the doctors' limited experience further increase the difficulty of\ndistinguishing among similar diseases. In this paper, a pediatric fine-grained\ndiagnosis-assistant system is proposed to provide prompt and precise diagnosis\nusing solely clinical notes upon admission, which would assist clinicians\nwithout changing the diagnostic process. The proposed system consists of two\nstages: a test result structuralization stage and a disease identification\nstage. The first stage structuralizes test results by extracting relevant\nnumerical values from clinical notes, and the disease identification stage\nprovides a diagnosis based on text-form clinical notes and the structured data\nobtained from the first stage. A novel deep learning algorithm was developed\nfor the disease identification stage, where techniques including adaptive\nfeature infusion and multi-modal attentive fusion were introduced to fuse\nstructured and text data together. Clinical notes from over 12000 patients with\nrespiratory diseases were used to train a deep learning model, and clinical\nnotes from a non-overlapping set of about 1800 patients were used to evaluate\nthe performance of the trained model. The average precisions (AP) for\npneumonia, RTI, bronchitis and asthma are 0.878, 0.857, 0.714, and 0.825,\nrespectively, achieving a mean AP (mAP) of 0.819.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 16:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

The emergence of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite systems has been\nseen as a potential solution for connecting remote areas. Despite the hype\naround these new technologies, we still lack an open-source modeling framework\nfor assessing the techno-economics of satellite broadband connectivity which is\ntherefore the purpose of this paper. Firstly, a generalizable techno-economic\nmodel is presented to assess the engineering-economics of satellite\nconstellations. Secondly, the approach is applied to assess the three main\ncompeting LEO constellations which include Starlink, OneWeb and Kuiper. This\ninvolves simulating the impact on coverage, capacity and cost as both the\nnumber of satellites and quantity of subscribers increases. Finally, a global\nassessment is undertaken visualizing the potential capacity and cost per user\nvia different subscriber scenarios. The results demonstrate how limited the\ncapacity will be once resources are spread across users in each satellite\ncoverage area. For example, if there is 1 user per 10 km^2 we estimate a mean\nper user capacity of 24.94 Mbps, 1.01 Mbps and 10.30 Mbps for Starlink, OneWeb\nand Kuiper respectively in the busiest hour of the day. But if the subscriber\ndensity increases to 1 user per km^2, then the mean per user capacity drops\nsignificantly to 2.49 Mbps, 0.10 Mbps and 1.02 Mbps for Starlink, OneWeb and\nKuiper respectively. LEO broadband will be an essential part of the\nconnectivity toolkit, but the results reveal that these mega-constellations\nwill most likely have to operate below 0.1 users per km^2 to provide a service\nthat outcompetes other broadband connectivity options. The open-source codebase\nwhich the paper contributes is provided with the hope that other engineers will\naccess, use, and further develop the satellite assessment capability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 16:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

To capture this threshold, it is critical to consider the spatial\nheterogeneity in the distributions of the infected and uninfected mosquitoes,\nwhich is created by the local release of the infected mosquitoes. We develop\nand analyze partial differential equation (PDE) models to study the invasion\ndynamics of Wolbachia infection among mosquitoes in the field.

By virtue of a gauge invariance principle,\nestablished by Marcolongo, Umari, and Baroni, the two approaches should be\nequivalent if the PES were reproduced accurately by the DNN model. We test this\nhypothesis by calculating the thermal conductivity, at the GGA (PBE) level of\ntheory, using the direct formulation and its DNN proxy, finding that both\napproaches yield the same conductivity, in excess of the experimental value by\napproximately 60%.

(2015) regarding\nskeleton-diagrammatic perturbation series expansion of $\\Sigma$. In doing so,\nwe make a number of observations of general interest. Chief amongst these, we\nobserve that contrary to general belief thermal correlation functions\ncalculated in the energy domain (i.e. over the set of the relevant Matsubara\nfrequencies) are generally unreliable, in contrast to those calculated in the\nimaginary-time domain. In an appendix we present a symbolic computational\nformalism and short programs for singling out topologically distinct proper\nself-energy diagrams that are algebraically equivalent up to determinate\nmultiplicative constants. This complements the work presented in our previous\npublication (2019). [Abridged abstract]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 18:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

The\ndissipation is represented by a bulk viscosity with a constant coefficient,\nwhereas shear viscosity is excluded due to the isotropy of the universe. We\nperformed a likelihood analysis using recent observational datasets from local\n$H_0$ measurements, SNe Ia, observational Hubble data, BAO, and CMB to put\ncosmological constraints on the model.

Here we present a\nlarge-area photonic lift-off (PLO) process to rapidly separate polymer films\nfrom rigid carriers. PLO uses a 150 microsecond pulse of broadband light from\nflashlamps to lift off functional thin films from a glass carrier substrate\ncoated with a light-absorber layer (LAL). A 3D finite element model indicates\nthat the polymer/LAL interface reaches 865 degrees C during PLO, but the top\nsurface of the PI reaches only 118 degrees C. To demonstrate the feasibility of\nthis process in the production of flexible electronics, an array of indium zinc\noxide (IZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) was fabricated on a polyimide\nsubstrate and then photonically lifted off from the glass carrier. The TFT\nmobility was 3.15 cm2V-1s-1 before and after PLO, indicating no significant\nchange during PLO. The flexible TFTs were mechanically robust, with no\nreduction in mobility while bent.

The established correction scheme does not translate to 7T since\nit requires a body coil reference. Here we introduce two alternatives that\noutperform the established method. Since they compute relative sensitivities\nthey do not require body coil images.\n  Theory: The proposed methods use coil-combined magnitude images to obtain the\nrelative coil sensitivities. The first method efficiently computes the relative\nsensitivities via a simple ratio; the second by fitting a more sophisticated\ngenerative model.\n  Methods: $R_1$ maps were computed using the variable flip angle (VFA)\napproach. Multiple datasets were acquired at 3T and 7T, with and without motion\nbetween the acquisition of the VFA volumes. $R_1$ maps were constructed without\ncorrection, with the proposed corrections, and (at 3T) with the previously\nestablished correction scheme.\n  Results: At 3T, the proposed methods outperform the baseline method.\nInter-scan motion artefacts were also reduced at 7T.

Furthermore, there are\nseveral factors, including driving behavior and driving environment, affecting\nthe perception of comfort. Automatically extracting the perceived comfort level\nof a commuter due to the impact of the driving behavior is crucial for a timely\nfeedback to the drivers, which can help them to meet the commuter's\nsatisfaction. In light of this, we surveyed around 200 commuters who usually\ntake such cab rides and obtained a set of features that impact comfort during\ncab rides. Following this, we develop a system Ridergo which collects\nsmartphone sensor data from a commuter, extracts the spatial time series\nfeature from the data, and then computes the level of commuter comfort on a\nfive-point scale with respect to the driving. Ridergo uses a Hierarchical\nTemporal Memory model-based approach to observe anomalies in the feature\ndistribution and then trains a Multi-task learning-based neural network model\nto obtain the comfort level of the commuter at a personalized level. The model\nalso intelligently queries the commuter to add new data points to the available\ndataset and, in turn, improve itself over periodic training.

Such working points are associated with\nlarge quantum coherence and multipartite quantum correlations within the state\nof the system. This suggests that the optimal operating regime of such quantum\nautonomous motor is one of maximal quantumness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 21:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

On the other hand,\nexisting QAs with few thousand of qubits have the potential to solve some\ndomain-specific optimization problems. QAs are single instruction machines and\nto execute a program, the problem is cast to a Hamiltonian, embedded on the\nhardware, and a single quantum machine instruction (QMI) is run. Unfortunately,\nnoise and imperfections in hardware result in sub-optimal solutions on QAs even\nif the QMI is run for thousands of trials.\n  The limited programmability of QAs mean that the user executes the same QMI\nfor all trials. This subjects all trials to a similar noise profile throughout\nthe execution, resulting in a systematic bias. We observe that systematic bias\nleads to sub-optimal solutions and cannot be alleviated by executing more\ntrials or using existing error-mitigation schemes. To address this challenge,\nwe propose EQUAL (Ensemble Quantum Annealing). EQUAL generates an ensemble of\nQMIs by adding controlled perturbations to the program QMI. When executed on\nthe QA, the ensemble of QMIs steers the program away from encountering the same\nbias during all trials and thus, improves the quality of solutions. Our\nevaluations using the 2041-qubit D-Wave QA show that EQUAL bridges the\ndifference between the baseline and the ideal by an average of 14% (and up to\n26%), without requiring any additional trials. EQUAL can be combined with\nexisting error mitigation schemes to further bridge the difference between the\nbaseline and ideal by an average of 55% (and up to 68%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 21:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

We\nintroduce small-scale flux ropes representative of those formed during a\ntearing instability in the current layer, and use the squashing factor on the\nsolar surface to identify the shape of the presumed flare ribbons and fine\nstructure. Our analysis suggests there is a direct link between flare-ribbon\nfine structure and flare current sheet tearing, with the majority of the ribbon\nfine structure related to oblique tearing modes. Depending upon the size,\nlocation and twist of the small-scale flux ropes, breaking wave-like and spiral\nfeatures within the hooks and straight sections of the flare ribbon can be\nformed that are qualitatively similar to observations.

A\nsimilar effect occurs in thicker Pt/Co/NixCu1-x structures when the Ni layer is\nalloyed with Cu. At this transition in domain morphology, skyrmion phases are\nstabilized when a small (< 1 mT) perpendicular magnetic field is applied and\ncurrent-induced skyrmion motion including the skyrmion Hall effect is observed.\nThe temperature and thickness-induced morphological phase transitions observed\nare similar to the well-studied spin reorientation transition that occurs in\nthe ultrathin limit, but we find that the underlying energy balances are\nsubstantially modified by the presence of an iDMI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 22:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

In addition, we demonstrate that NeRP is a general\nmethodology that generalizes to different imaging modalities such as CT and\nMRI. We also show that NeRP can robustly capture the subtle yet significant\nimage changes required for assessing tumor progression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 23:19:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 23:24:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

We define a PR as refactoring-inducing, when refactoring edits are\nperformed after the initial commit(s), as either a result of discussion among\nreviewers or spontaneous actions carried out by the PR developer. Aims: This\nmixed study (quantitative and qualitative) explores code reviewing-related\naspects intending to characterize refactoring-inducing PRs.

Although several works have studied\ntheoretical and numerical properties of sparse neural architectures, they have\nprimarily focused on the edge selection. Sparsity through edge selection might\nbe intuitively appealing; however, it does not necessarily reduce the\nstructural complexity of a network. Instead pruning excessive nodes leads to a\nstructurally sparse network with significant computational speedup during\ninference. To this end, we propose a Bayesian sparse solution using\nspike-and-slab Gaussian priors to allow for automatic node selection during\ntraining. The use of spike-and-slab prior alleviates the need of an ad-hoc\nthresholding rule for pruning.

We also determine that the derived c(Hb)\nconsists both of the ISM and circumsource components and that the ionized\ngas-to-dust mass ratio in the main ring is at least 437 and as high as about\n1600. We find that, unless we deliberately seek self-consistency, uncertainties\nat tens of per cent can easily arise in outcomes, making it impossible to\ndiscern actual spatial variations that occurs at the same level, defeating the\npurpose of conducting spatially resolved spectroscopic observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 01:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

In this\nwork, we aim to estimate the fraction of false positives that are unable to be\nclassified by Kepler alone but can be identified with their color-dependent\ndepth feature if a reference band (z, Ks and TESS) were adopted in follow-up\nobservation.

In this article, we\naddress this gap by investigating methods for integrating PRF signals into\nrerankers and dense retrievers based on deep language models. We consider\ntext-based and vector-based PRF approaches, and investigate different ways of\ncombining and scoring relevance signals. An extensive empirical evaluation was\nconducted across four different datasets and two task settings (retrieval and\nranking). Text-based PRF results show that the use of PRF had a mixed effect on\ndeep rerankers across different datasets. We found that the best effectiveness\nwas achieved when (i) directly concatenating each PRF passage with the query,\nsearching with the new set of queries, and then aggregating the scores; (ii)\nusing Borda to aggregate scores from PRF runs. Vector-based PRF results show\nthat the use of PRF enhanced the effectiveness of deep rerankers and dense\nretrievers over several evaluation metrics. We found that higher effectiveness\nwas achieved when (i) the query retains either the majority or the same weight\nwithin the PRF mechanism, and (ii) a shallower PRF signal (i.e., a smaller\nnumber of top-ranked passages) was employed, rather than a deeper signal.

Caused by the sophisticated interactions between foulant and\nmembrane surface, fouling strongly depends on membrane surface chemistry and\nmorphology. Current studies in the field have been largely focused on polymer\nmembranes. Herein, we report a molecular simulation study for fouling on\nalumina and graphene membrane surfaces during water treatment. For two foulants\n(sucralose and bisphenol A), the fouling on alumina surfaces is reduced with\nincreasing surface roughness; however, the fouling on graphene surfaces is\nenhanced by roughness. It is unravelled that the foulant-surface interaction\nbecomes weaker in the ridge region of a rough alumina surface, thus allowing\nfoulant to leave the surface and reducing fouling. Such behavior is not\nobserved on a rough graphene surface because of the strong foulant-graphene\ninteraction. Moreover, with increasing roughness, the hydrogen bonds formed\nbetween water and alumina surfaces are found to increase in number as well as\nstability. By scaling the atomic charges of alumina, fouling behavior on\nalumina surfaces is shifted to the one on graphene surfaces. This simulation\nstudy reveals that surface chemistry and roughness play a crucial role in\nmembrane fouling, and the microscopic insights are useful for the design of new\nmembranes towards high-performance water treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 06:32:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2021 12:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

This study assessed 23 sustainable biosorbents\nclassified as tannin-rich, lignin-rich, chitosan/chitin, dead biomass,\nmacroalgae or biochar for their Cu adsorption capacity and selectivity in a\ncomplex NH3-bearing bioleachate. Under a preliminary screen with 12 mM Cu in 1\nM ammoniacal solution, most biosorbents showed optimal Cu adsorption at pH 11,\nwith pinecone remarkably showing high removal efficiencies (up to 68%) at all\ntested pH values. Further refinements on select biosorbents with pH, contact\ntime, and presence of NH3, Zn and CO32- showed again that pinecone has a high\nmaximum adsorption capacity (1.07 mmol g-1), worked over pH 5-12 and was\nCu-selective with 3.97 selectivity quotient (KCu/Zn). Importantly, pinecone\nperformance was maintained in a real Cu/NH3/Zn/CO32- bioleachate, with 69.4% Cu\nremoval efficiency. Unlike synthetic adsorbents, pinecones require no\npre-treatment, which together with its abundance, selectivity, and efficiency\nwithout the need for prior NH3 removal, makes it a competitive and sustainable\nCu biosorbent for complex Cu-NH3 bearing streams. Overall, this study\ndemonstrated the potential of integrating bioleaching and biosorption as a\nclean Cu recovery technology utilizing only sustainable resources (i.e.,\nbio-lixiviant and biosorbents). This presents a closed-loop approach to Cu\nextraction and recovery from wastes, thus effectively addressing elemental\nsustainability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

There have been some recent\nattempts to tackle, on one side, the problem of learning from noisy labels and,\non the other side, learning from long-tailed data. Each group of methods make\nsimplifying assumptions about the other. Due to this separation, the proposed\nsolutions often underperform when both assumptions are violated. In this work,\nwe present a simple two-stage approach based on recent advances in\nself-supervised learning to treat both challenges simultaneously.

In particle simulations, this is mainly due to the\nmigration of particles between processing elements, which eventually gather\nunevenly and create workload imbalance. Dynamic load balancing is used at\nvarious iterations to mitigate load imbalance, employing a partitioning method\nto divide the computational space evenly while minimizing communications. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel partitioning methodology called ``informed\npartitioning''. It uses information based on the evolution of the computation\nto reduce the load balancing growth and the number of load balancing calls. We\nillustrate informed partitioning by proposing a new geometric partitioning\ntechnique for particles simulations. This technique is derived from the\nwell-known recursive coordinate bisection and employs the velocity of the\nparticles to guide the bisection axis. To properly compare the performance of\nour new method with existing partitioning techniques during application\nexecution, we introduce an effort metric based on a theoretical model of load\nbalanced parallel application time. We propose a proof-of-concept of informed\npartitioning, through a numerical study, on three N-Body simulations with\nvarious particle dynamics, and we discuss its performance against popular\ngeometric partitioning techniques. Moreover, we show that our effort metric can\nbe used to rank partitioning techniques by their efficiency at any time point\nduring the simulation. Eventually, this could be used to choose the best\npartitioning on the fly. In the numerical study, we report that our novel\nconcept increases the performance of two experiments out of three by up to 76%\nand 15%, while being marginally slower by only $3\\%$ in one experiment. Also,\nwe discuss the limitations of our implementation of informed partitioning and\nour effort metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

Then,\nthe S-boxes of the second round were attacked to obtain remaining the master\nkey bits. The results confirmed that the key is ultimately obtained. With the\nlow volume of computational complexity, we obtained the Midori block cipher\nkey, which was considered secure, just by using 300 samples of the plaintext.\nFollowing the running of Midori64 on the AVR microcontroller of the Atmega32\nmodel, the master key of Midori block cipher is discovered with 300 known\ntexts. Furthermore, we obtained the master key with a smaller number of samples\nthan the electromagnetic analysis attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 08:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

We propose the TransFER model which can learn rich\nrelation-aware local representations. It mainly consists of three components:\nMulti-Attention Dropping (MAD), ViT-FER, and Multi-head Self-Attention Dropping\n(MSAD). First, local patches play an important role in distinguishing various\nexpressions, however, few existing works can locate discriminative and diverse\nlocal patches. This can cause serious problems when some patches are invisible\ndue to pose variations or viewpoint changes. To address this issue, the MAD is\nproposed to randomly drop an attention map. Consequently, models are pushed to\nexplore diverse local patches adaptively. Second, to build rich relations\nbetween different local patches, the Vision Transformers (ViT) are used in FER,\ncalled ViT-FER. Since the global scope is used to reinforce each local patch, a\nbetter representation is obtained to boost the FER performance. Thirdly, the\nmulti-head self-attention allows ViT to jointly attend to features from\ndifferent information subspaces at different positions. Given no explicit\nguidance, however, multiple self-attentions may extract similar relations. To\naddress this, the MSAD is proposed to randomly drop one self-attention module.\nAs a result, models are forced to learn rich relations among diverse local\npatches. Our proposed TransFER model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\non several FER benchmarks, showing its effectiveness and usefulness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 08:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

We test the proposed approach in the Black-Scholes model, where the\nGPR-GHQ method is made even more efficient by exploiting the positive\nhomogeneity of the continuation value, which allows one to reduce the problem\nsize.

Most recent advances adopt a deep auto-encoder style architecture\nto compute novelty scores for detecting novel class data. Deep networks have\nshown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet little focus is devoted to\nstudying the adversarial robustness of deep novelty detectors. In this paper,\nwe first show that existing novelty detectors are susceptible to adversarial\nexamples. We further demonstrate that commonly-used defense approaches for\nclassification tasks have limited effectiveness in one-class novelty detection.\nHence, we need a defense specifically designed for novelty detection. To this\nend, we propose a defense strategy that manipulates the latent space of novelty\ndetectors to improve the robustness against adversarial examples. The proposed\nmethod, referred to as Principal Latent Space (PrincipaLS), learns the\nincrementally-trained cascade principal components in the latent space to\nrobustify novelty detectors.

Hybrid planning is concerned with resolving the time and quality\ntrade-off via dynamically combining multiple planners that individually aim to\nperform either timely or with high quality. The choice of the most fitting\nplanner is steered based on assessments of runtime information. A hybrid\nplanner for a self-adaptive system requires (i) a decision-making mechanism\nthat utilizes (ii) system-level as well as (iii) feedback control-level\ninformation at runtime.\n  In this paper, we present HYPEZON, a hybrid planner for self-adaptive\nsystems.

In this study, we analysed the solitary\nobservational record for a solar eclipse conducted by the ancient Maya on 16\nJuly 790 in Julian calendar, recorded on the Stela 3 of Santa Elena Poco Uinic\n(N16{\\deg}35', W91{\\deg}44').

The considered method is Razumikhin for time-varying\ndelay large-scale systems, in which it includes a Lyapunov function associated\nwith the original non-augmented state space of system dynamics in comparison\nwith the Krasovskii method. As a rule, the Razumikhin method has a perfect\npotential to avoid the inherent complexity of the Krasovskii method especially\nin the presence of large delays and disturbances. The considered large-scale\nsystem in this manuscript is decomposed into several subsystems, each of which\nis represented by a fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) model and the interconnection\nbetween any two subsystems is considered. Because the main section of the model\npredictive control is optimization, the hierarchical scheme is performed for\nthe optimization problem. Furthermore, persistent disturbances are considered\nthat robust positive invariance and input-to-state stability under such\ncircumstances are studied. The linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) method is\nperformed for our computations. So the closed-loop large-scale system is\nasymptotically stable. Ultimately, by two examples, the effectiveness of the\nproposed method is illustrated, and a comparison with other papers is made by\nremarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 11:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

We focus on\ngenerating piano accompaniments for folk/pop songs based on a lead sheet (i.e.,\nmelody with chord progression). Specifically, AccoMontage first retrieves\nphrase montages from a database while recombining them structurally using\ndynamic programming. Second, chords of the retrieved phrases are manipulated to\nmatch the lead sheet via style transfer. Lastly, the system offers controls\nover the generation process. In contrast to pure learning-based approaches,\nAccoMontage introduces a novel hybrid pathway, in which rule-based optimization\nand deep learning are both leveraged to complement each other for high-quality\ngeneration.

Recent studies showed\nthat $^{28}$F has a negative-parity ground state (g.s.) and thus lies within\nthe southern shore of the IOI, and $^{29}$F presents a halo structure in its\ng.s., but it is unclear which effects, such as deformation, shell evolution due\nto tensor forces, or couplings to the continuum, lead to this situation. We\ninvestigate the role of quadrupole deformation and continuum effects on the\nsingle-particle (s.p.) structure of $^{28,29,31}$F from a relativistic\nmean-field (RMF) approach, and show how both phenomena can lead to a\nnegative-parity g.s. in $^{28}$F and halo structures in $^{29,31}$F. We solve\nthe Dirac equation in the complex-momentum (Berggren) representation for a\npotential with quadrupole deformation at the first order obtained from RMF\ncalculations using the NL3 interaction, and calculate the continuum level\ndensities using the Green's function method. We extract s.p. energies and\nwidths from the continuum level densities to construct Nilsson diagrams, and\nanalyse the evolution of both the widths and occupation probabilities of\nrelevant Nilsson orbitals in $^{28}$F and find that some amount of prolate\ndeformation must be present. In addition, we calculate the density\ndistributions for bound Nilsson orbitals near the Fermi surface in $^{29,31}$F\nand reveal that for a quadrupole deformation $0.3 \\leq \\beta_2 \\leq 0.45$\n(prolate), halo tails appear at large distances. We also demonstrate that while\nin the spherical case the $pf$ shells are already inverted and close to the\nneutron emission threshold, a small amount of quadrupole deformation can reduce\nthe gap between $fp$ shells and increase the role of the continuum, ultimately\nleading to the negative parity in the g.s. of $^{28}$F and the halo structures\nin $^{29,31}$F.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

Moreover, it is relevant in applications,\nincluding decontamination and crystallization control. It still lacks a\nsystematic analysis for fluids with different bulk properties. Here we fill\nthis gap. We compare, by molecular dynamics simulations, three different\nliquids in a graphene slit pore: (A) A simple fluid, such as argon, described\nby a Lennard-Jones potential; (B) An anomalous fluid, such as a liquid metal,\nmodeled with an isotropic core-softened potential; (C) Water, the prototypical\nanomalous liquid, with directional hydrogen bonds. We study how the slit-pore\nwidth affects the structure, thermodynamics, and dynamics of the fluids. We\ncheck that all the fluids, as expected, show similar oscillating properties by\nchanging the pore size. However, the nature of the free-energy minima for the\nthree fluids is quite different: i) only for the simple liquid all the minima\nare energy-driven, while their structural order increases with decreasing\nslit-pore width; ii) only for the isotropic core-softened potential all the\nminima are entropy-driven, while the energy in the minima increases with\ndecreasing slit-pore width; iii) only the water has a changing nature of the\nminima: the monolayer minimum is entropy-driven, at variance with the simple\nliquid, while the bilayer minimum is energy-driven, at variance with the other\nanomalous liquid. Also, water diffusion has a large increase for sub-nm\nslit-pores, becoming faster than bulk. Instead, the other two fluids have\ndiffusion oscillations much smaller than water slowing down for decreasing\nslit-pore width. Our results clarify that nanoconfined water is unique compared\nto other (simple or anomalous) fluids under similar confinement, and are\npossibly relevant in nanopores applications, e.g., in water purification from\ncontaminants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

The underlying complex terrain leads to spatial heterogeneity and\nnon-stationarity of turbulent fluxes. Due to the contribution of\nthermally-induced flows and gravity waves, exchange mechanisms are fully\nthree-dimensional, instead of only vertical. Additionally, glaciers have their\nown distinct microclimate, governed by a down-glacier katabatic wind, which\nprotects the glacier ice and interacts with the surrounding flows on multiple\nscales. In this study, we perform large-eddy simulations with the WRF model\nwith dx=48 m to gain insight on the boundary-layer processes over an Alpine\nvalley glacier, the Hintereisferner (HEF). We choose two case studies from a\nmeasurement campaign (August 2018) with different synoptic wind directions\n(South-West and North-West). Model evaluation with an array of eddy-covariance\nstations on the glacier tongue and surroundings reveals that WRF is able to\nsimulate the general glacier boundary-layer structure. Under southwesterly\nairflow, the down-glacier wind is supported by the South-Western synoptic wind\ndirection, a stable boundary layer is present over the ice surface, and local\nprocesses govern the turbulence kinetic energy production. Under northwesterly\nairflow, a cross-glacier valley flow and a breaking gravity wave lead strong\nturbulent mixing and to the subsequent erosion of the glacier boundary layer.\nStationarity analyses of the sensible heat flux suggest non-stationary\nbehaviour for both case study days, while non-stationarity is highest on the NW\nday during the gravity-wave event. These results suggest that the synoptic wind\ndirection has, in addition to upstream topography and the atmospheric\nstability, a strong impact on whether a local glacier boundary layer can form\nor not, influencing whether a glacier is able to maintain its own microclimate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

Each function invocation (action) runs in an\nindividual container. When there is not an already started container for a user\nfunction, a new container has to be created for it. However, the long cold\nstartup time of a container results in the long response latency of the action.\nOur investigation shows that the containers for some user actions share most of\nthe software packages. If an action that requires a new container can\n``borrow'' a similar warm container from other actions, the long cold startup\ncan be eliminated. Based on the above finding, we propose Pagurus, a runtime\ncontainer management system for eliminating the cold startup in serverless\ncomputing. Pagurus is comprised of an inter-action container scheduler and an\nintra-action container scheduler for each action. The inter-action container\nscheduler schedules shared containers among actions. The intra-action container\nscheduler deals with the management of the container lifecycle. Our\nexperimental results show that Pagurus effectively eliminates the\ntime-consuming container cold startup. An action may start to run in 10ms with\nPagurus, even if there is not warm container for it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

Different from many previous hierarchical structures, our multiscale\nspatio-temporal graph is built in a data-adaptive fashion, which captures\nnonphysical, yet motion-based relations. The key module of MST-GNN is a\nmultiscale spatio-temporal graph computational unit (MST-GCU) based on the\ntrainable graph structure. MST-GCU embeds underlying features at individual\nscales and then fuses features across scales to obtain a comprehensive\nrepresentation. The overall architecture of MST-GNN follows an encoder-decoder\nframework, where the encoder consists of a sequence of MST-GCUs to learn the\nspatial and temporal features of motions, and the decoder uses a graph-based\nattention gate recurrent unit (GA-GRU) to generate future poses.

A classification\ntree is one of the most commonly used techniques in the area of classification.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel classification tree algorithm which we call\nDirect Nonparametric Predictive Inference (D-NPI) classification algorithm. The\nD-NPI algorithm is completely based on the Nonparametric Predictive Inference\n(NPI) approach, and it does not use any other assumption or information. The\nNPI is a statistical methodology which learns from data in the absence of prior\nknowledge and uses only few modelling assumptions, enabled by the use of lower\nand upper probabilities to quantify uncertainty. Due to the predictive nature\nof NPI, it is well suited for classification, as the nature of classification\nis explicitly predictive as well. The D-NPI algorithm uses a new split\ncriterion called Correct Indication (CI). The CI is about the informativity\nthat the attribute variables will indicate, hence, if the attribute is very\ninformative, it gives high lower and upper probabilities for CI. The CI reports\nthe strength of the evidence that the attribute variables will indicate, based\non the data. The CI is completely based on the NPI, and it does not use any\nadditional concepts such as entropy. The performance of the D-NPI\nclassification algorithm is tested against several classification algorithms\nusing classification accuracy, in-sample accuracy and tree size on different\ndatasets from the UCI machine learning repository. The experimental results\nindicate that the D-NPI classification algorithm performs well in terms of\nclassification accuracy and in-sample accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 14:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

State-of-the-art online coflow\nschedulers in essence approximate the classic Shortest-Job-First (SJF)\nscheduling by learning the coflow size online. In particular, they use multiple\npriority queues to simultaneously accomplish two goals: to sieve long coflows\nfrom short coflows, and to schedule short coflows with high priorities. Such a\nmechanism pays high overhead in learning the coflow size: moving a large coflow\nacross the queues delays small and other large coflows, and moving\nsimilar-sized coflows across the queues results in inadvertent round-robin\nscheduling. We propose Philae, a new online coflow scheduler that exploits the\nspatial dimension of coflows, i.e., a coflow has many flows, to drastically\nreduce the overhead of coflow size learning. Philae pre-schedules sampled flows\nof each coflow and uses their sizes to estimate the average flow size of the\ncoflow. It then resorts to Shortest Coflow First, where the notion of shortest\nis determined using the learned coflow sizes and coflow contention. We show\nthat the sampling-based learning is robust to flow size skew and has the added\nbenefit of much improved scalability from reduced coordinator-local agent\ninteractions.

The\nnon-volatility and the time evolution of the effect point at oxygen ion\nmigration across the ZrO$_2$ layer as the driving mechanism. A large variation\nof the PMA is obtained by modifying the degree of oxidation of the cobalt layer\nwith the flux of oxygen ions: the easy magnetization axis can be switched\nreversibly from in-plane, with an under-oxidized Co, to in-plane, with an\nover-oxidized Co, passing through an out-of-plane magnetization with maximum\nPMA. The switching time between the different magnetic states is limited by the\noxygen ion drift velocity through the multilayer structure. This was shown to\ndepend exponentially on the applied bias voltage, and could be varied by over 5\norders of magnitude, from several minutes to a few ms. On the other hand, for a\nfixed gate-voltage, the oxidation of the cobalt layer decreases exponentially\nas a function of time. This behavior is in agreement with the theoretical model\ndeveloped by Cabrera and Mott (1949) to explain the growth of very thin oxides\nat low temperatures.

In that case, the Bogoliubov\ncoefficients do not satisfy the required normalization condition. In canonical\nformulation, which closely mimics the Bogoliubov transformation method, one can\nconsistently reproduce the vanishing number density of Hawking quanta for an\nextremal Kerr black hole. In this method, the relation between the spatial\nnear-null coordinates, imperative in understanding the Hawking effect, was\napproximated into a sum of linear and inverse terms only. In the present work,\nwe first show that one can reach the same conclusion in canonical formulation\neven with the complete relationship between the near-null coordinates, which\ncontains an additional logarithmic term.

However,\nsystematic noise is introduced into the data during collection, complicating\ninterpretation of the results. Researchers most often use a combination of\nmanual interpretation and filtering techniques to denoise data; however, these\nprocesses are time intensive and inconsistent. Fully Convolutional Networks\nhave been proposed as an automated alternative to identify layer boundaries in\nradargrams. However, they require high-quality manually processed training data\nand struggle to interpolate data in noisy samples (Varshney et al. 2020).\n  Herein, the authors propose a GAN based model to interpolate layer boundaries\nthrough noise and highlight layers in two-dimensional glacial RES data. In\nreal-world noisy images, filtering often results in loss of data such that\ninterpolating layer boundaries is nearly impossible. Furthermore, traditional\nmachine learning approaches are not suited to this task because of the lack of\npaired data, so we employ an unpaired image-to-image translation model. For\nthis model, we create a synthetic dataset to represent the domain of images\nwith clear, highlighted layers and use an existing real-world RES dataset as\nour noisy domain.\n  We implement a CycleGAN trained on these two domains to highlight layers in\nnoisy images that can interpolate effectively without significant loss of\nstructure or fidelity. Though the current implementation is not a perfect\nsolution, the model clearly highlights layers in noisy data and allows\nresearchers to determine layer size and position without mathematical\nfiltering, manual processing, or ground-truth images for training. This is\nsignificant because clean images generated by our model enable subsurface\nresearchers to determine glacial layer thickness more efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 15:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

The clusters have stellar masses in the range\n$10^{11.8} - 10^{12.9} M_{\\odot}$. We compare the stellar mass of the BCGs in\neach cluster to what we would expect if their masses were drawn from the mass\ndistribution of the other member galaxies of the clusters. The BCGs are found\nto be \"special\", in the sense that they are not consistent with being a\nstatistical extreme of the mass distribution of other cluster galaxies. This\nresult is robust over the full range of cluster stellar masses and redshifts in\nthe sample, indicating that BCGs are special up to a redshift of $z=1.0$.\nHowever, BCGs with a large separation from the center of the cluster are found\nto be consistent with being statistical extremes of the cluster member mass\ndistribution. We discuss the implications of these findings for BCG formation\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 15:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

The proposed scheme combines user scheduling based on\ntime division multiple access (TDMA) and (mechanical) angular displacement of\nthe IRS. Each energy harvesting user (EHU) has dedicated time slots with\noptimized durations for energy harvesting and information transmission whereas,\nthe phase matrix of the IRS is adjusted to focus its beam to a particular EHU.\nThe proposed scheme exploits the fundamental dependence of the IRS channel\npath-loss on the angle between the IRS and the node's line-of-sight, which is\noften overlooked in the literature. Additionally, the network design can be\noptimized for large number of IRS unit cells, which is not the case with the\ncomputationally intensive state-of-the-art schemes. In fact, the EHUs can\nachieve significant rates at practical distances of several tens of meters to\nthe base station (BS) only if the number of IRS unit cells is at least a few\nthousand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 15:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

However, it is noted\nthat ASM-based SIDM degrades its performance in dehazing real world hazy images\ndue to the limited modelling ability of ASM where the atmospheric light factor\n(ALF) and the angular scattering coefficient (ASC) are assumed as constants for\none image. Obviously, the hazy images taken in real world cannot always satisfy\nthis assumption. Such generating modelling mismatch between the real-world\nimages and ASM sets up the upper bound of trained ASM-based SIDM for dehazing.\nBearing this in mind, in this study, a new fully non-homogeneous atmospheric\nscattering model (FNH-ASM) is proposed for well modeling the hazy images under\ncomplex conditions where ALF and ASC are pixel dependent. However, FNH-ASM\nbrings difficulty in practical application. In FNH-ASM based SIDM, the\nestimation bias of parameters at different positions lead to different\ndistortion of dehazing result. Hence, in order to reduce the influence of\nparameter estimation bias on dehazing results, two new cost sensitive loss\nfunctions, beta-Loss and D-Loss, are innovatively developed for limiting the\nparameter bias of sensitive positions that have a greater impact on the\ndehazing result. In the end, based on FNH-ASM, an end-to-end CNN-based dehazing\nnetwork, FNHD-Net, is developed, which applies beta-Loss and D-Loss.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our\nproposed FNHD-Net for dehazing on both synthetic and real-world images.

Certifiers for\nneural networks are a reliable way to check the robustness of these\npredictions. They guarantee for some predictions that a certain class of\nmanipulations or attacks could not have changed the outcome. For the remaining\npredictions without guarantees, the method abstains from making a prediction\nand a fallback strategy needs to be invoked, which typically incurs additional\ncosts, can require a human operator, or even fail to provide any prediction.\nWhile this is a key concept towards safe and secure AI, we show for the first\ntime that this approach comes with its own security risks, as such fallback\nstrategies can be deliberately triggered by an adversary. Using training-time\nattacks, the adversary can significantly reduce the certified robustness of the\nmodel, making it unavailable. This transfers the main system load onto the\nfallback, reducing the overall system's integrity and availability. We design\ntwo novel backdoor attacks which show the practical relevance of these threats.\nFor example, adding 1% poisoned data during training is sufficient to reduce\ncertified robustness by up to 95 percentage points.

One of its ways of guaranteeing separation is the use of\nairborne, stand-alone Detect-And-Avoid, an operational concept where each\naircraft decides its avoidance maneuvers independently, observing right-of-way\nrules and, in specific implementations, some form of pairwise coordination.\nThis is a fundamental safety element for autonomous aircraft but, according to\nour research, is not sufficient for high-density airspaces as envisioned for\nurban environments. In these environments, some way of explicit and strategic\ntraffic coordination must be in place, as done for conventional ATM. For\nefficiency reasons, ATM is evolving to more flexible uses of the airspace, such\nthat the use of dynamically allocated corridors is a rising concept for AAM.\nThese strategic forms of traffic coordination are potentially highly efficient\nif the aircraft adhere to their trajectory contracts and there are no\nsignificant perturbations to the traffic. However, if significant perturbations\noccur, such as loss of data communication, or the sudden appearance of an\nintruder, a centralized system may not react appropriately in due time.

To cope\nwith the mitigation of planned service interruptions and to guarantee a\nseamless journey and a good travel experience for passengers, it is possible to\nexploit the existing services differently and/or provide additional on-demand\nservices, such as temporary supplemental bus lines. In this context, this paper\naims to develop a mathematical programming model for planning service\ninterruptions due to maintenance considering passenger transport demand\ndynamics. In particular, the proposed approach deals with service interruptions\ncharacterized by a long duration for which timetable adaption strategies are\nnot applicable, suggesting mitigation actions that exploit the already existing\nservices and/or the activation of additional ones, with the aim of minimizing\nusers' inconvenience. In doing so, the planned infrastructure status (i.e.,\navailable or under maintenance), as well as the forecasted transport demand,\nare taken into account to adapt the service accordingly by offering a\nmultimodal transport solution to passengers. To find the best solution, a\ndecomposition solution approach is proposed in combination with a multistage\ncooperative framework with feedback that models the negotiation process between\nthe involved actors. Finally, the applicability of the proposed approach to\nreal case studies is discussed based on some performance indicators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 16:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

One recurring element is the use of\npre-defined airways or corridors, a natural way to create order, with proven\nsuccess from the conventional, manned, Air Traffic Management (ATM). But, while\nATM is evolving to 4D Trajectory-Based Operations, when we apply the ATM\nprinciples to very dense and potentially more complex operations such as AAM,\nwe have to consider their limitations in such demanding new environment. The\nrequirement of following circulation corridors most often increase flight\ndistance and inevitably create bottlenecks, hence we explore the hypothesis of\nnot using corridors, testing such option via a simple and scalable simulation\nmodel. Other motivations for comparing different forms of traffic coordination\nare redundancy and diversity, which have potential to increase system safety.\nRelying on a single method to maintain traffic separation of course would not\nbe allowed in practice.

In particular, diverse histological\nmicrostructures may lead to differential mechanical behavior during dissection,\nincluding the pressure--volume relationship of the injected fluid and the\ndisplacement field between adjacent lamellae.

Methods: In this\npaper, we comprehensively describe the recent Tilt-and-Torsion method and\ncompare it to the Euler YXY method currently recommended by the International\nSociety of Biomechanics.

This is a nunber of polarized particles large\nenough for the beam polarization to be detected externally, and fed back to\npermit external control of the beam polarization. The level of achievable spin\ncontrol, though classical, not quantum mechanical, can be comparable to the\ncontrol of one or a small number of polarized particles in a low energy trap.\n  Motivated to investigate time reversal invariance, especially the detection\nof non-zero electric dipole moments (EDMs) this paper describes the design of a\nlow energy storage ring having the superimposed electric and magnetic bending\nneeded to \"freeze\" the spins of polarized beams. For electrons (of either sign)\nand protons the spins can be frozen with all-electric bending but, in general,\nsuperimposed electric/magnetic bending is required. Since constructive bending\nsuperposition in one direction implies destructive superposition in the other\ndirection, counter-circulating beams must differ, either in particle type or\nmomentum, in order for their orbits to be identical.\n  For globally frozen spin operation the bunch polarizations remain constant\nrelative to the momenta, for example remaining parallel to the circuating beam\nmomentum vectors. With superimposed electric and magnetic bending, the globally\nfrozen spin condition can be met over a continua (specific to particle type) of\nE/B ratios. When this condition is met, the out-of-plane, EDM-induced\nprecession accumulates monitonically, which is obligatory for producing a\nmeasurably large EDM signal. As Koop has explained, the EDM signal will still\naccumulate if the polarization is allowed to \"roll like a wheel\" around a\nradial axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 19:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}
