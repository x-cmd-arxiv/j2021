We start with logical resource\nrequirements corresponding to a quantum advantage for a particular chemistry\napplication, simulating the FeMoco molecule, and explore to what extent slower\ncode cycle times can be mitigated by using additional qubits. We show that in\ncertain situations architectures with considerably slower code cycle times will\nstill be able to reach desirable run times, provided enough physical qubits are\navailable.

In that vein, this paper\nreconsiders the problem of PCA when data samples are distributed across nodes\nin an arbitrarily connected network.

Each simulation was run up to $t \\gtrsim 100,000\\,GM/c^3$ to ensure disk\ninflow equilibrium out to large radii. We find that the saturated magnetic flux\nlevel, and consequently also jet power, of MAD disks depends strongly on the\nblack hole spin, confirming previous results. Prograde disks saturate at a much\nhigher relative magnetic flux and have more powerful jets than their retrograde\ncounterparts. MADs with spinning black holes naturally launch jets with\ngeneralized parabolic profiles whose widths vary as a power of distance from\nthe black hole. For distances up to $100\\;GM/c^2$, the power-law index is $k\n\\approx 0.27-0.42$. There is a strong correlation between the disk-jet geometry\nand the dimensionless magnetic flux, resulting in prograde systems displaying\nthinner equatorial accretion flows near the black hole and wider jets, compared\nto retrograde systems. Prograde and retrograde MADs also exhibit different\ntrends in disk variability: accretion rate variability increases with\nincreasing spin for $a_*>0$ and remains almost constant for $a_*\\lesssim 0$,\nwhile magnetic flux variability shows the opposite trend. Jets in the MAD state\nremove more angular momentum from black holes than is accreted, effectively\nspinning down the black hole. If powerful jets from MAD systems in Nature are\npersistent, this loss of angular momentum will notably reduce the black hole\nspin over cosmic time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 16:31:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 19:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Despite\nsubstantial throughput and energy efficiency achievements, most proposals only\nbring modest (or marginal) gains in transaction commit latency. Consequently,\ncommit latencies in today's permissionless blockchain landscape remain\nprohibitively high. This paper proposes NimbleChain, a novel algorithm that\nextends permissionless blockchains based on Nakamoto consensus with a fast path\nthat delivers causal promises of commitment, or simply promises. Since promises\nonly partially order transactions, their latency is only a small fraction of\nthe totally-ordered commitment latency of Nakamoto consensus. Still, the weak\nconsistency guarantees of promises are strong enough to correctly implement\ncryptocurrencies. To the best of our knowledge, NimbleChain is the first system\nto bring together fast, partially-ordered transactions with consensus-based,\ntotally-ordered transactions in a permissionless setting. This hybrid\nconsistency model is able to speed up cryptocurrency transactions while still\nsupporting smart contracts, which typically have (strong) sequential\nconsistency needs. We implement NimbleChain as an extension of Ethereum and\nevaluate it in a 500-node geo-distributed deployment.

We\ninvestigate a class of ansatze that incorporates knowledge of the quantum\nhardware, namely the hardware efficient ansatze. The performance of hardware\nefficient ansatze is affected differently by noise, and our goal is to study\nthe effect of noise on evaluating which ansatz gives more accurate results in\npractice. First, we study the effect of noise on the different hardware\nefficient ansatze by benchmarking and ranking the performance of each ansatz\nfamily (i) on a chemistry application using VQE and (ii) by the recently\nestablished metric of \"expressibility\". The results demonstrate the ranking of\noptimal circuits does not remain constant in the presence of noise.

The proposed scheme identifies multiplicative layers of light\nfield view subsets optimized using a convolutional neural network for different\nscanning orders. Our approach exploits the hidden low-rank structure in the\nmultiplicative layers obtained from the subsets of different scanning patterns.\nThe spatial redundancies in the multiplicative layers can be efficiently\nremoved by performing low-rank approximation at different ranks on the Krylov\nsubspace. The intra-view and inter-view redundancies between approximated\nlayers are further removed by HEVC encoding. Next, a Fourier disparity layer\nrepresentation is constructed from the first subset of the approximated light\nfield based on the chosen hierarchical order. Subsequent view subsets are\nsynthesized by modeling the Fourier disparity layers that iteratively refine\nthe representation with improved accuracy. The critical advantage of the\nproposed hybrid layered representation and coding scheme is that it utilizes\nnot just spatial and temporal redundancies in light fields but efficiently\nexploits intrinsic similarities among neighboring sub-aperture images in both\nhorizontal and vertical directions as specified by different predication\norders.

We find that galaxies with SFR higher than the MS are more metal-poor\nthan their counterparts on the MS, which is interpreted in terms of gas\naccretion, boosting star formation and diluting the metallicity. Low-mass\ngalaxies below the MS (i.e. towards quiescence) have metallicities higher than\ntheir MS counterparts, which is interpreted in terms of starvation, (i.e.\nsuppression of fresh gas supply) hampering star formation and reducing the\ndilution effect, hence resulting in a higher level of internal chemical\nenrichment. Massive galaxies below the MS have gas metallicity much closer to\ntheir MS counterparts and much lower than expected from their stellar\nmetallicities; this result suggests a scenario where massive nearly-quiescent\ngalaxies with LI(N)ER-like nebular emission have recently accreted gas from the\ncircum/intergalactic medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 18:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

A long-standing unsolved problem is the presence of HeII nebular\nemission in many low-metallicity star-forming galaxies. This emission requires\nionising photons with energy >54 eV, which are not produced in sufficient\namounts by normal stellar populations. To examine if high mass X-ray binaries\nand ultra-luminous X-ray sources (HMXB/ULX) can explain the observed HeII\nnebular emission and how their presence alters other emission lines, we compute\nphotoionisation models of galaxies including such sources. We combine spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) of integrated stellar populations with constrained\nSEDs of ULXs to obtain composite spectra with varying amounts of X-ray\nluminosity, parameterised by Lx/SFR. With these we compute photoionisation\nmodels to predict the emission line fluxes of the optical recombination lines\nof H and He+, and the main metal lines of OIII, OII, OI, and NII. The\npredictions are then compared to a large sample of low-metallicity galaxies. We\nfind that it is possible to reproduce the nebular HeII and other line\nobservations with our spectra and with amounts of Lx/SFR compatible with the\nobservations. Our work suggests that HMBX/ULX could be responsible for the\nobserved nebular HeII emission. However, the strengths of the high and low\nionisation lines, such as HeII and OI, depend strongly on the X-ray\ncontribution and on the assumed SEDs of the high energy source(s); the latter\nare poorly known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 18:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 15:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-11"}

For a given application, the model\ngenerates a performance metric such as the run time without executing the\napplication on hardware. Such models speed up the compilation process by\nobviating the need to benchmark an enormous number of candidate\nimplementations, referred to as schedules, on hardware. Existing performance\nmodels employ feed-forward networks, recurrent networks, or decision tree\nensembles to estimate the performance of different implementations of a neural\nnetwork. Graphs present a natural and intuitive way to model deep-learning\nnetworks where each node represents a computational stage or operation.\nIncorporating the inherent graph structure of these workloads in the\nperformance model can enable a better representation and learning of\ninter-stage interactions. The accuracy of a performance model has direct\nimplications on the efficiency of the search strategy, making it a crucial\ncomponent of this class of deep-learning compilers. In this work, we develop a\nnovel performance model that adopts a graph representation. In our model, each\nstage of computation represents a node characterized by features that capture\nthe operations performed by the stage.

The reliability and efficiency norms employed coincide when\nthere is no nonlinearity. Moreover, error contributors such as flux\nnonconformity, time discretization, quadrature, linearization, and data\noscillation are identified and separated. The estimates are also valid in a\nsetting where iterative linearization with inexact solvers is considered.\nNumerical tests are conducted for nondegenerate and degenerate cases having\nexact solutions, as well as for a realistic case. It is shown that the\nestimators correctly identify the errors up to a factor of the order of unity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 21:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

However, client developers\ncan have issues identifying the correct usage of a certain API, causing misuses\naccompanied by software crashes or usability bugs. Therefore, researchers have\naimed at identifying API misuses automatically by comparing client code usages\nto correct API usages. Some techniques rely on certain API-specific graph-based\ndata structures to improve the abstract representation of API usages. Such\ntechniques need to compare graphs, for instance, by computing distance metrics\nbased on the minimal graph edit distance or the largest common subgraphs, whose\ncomputations are known to be NP-hard problems. Fortunately, there exist many\nabstractions for simplifying graph distance computation. However, their\napplicability for comparing graph representations of API usages has not been\nanalyzed. In this paper, we provide a comparison of different distance\nalgorithms of API-usage graphs regarding correctness and runtime.

For this purpose, we systematically identified a set of\neight graph-based distance algorithms and applied them on two datasets of\nreal-world API usages and misuses. Interestingly, our results suggest that\nexisting distance algorithms are not reliable for comparing API usage graphs.\nTo improve on this situation, we identified and discuss the algorithms' issues,\nbased on which we formulate hypotheses to initiate research on overcoming them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 21:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

In this work we introduce the\nlimb darkening effect, therefore the position of the spot in the stellar disk\nand the impact parameter of the transiting planet now play a key role. The\nmethod is tested on simulations of planetary transits of three representative\nkinds of planetary systems, at ARIEL resolution. We find that a realistic\ntreatment of the limb darkening is required to reliably estimate both the spots\nparameters and the transmission spectrum of the transiting planet. Furthermore,\nwe show that the influence of the spots onthe retrieval of the planetary\ntransmission spectrum is significant for spots close to the center of the star,\ncovering a fraction greater than 0.05 and with a temperature contrast greater\nthan 500 K, and that for these cases our method can confidently extract the\ntransmission spectrum and the impact parameter of the transiting planet for\nboth cases of occulted and not occulted spots, provided that we have an\naccurate characterization of the stellar parameters and a reliable simulator of\nthe instrument performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 23:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

However, differentiating between common medical diagnoses can be\nchallenging in clinical practice. Machine learning models could improve medical\ndiagnosis by aiding in the diagnostic evaluation of these patients. Materials\nand Methods: Machine learning models were trained to predict the common causes\nof acute respiratory failure (pneumonia, heart failure, and/or COPD). Models\nwere trained using chest radiographs and clinical data from the electronic\nhealth record (EHR) and applied to an internal and external cohort. Results:\nThe internal cohort of 1,618 patients included 508 (31%) with pneumonia, 363\n(22%) with heart failure, and 137 (8%) with COPD based on physician chart\nreview.

The coupling between the polar and anti-polar modes thus leads\nto substantial differences among different polarization switching paths.\nSpecifically, our lattice-mode-coupling analysis shows that paths in which the\n$X_2^-$ mode is reversed involve a large activation energy, which because the\n$X_2^-$ mode is nonpolar cannot be directly overcome by applying an electric\nfield. Our results show that the anti-polar $Pbca$ phase, whose structure is\nlocally quite similar to that of the $Pca2_1$ phase, similarly cannot be\ntransformed to this phase by an electric field as this would require local\nreversal of the $X_2^-$ mode pattern. Moreover, for the domain wall structure\nmost widely considered, propagation also requires the reversal of the $X_2^-$\nmode, leading to a much larger activation energy compared with that for the\npropagation of domain wall structures with a single sign for the $X_2^-$ mode.\nFinally, these first-principles results for domain wall propagation in HfO$_2$\nhave implications to many experimental observations, such as sluggish domain\nwall motion and robust ferroelectricity in thin films, and lattice mode\nanalysis deepens our understanding of these distinctive properties of\nferroelectric HfO$_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 2021 00:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

Second,\nwe implement a strong data augmentation by mixing images and labels using the\ngeometry of the scene. Third, we transfer knowledge from features learned\nduring SDE to semantic segmentation by means of transfer and multi-task\nlearning.

Working in the realm of loop cosmological\nmodels with non-perturbative quantum gravity modifications we show that a\nmodified version of standard loop quantum cosmology based on Thiemann's\nregularization of the Hamiltonian constraint while generically non-singular\ndoes not allow a cyclic evolution unless some highly restrictive conditions\nhold.

On one\nhand our work shows that some quantum cosmological models even though\nnon-singular and bouncing are incompatible with a cyclic evolution, and on the\nother hand demonstrates that differences in various quantization prescriptions\nin loop cosmology need not be faint and buried in the pre-bounce regime, but\ncan be striking and profound even in the post-bounce regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 2021 02:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

In\nrecent years, fault diagnosis methods based on the Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have been mature, but Transformer has\nnot been widely used in the field of fault diagnosis. To address these\ndeficiencies, a new method based on the Time Series Transformer (TST) is\nproposed to recognize the fault mode of bearings. In this paper, our\ncontributions include: Firstly, we designed a tokens sequences generation\nmethod which can handle data in 1D format, namely time series tokenizer. Then,\nthe TST combining time series tokenizer and Transformer was introduced.\nFurthermore, the test results on the given dataset show that the proposed\nmethod has better fault identification capability than the traditional CNN and\nRNN models. Secondly, through the experiments, the effect of structural\nhyperparameters such as subsequence length and embedding dimension on fault\ndiagnosis performance, computational complexity and parameters number of the\nTST is analyzed in detail. The influence laws of some hyperparameters are\nobtained. Finally, via t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)\ndimensionality reduction method, the feature vectors in the embedding space are\nvisualized. On this basis, the working pattern of TST has been explained to a\ncertain extent. Moreover, by analyzing the distribution form of the feature\nvectors, we find that compared with the traditional CNN and RNN models, the\nfeature vectors extracted by the method in this paper show the best intra-class\ncompactness and inter-class separability. These results further demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 2021 03:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

This paper investigates the\nvulnerability of realistic spatial accelerators using general, 8-bit, number\nrepresentation.\n  We investigate two systolic array architectures with weight-stationary\ndataflow: (1) a 3 $\\times$ 1 array for a dot-product operation, and (2) a 3\n$\\times$ 3 array for matrix-vector multiplication. Both are implemented on the\nSAKURA-G FPGA board. We show that both architectures are ultimately vulnerable.\nA conventional DPA succeeds fully on the 1D array, requiring 20K power\nmeasurements. However, the 2D array exhibits higher security even with 460K\ntraces. We show that this is because the 2D array intrinsically entails\nmultiple MACs simultaneously dependent on the same input. However, we find that\na novel template-based DPA with multiple profiling phases is able to fully\nbreak the 2D array with only 40K traces. Corresponding countermeasures need to\nbe investigated for spatial DNN accelerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 2021 05:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

In our previous works, we have considered linear\nmultiscale problems, where the spatial heterogeneities are at subgrid level and\nare not resolved.

The\ncontrast-independent partially explicit time discretization divides the spatial\nspace into two components: contrast dependent (fast) and contrast independent\n(slow) spaces defined via multiscale space decomposition. Following this\ndecomposition, temporal splitting is proposed that treats fast components\nimplicitly and slow components explicitly. The space decomposition and temporal\nsplitting are chosen such that it guarantees a stability and formulate a\ncondition for the time stepping. This condition is formulated as a condition on\nslow spaces. In this paper, we extend this approach to nonlinear problems. We\npropose a splitting approach and derive a condition that guarantees stability.\nThis condition requires some type of contrast-independent spaces for slow\ncomponents of the solution.

Furthermore, it\nis common that robots come with a fixed quantity of hardware resources; if an\napplication requires more computational resources than the robot can\naccommodate, its onboard execution might be extended to a degree that degrades\nthe robot performance. Cloud computing, on the other hand, features on-demand\ncomputational resources; by enabling robots to leverage those resources,\napplication execution time can be reduced. The key to enabling robot use of\ncloud computing is designing an efficient offloading algorithm that makes\noptimum use of the robot onboard capabilities and also forms a quick consensus\non when to offload without any prior knowledge or information about the\napplication. In this paper, we propose a predictive algorithm to anticipate the\ntime needed to execute an application for a given application data input size\nwith the help of a small number of previous observations.

It has been widely recognized\nthat leveraging side information provided by auxiliary covariates can improve\nthe power of false discovery rate (FDR) procedures. Currently, most such\nprocedures are devised with $p$-values as their main statistics. However, for\ntwo-sided hypotheses, the usual data processing step that transforms the\nprimary statistics, known as $z$-values, into $p$-values not only leads to a\nloss of information carried by the main statistics, but can also undermine the\nability of the covariates to assist with the FDR inference. We develop a\n$z$-value based covariate-adaptive (ZAP) methodology that operates on the\nintact structural information encoded jointly by the $z$-values and covariates.\nIt seeks to emulate the oracle $z$-value procedure via a working model, and its\nrejection regions significantly depart from those of the $p$-value adaptive\ntesting approaches. The key strength of ZAP is that the FDR control is\nguaranteed with minimal assumptions, even when the working model is\nmisspecified.

Human beings revolve around these fears of uncertainties\nconcerning various aspects like a global pandemic, health, finances, to name\nbut a few. Dealing with this unavoidable part of life is far tougher due to the\nchaotic nature of these unpredictable activities. In the present article, we\nconsider a global network of identical chaotic maps, which splits into two\ndifferent clusters, despite the interaction between all nodes are uniform. The\nstability analysis of the spatially homogeneous chaotic solutions provides a\ncritical coupling strength, before which we anticipate such partial\nsynchronization. The distance between these two chaotic synchronized\npopulations often deviates more than eight times of standard deviation from its\nlong-term average. The probability density function of these highly deviated\nvalues fits well with the Generalized Extreme Value distribution. Meanwhile,\nthe distribution of recurrence time intervals between extreme events resembles\nthe Weibull distribution. The existing literature helps us to characterize such\nevents as extreme events using the significant height. These extremely high\nfluctuations are less frequent in terms of their occurrence. We determine\nnumerically a range of coupling strength for these extremely large but\nrecurrent events. On-off intermittency is the responsible mechanism underlying\nthe formation of such extreme events. Besides understanding the generation of\nsuch extreme events and their statistical signature, we furnish forecasting\nthese events using the powerful deep learning algorithms of an artificial\nrecurrent neural network.

It\nhas been widely believed that it is impossible to unilaterally control players'\npayoffs in games, since payoffs are jointly determined by all players. Until\nrecently, a class of so-called zero-determinant strategies are revealed, which\nenables a player to make a unilateral payoff control over her partners in\ntwo-action repeated games with a constant continuation probability. The\nexisting methods, however, lead to the curse of dimensionality when the\ncomplexity of games increases.

New\napproaches combining variational inference with normalizing flow are\ncharacterized by a computational cost that grows only linearly with the\ndimensionality of the latent variable space, and rely on gradient-based\noptimization instead of sampling, providing a more efficient approach for\nBayesian inference about the model parameters. Moreover, the cost of frequently\nevaluating an expensive likelihood can be mitigated by replacing the true model\nwith an offline trained surrogate model, such as neural networks.

To that end, the paper discusses the application of a\nlow-cost MSI to estimate the 'reheat cycle count classes' (number of times an\noil sample is recursively heated) and identify 'critical classes' at which\nsubstantial changes in the oil sample have materialized. Firstly, the reheat\ncycle count class is estimated with Bhattacharyya distance between the reheated\nand a pure oil sample as the input. The classification was performed using a\nsupport vector machine classifier that resulted in an accuracy of 83.34 % for\nreheat cycle count identification. Subsequently, an unsupervised clustering\nprocedure was introduced using a modified spectral clustering (SC) algorithm to\ndistinguish critical classes under reheating. In addition, laboratory\nexperiments were performed to ascertain the ramifications of the reheating\nprocess with a chemical analysis. The chemical analysis of the coconut oil\nsamples used in the experiment coincided with the chemical analysis results and\nwas statistically significant (p < 0.05). Accordingly, the proposed work closes\nthe gap for using multispectral imaging for oil reheating and proposes a novel\nalgorithm for unsupervised detection of critical property changes in the oil.\nHence, the proposed research work is significant in its practical implications,\ncontribution to food image analysis, and unsupervised classification\nmechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 2021 15:43:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 08:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}
