One of the popular solutions is to exploit the temporal information\nand enhance per-frame representation through aggregating features from\nneighboring frames. Despite achieving improvements in detection, existing\nmethods focus on the selection of higher-level video frames for aggregation\nrather than modeling lower-level temporal relations to increase the feature\nrepresentation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel solution named\nTF-Blender,which includes three modules: 1) Temporal relation mod-els the\nrelations between the current frame and its neighboring frames to preserve\nspatial information. 2). Feature adjustment enriches the representation of\nevery neigh-boring feature map; 3) Feature blender combines outputs from the\nfirst two modules and produces stronger features for the later detection tasks.\nFor its simplicity, TF-Blender can be effortlessly plugged into any detection\nnetwork to improve detection behavior.

Without\nappropriately tuned $\\ell_2$ regularization or weight decay, such networks have\nthe tendency to make output scores (logits) and network weights large, causing\ntraining loss to become too small and the network to lose its adaptivity\n(ability to move around) in the parameter space. Although regularization is\ntypically understood from an overfitting perspective, we highlight its role in\nmaking the network more adaptive and enabling it to escape more easily from\nweights that generalize poorly. To provide such a capability, we propose a\nmethod called Logit Attenuating Weight Normalization (LAWN), that can be\nstacked onto any gradient-based optimizer. LAWN controls the logits by\nconstraining the weight norms of layers in the final homogeneous sub-network.\nEmpirically, we show that the resulting LAWN variant of the optimizer makes a\ndeep network more adaptive to finding minimas with superior generalization\nperformance on large-scale image classification and recommender systems. While\nLAWN is particularly impressive in improving Adam, it greatly improves all\noptimizers when used with large batch sizes\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 16:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}

Doing so requires loads to coordinate their on/off decisions so that\nthe aggregate power consumption profile tracks a grid-supplied reference. At\nthe same time, each consumer's quality of service (QoS) must be maintained.\nWhile there is a large body of work on TCL coordination, there are several\nlimitations. One is that they do not provide guarantees on the reference\ntracking performance and QoS maintenance. A second limitation of past work is\nthat they do not provide a means to compute a suitable reference signal for\npower demand of a collection of TCLs. In this work we provide a framework that\naddresses these weaknesses. The framework enables coordination of an arbitrary\nnumber of TCLs that: (i) is computationally efficient, (ii) is implementable at\nthe TCLs with local feedback and low communication, and (iii) enables reference\ntracking by the collection while ensuring that temperature and cycling\nconstraints are satisfied at every TCL at all times. The framework is based on\na Markov model obtained by discretizing a pair of Fokker-Planck equations\nderived in earlier work by Malhame and Chong [21]. We then use this model to\ndesign randomized policies for TCLs. The balancing authority broadcasts the\nsame policy to all TCLs, and each TCL implements this policy which requires\nonly local measurement to make on/off decisions. Simulation results are\nprovided to support these claims.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 16:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}

These obsolete TODO comments can confuse\ndevelopment teams and may cause the introduction of bugs in the future,\ndecreasing the software's quality and maintainability. In this work, we propose\na novel model, named TDCleaner (TODO comment Cleaner), to identify obsolete\nTODO comments in software projects. TDCleaner can assist developers in\njust-in-time checking of TODO comments status and avoid leaving obsolete TODO\ncomments. Our approach has two main stages: offline learning and online\nprediction. During offline learning, we first automatically establish\n<code_change, todo_comment, commit_msg> training samples and leverage three\nneural encoders to capture the semantic features of TODO comment, code change\nand commit message respectively. TDCleaner then automatically learns the\ncorrelations and interactions between different encoders to estimate the final\nstatus of the TODO comment. For online prediction, we check a TODO comment's\nstatus by leveraging the offline trained model to judge the TODO comment's\nlikelihood of being obsolete. We built our dataset by collecting TODO comments\nfrom the top-10,000 Python and Java Github repositories and evaluated TDCleaner\non them.

We also show that self-supervised training can bias the\nmodel towards extractive behavior, increasing performance in the zero-shot\nsetting without resorting to annotated examples. Overall, our results suggest\nthat pretrained language models are so good at adapting to extractive question\nanswering, that it is often enough to fine-tune on a small training set for the\ngreedy algorithm to emulate the optimal decoding strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 17:07:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 09:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

An effect that has not yet been\nconfidently detected is binary eccentricity, which might be present in a small\nfraction of binaries formed dynamically. Here we discuss general limits on\neccentricity that can, in-principle, be placed on all types of compact object\nbinaries by a detector operating at the design sensitivity of Advanced LIGO.\nUsing a post-Newtonian model for gravitational-wave phasing valid in the small\neccentricity regime, we assess the relative measurement error for eccentricity\nfor a variety of spinning and non-spinning binaries.

We find that\ndecreasing the low frequency limit of a detector's observational frequency band\nis one of the key design factors for increasing the odds of measuring binary\neccentricity. We also introduce and analytically explore the eccentric chirp\nmass parameter, which replaces the chirp mass as the key measurable parameter\ncombination in eccentric gravitational waveform models. The eccentric chirp\nmass parameter explains a degeneracy between the chirp mass and the\neccentricity. This degeneracy leads to a bias in the standard chirp mass\nparameter.

While the\nspecific focus is on metal films exposed to laser heating, the model itself\napplies to any setup involving films on the nanoscale whose material parameters\nare temperature-dependent. For the particular case of metal films heated from\nabove, an important aspect is that the considered heating is volumetric, since\nthe absorption length of the applied laser pulse is comparable to the film\nthickness. In such a setup, absorption of thermal energy and film evolution are\nclosely correlated and must be considered self-consistently. The asymptotic\nmodel allows for a significant simplification, which is crucial from both\nmodeling and computational points of view, since it allows for asymptotically\ncorrect averaging of the temperature over the film thickness. We find that the\nproperties of the thermally conductive substrate -- in particular its thickness\nand rate of heat loss -- play a critical role in controlling the film\ntemperature and dynamics. The film evolution is simulated using efficient\nGPU-based simulations which, when combined with the developed asymptotic model,\nallow for fully nonlinear time-dependent simulations in large three-dimensional\ncomputational domains.

Here, we distinguish\nx-ray spectra of individual crystalline phases operando during a redox-induced\nphase transformation in P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 - an archetypal layered oxide for\nsodium-ion batteries. We measure the resonant elastic scattering on the Bragg\nreflection corresponding to the P2-phase lattice spacing.

Two groups of DQWs systems were studied: one where both\nQWs have the same thickness (symmetric DQW) and another one where they have\ndifferent thicknesses (asymmetric DQW). RAS measures the IOAs arising from the\nintermixing of the heavy- and light- holes in the valence band when the\nsymmetry of the DQW system is lowered from $D_{2d}$ to $C_{2v}$.

In the case of an asymmetric DQW with QWs with\ndifferent thicknesses, the AlGaAs layers (that are sources of anisotropies) are\nnot distributed symmetrically at both sides of the tunneling barrier.

The dimensionality of these\nvariables (and consequently the dynamical models) can be arbitrarily large,\nobscuring the underlying behavior of the system. In truth, these variables are\noften highly redundant and the system is driven by a much smaller set of latent\nintrinsic variables. In this study, we combine the mathematical theory of\nmanifolds with the representational capacity of neural networks to develop a\nmethod that learns a system's intrinsic state variables directly from time\nseries data, and also learns predictive models for their dynamics. What\ndistinguishes our method is its ability to reduce data to the intrinsic\ndimensionality of the nonlinear manifold they live on. This ability is enabled\nby the concepts of charts and atlases from the theory of manifolds, whereby a\nmanifold is represented by a collection of patches that are sewn together -- a\nnecessary representation to attain intrinsic dimensionality.

Recent experimental\nand theoretical research has indicated that ferromagnetic phases can exist in\nelectronically-doped transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors, but\na stable magnetic state at zero magnetic field has eluded detection. Here, we\nexperimentally demonstrate that mesoscopic ferromagnetic order can be generated\nand controlled by local optical pumping in monolayer WSe2 at zero applied\nmagnetic field. In a spatially resolved pump-probe experiment, we use\npolarization-resolved reflectivity from excitonic states as a probe of\ncharge-carrier spin polarization. When the sample is electron-doped at density\n$n_e = 10^{12} cm^{-2}$, we observe that a local, circularly-polarized,\nmicrowatt-power optical pump breaks the symmetry between equivalent\nferromagnetic spin configurations and creates magnetic order which extends over\nmesoscopic regions as large as 8 um x 5 um, bounded by sample edges and folds\nin the 2D semiconductor. The experimental signature of magnetic order is\ncircular dichroism (CD) in reflectivity from the excitonic states, with\nmagnitude exceeding 20% at resonant wavelengths. The helicity of the pump\ndetermines the orientation of the magnetic state, which can be aligned along\nthe two principle out-of-plane axes. In contrast to previous studies in 2D\nmaterials that have required non-local, slowly varying magnetic fields to\nmanipulate magnetic phases, the demonstrated capability to control long-range\nmagnetism and corresponding strong CD with local and tunable optical pumps is\nhighly versatile.

However, a key limitation\nassociated with QAOA is the need to classically optimize over a set of quantum\ncircuit parameters. This classical optimization can have significant associated\ncosts and challenges. Here, we provide an expanded description of Lyapunov\ncontrol-inspired strategies for quantum optimization, as presented in [Magann\net al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 250502 (2022)], that do not require any classical\noptimization effort. Instead, these strategies utilize feedback from qubit\nmeasurements to assign values to the quantum circuit parameters in a\ndeterministic manner, such that the combinatorial optimization problem solution\nimproves monotonically with the quantum circuit depth. Numerical analyses are\npresented that investigate the utility of these strategies towards MaxCut on\nweighted and unweighted 3-regular graphs, both in ideal implementations and\nalso in the presence of measurement noise. We also discuss how how these\nstrategies compare with QAOA, how they may be used to seed QAOA optimizations\nin order to improve performance for near-term applications, and explore\nconnections to quantum annealing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 19:47:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 17:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

In addition to involving a\ndiverse set of stakeholders, the PBOC established a set of fundamental\nprinciples, including privacy, inclusiveness, and conservatism, and has\narticulated its progress in a public document translated into English. We\nmaintain that although both its first principles and its conclusions drawn from\nthe research conducted by the PBOC from 2014 to date are broadly reasonable and\nappropriate, the PBOC has also missed some important considerations and\nentertained some questionable assumptions, which many central banks around the\nworld have also done. In this analysis, we consider the strengths and\nweaknesses of the digital currency proposition articulated by the PBOC as it\nexists today, and we propose one fundamental and specific change for the PBOC\nand other central banks around the world: The architecture must accommodate\nprivacy-preserving, non-custodial wallets. With this change and a related set\nof minor adjustments, China has an opportunity to lead the world in the\nimplementation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) solution that protects\nthe authority of the central bank to implement monetary policy, preserves the\nrole of public-sector and private-sector banking institutions, promotes the\nefficiency of retail transactions and businesses, satisfies regulatory\nobjectives, and safeguards the human rights of retail consumers, including\ntheir privacy and their right to participate in the economy.

We aim to study, via\nthe Doppler dimming technique, the effects that the chromospheric Ly{\\alpha}\nline profile shape causes on the determination of the outflow speed of coronal\nHI atoms. The Doppler dimming technique takes into account the decrease of\ncoronal Ly{\\alpha} radiation in regions where HI atoms flow out in the solar\nwind. Starting from UV observations (UVCS/SOHO) of the coronal Ly{\\alpha} line\nand simultaneous measurements of pB (LASCO/SOHO and Mk3/MLSO), we studied the\neffect of the pumping chromospheric Ly{\\alpha} line profile through\nmeasurements from SOHO/SUMER, UVSP/SMM and LPSP/OSO-8, taken from\nrepresentative on-disk regions and as a function of time during the solar\nactivity cycle. In particular, we considered the effect of four chromospheric\nline parameters: line width, depth of the central reversal, asymmetry and\ndistance of the peaks. We find that the range of variability of these\nparameters is of about 50% for the width, 69% for the depth of the central\nreversal, 35% for the asymmetry, and 50% for the distance of the peaks. Then,\nwe find that the variability of the pumping Ly{\\alpha} profile affects the\nestimates of the coronal HI velocity by about 9-12%. Therefore, this\nuncertainty is smaller than other physical quantities uncertainties, and a\nconstant in time and unique shape of the Ly{\\alpha} profile over the solar disk\ncan be adopted in order to estimate the solar wind outflow velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 20:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

Previous work is\nmainly built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn\ndomain-invariant representations. With the recent exponential increase in\napplying Vision Transformer (ViT) to vision tasks, the capability of ViT in\nadapting cross-domain knowledge, however, remains unexplored in the literature.\nTo fill this gap, this paper first comprehensively investigates the\ntransferability of ViT on a variety of domain adaptation tasks. Surprisingly,\nViT demonstrates superior transferability over its CNNs-based counterparts with\na large margin, while the performance can be further improved by incorporating\nadversarial adaptation. Notwithstanding, directly using CNNs-based adaptation\nstrategies fails to take the advantage of ViT's intrinsic merits (e.g.,\nattention mechanism and sequential image representation) which play an\nimportant role in knowledge transfer. To remedy this, we propose an unified\nframework, namely Transferable Vision Transformer (TVT), to fully exploit the\ntransferability of ViT for domain adaptation. Specifically, we delicately\ndevise a novel and effective unit, which we term Transferability Adaption\nModule (TAM). By injecting learned transferabilities into attention blocks, TAM\ncompels ViT focus on both transferable and discriminative features. Besides, we\nleverage discriminative clustering to enhance feature diversity and separation\nwhich are undermined during adversarial domain alignment. To verify its\nversatility, we perform extensive studies of TVT on four benchmarks and the\nexperimental results demonstrate that TVT attains significant improvements\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art UDA methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 22:37:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 18:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-29"}

This paper studies the energy-age tradeoff for status update from a\nsensor to a monitor over an error-prone channel. The sensor can sleep, sense\nand transmit a new update, or retransmit by considering both sensing energy and\ntransmit energy. An infinite-horizon average cost problem is formulated as a\nMarkov decision process (MDP) with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum\nof average AoI and average energy consumption. By solving the associated\ndiscounted cost problem and analyzing the Markov chain under the optimal\npolicy, we prove that there exists a threshold optimal stationary policy with\nonly two thresholds, i.e., one threshold on the AoI at the transmitter (AoIT)\nand the other on the AoI at the receiver (AoIR). Moreover, the two thresholds\ncan be efficiently found by a line search. Numerical results show the\nperformance of the optimal policies and the tradeoff curves with different\nparameters. Comparisons with the conventional policies show that considering\nsensing energy is of significant impact on the policy design, and introducing\nsleep mode greatly expands the tradeoff range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-16"}

It employs the Hadamard pattern to illuminate the\nfast-moving object by a spatial light modulator, in which the resulting light\nsignal is collected by a single-pixel detector. The single-pixel measurement\nvalues are directly used to reconstruct the position information without image\nreconstruction.

A distinct characteristic in vehicle tracking is that the trajectories\nof vehicles are fairly smooth in both the world coordinate and the image\ncoordinate. Hence, models that capture motion consistencies are of high\nnecessity. However, tracking with the standalone motion-based trackers is quite\nchallenging because targets could get lost easily due to limited information,\ndetection error and occlusion. Leveraging appearance information to assist\nobject re-identification could resolve this challenge to some extent. However,\ndoing so requires extra computation while appearance information is sensitive\nto occlusion as well. In this paper, we try to explore the significance of\nmotion patterns for vehicle tracking without appearance information.

This prediction is based on\nthe assumption that the characteristic velocity $\\sqrt{\\tilde gd}$ of bed\ngrains ejected by the splash of an impacting grain controls the average\nsaltation kinematics.

Since the first experimental realization of such a\nwidefield NV microscope in 2010, the technology has seen rapid development and\ndemonstration of applications in various areas across condensed matter physics,\ngeoscience and biology. This Perspective analyzes the strengths and\nshortcomings of widefield NV microscopy in order to identify the most promising\napplications and guide future development. We begin with a brief review of\nquantum sensing with ensembles of NV centers, and the experimental\nimplementation of widefield NV microscopy. We then compare this technology to\nalternative microscopy techniques commonly employed to probe magnetic materials\nand charge flow distributions. Current limitations in spatial resolution,\nmeasurement accuracy, magnetic sensitivity, operating conditions and ease of\nuse, are discussed. Finally, we identify the technological advances that solve\nthe aforementioned limitations, and argue that their implementation would\nresult in a practical, accessible, high-throughput widefield NV microscope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 04:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

We\nmodel each flow's long-run guarantee as a worst-case service that maps each\nqueued arrival vector recording the flow's cumulative task arrivals, including\nthose initially queued, to a worst-case acceptable departure vector\nlower-bounding its cumulative task departures. We show these services to be\nstates that can be updated as tasks arrive and depart, and introduce\nstate-based scheduling. We find the schedulability condition that must be\npreserved to maintain all flows' long-run guarantees, and then use this\ncondition to identify, in each slot, all short-run scheduling decisions that\npreserve schedulability.\n  This framework is general but computationally complex. To reduce its\ncomplexity, we consider three specializations.

To reduce the wall-clock\ntraining time, a common practice is to increase the batch size and learning\nrate. However, such practice is often brittle and leads to a so-called\nstability-efficiency dilemma: increasing the batch sizes and learning rates\nleads to better training efficiency but can also result in training\ninstability, leading to poor generalization accuracy or failed runs. To better\nunderstand this phenomenon, we conduct an in-depth analysis on large-scale\npre-training experiments replicating the GPT-2 model. We find that there is a\nstrong correlation between training instability and extreme values of gradient\nvariance, and that samples with long sequence lengths contribute to these\nextreme gradient variance values, especially at the beginning of the training,\nindicating that long sequence length can be a main source of training\ninstability. Based on the analysis, we present a Sequence Length Warmup method\nthat aims to solve the training stability-efficiency dilemma. Experiments\nreplicating GPT-2 models show that our approach enables stable training with 8x\nlarger batch size and 4x larger learning rate, whereas the baseline approach\nstruggles with training instability.

To make the previous PA focus more on dense\nsubgraphs, we propose a multi-stage graph peeling algorithm (M-PA) that has a\ntwo-stage data screening procedure added before the previous PA. After removing\nvertices from the graph based on the user-defined thresholds, we can reduce the\ngraph complexity largely and without affecting the vertices in subgraphs that\nwe are interested in. We show that M-PA is more efficient than the previous PA\nand with the properly set filtering threshold, can produce very similar if not\nidentical dense subgraphs to the previous PA (in terms of graph density and\nclustering coefficient).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 07:06:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

In particular, an encoder\nbased on the dense block and a decoder form a symmetrical structure of U-Net\nare jointly staked to realize an effective feature extraction and image\nreconstruction. Besides, a transfer module based on MFA and \"adaptive instance\nnormalization\" (AdaIN) is inserted in the skip connection positions to achieve\nthe stylization.

Given the capability of IRSs in intelligently\nreconfiguring wireless channels over time, it is fundamentally unknown which\nmultiple access scheme is superior for MEC UL offloading. To answer this\nquestion, we first investigate the impact of three different dynamic IRS\nbeamforming (DIBF) schemes on the computation rate of both offloading schemes,\nbased on the flexibility for the IRS in adjusting its beamforming (BF) vector\nin each transmission frame. Under the DIBF framework, computation rate\nmaximization problems are formulated for both the NOMA and TDMA schemes,\nrespectively, by jointly optimizing the IRS passive BF and the resource\nallocation. We rigorously prove that offloading adopting TDMA can achieve the\nsame computation rate as that of NOMA, when all the devices share the same IRS\nBF vector during the UL offloading. By contrast, offloading exploiting TDMA\noutperforms NOMA, when the IRS BF vector can be flexibly adapted for UL\noffloading.

In this work, we focus on diffusion MRI in gray matter,\nwhich requires rethinking basic microstructure modeling blocks. In particular,\nat least three contributions beyond the SM need to be considered: water\nexchange across the cell membrane - between neurites and the extracellular\nspace; non-Gaussian diffusion along neuronal and glial processes - resulting\nfrom structural disorder; and signal contribution from soma. For the first\ncontribution, we propose Neurite Exchange Imaging (NEXI) as an extension of the\nSM of diffusion, which builds on the anisotropic K\\\"arger model of two\nexchanging compartments. Using datasets acquired at multiple diffusion\nweightings (b) and diffusion times (t) in the rat brain in vivo, we show that\nfor the investigated diffusion time window (~10-45 ms) there is minimal\ndiffusivity time-dependence and more pronounced kurtosis decay with time in\ngray matter, which is well fit by the exchange model. Moreover, we observe\nlower signal for longer diffusion times at high b. In light of these\nobservations, we identify exchange as the mechanism that best explains these\nsignal signatures in both low-b and high-b regime, and thereby propose NEXI as\nthe minimal model for gray matter microstructure mapping. We finally highlight\nmulti-b multi-t acquisitions protocols as being best suited to estimate NEXI\nmodel parameters reliably. Using this approach, we estimate the\ninter-compartment water exchange time to be 15 - 60 ms in the rat cortex and\nhippocampus in vivo, which is of the same order or shorter than the diffusion\ntime in typical diffusion MRI acquisitions. This suggests water exchange as an\nessential component for interpreting diffusion MRI measurements in gray matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 08:34:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 21:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

These technologies must ultimately be brought directly to\nthe edge to fully harness the power of deep learning for the IoT. The obvious\nchallenge is that deep learning techniques can only be implemented on strictly\nresource-constrained edge devices if the models are radically downsized. This\ntask relies on different model compression techniques, such as network pruning,\nquantization, and the recent advancement of XNOR-Net. This study examines the\nsuitability of these techniques for audio classification on microcontrollers.\nWe present an application of XNOR-Net for end-to-end raw audio classification\nand a comprehensive empirical study comparing this approach with\npruning-and-quantization methods. We show that raw audio classification with\nXNOR yields comparable performance to regular full precision networks for small\nnumbers of classes while reducing memory requirements 32-fold and computation\nrequirements 58-fold.

However, the learning processes of domain-invariant features and source\nhypothesis inevitably involve domain-specific information that would degrade\nthe generalizability of UDA models on the target domain. In this paper,\nmotivated by the lottery ticket hypothesis that only partial parameters are\nessential for generalization, we find that only partial parameters are\nessential for learning domain-invariant information and generalizing well in\nUDA. Such parameters are termed transferable parameters. In contrast, the other\nparameters tend to fit domain-specific details and often fail to generalize,\nwhich we term as untransferable parameters. Driven by this insight, we propose\nTransferable Parameter Learning (TransPar) to reduce the side effect brought by\ndomain-specific information in the learning process and thus enhance the\nmemorization of domain-invariant information. Specifically, according to the\ndistribution discrepancy degree, we divide all parameters into transferable and\nuntransferable ones in each training iteration. We then perform separate\nupdates rules for the two types of parameters. Extensive experiments on image\nclassification and regression tasks (keypoint detection) show that TransPar\noutperforms prior arts by non-trivial margins. Moreover, experiments\ndemonstrate that TransPar can be integrated into the most popular deep UDA\nnetworks and be easily extended to handle any data distribution shift\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 09:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

In\nthis paper, we handle the critical issue, slow training convergence, and\npresent a conditional cross-attention mechanism for fast DETR training. Our\napproach is motivated by that the cross-attention in DETR relies highly on the\ncontent embeddings for localizing the four extremities and predicting the box,\nwhich increases the need for high-quality content embeddings and thus the\ntraining difficulty. Our approach, named conditional DETR, learns a conditional\nspatial query from the decoder embedding for decoder multi-head\ncross-attention. The benefit is that through the conditional spatial query,\neach cross-attention head is able to attend to a band containing a distinct\nregion, e.g., one object extremity or a region inside the object box. This\nnarrows down the spatial range for localizing the distinct regions for object\nclassification and box regression, thus relaxing the dependence on the content\nembeddings and easing the training.

We also parallelize multiple\ndifferentiation operations on the same device and implement higher-order\ndifferentiators. Our \"over-the-air\" temporal differentiator for microwave\ncarriers may find civilian and military applications in processing wireless\ncommunication or radar signals, for data segmentation and compression, as well\nas machine vision and hearing.

However, recent studies have shown evident weaknesses of\nsuch models against adversarial perturbations. In a real-world scenario\ninstead, like autonomous driving, more attention should be devoted to\nreal-world adversarial examples (RWAEs), which are physical objects (e.g.,\nbillboards and printable patches) optimized to be adversarial to the entire\nperception pipeline. This paper presents an in-depth evaluation of the\nrobustness of popular SS models by testing the effects of both digital and\nreal-world adversarial patches. These patches are crafted with powerful attacks\nenriched with a novel loss function. Firstly, an investigation on the\nCityscapes dataset is conducted by extending the Expectation Over\nTransformation (EOT) paradigm to cope with SS. Then, a novel attack\noptimization, called scene-specific attack, is proposed. Such an attack\nleverages the CARLA driving simulator to improve the transferability of the\nproposed EOT-based attack to a real 3D environment. Finally, a printed physical\nbillboard containing an adversarial patch was tested in an outdoor driving\nscenario to assess the feasibility of the studied attacks in the real world.\nExhaustive experiments revealed that the proposed attack formulations\noutperform previous work to craft both digital and real-world adversarial\npatches for SS. At the same time, the experimental results showed how these\nattacks are notably less effective in the real world, hence questioning the\npractical relevance of adversarial attacks to SS models for autonomous/assisted\ndriving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 11:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-16"}

Parking slot detection performance has been dramatically improved by\ndeep learning techniques. Deep learning-based object detection methods can be\ncategorized into one-stage and two-stage approaches. Although it is well-known\nthat the two-stage approach outperforms the one-stage approach in general\nobject detection, they have performed similarly in parking slot detection so\nfar. We consider this is because the two-stage approach has not yet been\nadequately specialized for parking slot detection. Thus, this paper proposes a\nhighly specialized two-stage parking slot detector that uses region-specific\nmulti-scale feature extraction. In the first stage, the proposed method finds\nthe entrance of the parking slot as a region proposal by estimating its center,\nlength, and orientation. The second stage of this method designates specific\nregions that most contain the desired information and extracts features from\nthem. That is, features for the location and orientation are separately\nextracted from only the specific regions that most contain the locational and\norientational information. In addition, multi-resolution feature maps are\nutilized to increase both positioning and classification accuracies. A\nhigh-resolution feature map is used to extract detailed information (location\nand orientation), while another low-resolution feature map is used to extract\nsemantic information (type and occupancy). In experiments, the proposed method\nwas quantitatively evaluated with two large-scale public parking slot detection\ndatasets and outperformed previous methods, including both one-stage and\ntwo-stage approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 12:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-16"}

The\nmethod is well suited to experimentally obtain amplitude-dependent modal\nproperties (modal frequency, damping ratio and deflection shape) for strongly\nnonlinear systems. To isolate a nonlinear mode, the negative viscous damping\nterm of the extended periodic motion concept is approximated by ensuring phase\nresonance between excitation and response. In this work, an alternative\napproach to isolate a nonlinear mode is developed and analyzed: velocity\nfeedback. The accuracy of the extracted modal properties and robustness of\nvelocity feedback is first assessed by means of simulated experiments. The two\napproaches phase resonance and velocity feedback are then compared in terms of\naccuracy and experimental implementation effort. To this end, both approaches\nare applied to an experimental specimen, which is a cantilevered beam\ninfluenced by a strong dry friction nonlinearity. In this work, the discussion\nis limited to single-point excitation. It is shown that a robust implementation\nof velocity feedback requires the measurement of several response signals,\ndistributed over the structure. An advantage of velocity feedback is that no\ncontroller is needed.

In addition, most existing semi-supervised\napproaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts,\nand also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic\ninformation, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we\npresent SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly\nadvances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning.

However, due to the limitations of data collection, including\ninfrastructure density, user privacy, and business security, such fine-grained\ndata is hard to collect and usually, only coarse-grained data is available.\nThus, obtaining fine-grained population distribution from coarse-grained\ndistribution becomes an important problem. To tackle this problem, existing\nmethods mainly rely on sufficient fine-grained ground truth for training, which\nis not often available for the majority of cities. That limits the applications\nof these methods and brings the necessity to transfer knowledge between\ndata-sufficient source cities to data-scarce target cities.\n  In knowledge transfer scenario, we employ single reference fine-grained\nground truth in target city, which is easy to obtain via remote sensing or\nquestionnaire, as the ground truth to inform the large-scale urban structure\nand support the knowledge transfer in target city. By this approach, we\ntransform the fine-grained population mapping problem into a one-shot transfer\nlearning problem.

However, the deployment of intrusion detection methods falls\nshort. One of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic evaluation\ndatasets, which makes it a challenge to develop techniques and compare them.\nThis is caused by the large amounts of effort it takes for a cyber analyst to\nclassify network connections. This has raised the need for methods (i) that can\nlearn from small sets of labeled data, (ii) that can make predictions on large\nsets of unlabeled data, and (iii) that request the label of only specially\nselected unlabeled data instances. Hence, Active Learning (AL) methods are of\ninterest. These approaches choose specific unlabeled instances by a query\nfunction that are expected to improve overall classification performance. The\nresulting query observations are labeled by a human expert and added to the\nlabeled set.\n  In this paper, we propose a new hybrid AL method called Jasmine. Firstly, it\ndetermines how suitable each observation is for querying, i.e., how likely it\nis to enhance classification. These properties are the uncertainty score and\nanomaly score. Secondly, Jasmine introduces dynamic updating. This allows the\nmodel to adjust the balance between querying uncertain, anomalous and randomly\nselected observations. To this end, Jasmine is able to learn the best query\nstrategy during the labeling process. This is in contrast to the other AL\nmethods in cybersecurity that all have static, predetermined query functions.\nWe show that dynamic updating, and therefore Jasmine, is able to consistently\nobtain good and more robust results than querying only uncertainties, only\nanomalies or a fixed combination of the two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 13:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

Because in\nthese scenarios the stakes are high, it is desirable for decision systems to\nnot only provide recommendations but supply transparent reasoning in support\nthereof. For learning-based systems, this can be achieved through an\ninterpretable design of the inference pipeline. Herein we describe an automated\nyet interpretable system for uveal melanoma subtyping with digital cytology\nimages from fine needle aspiration biopsies. Our method embeds every\nautomatically segmented cell of a candidate cytology image as a point in a 2D\nmanifold defined by many representative slides, which enables reasoning about\nthe cell-level composition of the tissue sample, paving the way for\ninterpretable subtyping of the biopsy. Finally, a rule-based slide-level\nclassification algorithm is trained on the partitions of the circularly\ndistorted 2D manifold. This process results in a simple rule set that is\nevaluated automatically but highly transparent for human verification. On our\nin house cytology dataset of 88 uveal melanoma patients, the proposed method\nachieves an accuracy of 87.5% that compares favorably to all competing\napproaches, including deep \"black box\" models. The method comes with a user\ninterface to facilitate interaction with cell-level content, which may offer\nadditional insights for pathological assessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 13:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-16"}

This phenomenon is known as\n(quantum) self-testing.\n  Self-testing constitutes a significant research area with practical and\ntheoretical ramifications for quantum information theory. But since its\nconception two decades ago by Mayers and Yao, the common way to rigorously\nformulate self-testing has been in terms of operator-algebraic identities, and\nthis formulation lacks an operational interpretation. In particular, it is\nunclear how to formulate self-testing in other physical theories, in\nformulations of quantum theory not referring to operator-algebra, or in\nscenarios causally different from the standard one.\n  In this paper, we explain how to understand quantum self-testing\noperationally, in terms of causally structured dilations of the input-output\nchannel encoding the correlations. These dilations model side-information which\nleaks to an environment according to a specific schedule, and we show how\nself-testing concerns the relative strength between such scheduled leaks of\ninformation. As such, the title of our paper has double meaning: we recast\nconventional quantum self-testing in terms of information-leaks to an\nenvironment -- and this realises quantum self-testing as a special case within\nthe surroundings of a general operational framework.\n  Our new approach to quantum self-testing not only supplies an operational\nunderstanding apt for various generalisations, but also resolves some\nunexplained aspects of the existing definition, naturally suggests a distance\nmeasure suitable for robust self-testing, and points towards self-testing as a\nmodular concept in a larger, cryptographic perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 14:06:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 09:36:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 10:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

Forecasts help operators schedule power generation in advance to\nmaximise economic value, mitigate downstream flood risk, and meet environmental\nrequirements. The horizon of operational inflow forecasts is often limited in\nrange to ~2 weeks ahead, marking the predictability barrier of deterministic\nweather forecasts. Reliable inflow forecasts in the sub-seasonal to seasonal\n(S2S) range would allow operators to take proactive action to mitigate risks of\nadverse weather conditions, thereby improving water management and increasing\nrevenue. This study outlines a method of deriving skilful S2S inflow forecasts\nusing a case study reservoir in the Scottish Highlands. We generate ensemble\ninflow forecasts by training a linear regression model for the observed inflow\nonto S2S ensemble precipitation predictions from the European Centre for\nMedium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). Subsequently, post-processing\ntechniques from Ensemble Model Output Statistics are applied to derive\ncalibrated S2S probabilistic inflow forecasts, without the application of a\nseparate hydrological model. We find the S2S probabilistic inflow forecasts\nhold skill relative to climatological forecasts up to 6 weeks ahead. The inflow\nforecasts hold greater skill during winter compared with summer. The forecasts,\nhowever, struggle to predict high summer inflows, even at short lead-times. The\npotential for the S2S probabilistic inflow forecasts to improve water\nmanagement and deliver increased economic value is confirmed using a stylised\ncost model. While applied to hydropower forecasting, the results and methods\npresented here are relevant to broader fields of water management and S2S\nforecasting applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 14:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-16"}

However, it remains nontrivial to better\nadaptively balance effective multi-modal information in the feature fusion\nphase. In this letter, we propose a novel gated recoding network (GRNet) to\nevaluate the information validity of the two modes, and balance their\ninfluence. Our framework is divided into three phases: perception phase,\nrecoding mixing phase and feature integration phase. First, A perception\nencoder is adopted to extract multi-level single-modal features, which lays the\nfoundation for multi-modal semantic comparative analysis. Then, a\nmodal-adaptive gate unit (MGU) is proposed to suppress the invalid information\nand transfer the effective modal features to the recoding mixer and the hybrid\nbranch decoder. The recoding mixer is responsible for recoding and mixing the\nbalanced multi-modal information. Finally, the hybrid branch decoder completes\nthe multi-level feature integration under the guidance of an optional edge\nguidance stream (OEGS). Experiments and analysis on eight popular benchmarks\nverify that our framework performs favorably against 9 state-of-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 15:08:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 14:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Given that various models can be used for modelling one\nphysical phenomenon, the role of model comparison and model choice becomes\nparticularly important. Methods for model comparison and model choice typically\nused in practical applications nowadays are computation-based, and thus, time\nconsuming and computationally costly. Therefore, it is necessary to develop\nother approaches for working abstractly, i.e. without computations, with\nmathematical models. The abstract description of mathematical models can be\nachieved by help of abstract mathematics, implying formalisation of models and\nrelations between them. In this paper, a category theory-based approach to\nmathematical modelling is proposed. On this way, mathematical models are\nformalised in the language of categories, relations between the models are\nformally defined, as well as several practically relevant properties are\nintroduced on the level of categories. Finally, an illustrative example is\npresented underlying how the category-theory based approach can be used in\npractice. Further, all constructions presented in this paper are also discussed\nfrom the modelling point of view by making explicit the link to concrete\nmodelling scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 15:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-16"}

This is unrepresentative of what\nstudents will encounter in practice and experiential learning. RESEARCH\nQUESTIONS: This study aims to answer three research questions. The questions\ninclude discovering the experiential observations of the students, contrasting\nthe performance of the students using one monitor versus those using two\nmonitors, and an investigation of the ways in which multiple monitors were\nemployed by the students. METHODOLOGY: Half of the students in the study had\naccess to multiple monitors. This was the only difference between the two study\ngroups. This study contrasts grade medians and conducts median-test evaluation.\nAdditionally, an experience survey facilitated likert-scale values and\nopen-ended feedback questions facilitated textual analysis. Limitations of the\nstudy include the small sample size (86 students) and lack of control of\nparticipant composition. FINDINGS: Students reacted very favorably in rating\ntheir experience using the intervention. Overall, the multiple-monitor group\nhad a slight performance improvement. Most improvement was in software-design\nand graphics assignments. Performance increased statistically significantly on\nthe interfaces-and-hierarchies labs.

The time-history of important\nBL quantities such as gas / wall temperatures, TBL thickness, wall heat flux,\nand relative energy lost at the wall are evaluated in these regimes.

The experimental\nresults show that the identification capability of the VTLayout is superior to\nthe most advanced method of DLA based on the PubLayNet dataset, and the F1\nscore is as high as 0.9599.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 17:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

We present an\nincremental learning solution to provide both the training efficiency and the\nmodel quality. Our solution is based on sequential Bayesian update and\nquadratic approximation. Our focus is on large-scale personalized logistic\nregression models, with extensions to deep learning models. This paper fills in\nthe gap between the theory and the practice by addressing a few implementation\nchallenges that arise when applying incremental learning to large personalized\nrecommender systems. Detailed offline and online experiments demonstrated our\napproach can significantly shorten the training time while maintaining the\nmodel accuracy. The solution is deployed in LinkedIn and directly applicable to\nindustrial scale recommender systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 04:21:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

Typically, the mismatch between\nhuman-generated and natural systems produces externalities and inefficiencies\nreflectable in spatial scales. The largely known problem of fit in water\ngovernance is investigated to detect the issues of fit between\nadministrative/institutional scales and the hydrological one in a lake basin.\nTo implement the idea, constraining the level of analysis interlinked to the\nconcentrated levels of administration in spatial scales, the fit of the\ngoverning system was analyzed by means of statistical mechanics. Modeling the\nstructure of water demand/supply governing system in a given region through the\nCurie-Weiss Mean Field approximation, the system cost in relation to its\nstructure and fit was appraised and compared with two other conceptual\nstructures in the Urmia Lake Basin in Iran. The methodology articulated an\nanalysis framework for exploring the effectiveness of the formulated water\ndemand/supply governing system and its fit to the relevant hydrological system.\nThe findings of this study may help developing strategies to encourage\nadaptations, rescaling/reforms for effective watershed management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 06:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}

There is a considerable body of research and practice that\naddresses forest restoration. However, there has been little work by computer\nscientists to bring powerful computational techniques to bear on this important\narea of work, perhaps due to a lack of awareness. In an attempt to bridge this\ngap, we present our vision of how techniques from computer science, broadly\nspeaking, can aid current practice in forest restoration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 16:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-17"}
