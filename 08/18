In recent years,\nParallel Imaging (PI) and Compressed Sensing (CS) have been utilised to\naccelerate the MRI acquisition. In clinical settings, subsampling the k-space\nmeasurements during scanning time using Cartesian trajectories, such as\nrectilinear sampling, is currently the most conventional CS approach applied\nwhich, however, is prone to producing aliased reconstructions. With the advent\nof the involvement of Deep Learning (DL) in accelerating the MRI,\nreconstructing faithful images from subsampled data became increasingly\npromising. Retrospectively applying a subsampling mask onto the k-space data is\na way of simulating the accelerated acquisition of k-space data in real\nclinical setting. In this paper we compare and provide a review for the effect\nof applying either rectilinear or radial retrospective subsampling on the\nquality of the reconstructions outputted by trained deep neural networks. With\nthe same choice of hyper-parameters, we train and evaluate two distinct\nRecurrent Inference Machines (RIMs), one for each type of subsampling. The\nqualitative and quantitative results of our experiments indicate that the model\ntrained on data with radial subsampling attains higher performance and learns\nto estimate reconstructions with higher fidelity paving the way for other DL\napproaches to involve radial subsampling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 17:45:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 21:06:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

It is generally\nimplemented by two components: an optical encoder that compresses HD signals\ninto a 2D measurement and an algorithm decoder that retrieves the HD data upon\nthe hardware-encoded measurement. Over a broad range of SCI applications,\nhyperspectral imaging (HSI) and video compressive sensing have received\nsignificant research attention in recent years. Among existing SCI\nreconstruction algorithms, deep learning-based methods stand out as their\npromising performance and efficient inference. However, the deep reconstruction\nnetwork may suffer from overlarge model size and highly-specialized network\ndesign, which inevitably lead to costly training time, high memory usage, and\nlimited flexibility, thus discouraging the deployments of SCI systems in\npractical scenarios. In this paper, we tackle the above challenges by proposing\na simple yet highly efficient reconstruction method, namely stacked residual\nnetwork (SRN), by revisiting the residual learning strategy with nested\nstructures and spatial-invariant property. The proposed SRN empowers\nhigh-fidelity data retrieval with fewer computation operations and negligible\nmodel size compared with existing networks, and also serves as a versatile\nbackbone applicable for both hyperspectral and video data.

Moreover, the sign information for each eigenstate of\nthe solution is lost once the measurement is made, although the sign is\nsignificant. Therefore, the na\\\"ive iterative method of the HHL algorithm may\nslow down, especially, when the solution includes wrong signs. In this paper,\nwe propose and evaluate an improved iterative method for the HHL algorithm that\nis robust against the sign information loss, in terms of the number of\niterations and the computational accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 16:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

Particularly, we survey physical\nproperties of the magnetically charged black hole, thermodynamic properties,\nobservational appearance, quasinormal modes and absorption cross sections. We\nthen show that the black hole gets colder with increasing charge. Investigating\nthe heat capacity, we see that the black hole is thermally stable, which is\namplified by introduction of a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) with a\nquantum gravity parameter $\\lambda$. Then we compute the deflection angle at\nthe weak field limit, by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and the geodesic equation,\nshowing that the magnetic charge has a contribution at the first order. By\nray-tracing we simulate the observational appearance of a NED black hole with\nthin disk and spherical accretion. We find that the parameter $P$ has a very\nstrong effect on the shadow radius. We consider quasinormal modes under\nmassless scalar perturbations of the black hole and the greybody factor. We\nfind that the charge introduces a slight difference in the fundamental\nfrequency and that the greybody factor of the NED black hole is strongly\nsteepened by the introduction of increasing charge.

We\nfocus on the setting in which labelled data are only available in a source\ndomain DS, but not in a target domain DT. Our method is based on adversarial\ntraining of an appearance adaptation network (AAN) that transforms images from\nDS such that they look like images from DT. Together with the original label\nmaps from DS, the transformed images are used to adapt a DNN to DT. We propose\na joint training strategy of the AAN and the classifier, which constrains the\nAAN to transform the images such that they are correctly classified. In this\nway, objects of a certain class are changed such that they resemble objects of\nthe same class in DT. To further improve the adaptation performance, we propose\na new regularization loss for the discriminator network used in domain\nadversarial training. We also address the problem of finding the optimal values\nof the trained network parameters, proposing an unsupervised entropy based\nparameter selection criterion which compensates for the fact that there is no\nvalidation set in DT that could be monitored.

After a review of classical solutions, also connecting to\ndescriptions of higher-dimensional black holes, it overviews the canonical\nquantum treatment of the full evolution, including gravitational dynamics.\nDerived in an approximation to this, following conversion to \"perturbation\npicture,\" is the evolution of the quantum matter on the background geometry.\nFeatures of the evolving matter state are described, based on choice of a time\nslicing to put the evolution into ADM form. The choices of slicing as well as\ncoordinates on the slices result in different quantum \"pictures\" for treating\nthe evolution. If such a description is based on smooth trans-horizon slices,\nthat avoids explicit reference to ultra-planckian modes familiar from\ntraditional treatments, and exhibits the Hawking excitations as emerging from a\n\"quantum atmosphere\" with thickness comparable to the inverse temperature.\nDetailed study of the state exhibits the entanglement structure between Hawking\nquanta and the partner excitations inside the black hole, and the corresponding\n\"missing information.\" This explicit description also allows direct study of\nthe evolution and features, e.g. as seen by infalling observers, of these\npartner excitations, helping to address various puzzles with them. Explicit\ntreatment of the evolving state, and its extension to higher dimensions,\nprovides further connections to information theory and a starting point for\nstudy of corrections that can unitarize evolution, arising from new quantum\ngravity effects -- whether wormholes or something entirely different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 18:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

We find that a weak\npartial measurement can decrease the uncertainty between two incompatible\n(non-commuting) observables.

A major\nbarrier to shorter charge times is the accelerated aging of the battery at\nhigher charging rates, which can be driven by lithium plating, increased solid\nelectrolyte interphase growth due to elevated temperatures, and particle\ncracking due to mechanical stress. Lithium plating depends on the overpotential\nof the negative electrode, and mechanical stress depends on the concentration\ngradient, both of which cannot be measured directly.

Despite great successes, the\nability of CNNs in learning global contexts is limited. Recently, the vision\ntransformer has achieved revolutionary progress in computer vision owing to its\npowerful modeling of global dependencies. However, directly applying the\ntransformer to SOD is suboptimal because the transformer lacks the ability to\nlearn local spatial representations. To this end, this paper explores the\ncombination of transformers and CNNs to learn both global and local\nrepresentations for SOD. We propose a transformer-based Asymmetric Bilateral\nU-Net (ABiU-Net). The asymmetric bilateral encoder has a transformer path and a\nlightweight CNN path, where the two paths communicate at each encoder stage to\nlearn complementary global contexts and local spatial details, respectively.\nThe asymmetric bilateral decoder also consists of two paths to process features\nfrom the transformer and CNN encoder paths, with communication at each decoder\nstage for decoding coarse salient object locations and fine-grained object\ndetails, respectively. Such communication between the two encoder/decoder paths\nenables AbiU-Net to learn complementary global and local representations,\ntaking advantage of the natural properties of transformers and CNNs,\nrespectively. Hence, ABiU-Net provides a new perspective for transformer-based\nSOD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABiU-Net performs favorably against\nprevious state-of-the-art SOD methods.

We observe \"bursts\" of new gene creation in F1\nhybrids of D. yakuba and D. santomea, a species complex known to hybridize in\nnature. The number of new genes is higher in the gonads than soma. We observe\nasymmetry in new gene creation based on the direction of the cross. Greater\nnumbers of new transcripts form in the testes of F1 male offspring in D.\nsantomea female x D. yakuba male crosses and greater numbers of new transcripts\nappear in ovaries of F1 female offspring of D. yakuba female x D. santomea\nmale. These loci represent wholly new transcripts expressed in hybrids, but not\nin either parental reference strain of the cross. We further observe allelic\nactivation, where transcripts silenced in one lineage are activated by the\ntranscriptional machinery of the other genome. These results point to a\nfundamentally new model of new gene creation that does not rely on the\nformation of new mutations in the DNA. These results suggest that bursts of\ngenetic novelty can appear in response to hybridization or introgression in a\nsingle generation. Ultimately these processes are expected to contribute to the\nsubstrate of genetic novelty available in nature, with broad impacts on our\nunderstanding new gene formation and on hybrid phenotypes in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 20:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

Iron deposition occurs in\nconjunction with this loss. Loss of nigral neurons should remove barriers for\ndiffusion and increase diffusivity of water molecules in regions undergoing\nthis loss. In metrics from single-compartment diffusion tensor imaging models,\nthese changes should manifest as increases in mean diffusivity and the free\nwater compartment as well as and reductions in fractional anisotropy. However,\nstudies examining nigral diffusivity changes from PD with single-compartment\nmodels have yielded inconclusive results and emerging evidence in control\nsubjects indicates that iron corrupts diffusivity metrics derived from\nsingle-compartment models.\n  Iron-sensitive data and diffusion data were analyzed in two cohorts. The\neffect of iron on diffusion measures from single- and bi-compartment models was\nassessed in both cohorts.\n  Measures sensitive to the free water compartment and iron content were found\nto increase in substantia nigra of the PD group in both cohorts. However,\ndiffusion markers derived from the single-compartment model were not replicated\nacross cohorts. Correlations were seen between single-compartment diffusion\nmeasures and iron markers in the discovery cohort and validation cohort but no\ncorrelation was observed between a measure from the bi-compartment model\nrelated to the free water compartment and iron markers in either cohort.\n  The variability of single-compartment nigral diffusion metrics in PD may be\nattributed to competing influences of increased iron content, which drives\ndiffusivity down, and increases in the free water compartment, which drives\ndiffusivity up. In contrast to diffusion metrics derived from the\nsingle-compartment model, no relationship was seen between iron and the free\nwater compartment in substantia nigra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 20:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

The peculiar\noutburst occurred 14 years after the classical nova event and lasted for more\nthan 400 days, reaching an amplitude of around 6 magnitudes in the optical.\nEarly spectral follow-up revealed what could be a dwarf nova (accretion disk\ninstability) outburst. However, the outburst duration, high velocity\n($>$2000\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$) features in the optical line profiles, luminous optical\nemission, and presence of prominent long-lasting radio emission together\nsuggest a phenomenon more exotic and energetic than a dwarf nova outburst. The\noutburst amplitude, radiated energy, and spectral evolution are also not\nconsistent with a classical nova eruption. There are similarities between\nV1047~Cen's 2019 outburst and those of classical symbiotic stars, but pre-2005\nimages of the field of V1047~Cen indicate that the system likely hosts a dwarf\ncompanion, implying a typical cataclysmic variable system. Based on our\nmulti-wavelength observations, we suggest that the outburst may have started\nwith a brightening of the disk due to enhanced mass transfer or disk\ninstability, possibly leading to enhanced nuclear shell burning on the white\ndwarf, which was already experiencing some level of quasi-steady shell burning.\nThis eventually led to the generation of a wind and/or bipolar, collimated\noutflows.

Drawing on psychology\ntheories that link affect and deception, we experimented with unimodal and\nmultimodal DBN-based approaches trained on facial valence, facial arousal,\naudio, and visual features. In addition to using facial affect as a feature on\nwhich DBN models are trained, we also introduce a DBN training procedure that\nuses facial affect as an aligner of audio-visual representations. We conducted\nclassification experiments with unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Model clustering\nto evaluate our approaches. Our best unsupervised approach (trained on facial\nvalence and visual features) achieved an AUC of 80%, outperforming human\nability and performing comparably to fully-supervised models. Our results\nmotivate future work on unsupervised, affect-aware computational approaches for\ndetecting deception and other social behaviors in the wild.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 22:07:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 19:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

The ASG corrections are implemented\nvia renormalization group methods, which, as consequence, provides a new tensor\n$X_{\\mu\\nu}$ as a source to improved field equations, and promotes the Newton's\nconstant into a running coupling constant. In particular, we check whether the\nradial energy conditions are satisfied and compare with the results obtained\nfrom the usual theory. We show that only in the particular case of the wormhole\nbeing asymptotically flat(Schwarzschild Wormholes) that the radial energy\nconditions are satisfied at the throat, depending on the chosen values for its\nradius $r_0$. In contrast, in the general Schwarzschild-like case, there is no\npossibility of the energy conditions being satisfied nearby the throat, as in\nthe usual case.

However, in the real world,\nillumination variation caused by diverse lighting conditions cannot be fully\ncovered by the limited face dataset. In this paper, we study the threat of\nlighting against FR from a new angle, i.e., adversarial attack, and identify a\nnew task, i.e., adversarial relighting. Given a face image, adversarial\nrelighting aims to produce a naturally relighted counterpart while fooling the\nstate-of-the-art deep FR methods. To this end, we first propose the physical\nmodelbased adversarial relighting attack (ARA) denoted as albedoquotient-based\nadversarial relighting attack (AQ-ARA). It generates natural adversarial light\nunder the physical lighting model and guidance of FR systems and synthesizes\nadversarially relighted face images. Moreover, we propose the auto-predictive\nadversarial relighting attack (AP-ARA) by training an adversarial relighting\nnetwork (ARNet) to automatically predict the adversarial light in a one-step\nmanner according to different input faces, allowing efficiency-sensitive\napplications. More importantly, we propose to transfer the above digital\nattacks to physical ARA (PhyARA) through a precise relighting device, making\nthe estimated adversarial lighting condition reproducible in the real world. We\nvalidate our methods on three state-of-the-art deep FR methods, i.e., FaceNet,\nArcFace, and CosFace, on two public datasets.

However, such applications have focused primarily on the (important)\nproblem of fitting accurate central estimates of the outstanding claims. In\npractice, properties regarding the variability of outstanding claims are\nequally important (e.g., quantiles for regulatory purposes).\n  In this paper we fill this gap by applying a Mixture Density Network (\"MDN\")\nto loss reserving. The approach combines a neural network architecture with a\nmixture Gaussian distribution to achieve simultaneously an accurate central\nestimate along with flexible distributional choice. Model fitting is done using\na rolling-origin approach. Our approach consistently outperforms the classical\nover-dispersed model both for central estimates and quantiles of interest, when\napplied to a wide range of simulated environments of various complexity and\nspecifications.\n  We further extend the MDN approach by proposing two extensions. Firstly, we\npresent a hybrid GLM-MDN approach called \"ResMDN\". This hybrid approach\nbalances the tractability and ease of understanding of a traditional GLM model\non one hand, with the additional accuracy and distributional flexibility\nprovided by the MDN on the other. We show that it can successfully improve the\nerrors of the baseline ccODP, although there is generally a loss of performance\nwhen compared to the MDN in the examples we considered. Secondly, we allow for\nexplicit projection constraints, so that actuarial judgement can be directly\nincorporated in the modelling process.\n  Throughout, we focus on aggregate loss triangles, and show that our\nmethodologies are tractable, and that they out-perform traditional approaches\neven with relatively limited amounts of data.

Recently, federated learning (FL) is an\nemerging paradigm that features decentralized learning on client's local data\nwith a privacy-preserving capability. And, while learning GANs to synthesize\nimages on FL systems has just been demonstrated, it is unknown if GANs for\ntabular data can be learned from decentralized data sources. Moreover, it\nremains unclear which distributed architecture suits them best. Different from\nimage GANs, state-of-the-art tabular GANs require prior knowledge on the data\ndistribution of each (discrete and continuous) column to agree on a common\nencoding -- risking privacy guarantees. In this paper, we propose Fed-TGAN, the\nfirst Federated learning framework for Tabular GANs. To effectively learn a\ncomplex tabular GAN on non-identical participants, Fed-TGAN designs two novel\nfeatures: (i) a privacy-preserving multi-source feature encoding for model\ninitialization; and (ii) table similarity aware weighting strategies to\naggregate local models for countering data skew.

We present a\nretrieval-based personalized chatbot model, namely IMPChat, to learn an\nimplicit user profile from the user's dialogue history. We argue that the\nimplicit user profile is superior to the explicit user profile regarding\naccessibility and flexibility. IMPChat aims to learn an implicit user profile\nthrough modeling user's personalized language style and personalized\npreferences separately. To learn a user's personalized language style, we\nelaborately build language models from shallow to deep using the user's\nhistorical responses; To model a user's personalized preferences, we explore\nthe conditional relations underneath each post-response pair of the user.

This distribution is seen as especially\nuseful in situations in which the spot's price follows a negatively skewed\ndistribution and hence, Black-Scholes based (i.e. the log-normal distribution)\nmodeling is largely inapt. We apply the GG distribution as RND to modeling\ncurrent market option data on three large market-index ETFs, namely the SPY,\nIWM and QQQ as well as on the TLT (an ETF that tracks an index of long term US\nTreasury bonds). The current option chain of each of the three market-index\nETFs shows of a pronounced skew of their volatility `smile' which indicates a\nlikely distortion in the Black-Scholes modeling of such option data.

All three\nmarket-index ETFs exhibit negatively skewed distributions which are\nwell-matched with those derived under the GG distribution as RND. The\ninadequacy of the Black-Scholes modeling in such instances which involve\nnegatively skewed distribution is further illustrated by its impact on the\nhedging factor, delta, and the immediate implications to the retail trader.

A camera pair usually\nrequired lens undistortion and stereo calibration to provide an undistorted\nepipolar line calibrated image pair for accurate dense pixel disparity\ncomputation. Due to noise, object occlusion, repetitive or lack of texture and\nlimitation of matching algorithms, the pixel disparity accuracy usually suffers\nthe most at those object boundary areas. Although statistically the total\nnumber of pixel disparity errors might be low (under 2% according to the Kitti\nVision Benchmark of current top ranking algorithms), the percentage of these\ndisparity errors at object boundaries are very high.

In this\npaper, we propose a practical solution named degraded-reference IQA (DR-IQA),\nwhich exploits the inputs of IR models, degraded images, as references.\nSpecifically, we extract reference information from degraded images by\ndistilling knowledge from pristine-quality images. The distillation is achieved\nthrough learning a reference space, where various degraded images are\nencouraged to share the same feature statistics with pristine-quality images.\nAnd the reference space is optimized to capture deep image priors that are\nuseful for quality assessment. Note that pristine-quality images are only used\nduring training. Our work provides a powerful and differentiable metric for\nblind IRs, especially for GAN-based methods. Extensive experiments show that\nour results can even be close to the performance of full-reference settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 02:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

While being able to bring reliable\nrobustness, adversarial training (AT) methods in general favor high capacity\nmodels, i.e., the larger the model the better the robustness. This tends to\nlimit their effectiveness on small models, which are more preferable in\nscenarios where storage or computing resources are very limited (e.g., mobile\ndevices). In this paper, we leverage the concept of knowledge distillation to\nimprove the robustness of small models by distilling from adversarially trained\nlarge models. We first revisit several state-of-the-art AT methods from a\ndistillation perspective and identify one common technique that can lead to\nimproved robustness: the use of robust soft labels -- predictions of a robust\nmodel. Following this observation, we propose a novel adversarial robustness\ndistillation method called Robust Soft Label Adversarial Distillation (RSLAD)\nto train robust small student models. RSLAD fully exploits the robust soft\nlabels produced by a robust (adversarially-trained) large teacher model to\nguide the student's learning on both natural and adversarial examples in all\nloss terms. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our RSLAD approach\nover existing adversarial training and distillation methods in improving the\nrobustness of small models against state-of-the-art attacks including the\nAutoAttack.

To tackle this problem, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques\nare proposed to bridge the gap between different domains, for the purpose of\nimproving model performance without annotation in the target domain.\nParticularly, UDA has a great value for multimodal medical image analysis,\nwhere annotation difficulty is a practical concern. However, most existing UDA\nmethods can only achieve satisfactory improvements in one adaptation direction\n(e.g., MRI to CT), but often perform poorly in the other (CT to MRI), limiting\ntheir practical usage.

This framework employs a unified domain-aware pattern\nencoder which not only can adaptively encode images in different domains\nthrough a domain controller, but also improve model efficiency by eliminating\nredundant parameters. Furthermore, to avoid distortion of contents and patterns\nof input images during the adaptation process, a content-pattern consistency\nloss is introduced.

First, previous studies either encode the document or extract\nlatent sentiment via neural networks, which are difficult to interpret the\nsentiment of reviewers intuitively. Second, they neglect the personalized\ninteraction of reviews with user/item, i.e., each review has different\ncontributions when modeling the sentiment preference of user/item. To remedy\nthese issues, we propose a Sentiment-aware Interactive Fusion Network (SIFN)\nfor review-based item recommendation. Specifically, we first encode user/item\nreviews via BERT and propose a light-weighted sentiment learner to extract\nsemantic features of each review. Then, we propose a sentiment prediction task\nthat guides the sentiment learner to extract sentiment-aware features via\nexplicit sentiment labels. Finally, we design a rating prediction task that\ncontains a rating learner with an interactive and fusion module to fuse the\nidentity (i.e., user and item ID) and each review representation so that\nvarious interactive features can synergistically influence the final rating\nscore.

A central feature of the new method is\nthe use of position-dependent weighting scheme that reduces the influence of\nnearby galaxies, which are typically overrepresented relative to the more\ndistant galaxies in most surveys. We demonstrate that the correlation functions\ncalculated this way are less susceptible to biases due to our particular\nlocation in the Universe, and thus are more easily comparable to linear theory\nand between surveys. Our results suggest that the parallel velocity correlation\nfunction is a promising cosmological probe, given that it provides a better\napproximation of a Gaussian distribution than other velocity correlation\nfunctions and that its bias is more easily minimized by weighting. Though the\nposition weighted parallel velocity correlation function increases the\nstatistical uncertainty, it decreases the cosmic variance and is expected to\nprovide more stable and tighter cosmological parameter constraints than other\ncorrelation methods in conjunction with more precise velocity surveys in the\nfuture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 08:40:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Self-Distillation Joint NLU model (SDJN) for\nmulti-intent NLU. First, we formulate multiple intent detection as a weakly\nsupervised problem and approach with multiple instance learning (MIL). Then, we\ndesign an auxiliary loop via self-distillation with three orderly arranged\ndecoders: Initial Slot Decoder, MIL Intent Decoder, and Final Slot Decoder. The\noutput of each decoder will serve as auxiliary information for the next\ndecoder. With the auxiliary knowledge provided by the MIL Intent Decoder, we\nset Final Slot Decoder as the teacher model that imparts knowledge back to\nInitial Slot Decoder to complete the loop. The auxiliary loop enables intents\nand slots to guide mutually in-depth and further boost the overall NLU\nperformance.

We\nintroduce Moser Flow (MF), a new class of generative models within the family\nof continuous normalizing flows (CNF). MF also produces a CNF via a solution to\nthe change-of-variable formula, however differently from other CNF methods, its\nmodel (learned) density is parameterized as the source (prior) density minus\nthe divergence of a neural network (NN). The divergence is a local, linear\ndifferential operator, easy to approximate and calculate on manifolds.\nTherefore, unlike other CNFs, MF does not require invoking or backpropagating\nthrough an ODE solver during training. Furthermore, representing the model\ndensity explicitly as the divergence of a NN rather than as a solution of an\nODE facilitates learning high fidelity densities. Theoretically, we prove that\nMF constitutes a universal density approximator under suitable assumptions.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate for the first time the use of flow models for\nsampling from general curved surfaces and achieve significant improvements in\ndensity estimation, sample quality, and training complexity over existing CNFs\non challenging synthetic geometries and real-world benchmarks from the earth\nand climate sciences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 09:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 18:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

Blazars emission is dominated by\nnon-thermal processes, where Doppler boosted radiation originates from a\nrelativistic population of charged particles within the jet. From radio to TeV\nenergies, blazars are highly variable on timescales from minutes to several\nmonths. There are several mechanisms proposed to explain variability, including\nchanges in the viewing angle of the jet, propagating along the rotation axis of\nthe accretion disc. The misalignment of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) spin\nand the angular momentum of the accretion disc yields to Lense-Thirring\nprecession of such tilted disc, which leads to the variation of Doppler\nbeaming. Such scenario is supported by radio observations of jet precession\nobserved in some AGNs. The radio-emitting regions, however, are located far\nfrom the central engine, and thus the observed time scales in this band can be\naffected by e.g. a variation of the bulk Lorentz factor along the jet. In this\ncontribution, we derive expected time scales of the jet wobbling using SMBH\nmasses and compare them with the time intervals between flares in long-term\n(over 15 years) X-ray light curves of bright blazars observed by Swift-XRT. We\nfound that for Mrk 421, Mrk 501 and 3C 273, the derived time scales are\nconsistent with the observational constraints, while for 1ES 1959+650 we are\nmostly limited by uncertainty in the Doppler beaming factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 09:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

It introduces the\nparameters directed tree-partition width (dtpw) and directed path-partition\nwidth (dppw) and shows that computing minimal witnesses remains NP-hard for\nMarkov chains with bounded dppw (and hence also for Markov chains with bounded\ndtpw). By observing that graphs of bounded dtpw have bounded width with respect\nto all known tree similarity measures for directed graphs, the hardness result\ncarries over to these other tree similarity measures. Technically, the\nreduction proceeds via the conceptually simpler matrix-pair chain problem,\nwhich is introduced and shown to be NP-complete for nonnegative matrices of\nfixed dimension. Furthermore, an algorithm which aims to utilise a given\ndirected tree partition of the system to compute a minimal witnessing subsystem\nis described. It enumerates partial subsystems for the blocks of the partition\nalong the tree order, and keeps only necessary ones. A preliminary experimental\nanalysis shows that it outperforms other approaches on certain benchmarks which\nhave directed tree partitions of small width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 09:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

They\nundergo large deformations and they exhibit a time-dependent mechanical\nbehaviour, i.e. they are viscoelastic. In this chapter we review the\nfoundations of the linear viscoelastic theory and the theory of Quasi-Linear\nViscoelasticity (QLV) in view of developing new methods to estimate the\nviscoelastic properties of soft tissues through model fitting. To this aim, we\nconsider the simple torsion of a viscoelastic Mooney-Rivlin material in two\ndifferent testing scenarios: step-strain and ramp tests. These tests are\ncommonly performed to characterise the time-dependent properties of soft\ntissues and allow to investigate their stress relaxation behaviour. Moreover,\ncommercial torsional rheometers measure both the torque and the normal force,\ngiving access to two sets of data. We show that for a step test, the linear and\nthe QLV models predict the same relaxation curves for the torque. However, when\nthe strain history is in the form of a ramp function, the non-linear terms\nappearing in the QLV model affect the relaxation curve of the torque depending\non the final strain level and on the rising time of the ramp. Furthermore, our\nresults show that the relaxation curve of the normal force predicted by the QLV\ntheory depends on the level of strain both for a step and a ramp tests. To\nquantify the effect of the non-linear terms, we evaluate the maximum and the\nequilibrium values of the relaxation curves. Our results provide useful\nguidelines to accurately fit QLV models in view of estimating the viscoelastic\nproperties of soft tissues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 10:19:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

Microservices are a recent\nmodularization approach with the specific requirements of independent\ndeployability and, in particular, decentralized data management.

We propose using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to\nfind the ground state of the KAFH on a quantum computer. We find efficient\nansatz circuits and show how physically interesting observables can be measured\nefficiently. To investigate the expressiveness and scaling of our ansatz\ncircuits we used classical, exact simulations of VQE for the KAFH for different\nlattices ranging from 8 to 24 qubits. We find that the fidelity with the ground\nstate approaches one exponentially in the circuit depth for all lattices\nconsidered, except for a 24-qubit lattice with an almost degenerate ground\nstate. We conclude that VQE circuits that are able to represent the ground\nstate of the KAFH on lattices inaccessible to exact diagonalisation techniques\nmay be achievable on near term quantum hardware. However, for large systems\ncircuits with many variational parameters are needed to achieve high fidelity\nwith the ground state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 10:58:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 15:11:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

In the\nsecond phase, CERT is introduced to learn the matching signals by discovering\ngraph features and sentence features of tuples collaboratively.

Hence, a THz IRS is expected to consist of a massive\nnumber of reflecting elements to compensate for those losses. However, as the\nIRS size grows, the conventional far-field assumption starts becoming invalid\nand the spherical wavefront of the radiated waves must be taken into account.\nIn this work, we focus on the near-field and analytically determine the IRS\nresponse in the Fresnel zone by leveraging electromagnetic theory.\nSpecifically, we derive a novel expression for the path loss and beampattern of\na holographic IRS, which is then used to model its discrete counterpart.

However, they\nstill suffer from several inherent challenges including: modelling forgetting\nbehaviours and identifying relationships among latent concepts. To address\nthese challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel knowledge tracing model,\nnamely \\emph{Deep Graph Memory Network} (DGMN). In this model, we incorporate a\nforget gating mechanism into an attention memory structure in order to capture\nforgetting behaviours dynamically during the knowledge tracing process.\nParticularly, this forget gating mechanism is built upon attention forgetting\nfeatures over latent concepts considering their mutual dependencies. Further,\nthis model has the capability of learning relationships between latent concepts\nfrom a dynamic latent concept graph in light of a student's evolving knowledge\nstates. A comprehensive experimental evaluation has been conducted using four\nwell-established benchmark datasets. The results show that DGMN consistently\noutperforms the state-of-the-art KT models over all the datasets. The\neffectiveness of modelling forgetting behaviours and learning latent concept\ngraphs has also been analyzed in our experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 12:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

However, the severe color inconsistency makes it very\nchallenging to generate well-aligned training pairs of input raw and target\nsRGB images. While learning with inaccurately aligned supervision is prone to\ncausing pixel shift and producing blurry results. In this paper, we circumvent\nsuch issue by presenting a joint learning model for image alignment and\nRAW-to-sRGB mapping. To diminish the effect of color inconsistency in image\nalignment, we introduce to use a global color mapping (GCM) module to generate\nan initial sRGB image given the input raw image, which can keep the spatial\nlocation of the pixels unchanged, and the target sRGB image is utilized to\nguide GCM for converting the color towards it. Then a pre-trained optical flow\nestimation network (e.g., PWC-Net) is deployed to warp the target sRGB image to\nalign with the GCM output. To alleviate the effect of inaccurately aligned\nsupervision, the warped target sRGB image is leveraged to learn RAW-to-sRGB\nmapping. When training is done, the GCM module and optical flow network can be\ndetached, thereby bringing no extra computation cost for inference.

We detect HI in 5 sources with a detection\nrate of $\\sim$19%, similar to the detection rate at lower redshifts. The\nrest-frame UV luminosities of most of the sources in the sample, including all\nthe detections, are below the proposed threshold above which the HI is supposed\nto have been ionised. The optical emission-line spectra show that despite their\nhigh radio powers, one-third of the sample, including two detections, are\nlow-ionisation sources. The radio continuum emission from the HI detections is\nunresolved at kpc scales, but is extended on parsec scales. The detections have\ncomplex HI 21cm absorption profiles with FWZI ranging from 60 km/s to 700 km/s\nand exhibit remarkably high HI column densities in the range 10$^{21}$\ncm$^{-2}$ to 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ for T$_{\\rm spin}=$100 K and unit covering\nfactor. A modelling of the HI 21cm absorption profiles suggests that in 2\nsources the gas is disturbed, and in 3 cases, including the one with disturbed\nHI, the majority of the absorption is consistent with arising from an HI disc.\nThough we detect no fast HI outflows, the optical emission lines in the HI\ndetections show the presence of highly disturbed gas in the nuclear region.\nSince some of our detections are low-ionisation AGN, this disturbance may be\ncaused by the radio jets. Overall, our findings point towards a continuation of\nthe low-$z$ trends in the incidence of HI in radio AGN up to $z \\sim 0.4$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 12:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

Extruders enable the continuous\nproduction of constant-cross-section profiles. Equipped with one or several\nscrew-shaped rotors, extruders transport polymer particles towards the outlet.\nDue to shear heating, melting is induced and a melt stream is created, which\ncan be further processed. While many variants of multi-screw extruders exist, a\nsignificant share of all extrusion machines is made up of single-screw\nextruders due to their comparatively low operating costs and complexity. While\nthe reduced complexity yields economic benefits, single-screw extruders' mixing\ncapabilities, i.e., their ability to produce a melt with a homogeneous material\nand temperature distribution, suffer compared to multi-screw extruders. To\ncompensate for this shortcoming, so-called mixing elements are added to the\nscrew to enhance mixing by recurring flow reorientations. In view of the\nlargely unintuitive flow characteristics of polymer melts, we present an\noptimization framework that allows designing these mixing elements numerically\nbased on finite-element simulations of the melt flow. To reduce the\ncomputational demand required by shape optimization of a complete mixing\nsection, we only focus on the shape optimization of a single mixing element.\nThis paper presents advances in three aspects of numerical design: (1) A\ncombination of free-form deformation and surface splines is presented, allowing\nto parameterize the mixing element's shape by very few variables.

We follow a bottom up approach where we\nspecify a control design (in Simulink) for a case inspired by Scuderia Ferrari\n(F1) and provide evidence for stability and safety. The design is then\ntransferred into code (in C) that is further optimized. Next, we define\nproperties that enable verifying whether the control properties still hold at\ncode level. Then, we consolidate the solution by mapping the properties in both\nworlds using specification patterns as common language and we verify the\ncorrectness of this mapping. The mapping offers a reusable artifact to solve\nsimilar problems. Finally, we outline opportunities for future work,\nparticularly to refine and extend the mapping and investigate how it can\nimprove the engineering of self-adaptive systems for both SE and CT engineers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 13:30:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 09:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

This amount of data has the potential to uncover\nthe evolutionary dynamics of a virus like never before. However, a million is\nalready several orders of magnitude beyond what can be processed by the\ntraditional methods designed to reconstruct a virus's evolutionary history,\nsuch as those that build a phylogenetic tree. Hence, new and scalable methods\nwill need to be devised in order to make use of the ever increasing number of\nviral sequences being collected.\n  Since identifying variants is an important part of understanding the\nevolution of a virus, in this paper, we propose an approach based on clustering\nsequences to identify the current major SARS-CoV-2 variants.

In\npursuit of better CD performance, it has become a tendency to design deeper and\nmore complicated FCNs, which inevitably brings about huge numbers of parameters\nand an unbearable computational burden. With the goal of designing a quite deep\narchitecture to obtain more precise CD results while simultaneously decreasing\nparameter numbers to improve efficiency, in this work, we present a very deep\nand efficient CD network, entitled EffCDNet. In EffCDNet, to reduce the\nnumerous parameters associated with deep architecture, an efficient convolution\nconsisting of depth-wise convolution and group convolution with a channel\nshuffle mechanism is introduced to replace standard convolutional layers. In\nterms of the specific network architecture, EffCDNet does not use mainstream\nUNet-like architecture, but rather adopts the architecture with a very deep\nencoder and a lightweight decoder. In the very deep encoder, two very deep\nsiamese streams stacked by efficient convolution first extract two highly\nrepresentative and informative feature maps from input image-pairs.\nSubsequently, an efficient ASPP module is designed to capture multi-scale\nchange information. In the lightweight decoder, a recurrent criss-cross\nself-attention (RCCA) module is applied to efficiently utilize non-local\nsimilar feature representations to enhance discriminability for each pixel,\nthus effectively separating the changed and unchanged regions. Moreover, to\ntackle the optimization problem in confused pixels, two novel loss functions\nbased on information entropy are presented. On two challenging CD datasets, our\napproach outperforms other SOTA FCN-based methods, with only benchmark-level\nparameter numbers and quite low computational overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 14:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

However, due to subsequent diagnostic difficulties,\nthe sensitivity of gastric X-ray is only 85.5%, and little research has been\ndone on automated diagnostic aids that directly target gastric cancer. This\npaper proposes a practical gastric cancer screening system for X-ray images\ntaken under realistic clinical imaging conditions. Our system not only provides\na diagnostic result for each image, but also provides an explanation for the\nresult by displaying candidate cancer areas with bounding boxes. Training\nobject detection models to do this was very expensive in terms of assigning\nsupervised labels, and had the disadvantage of not being able to use negative\n(i.e., non-cancer) data for training. Our proposal consists of two novel\ntechniques: (1) refined stochastic gastric image augmentation (R-sGAIA) and (2)\nhard boundary box training (HBBT). The R-sGAIA probabilistically highlights the\ngastric folds in the X-ray image based on medical knowledge, thus increasing\nthe detection efficiency of gastric cancer. The HBBT is a new, efficient, and\nversatile training method that can reduce the number of false positive\ndetections by actively using negative samples. The results showed that the\nproposed R-sGAIA and HBBT significantly improved the F1 score by 5.9% compared\nto the baseline EfficientDet-D7 + RandAugment (F1: 57.8%, recall: 90.2%,\nprecision: 42.5%). This score is higher than the physician's cancer detection\nrate, indicating that at least 2 out of 5 areas detected are cancerous,\nconfirming the utility of gastric cancer screening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 14:04:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 00:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

In this study, we propose a novel\nframework, termed SPNet} (Specificity-preserving network), which benefits SOD\nperformance by exploring both the shared information and modality-specific\nproperties (\\eg, specificity). Specifically, we propose to adopt two\nmodality-specific networks and a shared learning network to generate individual\nand shared saliency prediction maps, respectively. To effectively fuse\ncross-modal features in the shared learning network, we propose a\ncross-enhanced integration module (CIM) and then propagate the fused feature to\nthe next layer for integrating cross-level information.

Our findings are compared to corresponding results along an isotherm\nand an isochore. Confirming the theoretical prediction, the reduced-unit\ndynamics of the transverse momentum density is invariant to a good\napproximation along the isomorph at all time and length scales.

Using a spatially non-local hydrodynamic model for the transverse\nmomentum-density time-autocorrelation function, the macroscopic shear viscosity\nand its wave dependence are determined, demonstrating that the shear viscosity\nis isomorph invariant on all length scales studied. This analysis implies the\nexistence of a novel length scale which characterizes each isomorph.

To overcome the severe attenuation and relieve the high\npower consumption, massive MIMO with hybrid precoding has been widely\nconsidered for THz communication. However, accurate wideband channel estimation\nis challenging in THz massive MIMO systems. The existing wideband channel\nestimation schemes based on the ideal assumption of common sparse channel\nsupport will suffer from a severe performance loss due to the beam split\neffect. In this paper, we propose a beam split pattern detection based channel\nestimation scheme to realize reliable wideband channel estimation.\nSpecifically, a comprehensive analysis on the angle-domain sparse structure of\nthe wideband channel is provided by considering the beam split effect. Based on\nthe analysis, we define a series of index sets called as beam split patterns,\nwhich are proved to have a one-to-one match to different physical channel\ndirections. Inspired by this one-to-one match, we propose to estimate the\nphysical channel direction by exploiting beam split patterns at first. Then,\nthe sparse channel supports at different subcarriers can be obtained by\nutilizing a support detection window. This support detection window is\ngenerated by expanding the beam split pattern which is determined by the\nobtained physical channel direction. The above estimation procedure will be\nrepeated path by path until all path components are estimated.

It happens in the ultrastrong coupling regime where the\nsuperradiant field equilibrium is far from the vacuum state. The degree of\nstabilization varies abruptly with interaction parameters and increases with\nthe softness of the field mode. We analyze semiclassical origins of these\neffects and show their connection to various forms of excited-state quantum\nphase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 15:46:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 12:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

The basic framework of such algorithm is the auto-encoder like\nend-to-end architecture with an encoder, a noise layer and a decoder. The key\nto guarantee robustness is the adversarial training with the differential noise\nlayer. However, we found that none of the existing framework can well ensure\nthe robustness against JPEG compression, which is non-differential but is an\nessential and important image processing operation. To address such\nlimitations, we proposed a novel end-to-end training architecture, which\nutilizes Mini-Batch of Real and Simulated JPEG compression (MBRS) to enhance\nthe JPEG robustness. Precisely, for different mini-batches, we randomly choose\none of real JPEG, simulated JPEG and noise-free layer as the noise layer.\nBesides, we suggest to utilize the Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks which can\nlearn better feature in embedding and extracting stage, and propose a \"message\nprocessor\" to expand the message in a more appreciate way.

As a result, multicomponent mass diffusion, which is often neglected in\ndirect numerical simulations (DNS) of premixed combustion, has the potential to\nimpact both turbulence and flame characteristics at small scales. In this\nstudy, we evaluate these impacts by examining enstrophy dynamics and the\ninternal structure of the flame for lean premixed hydrogen-air combustion,\nneglecting secondary Soret and Dufour effects. We performed three-dimensional\nDNS of these flames by implementing the Stefan-Maxwell equations in the code\nNGA to represent multicomponent mass transport, and we simulated statistically\nplanar lean premixed hydrogen-air flames using both mixture-averaged and\nmulticomponent models. The mixture-averaged model underpredicts the peak\nenstrophy by up to 13% in the flame front. Comparing the enstrophy budgets of\nthese flames, the multicomponent simulation yields larger peak magnitudes\ncompared to the mixture-averaged simulation in the reaction zone, showing\ndifferences of 17% and 14% in the normalized stretching and viscous effects\nterms. In the super-adiabatic regions of the flame, the mixture-averaged model\noverpredicts the viscous effects by up to 13%. To assess the effect of these\ndifferences on flame structure, we reconstructed the average local internal\nstructure of the turbulent flame through statistical analysis of the scalar\ngradient field. Based on this analysis, we show that large differences in\nviscous effects contribute to significant differences in the average local\nflame structure between the two models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 05:15:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 19:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

The use of Candidate Lists (CLs) has been\nbrought up to cope with the issues. The procedure allows to restrict the search\nspace during solution creation, consequently reducing the solver computational\nburden. So far, ML were engaged to create CLs and values on the edges of these\nCLs expressing ML preferences at solution insertion. Although promising, these\nsystems do not clearly restrict what the ML learns and does to create\nsolutions, bringing with them some generalization issues. Therefore, motivated\nby exploratory and statistical studies, in this work we instead use a machine\nlearning model to confirm the addition in the solution just for high probable\nedges. CLs of the high probable edge are employed as input, and the ML is in\ncharge of distinguishing cases where such edges are in the optimal solution\nfrom those where they are not. . This strategy enables a better generalization\nand creates an efficient balance between machine learning and searching\ntechniques. Our ML-Constructive heuristic is trained on small instances.

We compare our results with classic constructive heuristics, showing good\nperformances for TSPLIB instances up to 1748 cities.

This is limiting for applications such as 3D CAD design that involve\nadjusting created shapes at multiple levels of detail. To address this, we\nintroduce LSD-StructureNet, an augmentation to the StructureNet architecture\nthat enables re-generation of parts situated at arbitrary positions in the\nhierarchies of its outputs. We achieve this by learning individual,\nprobabilistic conditional decoders for each hierarchy depth. We evaluate\nLSD-StructureNet on the PartNet dataset, the largest dataset of 3D shapes\nrepresented by hierarchies of parts.

The conceptual similarity between these tasks\nhas promoted the use of multi-task learning: a class of algorithms that aim to\nbring positive inductive transfer from related tasks. Here, we empirically\nevaluate multi-task learning approaches with neural networks for an online\nadvertising task. Specifically, we consider approximating the probability of\npost-click conversion events (installs) (CVR) for mobile app advertising on a\nlarge-scale advertising platform, using the related click events (CTR) as an\nauxiliary task. We use an ablation approach to systematically study recent\napproaches that incorporate both multitask learning and \"entire space modeling\"\nwhich train the CVR on all logged examples rather than learning a conditional\nlikelihood of conversion given clicked. Based on these results we show that\nseveral different approaches result in similar levels of positive transfer from\nthe data-abundant CTR task to the CVR task and offer some insight into how the\nmulti-task design choices address the two primary problems affecting the CVR\ntask: data sparsity and data bias.

It is shown that the\nmodel can lead to energetic consistency in both slip state and stick state upon\nimposing specific constraints on the coefficient of friction (CoF) and the\ncoefficient of restitution (CoR). A discriminator in the form of a quadratic\nfunction of the pre-impact velocity is introduced based on isotropic Coulomb\nconstraint such that its sign determines whether the impact occurs in the\nsticking mode or in the slipping mode just prior to the contact. Solving the\nzero-crossings of such a function in terms of the CoF and the CoR variables\nleads to another discriminator called Critical CoF, which is the lowest static\nCoF required to prevent the subsequent impulse vector violating the isotropic\nfriction cone constraint. Investigating conditions for the energetically\nconsistent impact model reveals that the maximum values of either CoR or CoF\nshould be limited depending on stick state or slip state. Furthermore, it is\nshown that these upper-bound limits in conjunction with the introduced Critical\nCoF variable can be used to specify the admissible set of CoR and CoF\nparameters, which can be represented by two distinct regions in the plan of CoF\nversus CoR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 02:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}
