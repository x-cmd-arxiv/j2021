We use path\nanalysis technique using the lavaan package in RStudio to empirically test the\nrole of information. We find that information is a direct and significant\ncontributor to enhancing farmers' adaptive capacity. However, even with\nexponential growth in use of technology, particularly information and\ncommunication technologies (ICTs), small farmers still lack access to\ninformation which hinders their capacity to respond to weather and climate\nrisks. Thus, understanding the mechanism that can facilitate exchange and use\nof information by the farming community more effectively is important. We take\nan ensemble view of ICTs operationalized using ICT ecosystem and find\nsignificant interlinkages between information, technology and the ICT ecosystem\nthat facilitate learning and information exchange and therefore contribute to\nenhancing farmers' adaptive capacity and building resilience to climate shocks.\nWe find that ICT ecosystem does facilitate access to information and also\nmediate the effect of farmer's capability and willingness to use ICTs for\nagricultural purposes.

In this investigation, 2-phenoxyacetophenone, a\nmodel compound for lignin \\b{eta}-O-4 linkage, was electro-catalytically\nhydrogenated (ECH) in distinct three-electrode setups: an open and a membrane\ncell. A deep eutectic solvent based on ethylene-glycol and choline chloride was\nused to pursue sustainable routes to dissolve lignin.

LfLH is robust to different robot\ntypes and does not make assumptions about the planning horizon.

The study noted that women experienced various forms of cyber\nviolence such as cyber bullying, cyber harassment, online defamation,\ncyberstalking, sexual exploitation, online hate speech, and revenge\npornography. Perpetrators used digital platforms such Facebook, WhatsApp,\nonline personal accounts, dating sites, and smartphones to carry out their evil\nacts.

An intelligent network of connected devices\nthat collect data with their sensors and transmit them using cloud technologies\nin order to communicate with other assets in the ecosystem plays a pivotal role\nin this framework. Maximizing the quality of life of citizens, making better\nuse of resources, cutting costs, and improving sustainability are the ultimate\ngoals that a smart city is after. Hence, data collected from connected devices\nwill continuously get thoroughly analyzed to gain better insights into the\nservices that are being offered across the city; with this goal in mind that\nthey can be used to make the whole system more efficient. Robots and physical\nmachines are inseparable parts of a smart city. Embodied AI is the field of\nstudy that takes a deeper look into these and explores how they can fit into\nreal-world environments. It focuses on learning through interaction with the\nsurrounding environment, as opposed to Internet AI which tries to learn from\nstatic datasets. Embodied AI aims to train an agent that can See (Computer\nVision), Talk (NLP), Navigate and Interact with its environment (Reinforcement\nLearning), and Reason (General Intelligence), all at the same time. Autonomous\ndriving cars and personal companions are some of the examples that benefit from\nEmbodied AI nowadays. In this paper, we attempt to do a concise review of this\nfield. We will go through its definitions, its characteristics, and its current\nachievements along with different algorithms, approaches, and solutions that\nare being used in different components of it (e.g. Vision, NLP, RL). We will\nthen explore all the available simulators and 3D interactable databases that\nwill make the research in this area feasible.

First, we consider a single\ndiffractive surface and use a matrix pseudoinverse-based method to determine\nthe complex-valued transmission coefficients of the diffractive\nfeatures/neurons to all-optically perform a desired/target linear\ntransformation.

This research presents a Non-coplanar\nAccelerometer Array (NAA) for estimating angular velocity with non-specific\ngeometric arrangement of four or more triaxial accelerometers with\nnon-coplanarity constraint. The presented proof of non-coplanar spacial\narrangement also provides insights into propagation of the sensor noise and\nconstruction of the noise covariance matrices. The system noise depends on the\nsingular values of the relative displacement matrix (between the sensors). A\ndynamical system model with uncorrelated process and measurement noise is\nproposed where the accelerometer readings are used simultaneously as process\nand measurement inputs. The angular velocity is estimated using an EKF that\ndiscretizes and linearizes the continuous-discrete time dynamical system. The\nsimulations are performed on a Cube-NAA (Cu-NAA) comprising four accelerometers\nplaced at different vertices of a cube. They analyze the estimation error for\nstatic and dynamic movement as the distance between the accelerometers is\nvaried. Here, the system noise is observed to decrease inversely with the\nlength of the cube edge as the arrangement is kept identical. Consequently, the\nsimulation results indicate asymptotic decrease in the standard error of\nestimation with edge length. The experiments are conducted on a Cu-NAA with\nfive reflective optical markers. The reflective markers are visually tracked\nusing VICON to construct the ground truth. This unique experimental setup,\napart from providing three degrees of rotational freedom of movement, also\nallows for three degrees of spacial translation (linear acceleration of the\nCu-NAA in space). The simulation and experimental results indicate better\nperformance of the proposed EKF as compared to one with correlated process and\nmeasurement noises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2021 20:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

Let $M_n$ be\na deterministic matrix that converges in $*$-moments to an operator $x_0$. It\nis known from the work by \\'{S}niady and Tao-Vu that the ESD of\n$X_n/\\sqrt{n}+M_n$ converges to the Brown measure of $x_0+c$, where $c$ is\nVoiculescu's circular operator. We obtain a formula for the Brown measure of\n$x_0+c$ which provides a description of the limit distribution. This answers a\nquestion of Biane-Lehner for arbitrary operator $x_0$.\n  Generalizing the case of circular and semi-circular operators, we also\nconsider a family of twisted elliptic operators that are $*$-free from $x_0$.\nFor an arbitrary twisted elliptic operator $g$, possible degeneracy then\nprevents a direct calculation of the Brown measure of $x_0+g$. We instead show\nthat the whole family of Brown measures are the push-forward measures of the\nBrown measure of $x_0+c$ under a family of self-maps of the plane, which could\npossibly be singular. We calculate explicit formula for the case $x_0$ is\nselfadjoint. In addition, we prove that the Brown measure of the sum of an\n$R$-diagonal operator and a twisted elliptic element is supported in a deformed\nring where the inner boundary is a circle and the outer boundary is an ellipse.\n  These results generalize some known results about free additive Brownian\nmotions where the free random variable $x_0$ is assumed to be selfadjoint.

However,\nprior work has shown that such requirements can be expensive, taking several\nweeks to label thousands of commits, and not always available when traversing\nnew research problems and domains. Unsupervised Learning is a promising\ndirection to learn hidden patterns within unlabelled data, which has only been\nextensively studied in defect prediction. Nevertheless, unsupervised learning\ncan be ineffective by itself and has not been explored in other domains (e.g.,\nstatic analysis and issue close time).\n  Motivated by this literature gap and technical limitations, we present\nFRUGAL, a tuned semi-supervised method that builds on a simple optimization\nscheme that does not require sophisticated (e.g., deep learners) and expensive\n(e.g., 100% manually labelled data) methods. FRUGAL optimizes the unsupervised\nlearner's configurations (via a simple grid search) while validating our design\ndecision of labelling just 2.5% of the data before prediction.\n  As shown by the experiments of this paper FRUGAL outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art adoptable static code warning recognizer and issue closed time\npredictor, while reducing the cost of labelling by a factor of 40 (from 100% to\n2.5%). Hence we assert that FRUGAL can save considerable effort in data\nlabelling especially in validating prior work or researching new problems.\n  Based on this work, we suggest that proponents of complex and expensive\nmethods should always baseline such methods against simpler and cheaper\nalternatives. For instance, a semi-supervised learner like FRUGAL can serve as\na baseline to the state-of-the-art software analytics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2021 21:15:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

The thickness is one of the most crucial parameters in\nquantifying the spray characteristics for which several non-unique solutions\nhave been acquired theoretically, so far. Among all, three theoretical\nsolutions presented by Hasson and Peck, Ranz, and Miller are the most reliable\nexpressions in terms of precision. Apparently, all these distinctive solutions\ncannot be physical simultaneously. However, a theoretical satisfactory\nexplanation for having various non-unique solutions has not been presented.\nMoreover, a meaningful criterion to recognize the most physical solution is\nhighly desirable. To address this gap, it is hypothesized that an additional\nconstraint should be considered in couple with the continuity and momentum\nequations to have a unique prediction for the liquid sheet thickness. By\nemploying the minimum energy principle, the minimum stored energy in the liquid\nsheet is considered the crucial constraint to achieving a unique solution and\nrejecting non-physical ones. Since the inviscid flow assumption is reasonably\nvalid for the liquid sheet, the minimum energy principle satisfies when the\nminimum lateral surface predicts. To quantify the lateral surface area the\nsheet shape is presented in terms of the sheet thickness and numerically\ncalculated by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for the three mentioned\nexpressions. Using the liquid shape, the lateral surface areas are calculated\nand compared in three different impingement angles of 58, 89, and 117 degrees.\nIn addition, the liquid shapes are visually compared with the experimental\nresults obtained by the Shadowgraph technique. In sum, it is proved that Hasson\nand Peck presented the most physical solution for the liquid sheet thickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2021 21:35:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 16:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

In\ntransportation, logistic regression and its variants are often interpreted as\ndiscrete choice models under utility theory (McFadden, 2001). Two prominent\napplications of logit models in the transportation domain are traffic accident\nanalysis and choice modeling. In these applications, researchers often want to\nunderstand and capture the individual variation under the same accident or\nchoice scenario. The mixed effect logistic regression (mixed logit) is a\npopular model employed by transportation researchers. To estimate the\ndistribution of mixed logit parameters, a non-convex optimization problem with\nnested high-dimensional integrals needs to be solved. Simulation-based\noptimization is typically applied to solve the mixed logit parameter estimation\nproblem. Despite its popularity, the mixed logit approach for learning\nindividual heterogeneity has several downsides. First, the parametric form of\nthe distribution requires domain knowledge and assumptions imposed by users,\nalthough this issue can be addressed to some extent by using a non-parametric\napproach. Second, the optimization problems arise from parameter estimation for\nmixed logit and the non-parametric extensions are non-convex, which leads to\nunstable model interpretation. Third, the simulation size in\nsimulation-assisted estimation lacks finite-sample theoretical guarantees and\nis chosen somewhat arbitrarily in practice. To address these issues, we are\nmotivated to develop a formulation that models the latent individual\nheterogeneity while preserving convexity, and avoids the need for\nsimulation-based approximation. Our setup is based on decomposing the\nparameters into a sparse homogeneous component in the population and low-rank\nheterogeneous parts for each individual.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2021 22:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

This ultimate length scale\nrequires the use of fundamental quantum properties of atoms, such as the spin\nof electrons, which naturally occurs in many solid-state environments and\nallows high-fidelity operations and readout by electromagnetic means. Despite\ndecades of effort, however, it remains a formidable task to realize an\natomic-scale quantum architecture where multiple electron spin qubits can be\nprecisely assembled, controllably coupled, and coherently operated. Electron\nspin qubits created in dopants in semiconductors and color centers in\ninsulators, for example, can be well controlled individually6-8 but are\ndifficult to couple together into a circuit. On the other hand, multiple\nmagnetic atoms and molecules on surfaces can be coupled to each other by\nbuilding sophisticated atomic structures using a scanning tunneling microscope\n(STM), but coherent operation has so far been limited to a single qubit in the\ntunnel junction. Here we demonstrate an atomic-scale qubit platform by showing\natom-by-atom construction, coherent operations, and readout of multiple\nelectron-spin qubits on a surface. To enable the coherent control of remote\nqubits that are outside the tunnel junction, we complement each electron spin\nwith a local magnetic field gradient from a nearby single-atom magnet. To\nenable readout of remote qubits, we employ a sensor qubit in the tunnel\njunction and implement pulsed double electron spin resonance. Using these\nmethods, we demonstrate fast single-, two-, and three-qubit operations in an\nall-electrical fashion. Our work marks the creation of an Angstrom-scale qubit\nplatform, where quantum functionalities using electron spin arrays, built\natom-by-atom on a surface, are now within reach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 01:04:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 09:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-08"}

Existing data mining and machine learning methods\nare either shallow methods that could not effectively capture the complex\ninterdependency of graph data or graph autoencoder methods that could not fully\nexploit the contextual information as supervision signals for effective anomaly\ndetection. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod, Self-Supervised Learning for Graph Anomaly Detection (SL-GAD). Our\nmethod constructs different contextual subgraphs (views) based on a target node\nand employs two modules, generative attribute regression and multi-view\ncontrastive learning for anomaly detection. While the generative attribute\nregression module allows us to capture the anomalies in the attribute space,\nthe multi-view contrastive learning module can exploit richer structure\ninformation from multiple subgraphs, thus abling to capture the anomalies in\nthe structure space, mixing of structure, and attribute information. We conduct\nextensive experiments on six benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 02:15:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Jan 2022 00:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

The resulting predictions on training images are taken as the\npseudo-ground truth for the standard training of Mask-RCNN, which we use for\namodal instance segmentation of test images. For generating the pseudo-ground\ntruth, we specify a new Amodal Segmenter based on Boundary Uncertainty\nestimation (ASBU) and make two contributions. First, while prior work uses the\noccluder's mask, our ASBU uses the occlusion boundary as input. Second, ASBU\nestimates an uncertainty map of the prediction. The estimated uncertainty\nregularizes learning such that lower segmentation loss is incurred on regions\nwith high uncertainty.

To circumvent\nthe problem of large modality gap, our approach is to use an intermediate\nlatent space between the two modalities.

A StyleGAN-like\narchitecture is utilized to make the intermediate latent space be equipped with\nrich representation power. To resolve the problem of insufficient training\nsamples, we introduce a three-step training scheme.

Specifically, a composite immersion and\ninvariance (I&I) adaptive controller is derived by integrating a\nprediction-error-driven learning law into the dynamically scaled I&I adaptive\ncontrol framework, wherein we modify the scaling factor so that the algorithm\ndesign does not involve any dynamic gains. To avoid the unwinding problem, a\nbarrier function is introduced as the attitude error function, along with the\ntactful establishment of two crucial algebra properties for exponential\nstability analysis. The regressor filtering method is adopted in combination\nwith the dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) procedure to acquire the\nprediction error using only easily obtainable signals. In particular, aiding by\na constructive liner time-varying filter, the scalar regressor of DREM is\nextended to generate a new exciting counterpart. In this way, the derived\ncontroller is shown to permit closed-loop exponential stability without PE, in\nthe sense that both output-tracking and parameter estimation errors\nexponentially converge to zero. Further, the composite learning law is\naugmented with a power term to achieve synchronized finite/fixed-time parameter\nconvergence.

While most of the existing methods are limited to the local\nfunctionals especially the graph edges, this paper focuses on selecting the\ndiscrete hub structures of the networks. Specifically, we propose an\ninferential method, called StarTrek filter, to select the hub nodes with\ndegrees larger than a certain thresholding level in the high dimensional\ngraphical models and control the false discovery rate (FDR). Discovering hub\nnodes in the networks is challenging: there is no straightforward statistic for\ntesting the degree of a node due to the combinatorial structures; complicated\ndependence in the multiple testing problem is hard to characterize and control.\nIn methodology, the StarTrek filter overcomes this by constructing p-values\nbased on the maximum test statistics via the Gaussian multiplier bootstrap. In\ntheory, we show that the StarTrek filter can control the FDR by providing\naccurate bounds on the approximation errors of the quantile estimation and\naddressing the dependence structures among the maximal statistics. To this end,\nwe establish novel Cram\\'er-type comparison bounds for the high dimensional\nGaussian random vectors. Comparing to the Gaussian comparison bound via the\nKolmogorov distance established by \\citet{chernozhukov2014anti}, our\nCram\\'er-type comparison bounds establish the relative difference between the\ndistribution functions of two high dimensional Gaussian random vectors.

One of the common strategies is word substitution\nwhere an individual avoids saying a word they might stutter on and use an\nalternative instead. This process itself can cause stress and add more burden.\nIn this work, we present Fluent, an AI augmented writing tool which assists PWS\nin writing scripts which they can speak more fluently. Fluent embodies a novel\nactive learning based method of identifying words an individual might struggle\npronouncing. Such words are highlighted in the interface. On hovering over any\nsuch word, Fluent presents a set of alternative words which have similar\nmeaning but are easier to speak. The user is free to accept or ignore these\nsuggestions. Based on such user interaction (feedback), Fluent continuously\nevolves its classifier to better suit the personalized needs of each user.

Generally, from the\nmodels of nuclear interaction it follows that the EAS which have produced\ngamma-hadron families in the Tien Shan X-ray emulsion chamber did preferably\noriginate from interaction of the light cosmic ray nuclei, such that their muon\nabundance must be ~1.5 times below an average calculated over all showers. In\ncontrary, the experimental muon counts in the EAS with families demonstrate a\n(1.5-2)-fold excess above the average, and this difference starts to be\nobservable in the showers with the energy above the 3PeV knee of the primary\ncosmic ray spectrum.

However, due to the\ninfluence of the disease stage, corpus, and other factors on data collection,\nthe ability of every samples within one subject to reflect the status of PD\nvary. No samples are useless totally, and not samples are 100% perfect. This\ncharacteristic means that it is not suitable just to remove some samples or\nkeep some samples. It is necessary to consider the sample transformation for\nobtaining high quality new samples. Unfortunately, existing PD speech\nrecognition methods focus mainly on feature learning and classifier design\nrather than sample learning, and few methods consider the sample\ntransformation. To solve the problem above, a PD speech sample transformation\nalgorithm based on multitype reconstruction operators is proposed in this\npaper. The algorithm is divided into four major steps. Three types of\nreconstruction operators are designed in the algorithm: types A, B and C.\nConcerning the type A operator, the original dataset is directly reconstructed\nby designing a linear transformation to obtain the first dataset. The type B\noperator is designed for clustering and linear transformation of the dataset to\nobtain the second new dataset. The third operator, namely, the type C operator,\nreconstructs the dataset by clustering and convolution to obtain the third\ndataset. Finally, the base classifier is trained based on the three new\ndatasets, and then the classification results are fused by decision weighting.\nIn the experimental section, two representative PD speech datasets are used for\nverification. The results show that the proposed algorithm is effective.\nCompared with other algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieves apparent\nimprovements in terms of classification accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 04:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

Another key\nfinding was that even though the innovation was regarded as not being easy to\nuse, women identified that they would still use it because of the social\ninfluence from the peers and the bosses. This finding suggests that women\ngovernment employees who obtain external support are more likely to use digital\ngovernment innovations compared with men who are unlikely to use it even if\nthey were facilitated.

A classical result of Eckhoff in 1988 provided an optimal fractional\nHelly theorem for axis-aligned boxes, which are Cartesian products of line\nsegments. Answering a question raised by B\\'ar\\'any and Kalai, and\nindependently Lew, we generalize Eckhoff's result to Cartesian products of\nconvex sets in all dimensions.

This is a special case of a more general result on intersections\nof $d$-Leray complexes. We also provide a construction showing that our result\non $d$-Leray complexes is optimal. Interestingly the extremal example is\nrepresentable as a family of cartesian products of convex sets, implying the\nbound $\\alpha>1-\\frac{1}{t^d}$ and the fraction $(1-(t^d(1-\\alpha))^{1/(d+1)})$\nabove are also best possible.

The development of the tulip flame in hydrogen/air\nobtained in simulations with a one-step Arrhenius model was compared with\nsimulations using a detailed chemical model. It is shown that the inversion of\nthe flame front and the onset of the tulip flame occurs due to rarefaction\nwaves generated by the decelerating flame when its surface was reduced due to\nextinguishing of the rear parts of the flame skirt at the sidewalls. The\nrarefaction waves reduce the flow velocity ahead of the flame, creating an\nuneven velocity profile, which facilitate the flame front inversion.

The alignment of dust grains in the clouds and\nresulting dust polarization is a promising method to study magnetic fields of\nexoplanets. Moreover, the grain size distribution plays an important role in\nphysical and chemical processes in the atmospheres, which is rather uncertain\nin atmospheres. In this paper, we first study grain alignment of dust grains in\nthe atmospheres of hot Jupiters by RAdiative Torques (RATs). We find that\nsilicate grains can be aligned by RATs with the magnetic fields (B-RAT) due to\nstrong magnetic fields of hot Jupiters, but carbonaceous grains of diamagnetic\nmaterial tend to be aligned with the radiation direction (k-RAT). At a low\naltitude of $r<2R_{\\rm p}$ with $R_{\\rm p}$ being the planet radius, only large\ngrains can be aligned, but tiny grains of $a\\sim 0.01\\mu$m can be aligned at a\nhigh altitude of $r>3R_{\\rm p}$.

Grains of high tensile\nstrength are disrupted at an altitude of $r>3R_{\\rm p}$, but weak grains can be\ndisrupted at a lower altitude. We suggest that the disruption of large grains\ninto smaller ones can facilitate dust clouds to escape to high altitudes due to\nlower gravity and may explain the presence of high-altitude clouds in hot\nJupiter as well as super-puff atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 06:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

This paper presents a new algorithm called Token-Aware Cascade\ncontrastive learning (TACo) that improves contrastive learning using two novel\ntechniques. The first is the token-aware contrastive loss which is computed by\ntaking into account the syntactic classes of words. This is motivated by the\nobservation that for a video-text pair, the content words in the text, such as\nnouns and verbs, are more likely to be aligned with the visual contents in the\nvideo than the function words. Second, a cascade sampling method is applied to\ngenerate a small set of hard negative examples for efficient loss estimation\nfor multi-modal fusion layers. To validate the effectiveness of TACo, in our\nexperiments we finetune pretrained models for a set of downstream tasks\nincluding text-video retrieval (YouCook2, MSR-VTT and ActivityNet), video\naction step localization (CrossTask), video action segmentation (COIN).

I build a static model of couples' labor\nsupply that features both intensive and extensive margins and derive a\ntractable expression that delivers a transparent understanding of how labor\nsupply responses, policy parameters, and income distribution affect the\nreform-induced welfare gains. Using this formula, I conduct a comparative\nwelfare analysis of four tax reforms implemented in the United States over the\nlast four decades, namely the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the Omnibus Budget\nReconciliation Act of 1993, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation\nAct of 2001, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. I find that these reforms\ncreated welfare gains ranging from -0.16 to 0.62 percent of aggregate labor\nincome. A sizable part of the gains is generated by the labor force\nparticipation responses of women. Despite three reforms resulted in aggregate\nwelfare gains, I show that each reform created both winners and losers.\nFurthermore, I uncover two patterns in the relationship between welfare gains\nand couples' labor income. In particular, the reforms of 1986 and 2017 display\na monotonically increasing relationship, while the other two reforms\ndemonstrate a U-shaped pattern. Finally, I characterize the bias in welfare\ngains resulting from the assumption about a linear tax function. I consider a\nreform that changes tax progressivity and show that the linearization bias is\ngiven by the ratio between the tax progressivity parameter and the inverse\nelasticity of taxable income. Quantitatively, it means that linearization\noverestimates the welfare effects of the U.S. tax reforms by 3.6-18.1%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 07:32:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 22:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Although previous approaches pre-define the type of dataset bias\nto prevent the network from learning it, recognizing the bias type in the real\ndataset is often prohibitive. This paper proposes a novel bias-tailored\naugmentation-based approach, BiaSwap, for learning debiased representation\nwithout requiring supervision on the bias type. Assuming that the bias\ncorresponds to the easy-to-learn attributes, we sort the training images based\non how much a biased classifier can exploits them as shortcut and divide them\ninto bias-guiding and bias-contrary samples in an unsupervised manner.\nAfterwards, we integrate the style-transferring module of the image translation\nmodel with the class activation maps of such biased classifier, which enables\nto primarily transfer the bias attributes learned by the classifier. Therefore,\ngiven the pair of bias-guiding and bias-contrary, BiaSwap generates the\nbias-swapped image which contains the bias attributes from the bias-contrary\nimages, while preserving bias-irrelevant ones in the bias-guiding images. Given\nsuch augmented images, BiaSwap demonstrates the superiority in debiasing\nagainst the existing baselines over both synthetic and real-world datasets.\nEven without careful supervision on the bias, BiaSwap achieves a remarkable\nperformance on both unbiased and bias-guiding samples, implying the improved\ngeneralization capability of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 08:35:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

Light is absorbed\nand scattered in the liquid medium, and irradiance exponentially decreases\ntowards the darkest part of the photobioreactor at a rate nonlinearly depending\non the biomass concentration. Maximizing productivity is then a tricky problem,\nespecially when the growth rate is inhibited by an excess of light.\nProductivity optimization turns out to be highly dependent on how light is\ndistributed along the reactor, and is therefore related to the extinction rate\nand the background turbidity. The concept of optical depth productivity is\nintroduced for systems where background turbidity must be accounted for and a\nglobal optimum maximizing productivity is proposed, extending the concept of\nthe compensation condition. This optimal condition consists in compensating the\nalgal growth rate at the bottom of the reactor by the respiration. This\ncondition can drive the optimization of the surface biomass productivity\ndepending on the minimum reachable depth.

In further detail, the properties of the blood circulation system are\nbeing deducted from the heartbeat signal profile. One disadvantage is that the\nwaveform can be affected by tissues that surround the blood vessels. This may\nresult in the unreliability of the methods utilized by many wearable smart\ndevices. This paper introduces an experimental study on the deformation of\nwaveform change caused by sensor binding force. The results of the study are\nthat an increase in sensor binding force decreases the width of the pump\nstrength-related pulse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 08:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

Several lines\nof text attack methods have been proposed in the literature, including\ncharacter-level, word-level, and sentence-level attacks. However, it is still a\nchallenge to minimize the number of word changes necessary to induce\nmisclassification, while simultaneously ensuring lexical correctness, syntactic\nsoundness, and semantic similarity. In this paper, we propose a Bigram and\nUnigram based adaptive Semantic Preservation Optimization (BU-SPO) method to\nexamine the vulnerability of deep models. Our method has four major merits.\nFirstly, we propose to attack text documents not only at the unigram word level\nbut also at the bigram level which better keeps semantics and avoids producing\nmeaningless outputs. Secondly, we propose a hybrid method to replace the input\nwords with options among both their synonyms candidates and sememe candidates,\nwhich greatly enriches the potential substitutions compared to only using\nsynonyms. Thirdly, we design an optimization algorithm, i.e., Semantic\nPreservation Optimization (SPO), to determine the priority of word\nreplacements, aiming to reduce the modification cost. Finally, we further\nimprove the SPO with a semantic Filter (named SPOF) to find the adversarial\nexample with the highest semantic similarity. We evaluate the effectiveness of\nour BU-SPO and BU-SPOF on IMDB, AG's News, and Yahoo! Answers text datasets by\nattacking four popular DNNs models.

We prove that if a compatible linear connection is not\nunique then the indicatrices must be Euclidean surfaces of revolution. The\nsurplus freedom of choosing compatible linear connections is related to\nEuclidean symmetries. The unicity of the solution of the compatibility\nequations can be provided by some additional requirements. Following the idea\nin \\cite{V14} we are also looking for the so-called extremal compatible linear\nconnection minimizing the norm of its torsion at each point of the manifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 09:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

Such signals,\nlasting between 10 and 1000s, can come from a variety of sources, including\naccretion disk instabilities around black holes, binary neutron stars\npost-merger, core-collapse supernovae, non-axisymmetric deformations in\nisolated neutron stars, and magnetar giant flares. Given the large parameter\nspace and the lack of precisely modeled waveforms, searches must rely on robust\ndetection algorithms, which make few or no assumptions on the nature of the\nsignal. Here we present a new data analysis pipeline to search for long-lived\ntransient GW signals, based on an excess cross-power statistic computed over a\nnetwork of detectors. It uses a hierarchical strategy that allows to estimate\nthe background quickly and implements several features aimed to increase\ndetection sensitivity by 30% for a wide range of signal morphology compared to\nan older implementation. We also report upper limits on the GW energy emitted\nfrom a search conducted with the pipeline for GW emission around a sample of\nnearby magnetar giant flares, and discuss detection potential of such sources\nwith second and third-generation detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 09:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

As different event types always own distinct extraction schemas\n(i.e., role patterns), previous work on EE usually follows an isolated learning\nparadigm, performing element extraction independently for different event\ntypes. It ignores meaningful associations among event types and argument roles,\nleading to relatively poor performance for less frequent types/roles.

Then, element\nextraction is achieved by building a universal schema of argument roles, with a\nparameter inheritance mechanism to enhance role preference for extracted\nelements.

However, source code is not\nalways available: only 0.3% of the ~49M smart contracts that are currently\ndeployed on Ethereum have their source code publicly available. Moreover, since\ncontracts may call functions from other contracts, security flaws in\nclosed-source contracts may affect open-source contracts as well. However,\ncurrent state-of-the-art approaches that operate on closed-source contracts\n(i.e., EVM bytecode), such as EVMPatch and SmartShield, make use of purely\nhard-coded templates that leverage fix patching patterns. As a result, they\ncannot dynamically adapt to the bytecode that is being patched, which severely\nlimits their flexibility and scalability. For instance, when patching integer\noverflows using hard-coded templates, a particular patch template needs to be\nemployed as the bounds to be checked are different for each integer size. In\nthis paper, we propose Elysium, a scalable approach towards automatic smart\ncontract repair at the bytecode level. Elysium combines template-based and\nsemantic-based patching by inferring context information from bytecode. Elysium\nis currently able to patch 7 different types of vulnerabilities in smart\ncontracts automatically and can easily be extended with new templates and new\nbug-finding tools. We evaluate its effectiveness and correctness using 3\ndifferent datasets by replaying more than 500K transactions on patched\ncontracts. We find that Elysium outperforms existing tools by patching at least\n30% more contracts correctly. Finally, we also compare the overhead of Elysium\nin terms of deployment and transaction cost.

Pulsed excitation promises such benefits, at the\ncost of more complex hardware solutions and restrictions on drive field\namplitude and frequency. State-of-the-art systems utilize a sinusoidal\nexcitation to drive superparamagnetic nanoparticles into the non-linear part of\ntheir magnetization curve, which creates a spectrum with a clear separation of\ndirect feed-through and higher harmonics caused by the particles response. One\nchallenge for rectangular excitation is the discrimination of particle and\nexcitation signals, both broad-band. Another is the drive-field sequence\nitself, as particles that are not placed at the same spatial position, may\nreact simultaneously and are not separable by their signal phase or shape. To\novercome this potential loss of information in spatial encoding for high\namplitudes, a superposition of shifting fields and drive-field rotations is\nproposed in this work.

We demonstrate by explicitly constructing\nan entropy function for a zero-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric model that\nthe dissipative character of generic non-linear diffusion equations is also\nhard-coded in the functional RG equation. This renders RG flows manifestly\nirreversible, revealing the semi-group property of RG transformations on the\nlevel of the flow equation itself.

Much of the\nclassical theories developed over the course of 90 years represent the effects\nof turbulence on suspended sediments (SS) using an effective mixing length or\neddy diffusivity without explicitly accounting for the energetics of turbulent\neddies across scales. To address this gap, the turbulent flux of sediments is\nderived using a co-spectral budget (CSB) model that can be imminently used in\nSS and other fine particle transport models. The CSB closes the\npressure-redistribution effect using a spectral linear Rotta scheme modified to\ninclude isotropoziation of production and interactions between turbulent eddies\nand sediment grains through a modified scale-dependent de-correlation time.

We\ndefine a class of multivariate point processes via their corresponding\nstochastic intensity processes that are driven by stochastic jumps.\nEssentially, there is a jump in an intensity process whenever the corresponding\npoint process records an event. An attribute of our modelling class is that not\nonly a jump is recorded at each instance, but also its magnitude. This allows\nlarge jumps to influence the intensity to a larger degree than smaller jumps.\nWe give conditions which guarantee that the process is stable, in the sense\nthat it does not explode, and provide a detailed discussion on when the\nsubclass of linear models is stable. Finally, we fit our model to financial\ntime series data from the S\\&P 500 and Nikkei 225 indices respectively. We\nconclude that a nonlinear variant from our modelling class fits the data best.\nThis supports the observation that in times of crises (high intensity) jumps\ntend to arrive in clusters, whereas there are typically longer times between\njumps when the markets are calmer.

For instance, the minimum cut, the minimum $s$-$t$\ncut, the minimum multiway cut, and the minimum $k$-way cut are some of the\ncommonly encountered cut problems. Many of these problems have been extensively\nstudied over several decades. In this paper, we initiate the algorithmic study\nof some cut problems in high dimensions.\n  The first problem we study, namely, Topological Hitting Set (THS), is defined\nas follows: Given a nontrivial $r$-cycle $\\zeta$ in a simplicial complex\n$\\mathsf{K}$, find a set $\\mathcal{S}$ of $r$-dimensional simplices of minimum\ncardinality so that $\\mathcal{S}$ meets every cycle homologous to $\\zeta$. Our\nmain result is that this problem admits a polynomial-time solution on\ntriangulations of closed surfaces. Interestingly, the optimal solution is given\nin terms of the cocycles of the surface. For general complexes, we show that\nTHS is W[1]-hard with respect to the solution size $k$. On the positive side,\nwe show that THS admits an FPT algorithm with respect to $k+d$, where $d$ is\nthe maximum degree of the Hasse graph of the complex $\\mathsf{K}$.\n  We also define a problem called Boundary Nontrivialization (BNT): Given a\nbounding $r$-cycle $\\zeta$ in a simplicial complex $\\mathsf{K}$, find a set\n$\\mathcal{S}$ of $(r+1)$-dimensional simplices of minimum cardinality so that\nthe removal of $\\mathcal{S}$ from $\\mathsf{K}$ makes $\\zeta$ non-bounding. We\nshow that BNT is W[1]-hard with respect to the solution size as the parameter,\nand has an $O(\\log n)$-approximation FPT algorithm for $(r+1)$-dimensional\ncomplexes with the $(r+1)$-th Betti number $\\beta_{r+1}$ as the parameter.\nFinally, we provide randomized (approximation) FPT algorithms for the global\nvariants of THS and BNT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 14:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

For example, metric-affine and generalized geometries can be\nwritten on Lie and Courant algebroids, respectively. Furthermore, string\ntheories might make use of many other algebroids such as metric algebroids,\nhigher-Courant algebroids, or conformal Courant algebroids. Working on the\npossibly most general algebroid structure is fruitful as it creates a chance to\nstudy all of them at once. Local pre-Leibniz algebroids are such general ones\nin which metric-connection geometries are possible to construct. Yet, the\nexistence of the locality operator necessitates the modification of torsion and\ncurvature operators to achieve tensorial quantities. In this paper, this\nmodification is explained from the point of view that the modification is\napplied to the bracket instead. This leads one to consider `anti-commutable'\npre-Leibniz algebroids whose bracket satisfies a property defined with respect\nto a choice of an equivalence class of connections. These `admissible'\nconnections are claimed to be the necessary ones for a geometry on algebroids\nbecause one can prove many desirable properties for them. For instance, we\nprove the first and second Bianchi identities, Ricci identity, Cartan structure\nequations, the construction of Levi-Civita connections, the decomposition of\nconnection in terms of torsion and non-metricity. These all are possible\nbecause the modified bracket becomes anti-symmetric for an admissible\nconnection so that one can apply the machinery of almost- or pre-Lie\nalgebroids. We investigate various algebroid structures from the literature and\nshow that they admit admissible connections which are metric-compatible in some\ngeneralized sense. Moreover, we prove that local pre-Leibniz algebroids that\nare not anti-commutable cannot be equipped with a torsion-free, and in\nparticular Levi-Civita, connection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 14:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

However, deep neural networks\n(DNNs) are susceptible to be fooled with nearly high confidence by an\nadversary. In practice, the vulnerability of deep learning systems against\ncarefully perturbed images, known as adversarial examples, poses a dire\nsecurity threat in the physical world applications. To address this phenomenon,\nwe present, what to our knowledge, is the first ever image set based\nadversarial defence approach. Image set classification has shown an exceptional\nperformance for object and face recognition, owing to its intrinsic property of\nhandling appearance variability. We propose a robust deep Bayesian image set\nclassification as a defence framework against a broad range of adversarial\nattacks. We extensively experiment the performance of the proposed technique\nwith several voting strategies. We further analyse the effects of image size,\nperturbation magnitude, along with the ratio of perturbed images in each image\nset. We also evaluate our technique with the recent state-of-the-art defence\nmethods, and single-shot recognition task. The empirical results demonstrate\nsuperior performance on CIFAR-10, MNIST, ETH-80, and Tiny ImageNet datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 14:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

Materials and Methods: Define and validate the RRCP\ndataset for a set of subreddits related to chronic pain. Identify the main\nconcerns discussed in each subreddit. Model each subreddit according to their\nmain concerns. Compare subreddit models. Results: The RRCP dataset comprises\n86,537 Reddit submissions from 12 subreddits related to chronic pain (each\nrelated to one pathological background). Each RRCP subreddit has various main\nconcerns. Some of these concerns are shared between multiple subreddits (e.g.,\nthe subreddit Sciatica semantically entails the subreddit backpain in their\nvarious concerns, but not the other way around), whilst some concerns are\nexclusive to specific subreddits (e.g., Interstitialcystitis and\nCrohnsDisease). Discussion: These results suggest that the reported experience\nof chronic pain, from multiple pathologies (i.e., subreddits), has concerns\nrelevant to all, and concerns exclusive to certain pathologies. Our analysis\ndetails each of these concerns and their similarity relations.

Three models are studied, i.e. the\nextreme case of no-SSA model with a high level of ionizing background, the\nmoderate-SSA model with a relatively high level of ionizing background, and the\ndense-SSA model with a low level of ionizing background. We find that while the\ncharacteristic scale of neutral regions decreases during the early and middle\nstages of reionization, it stays nearly unchanged at about 10 comoving Mpc\nduring the late stage for the no-SSA and moderate-SSA models.

The purpose of this study is to assess the effect\nof Share capital on financial growth of Non-financial firms listed at the\nNairobi Securities Exchange. Financial firms were excluded because of their\nspecific sector characteristics and stringent regulatory framework. The study\nis guided by Market Timing Theory and Theory of Growth of the Firm.\nMethodology: Explanatory research design was adopted. The target population of\nthe study comprised of 45 non-financial firms listed at NSE for a period of ten\nyears from 2008 to 2017. The study conducted both descriptive statistics\nanalysis and panel data analysis. Findings: The result indicates that, share\ncapital explains 32.73% and 11.62% of variations in financial growth as measure\nby growth in earnings per share and growth in market capitalization\nrespectively. Share capital positively and significantly influences financial\ngrowth as measured by both growth in earnings per share and growth in market\ncapitalization. Implications: The study recommends for the Non-financial firms\nto utilize equity financing as a way of raising capital for major expansions,\nasset growth or acquisitions which may require heavy funding. In this way,\nfirms will be assured of improved performance as well as high financial growth.\nThe study also recommends for substantial firm financing through equity. Value:\nEquity financing is important to any firm, if the proceeds are used to invest\nin projects which eventually bring growth to the firm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 15:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

The task of tensor completion is crucial in many applications such\nas personalized recommendation, image and video restoration, and link\nprediction in social networks. Many tensor factorization and neural\nnetwork-based tensor completion algorithms have been developed to predict\nmissing entries in partially observed tensors. However, they can produce\ninaccurate estimations as real-world tensors are very sparse, and these methods\ntend to overfit on the small amount of data. Here, we overcome these\nshortcomings by presenting a data augmentation technique for tensors. In this\npaper, we propose DAIN, a general data augmentation framework that enhances the\nprediction accuracy of neural tensor completion methods. Specifically, DAIN\nfirst trains a neural model and finds tensor cell importances with influence\nfunctions. After that, DAIN aggregates the cell importance to calculate the\nimportance of each entity (i.e., an index of a dimension). Finally, DAIN\naugments the tensor by weighted sampling of entity importances and a value\npredictor. Extensive experimental results show that DAIN outperforms all data\naugmentation baselines in terms of enhancing imputation accuracy of neural\ntensor completion on four diverse real-world tensors. Ablation studies of DAIN\nsubstantiate the effectiveness of each component of DAIN. Furthermore, we show\nthat DAIN scales near linearly to large datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 15:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

Such methods, however,\nhave limited ability to capture rich contextual dependencies among points. In\nthis paper, we leverage the high-quality region proposal network and a\nChannel-wise Transformer architecture to constitute our two-stage 3D object\ndetection framework (CT3D) with minimal hand-crafted design. The proposed CT3D\nsimultaneously performs proposal-aware embedding and channel-wise context\naggregation for the point features within each proposal. Specifically, CT3D\nuses proposal's keypoints for spatial contextual modelling and learns attention\npropagation in the encoding module, mapping the proposal to point embeddings.\nNext, a new channel-wise decoding module enriches the query-key interaction via\nchannel-wise re-weighting to effectively merge multi-level contexts, which\ncontributes to more accurate object predictions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our CT3D method has superior performance and excellent\nscalability.

The\ntemperature of the corona can be accurately determined by the cut-off signature\nin the X-ray spectrum. Owing to the large temperatures of the corona,\nobservations well above 10 keV are necessary. Here, we explore the NuSTAR\nobservations of 118 Gehrels/Swift selected Seyfert 1 AGN. We model the spectrum\nusing a single power-law with an exponential cut-off modified by neutral and\nionised absorption as well as a reflection component. We find secure spectral\ncut-off estimates in 62 sources while for the remaining ones we derive only\nlower limits. The mean value is 103 keV with a skewed distribution towards\nlarge energies with large dispersion. When we consider the lower limits using\nsurvival analysis techniques, the mean cut-off energy becomes significantly\nlarger, about 200 keV. Because of various limitations (e.g. limited spectral\npassband, photon statistics, model degeneracies) we perform extensive\nsimulations to explore the underlying spectral cut-off distribution. We find\nthat an intrinsic spectral cut-off distribution which has a Maxwell-Boltzmann\nshape with a mean value in the range of 160 - 200 keV can reproduce\nsufficiently well the observations. Finally, our spectral analysis places very\nstringent constraints on both the photon index (Gamma=1.77+/-0.01) as well as\non the reflection component (R=0.69+/-0.04) of the Seyfert 1 population.

The approach to develop such\nlibraries is often not modular or reusable to the same extent that compiler\ninfrastructure like LLVM is. Manual optimization typically does not use a\nstandard intermediate representation (IR), although the optimizations performed\ncan be encoded as a sequence of transformation steps and customized passes on\nan IR. Hand tuning may also miss exploration of design points only reachable\neasily by automatic code generation. We believe that until the recent\nintroduction of MLIR (Multi-level intermediate representation), IR\ninfrastructure was not geared to tackle the problem of automatic generation of\ndomain-specific libraries in an effective manner. In particular, it was hard to\nrepresent and transform compute abstractions at high, middle, and low levels\nusing a single IR.\n  With suitable abstractions in MLIR, we build an experimental lowering\npipeline that is able to automatically generate code for matrix-matrix\nmultiplication on NVIDIA GPUs targeting its tensor cores. On a set of problem\nsizes we evaluated, initial performance results show that we are able to attain\nperformance that is 95-119% and 80-160% of CuBLAS for FP32 and FP16 accumulate\nrespectively on NVIDIA's Ampere microarchitecture-based Geforce 3090 RTX. We\nbelieve that these results could be used as motivation for further research and\ndevelopment on automatic code and library generation using IR infrastructure\nfor similar specialized accelerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 11:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

Previous valley boundary transport relies on kink\nstates at internal boundaries between two topologically distinct domains.\nHowever, recent studies have revealed a novel class of topological chiral edge\nstates (CESs) at external boundaries of valley materials, which have remained\nelusive in photonics. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the\ntopological CESs in valley photonic metamaterials (VPMMs) by accurately tuning\non-site edge potentials. Moreover, the VPMMs work at deep-subwavelength scales.\nThus, the supported CESs are highly confined and self-guiding without relying\non a cladding layer to prevent leakage radiation. Via direct near-field\nmeasurements, we observe the bulk bandgap, the edge dispersions, and the robust\nedge transport passing through sharp corners, which are hallmarks of the CESs.\nOur work paves a way to explore novel topological edge states in valley\nphotonics and sheds light on robust and miniaturized photonic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 14:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}
