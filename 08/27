Since performance can depend\nstrongly on these parameters, it is important to compare classes of\nestimators-by considering prescribed finite sets of tuning parameters-not just\nparticularly tuned methods. In this work, we investigate classes of methods via\nthe relative performance of the best method in the class. We consider the\ncentral problem of linear regression-with a random isotropic ground truth-and\ninvestigate the estimation performance of two fundamental methods, gradient\ndescent and ridge regression. We unveil the following phenomena. (1) For\ngeneral designs, constant stepsize gradient descent outperforms ridge\nregression when the eigenvalues of the empirical data covariance matrix decay\nslowly, as a power law with exponent less than unity. If instead the\neigenvalues decay quickly, as a power law with exponent greater than unity or\nexponentially, we show that ridge regression outperforms gradient descent. (2)\nFor orthogonal designs, we compute the exact minimax optimal class of\nestimators (achieving min-max-min optimality), showing it is equivalent to\ngradient descent with decaying learning rate. We find the sub-optimality of\nridge regression and gradient descent with constant step size. Our results\nhighlight that statistical performance can depend strongly on tuning\nparameters. In particular, while optimally tuned ridge regression is the best\nestimator in our setting, it can be outperformed by gradient descent by an\narbitrary/unbounded amount when both methods are only tuned over finitely many\nregularization parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 16:01:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2022 12:28:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

In view of this, one may ask: can we leverage the\nadditional signals from contrastive learning to alleviate data scarcity, so as\nto benefit STG forecasting? To answer this question, we present the first\nsystematic exploration on incorporating contrastive learning into STG\nforecasting. Specifically, we first elaborate two potential schemes for\nintegrating contrastive learning. We then propose two feasible and efficient\ndesigns of contrastive tasks that are performed on the node or graph level. The\nempirical study on STG benchmarks demonstrates that integrating graph-level\ncontrast with the joint learning scheme achieves the best performance.

A typical topological laser employs a\nsingle-mode topological edge state, which appears deterministically in a\ndesigned topological bandgap and exhibits robustness to disorder. These\nproperties seem to be highly attractive in pursuit of high power lasers capable\nof single mode operation. In this paper, we theoretically analyze a large-scale\nsingle-mode laser based on a topological edge state. We consider a sizable\narray laser consisting of a few hundreds of site resonators, which support a\nsingle topological edge mode broadly distributed among the resonators. We build\na basic model describing the laser using the tight binding approximation and\nevaluate the stability of single mode lasing based on the threshold gain\ndifference $\\Delta\\alpha$ between the first-lasing edge mode and the\nsecond-lasing competing bulk mode. Our calculations demonstrate that stronger\ncouplings between the cavities and lower losses are advantageous for achieving\nstable operation of the device. When assuming an average coupling of 100\ncm$^{-1}$ between site resonators and other realistic parameters, the threshold\ngain difference $\\Delta\\alpha$ can reach about 2 cm$^{-1}$, which would be\nsufficient for stable single mode lasing using a conventional semiconductor\nlaser architecture. We also consider the effects of possible disorders and\nlong-range interactions to assess the robustness of the laser under non-ideal\nsituations.

This problem\nsubsumes bipartite graph matching and graph partitioning as special cases and\nis NP-hard, in general. We develop scalable linear programming (LP) relaxations\nwith theoretical performance guarantees for joint object matching. We start by\nproposing a new characterization of consistent partial maps; this in turn\nenables us to formulate joint object matching as an integer linear programming\n(ILP) problem. To construct strong LP relaxations, we study the facial\nstructure of the convex hull of the feasible region of this ILP, which we refer\nto as the joint matching polytope. We present an exponential family of\nfacet-defining inequalities that can be separated in strongly polynomial time,\nhence obtaining a partial characterization of the joint matching polytope that\nis both tight and cheap to compute. To analyze the theoretical performance of\nthe proposed LP relaxations, we focus on permutation group synchronization, an\nimportant special case of joint object matching. We show that under the random\ncorruption model for the input maps, a simple LP relaxation, that is, an LP\ncontaining only a very small fraction of the proposed facet-defining\ninequalities, recovers the ground truth with high probability if the corruption\nlevel is below $40\\%$. Finally, via a preliminary computational study on\nsynthetic data, we show that the proposed LP relaxations outperform a popular\nSDP relaxation both in terms of recovery and tightness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 17:06:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2022 00:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

One of the biggest challenges with this task is the lack of\nsufficient paired stylized data. Many studies focus on unsupervised approaches,\nwithout considering from the perspective of data augmentation. We begin with\nthe observation that people may recall similar emotions when they are in\nsimilar scenes, and often express similar emotions with similar style phrases,\nwhich underpins our data augmentation idea. In this paper, we propose a novel\nExtract-Retrieve-Generate data augmentation framework to extract style phrases\nfrom small-scale stylized sentences and graft them to large-scale factual\ncaptions. First, we design the emotional signal extractor to extract style\nphrases from small-scale stylized sentences. Second, we construct the plugable\nmulti-modal scene retriever to retrieve scenes represented with pairs of an\nimage and its stylized caption, which are similar to the query image or caption\nin the large-scale factual data. In the end, based on the style phrases of\nsimilar scenes and the factual description of the current scene, we build the\nemotion-aware caption generator to generate fluent and diversified stylized\ncaptions for the current scene. Extensive experimental results show that our\nframework can alleviate the data scarcity problem effectively. It also\nsignificantly boosts the performance of several existing image captioning\nmodels in both supervised and unsupervised settings, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art stylized image captioning methods in terms of both sentence\nrelevance and stylishness by a substantial margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 17:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-27"}

Its inner regions, hidden behind dust and gas, have been\npartially unveiled with the arrival of near-IR photometric and spectroscopic\ndatasets. Among recent discoveries, there is a population of low-mass globular\nclusters, known to be missing, especially towards the Galactic bulge. In this\nwork, five new low-luminosity globular clusters located towards the bulge area\nare presented. They were discovered by searching for groups in the\nmulti-dimensional space of coordinates, colours, and proper motions from the\nGaia EDR3 catalogue and later confirmed with deeper VVV survey near-IR\nphotometry. The clusters show well-defined red-giant branches and, in some\ncases, horizontal branches with their members forming a dynamically coherent\nstructure in proper motion space. Four of them were confirmed by spectroscopic\nfollow-up with the MUSE instrument on the ESO VLT. Photometric parameters were\nderived, and when available, metallicities, radial velocities and orbits were\ndetermined. The new clusters Gran 1 and 5 are bulge globular clusters, while\nGran 2, 3, and 4 present halo-like properties. Preliminary orbits indicate that\nGran 1 might be related to the Main Progenitor, or the so-called ''low-energy''\ngroup, while Gran 2, 3 and 5 appear to follow the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage. This\nstudy demonstrates that the Gaia proper motions, combined with the\nspectroscopic follow-up and colour-magnitude diagrams, are required to confirm\nthe nature of cluster candidates towards the inner Galaxy. High stellar\ncrowding and differential extinction may hide other low-luminosity clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 17:23:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 12:44:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

They offer an attractive representation for\nmany data-sparse dense operators that appear in practical applications, where\nsubstantial compression and a much smaller memory footprint can be achieved.\nTLR matrices are a compromise between the simplicity of a regular\nperfectly-strided data structure and the optimal complexity of the unbalanced\ntrees of hierarchically low rank matrices, and provide a convenient\nperformance-tuning parameter through their tile size that can be proportioned\nto take into account the cache size where the tiles reside in the memory\nhierarchy.\n  There are currently no high-performance algorithms that can generate Cholesky\nand $LDL^T$ factorizations, particularly on GPUs.

However,\nthese benchmarks unfortunately introduce some unwanted and impractical goals,\ne.g., to perfectly distinguish CIFAR dogs from ImageNet dogs, even though they\nhave the same semantics and negligible covariate shifts. These unrealistic\ngoals will result in an extremely narrow range of model capabilities, greatly\nlimiting their use in real applications. To overcome these drawbacks, we\nre-design the benchmarks and propose the semantically coherent\nout-of-distribution detection (SC-OOD). On the SC-OOD benchmarks, existing\nmethods suffer from large performance degradation, suggesting that they are\nextremely sensitive to low-level discrepancy between data sources while\nignoring their inherent semantics. To develop an effective SC-OOD detection\napproach, we leverage an external unlabeled set and design a concise framework\nfeatured by unsupervised dual grouping (UDG) for the joint modeling of ID and\nOOD data. The proposed UDG can not only enrich the semantic knowledge of the\nmodel by exploiting unlabeled data in an unsupervised manner, but also\ndistinguish ID/OOD samples to enhance ID classification and OOD detection tasks\nsimultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on SC-OOD benchmarks.

This development poses significant challenges for\nconflict mediation, as mediators struggle to make sense of conflict dynamics,\nsuch as the range of conflict parties and the evolution of their political\npositions, the distinction between relevant and less relevant actors in peace\nmaking, or the identification of key conflict issues and their interdependence.\nInternational peace efforts appear increasingly ill-equipped to successfully\naddress these challenges. While technology is being increasingly used in a\nrange of conflict related fields, such as conflict predicting or information\ngathering, less attention has been given to how technology can contribute to\nconflict mediation. This case study is the first to apply state-of-the-art\nmachine learning technologies to data from an ongoing mediation process. Using\ndialogue transcripts from peace negotiations in Yemen, this study shows how\nmachine-learning tools can effectively support international mediators by\nmanaging knowledge and offering additional conflict analysis tools to assess\ncomplex information.

Our approach is\nbased on the normalizing flows model and offers a series of advantages. For\nconventional applications, where a single 3D estimate is required, our\nformulation allows for efficient mode computation. Using the mode leads to\nperformance that is comparable with the state of the art among deterministic\nunimodal regression models. Simultaneously, since we have access to the\nlikelihood of each sample, we demonstrate that our model is useful in a series\nof downstream tasks, where we leverage the probabilistic nature of the\nprediction as a tool for more accurate estimation.

When a sufficient\namount of within-domain text may not be available, expanding a seed corpus of\nrelevant documents from large-scale web data poses several challenges. First,\ncorpus expansion requires scoring and ranking each document in the collection,\nan operation that can quickly become computationally expensive as the web\ncorpora size grows.

Motivated by a recent study on learning robustness without input\nperturbations by distilling an AT model, we explore what is learned during\nadversarial training by analyzing the distribution of logits in AT models. We\nidentify three logit characteristics essential to learning adversarial\nrobustness.

We furthermore use a D-Wave Advantage 1.1 flux\nqubit quantum annealing computer to show that the dynamics effectively freeze\nlater for a domain-wall encoding compared to a traditional one-hot encoding.\nThis second result could help explain the dramatic performance improvement of\ndomain wall over one hot which has been seen in a recent experiment on D-Wave\nhardware. This is an important result because usually problem encoding and the\nunderlying physics are considered separately, our work suggests that\nconsidering them together may be a more useful paradigm.

Recently, it has also been shown that an\n`epochwise double descent' effect exists in which the generalization error\ninitially drops, then rises, and finally drops again with increasing training\ntime. This presents a practical problem in that the amount of time required for\ntraining is long, and early stopping based on validation performance may result\nin suboptimal generalization. In this work we develop an analytically tractable\nmodel of epochwise double descent that allows us to characterise theoretically\nwhen this effect is likely to occur. This model is based on the hypothesis that\nthe training data contains features that are slow to learn but informative. We\nthen show experimentally that deep neural networks behave similarly to our\ntheoretical model. Our findings indicate that epochwise double descent requires\na critical amount of noise to occur, but above a second critical noise level\nearly stopping remains effective. Using insights from theory, we give two\nmethods by which epochwise double descent can be removed: one that removes slow\nto learn features from the input and reduces generalization performance, and\nanother that instead modifies the training dynamics and matches or exceeds the\ngeneralization performance of standard training. Taken together, our results\nsuggest a new picture of how epochwise double descent emerges from the\ninterplay between the dynamics of training and noise in the training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 19:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

However, existing approaches lack the\nability to model the combined effect of these flood mechanisms. Thus, to\nincrease flood resilience, modeling techniques to improve understanding and\nprediction of the combined effect of these flood hazards are critical. To\naddress this need, this study presents a modeling system for assessing the\ncombined flood risk to coastal cities under changing climate conditions that\nleverages ocean modeling with land surface modeling capable of resolving urban\ndrainage infrastructure within the city. The modeling approach is demonstrated\nin quantifying the future impact on transportation infrastructure within\nNorfolk, Virginia USA. A series of combined storms events are modeled for\ncurrent (2020) and projected future (2070) climate conditions. Results show\nthat pluvial flooding causes a larger interruption to the transportation\nnetwork compared to tidal flooding under current climate conditions. By 2070,\nhowever, tidal flooding will be the dominant flooding mechanism with even\nnuisance flooding expected to happen daily due to SLR. In 2070, nuisance\nflooding is expected to cause a 4.6% total link close time (TLC), which is more\nthan two times that of a 50-year storm surge (1.8% TLC) in 2020. The coupled\nmodel was compared with a widely used but physically simplistic bathtub method\nto assess the difference resulting from the more complex modeling presented.\nResults show that the bathtub method overestimated the flooded area near the\nshoreline by 9.5% and 3.1% for a 10-year storm surge event in 2020 and 2070,\nrespectively, but underestimated flooded area in the inland region by 9.0% and\n4.0% for the same events.

The very existence of these chemically\ninhomogeneous binaries represents one of the most contradictory examples in\nstellar astrophysics and source of tension between theory and observations. It\nis still unclear whether the abundance variations are the result of chemical\ninhomogeneities in the protostellar gas clouds or instead if they are due to\nplanet engulfment events occurred after the stellar formation. While the former\nscenario would undermine the belief that the chemical makeup of a star provides\nthe fossil information of the environment where it formed, a key assumption\nmade by several studies of our Galaxy, the second scenario would shed light on\nthe possible evolutionary paths of planetary systems.

This is necessitated because the increasing availability of 3D data\nmakes manual rigging infeasible. However, object animations involve\nunderstanding elaborate geometry and dynamics, and such knowledge is hard to\ninfuse even with modern data-driven techniques. Automatic rigging methods do\nnot provide adequate control and cannot generalize in the presence of unseen\nartifacts. As an alternative, one can design a system for one shape and then\ntransfer it to other objects. In previous work, this has been implemented by\nsolving the dense point-to-point correspondence problem. Such an approach\nrequires a significant amount of supervision, often placing hundreds of\nlandmarks by hand. This paper proposes a functional approach for skeleton\ntransfer that uses limited information and does not require a complete match\nbetween the geometries. To do so, we suggest a novel representation for the\nskeleton properties, namely the functional regressor, which is compact and\ninvariant to different discretizations and poses. We consider our functional\nregressor a new operator to adopt in intrinsic geometry pipelines for encoding\nthe pose information, paving the way for several new applications. We\nnumerically stress our method on a large set of different shapes and object\nclasses, providing qualitative and numerical evaluations of precision and\ncomputational efficiency.

But first they must be capable\nof learning and retaining new information without being exposed to it\narbitrarily often. Past efforts to engineer such systems have sought to build\nor regulate artificial neural networks using disjoint sets of weights that are\nuniquely sensitive to specific tasks or inputs. This has not yet enabled\ncontinual learning over long sequences of previously unseen data without\ncorrupting existing knowledge: a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. In\nthis paper, we introduce a system that can learn sequentially over previously\nunseen datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-100) with little forgetting over time. This is\ndone by controlling the activity of weights in a convolutional neural network\non the basis of inputs using top-down regulation generated by a second\nfeed-forward neural network. We find that our method learns continually under\ndomain transfer with sparse bursts of activity in weights that are recycled\nacross tasks, rather than by maintaining task-specific modules. Sparse synaptic\nbursting is found to balance activity and suppression such that new functions\ncan be learned without corrupting extant knowledge, thus mirroring the balance\nof order and disorder in systems at the edge of chaos. This behavior emerges\nduring a prior pre-training (or 'meta-learning') phase in which regulated\nsynapses are selectively disinhibited, or grown, from an initial state of\nuniform suppression through prediction error minimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 22:53:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 16:29:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 17:27:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2021 16:36:59 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 15:33:59 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 02:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 16:48:56 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 15:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies are a potential\nsecurity risk. Software composition analysis (SCA) tools, therefore, are being\nincreasingly adopted by practitioners to keep track of vulnerable dependencies.\nAim: The goal of this study is to understand the difference in vulnerability\nreporting by various SCA tools. Understanding if and how existing SCA tools\ndiffer in their analysis may help security practitioners to choose the right\ntooling and identify future research needs. Method: We present an in-depth case\nstudy by comparing the analysis reports of 9 industry-leading SCA tools on a\nlarge web application, OpenMRS, composed of Maven (Java) and npm (JavaScript)\nprojects. Results: We find that the tools vary in their vulnerability\nreporting.

The\neigen-modes are naturally angle dependent due to changes in phases and periodic\nmode shapes determined by the incident angle. Intriguingly, the band exhibits\nangle-dependent transitions at the exceptional points (EPs) and critical angles\n(CAs), where the eigenvalues coincide or vanish. Coupled with these\ntransitions, it is found that the eigen-modes switch their energy\ncharacteristics and symmetry patterns at these branch points, leading to\nenhanced angle dependence. Moreover, these eigen-modes also serve as the basis\nfunctions of the scattered waves. Therefore, the scattering response of the\nmedium inherently possesses the angle-dependent properties, making this system\nnaturally suitable for sensing applications. An artificial neural network (ANN)\nis trained with randomly weighted eigen-modes to achieve deep learning of the\neigen features and angle dependence. The training data is derived only based on\nthe eigen-modes of the unit cells. Nevertheless, the trained ANN can accurately\nidentify the incident angle of an unknown scattering signal, with minimal side\nlobe levels and suppressed main lobe width. The ANN shows superior performance\nin comparison with standard delay-and-sum technique of estimating angle of\narrival.

To maintain real-time\nperformance, many practical systems downsample the video stream. But this can\nhurt downstream tasks such as (small) object detection. Instead, we take\ninspiration from biological vision systems that allocate more foveal \"pixels\"\nto salient parts of the scene. We introduce FOVEA, an approach for intelligent\ndownsampling that ensures salient image regions remain \"magnified\" in the\ndownsampled output. Given a high-res image, FOVEA applies a differentiable\nresampling layer that outputs a small fixed-size image canvas, which is then\nprocessed with a differentiable vision module (e.g., object detection network),\nwhose output is then differentiably backward mapped onto the original image\nsize. The key idea is to resample such that background pixels can make room for\nsalient pixels of interest. In order to ensure the overall pipeline remains\nefficient, FOVEA makes use of cheap and readily available cues for saliency,\nincluding dataset-specific spatial priors or temporal priors computed from\nobject predictions in the recent past. On the autonomous driving datasets\nArgoverse-HD and BDD100K, our proposed method boosts the detection AP over\nstandard Faster R-CNN, both with and without finetuning.

This methodology is demonstrated on the high-pressure side of a\nsimple supercritical CO2 cycle power block, composed of a variable-speed\ncompressor, heat exchanger, and fixed-speed turbine. The control model is\ndeveloped by applying timescale-separation arguments to a high-fidelity\nsimulation model and locally linearizing non-ideal-gas turbomachinery\nperformance maps. MPC is implemented by linearizing the control model online at\neach sampling instant. Closed-loop simulations with a full-order gas-dynamics\ntruth model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control methodology.\nIn response to load changes, the controller maintains high turbine inlet\ntemperatures while achieving net power output ramp rates in excess of 100% of\nnameplate output per minute. The controller often acts at the intersection of\nmotor torque, compressor surge, and turbine inlet temperature constraints, and\nperforms well from 35 to 105% of nameplate capacity with no parameter\nscheduling.

Our intention is to alleviate\nthe problem that SE systems trained to improve speech quality often fail to\nimprove other downstream tasks, such as automatic speaker verification (ASV)\nand automatic speech recognition (ASR), because they do not share the same\nobjects. It is easy to apply the proposed dual-warping factors approach to any\nmask-based SE method, and it allows a single SE system to handle multiple tasks\nwithout task-dependent training.

Purpose: I investigate various SD configurations in the rapidly\nrotating $^{60,62}$Zn and $^{64}$Ge, and attempt elucidating the different\nroles of the energy gaps at particle numbers 30 and 32.

Results: The negative-parity SD bands appear higher in energy\nthan the positive-parity SD-yrast band in $^{60}$Zn by about 4 MeV, which is\nindicative of the SD doubly-magic nucleus.

The recent decade has witnessed the wide\napplications of TT-format tensors from diverse disciplines, among which tensor\ncompletion has drawn considerable attention. Numerous fast algorithms,\nincluding the Riemannian gradient descent (RGrad), have been proposed for the\nTT-format tensor completion. However, the theoretical guarantees of these\nalgorithms are largely missing or sub-optimal, partly due to the complicated\nand recursive algebraic operations in TT-format decomposition. Moreover,\nexisting results established for the tensors of other formats, for example,\nTucker and CP, are inapplicable because the algorithms treating TT-format\ntensors are substantially different and more involved. In this paper, we\nprovide, to our best knowledge, the first theoretical guarantees of the\nconvergence of RGrad algorithm for TT-format tensor completion, under a nearly\noptimal sample size condition. The RGrad algorithm converges linearly with a\nconstant contraction rate that is free of tensor condition number without the\nnecessity of re-conditioning.

In this study a\ncomprehensive numerical analysis of a caloric micro-cooling system using\nelastocaloric and electrocaloric materials was performed in order to\ninvestigate the limits and potential of this technology.

One basic\nassumption in [4] and here is that group actions g 2 G are defined on a space\nwhere some maximally accessible variable varies, and then accessible functions\nof these maximal variables are introduced.

In order to solve the\nmisalignment problem, we propose a plug-in Spatial-disentangled and\nTask-aligned operator (SALT). By predicting two task-aware point sets that are\nlocated in each task's sensitive regions, SALT can reassign features from those\nregions and align them to the corresponding anchor point. Therefore, features\nfor the two tasks are spatially aligned and disentangled. To minimize the\ndifference between the two regression stages, we propose a Self-distillation\nregression (SDR) loss that can transfer knowledge from the refined regression\nresults to the coarse regression results. On the basis of SALT and SDR loss, we\npropose SALT-Net, which explicitly exploits task-aligned point-set features for\naccurate detection results. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO dataset show\nthat our proposed methods can consistently boost different state-of-the-art\ndense detectors by $\\sim$2 AP. Notably, SALT-Net with Res2Net-101-DCN backbone\nachieves 53.8 AP on the MS-COCO test-dev.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 08:40:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 08:43:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 11:34:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 10:16:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 1 May 2022 03:49:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Self-supervised learning (SSL), which leverages\nunlabeled data only for representation learning, might be a promising way to\nimprove model performance. Existing SSL methods, however, usually rely on the\nsingle-centric-object guarantee, which may not be applicable for multi-instance\ndatasets such as street scenes. To alleviate this limitation, we raise two\nissues to solve: (1) how to define positive samples for cross-view consistency\nand (2) how to measure similarity in multi-instance circumstances. We first\nadopt an IoU threshold during random cropping to transfer global-inconsistency\nto local-consistency. Then, we propose two feature alignment methods to enable\n2D feature maps for multi-instance similarity measurement. Additionally, we\nadopt intra-image clustering with self-attention for further mining intra-image\nsimilarity and translation-invariance. Experiments show that, when pre-trained\non Waymo dataset, our method called Multi-instance Siamese Network (MultiSiam)\nremarkably improves generalization ability and achieves state-of-the-art\ntransfer performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, including Cityscapes and\nBDD100K, while existing SSL counterparts like MoCo, MoCo-v2, and BYOL show\nsignificant performance drop.

Due to the cascading effect, cloud failures often come with an\noverwhelming number of incidents from dependent services and devices. To pursue\nefficient incident management, related incidents should be quickly aggregated\nto narrow down the problem scope. To this end, in this paper, we propose GRLIA,\nan incident aggregation framework based on graph representation learning over\nthe cascading graph of cloud failures. A representation vector is learned for\neach unique type of incident in an unsupervised and unified manner, which is\nable to simultaneously encode the topological and temporal correlations among\nincidents. Thus, it can be easily employed for online incident aggregation. In\nparticular, to learn the correlations more accurately, we try to recover the\ncomplete scope of failures' cascading impact by leveraging fine-grained system\nmonitoring data, i.e., Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The proposed\nframework is evaluated with real-world incident data collected from a\nlarge-scale online service system of Huawei Cloud.

We have\nconsidered the aligned anisotropy case, $\\alpha$ is the orientational angle. It\nprovides an elegant en route to unearth the explicit role of anisotropy and\ndipolar interaction on the hysteresis response in such a versatile system.

The coercive field\n$\\mu^{}_oH^{}_c$, remanent magnetization $M^{}_r$, and the heat dissipation\n$E^{}_H$ also depend strongly on these parameters.

However, building an effective ML-based detection system is not a\ntrivial task, and requires data scientists with knowledge of the relevant\ndomain. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks have received a lot of\nattention in recent years, enabling non-ML experts in building a machine\nlearning model. This brings to an intriguing question of whether AutoML can\noutperform the results achieved by human data scientists. Our paper compares\nthe performances of six well-known, state-of-the-art AutoML frameworks on ten\ndifferent phishing datasets to see whether AutoML-based models can outperform\nmanually crafted machine learning models. Our results indicate that\nAutoML-based models are able to outperform manually developed machine learning\nmodels in complex classification tasks, specifically in datasets where the\nfeatures are not quite discriminative, and datasets with overlapping classes or\nrelatively high degrees of non-linearity. Challenges also remain in building a\nreal-world phishing detection system using AutoML frameworks due to the current\nsupport only on supervised classification problems, leading to the need for\nlabeled data, and the inability to update the AutoML-based models\nincrementally. This indicates that experts with knowledge in the domain of\nphishing and cybersecurity are still essential in the loop of the phishing\ndetection pipeline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 09:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

The multifluid quantum\nhydrodynamic model is used to obtain $N$-coupled pseudoforce differential\nequation system from which the energy band structure of plasmonic excitations\nis calculated. It is shown that inevitable appearance of energy bands separated\nby gaps can be due to discrete velocity filaments and their electrostatic mode\ncoupling in the electron gas. Current model also provides an alternative\ndescription of collisionless damping and phase mixing, i.e., collective\nscattering phenomenon within the energy band gaps due to mode coupling between\nwave-like and particle-like oscillations. The quantum multistream model is\nfurther generalized to include virtual streams which is used to calculate the\nelectronic band structure of one-dimensional plasmonic crystals. It is remarked\nthat, unlike the empty lattice approximation in free electron model, energy\nband gaps exist in plasmon excitations due to the collective electrostatic\ninteractions between electrons. It is also shown that the plasmonic band gap\nsize at first Brillouin zone boundary maximizes at the reciprocal lattice\nvector, $G$, close to metallic densities. Furthermore, the electron-lattice\nbinding and electron-phonon coupling strength effects on the electronic band\nstructure are discussed.

Such\nmacroscopic quantumness is often evaluated using long-range entanglement, i.e.,\nentanglement in the macroscopic length scale. The long-range entanglement not\nonly characterizes the novel quantum phases but also serves as a critical\nresource for quantum computation. Thus, the problem that arises is under which\nconditions can the long-range entanglement be stable even at room temperatures.\nHere, we show that bi-partite long-range entanglement is unstable at arbitrary\ntemperatures and exponentially decays with distance. Our theorem provides a\nno-go theorem on the existence of the long-range entanglement. The obtained\nresults are consistent with the existing observations that long-range\nentanglement at non-zero temperatures can exist in topologically ordered\nphases, where tripartite correlations are dominant. In the derivation of our\nresult, we introduce a quantum correlation defined by the convex roof of the\nstandard correlation function. We establish an exponential clustering theorem\nfor generic quantum many-body systems for such a quantum correlation at\narbitrary temperatures, which yields our main result by relating quantum\ncorrelation to quantum entanglement.

In\nparticular, the three effects explicitly covered are reflections at the\nunderbody of a car or truck, signals traveling back and forth between the\nvehicle on which the sensor is mounted and another object, and multipath\npropagation via specular reflection.

While such a\nmeasurement has been demonstrated in the microwave regime using a\nsuperconducting transmon ancilla, it has remained unclear how it can be\nimplemented in the optical regime. Here, we introduce a teleportation-based\nerror-correction scheme for the cat code, using elements suitable for an\noptical setting. The scheme detects and corrects single-photon losses while\nrestoring the amplitude of the cat states, thereby greatly suppressing the\naccumulation of errors in lossy channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 11:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

Further, we find that these approaches\nperform well on benchmark problems if there is a simple mapping from the given\ninput to the correct output. On problems where this mapping is complex, e.g.,\nif the problem consists of several sub-problems or requires iteration/recursion\nfor a correct solution, results tend to be worse.

This is a discrete exponential\nfamily with binary outcomes, where the sufficient statistic involves a\nquadratic term designed to capture correlations arising from pairwise\ninteractions. However, in many situations the dependencies in a network arise\nnot just from pairs, but from peer-group effects. A convenient mathematical\nframework for capturing higher-order dependencies, is the $p$-tensor Ising\nmodel, where the sufficient statistic consists of a multilinear polynomial of\ndegree $p$. This thesis develops a framework for statistical inference of the\nnatural parameters in $p$-tensor Ising models. We begin with the Curie-Weiss\nIsing model, where we unearth various non-standard phenomena in the asymptotics\nof the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the parameters, such as the\npresence of a critical curve in the interior of the parameter space on which\nthese estimates have a limiting mixture distribution, and a surprising\nsuperefficiency phenomenon at the boundary point(s) of this curve. ML\nestimation fails in more general $p$-tensor Ising models due to the presence of\na computationally intractable normalizing constant. To overcome this issue, we\nuse the popular maximum pseudo-likelihood (MPL) method, which avoids computing\nthe inexplicit normalizing constant based on conditional distributions. We\nderive general conditions under which the MPL estimate is\n$\\sqrt{N}$-consistent, where $N$ is the size of the underlying network.\nFinally, we consider a more general Ising model, which incorporates\nhigh-dimensional covariates at the nodes of the network, that can also be\nviewed as a logistic regression model with dependent observations. In this\nmodel, we show that the parameters can be estimated consistently under sparsity\nassumptions on the true covariate vector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 12:28:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 07:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

They have even outperformed human accuracy on some tasks. However,\nperformance evaluation of such AI systems have been limited to accuracy\nmeasures on curated and clean benchmark datasets that may not properly reflect\nhow robustly these systems can operate in real-world situations. In order to\naddress this challenge, we introduce and implement a wide variety of\nperturbation methods that simulate different types of noise and variability in\nclinical text data. While noisy samples produced by these perturbation methods\ncan often be understood by humans, they may cause AI systems to make erroneous\ndecisions. Conducting extensive experiments on several clinical text processing\ntasks, we evaluated the robustness of high-performance NLP models against\nvarious types of character-level and word-level noise. The results revealed\nthat the NLP models performance degrades when the input contains small amounts\nof noise. This study is a significant step towards exposing vulnerabilities of\nAI models utilized in clinical text processing systems. The proposed\nperturbation methods can be used in performance evaluation tests to assess how\nrobustly clinical NLP models can operate on noisy data, in real-world settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 12:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

Large values of the\nminimum electron Lorentz factor and quite low magnetisation values seem to be\nrequired. We propose a scenario where protons and electrons are co-accelerated\non internal or recollimation shocks inside the relativistic jet. In this\nsituation, energy is transferred from the protons to the electrons in the shock\ntransition layer, leading naturally to a high minimum Lorentz factor for the\nlatter. A low magnetisation favours the acceleration of particles in\nrelativistic shocks. The shock co-acceleration scenario provides additional\nconstraints on the set of parameters of a standard one-zone lepto-hadronic\nemission model, reducing its degeneracy. Values of the magnetic field strength\nof a few mG and minimum electron Lorentz factors of 10^3 to 10^4, required to\nprovide a satisfactory description of the observed spectral energy\ndistributions of extreme blazars, result here from first principles. While\nacceleration on a single standing shock is sufficient to reproduce the emission\nof most of the extreme-TeV sources we have examined, re-acceleration on a\nsecond shock appears needed for those objects with the hardest gamma-ray\nspectra. Emission from the accelerated proton population, with the same number\ndensity as the electrons but in a lower range of Lorentz factors, is strongly\nsuppressed. Satisfactory self-consistent representations were found for the\nmost prominent representatives of this new blazar class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 13:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

The evaluation of the learned policies shows that reinforcement\nlearning based maintenance strategies meet the requirements of the presented\nuse case and are suitable for maintenance scheduling in the shop floor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 14:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

Fundamental to these applications is the weighted addition operation\nwhich is most often implemented by a multiplexer (mux) tree. Mux-based adders\nhave very low area but typically require long bit-streams to reach practical\naccuracy thresholds when the number of summands is large. In this work, we\nfirst identify the main contributors to mux adder error. We then demonstrate\nwith analysis and experiment that two new techniques, precise sampling and full\ncorrelation, can target and mitigate these error sources. Implementing these\ntechniques in hardware leads to the design of CeMux (Correlation-enhanced\nMultiplexer), a stochastic mux adder that is significantly more accurate and\nuses much less area than traditional weighted adders. We compare CeMux to other\nSC and hybrid designs for an electrocardiogram filtering case study that\nemploys a large digital filter. One major result is that CeMux is shown to be\naccurate even for large input sizes. CeMux's higher accuracy leads to a latency\nreduction of 4x to 16x over other designs. Further, CeMux uses about 35% less\narea than existing designs, and we demonstrate that a small amount of accuracy\ncan be traded for a further 50% reduction in area. Finally, we compare CeMux to\na conventional binary design and we show that CeMux can achieve a 50 to 73%\narea reduction for similar power and latency as the conventional design, but at\na slightly higher level of error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 14:59:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 13:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

It has been\nhypothesized that they form in the inner regions of protoplanetary discs, out\nof the dust that may accumulate at the boundary between the inner region\nsusceptible to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) and an MRI-dead zone\nfurther out.

Here we\nexamine how the inner disc structure varies with stellar, disc and dust\nparameters. For high accretion rates and small dust grains, we find that: (1)\nthe main sources of ionization are thermal ionization and thermionic and ion\nemission; (2) the disc features a hot, high-viscosity inner region, and a local\ngas pressure maximum at the outer edge of this region (in line with previous\nstudies); and (3) an increase in the dust-to-gas ratio pushes the pressure\nmaximum outwards. Consequently, dust can accumulate in such inner discs without\nsuppressing the MRI, with the amount of accumulation depending on the viscosity\nin the MRI-dead regions. Conversely, for low accretion rates and large dust\ngrains, there appears to be an additional steady-state solution in which: (1)\nstellar X-rays become the main source of ionization; (2) MRI-viscosity is high\nthroughout the disc; and (3) the pressure maximum ceases to exist.

We propose a series\nof mitigating measures, including one that uses the described simulation method\nto optimize the scheduling of the observations. We conclude that no single\nmitigation measure will solve the problem of satellite trails for all\ninstruments and all science cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 15:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Although typically operated independently, coordination of these\nsystems during severe disruptions can allow for targeted delivery to lifeline\nservices, including gas delivery for residential heating and power delivery for\ncritical facilities. To address the challenge of estimating maximum joint\nnetwork capacities under such disruptions, we consider the task of determining\nfeasible steady-state operating points for severely damaged systems while\nensuring the maximal delivery of gas and power loads simultaneously,\nrepresented mathematically as the nonconvex joint Maximal Load Delivery (MLD)\nproblem.

However, not only are ablation procedures long,\nwith relatively high risk, but success rates are punitively low, with frequent\nVT recurrence. Personalized in-silico approaches have the opportunity to\naddress these limitations. However, state-of-the-art reaction diffusion (R-D)\nsimulations of VT induction and subsequent circuits used for in-silico ablation\ntarget identification require long execution times, along with vast\ncomputational resources, which are incompatible with the clinical workflow.\nHere, we present the Virtual Induction and Treatment of Arrhythmias (VITA), a\nnovel, rapid and fully automated computational approach that uses\nreaction-Eikonal methodology to induce VT and identify subsequent ablation\ntargets. The rationale for VITA is based on finding isosurfaces associated with\nan activation wavefront that splits in the ventricles due to the presence of an\nisolated isthmus of conduction within the scar; once identified, each isthmus\nmay be assessed for their vulnerability to sustain a reentrant circuit, and the\ncorresponding exit site automatically identified for potential ablation\ntargeting. VITA was tested on a virtual cohort of 7 post-infarcted porcine\nhearts and the results compared to R-D simulations. Using only a standard\ndesktop machine, VITA could detect all scar-related VTs, simulating activation\ntime maps and ECGs (for clinical comparison) as well as computing ablation\ntargets in 48 minutes. The comparable VTs probed by the R-D simulations took\n68.5 hours on 256 cores of high-performance computing infrastructure. The set\nof lesions computed by VITA was shown to render the ventricular model VT-free.\nVITA could be used in near real-time as a complementary modality aiding in\nclinical decision-making in the treatment of post-infarction VTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 13:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

From the Jordan-H\\\"older theorem and Frobenius-Lagrange\nembedding in an iterated wreath product, any finite group $G$ can be\nconstructed from a unique collection of simple groups, its Jordan-H\\\"older\nfactors, each with well-defined multiplicities through iterated extension.

It enables measuring very weak forces at the\nnanoscale, thus elucidating interactions at play in fundamental processes. Here\nwe leverage the combined benefits of micro/nanoelectromechanical systems and\ncavity optomechanics to fabricate a sensor for dynamic mode AFM at a frequency\nabove 100 MHz. This is two decades above the fastest commercial AFM probes,\nsuggesting opportunity for measuring forces at timescales unexplored so far.\nThe fabrication is achieved using very-large scale integration technologies\ninherited from photonic silicon circuits. The probe's ring optomechanical\ncavity is coupled to a 1.55 um laser light and features a 130 MHz mechanical\nresonance mode with a quality factor of 900 in air. A limit of detection in\ndisplacement of 3.10-16 m/sqrt(Hz) is obtained, enabling the detection of the\nBrownian motion of the probe and paving the way for force sensing experiments\nin the dynamic mode with a working vibration amplitude in the picometer range.\nInserted in a custom AFM instrument embodiment, this optomechanical sensor\ndemonstrates the capacity to perform force-distance measurements and to\nmaintain a constant interaction strength between tip and sample, an essential\nrequirement for AFM applications. Experiments show indeed a stable closed-loop\noperation with a setpoint of 4 nN/nm for an unprecedented sub-picometer\nvibration amplitude, where the tip-sample interaction is mediated by a\nstretched water meniscus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 07:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

The assemblies of particles are\ncharacterized using the evolution of the packing fraction, the coordination\nnumber, and the von Misses stress distribution within the particles as the\nconfining stress increases. The packing fraction increases and tends toward a\nmaximum value close to $1$, and the mean coordination number increases as a\nsquare root of the packing fraction. As the confining stress increases, a\ntransition is observed from a granular-like material with exponential tails of\nthe shear stress distributions to a continuous-like material characterized by\nGaussian-like distributions of the shear stresses. We develop an equation that\ndescribes the evolution of the packing fraction as a function of the applied\npressure. This equation, based on the micromechanical expression of the\ngranular stress tensor, the limit of the Hertz contact law for small\ndeformation, and the power-law relation between the packing fraction and the\ncoordination of the particles, provides good predictions from the jamming point\nup to very high densities without the need of tuning any parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 12:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

The experiments found that the maximum downslope velocity\ndepends on the ratio between the size of the flowing particles and the size of\nthe bed particles, with higher ratios leading to faster velocities. Two\ntechniques were then applied to estimate the evolving erosion depth: an\nestablished critical velocity method, and a novel particle-size-based method.\nErosion rates were estimated from both of these methods. Interestingly, these\ntwo rates express different and contradictory conclusions. In the\ncritical-velocity-based rate estimation, the normalized erosion rate increases\nwith the flow to bed grain size ratio, whereas the erosion rates estimated from\nthe particle-size-based approach find the opposite trend. We rationalise this\ndiscrepancy by considering the physical interpretation of both measurement\nmethods, and provide insight into how future modelling can be performed to\naccommodate both of these complementary measures. This paper highlights how the\nerosion rate is entirely dependent on the method of estimating the erosion\ndepth and the choice of measurement technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 03:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}
