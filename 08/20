To demarcate\nbetween a claim and a non-claim is arduous for both humans and machines, owing\nto latent linguistic variance between the two and the inadequacy of extensive\ndefinition-based formalization. Furthermore, the increase in the usage of\nonline social media has resulted in an explosion of unsolicited information on\nthe web presented as informal text. To account for the aforementioned, in this\npaper, we proposed DESYR. It is a framework that intends on annulling the said\nissues for informal web-based text by leveraging a combination of hierarchical\nrepresentation learning (dependency-inspired Poincare embedding),\ndefinition-based alignment, and feature projection. We do away with fine-tuning\ncomputer-heavy language models in favor of fabricating a more domain-centric\nbut lighter approach. Experimental results indicate that DESYR builds upon the\nstate-of-the-art system across four benchmark claim datasets, most of which\nwere constructed with informal texts. We see an increase of 3 claim-F1 points\non the LESA-Twitter dataset, an increase of 1 claim-F1 point and 9 macro-F1\npoints on the Online Comments(OC) dataset, an increase of 24 claim-F1 points\nand 17 macro-F1 points on the Web Discourse(WD) dataset, and an increase of 8\nclaim-F1 points and 5 macro-F1 points on the Micro Texts(MT) dataset.

We\nalso introduce MobileCaps-S and leverage it for performing severity assessment\nof CXR images of COVID-19 based on the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema\n(RALE) scoring technique. Our classification model achieved an overall recall\nof 91.60, 94.60, 92.20, and a precision of 98.50, 88.21, 92.62 for COVID-19,\nnon-COVID-19 pneumonia, and healthy cases, respectively. Further, the severity\nassessment model attained an R$^2$ coefficient of 70.51. Owing to the fact that\nthe proposed models have fewer trainable parameters than the state-of-the-art\nmodels reported in the literature, we believe our models will go a long way in\naiding healthcare systems in the battle against the pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 16:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

The sole\nfundamental solution to learn causal attention is by causal intervention, which\nrequires additional annotations of the confounders, e.g., a \"dog\" model is\nlearned within \"grass+dog\" and \"road+dog\" respectively, so the \"grass\" and\n\"road\" contexts will no longer confound the \"dog\" recognition.

Furthermore, we derive\ninfinitely many Ward identities associated with the infinite soft currents\nwhich generate the holographic symmetry algebra. This is realized by\nconsidering the OPE between a soft symmetry current and a hard operator, and\nthen summing over its $\\overline{SL(2,\\mathbb R)}$ descendants. These Ward\nidentities reproduce the known Ward identities corresponding to the leading,\nsub-leading, and sub-sub-leading soft graviton theorems as well as the leading\nand sub-leading soft gluon theorems. By performing shadow transformations, we\nalso obtain infinitely many shadow Ward identities, including the stress tensor\nWard identities for sub-leading soft graviton. Finally, we use our procedure to\ndiscuss the corrections to Ward identities in effective field theory (EFT), and\nreproduce the corrections to soft theorems at sub-sub-leading order for\ngraviton and sub-leading order for photon. For this aim, we derive general\nformulae for the celestial OPE and its corresponding Ward identities arising\nfrom a cubic interaction of three spinning massless particles.

Currently, we\ncan build computing systems that adjust or learn over time to match changes\nthat were anticipated.

Nevertheless, they incorporate image context in a linear 1D\norder by attending only to previously synthesized image patches above or to the\nleft. Not only is this unidirectional, sequential bias of attention unnatural\nfor images as it disregards large parts of a scene until synthesis is almost\ncomplete. It also processes the entire image on a single scale, thus ignoring\nmore global contextual information up to the gist of the entire scene. As a\nremedy we incorporate a coarse-to-fine hierarchy of context by combining the\nautoregressive formulation with a multinomial diffusion process: Whereas a\nmultistage diffusion process successively removes information to coarsen an\nimage, we train a (short) Markov chain to invert this process.

However, matrices in this domain are typically large, with rows and\ncolumns numbered in billions. Low-rank approximation of such arrays typically\ndestroys essential information; thus, new mathematical and computational\nparadigms are needed for very large, sparse matrices.\n  We present the U-match matrix factorization scheme to address this challenge.\nU-match has two desirable features. First, it admits a compressed storage\nformat that reduces the number of nonzero entries held in computer memory by\none or more orders of magnitude over other common factorizations. Second, it\npermits direct solution of diverse problems in linear and homological algebra,\nwithout decompressing matrices stored in memory. These problems include look-up\nand retrieval of rows and columns; evaluation of birth/death times, and\nextraction of generators in persistent (co)homology; and, calculation of bases\nfor boundary and cycle subspaces of filtered chain complexes. Such bases are\nkey to unlocking a range of other topological techniques for use in TDA, and\nU-match factorization is designed to make such calculations broadly accessible\nto practitioners.\n  As an application, we show that individual cycle representatives in\npersistent homology can be retrieved at time and memory costs orders of\nmagnitude below current state of the art, via global duality. Moreover, the\nalgebraic machinery needed to achieve this computation already exists in many\nmodern solvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 17:51:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 14:07:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

By representing the point cloud as a\nset of unordered groups of points with position embeddings, we convert the\npoint cloud to a sequence of point proxies and employ the transformers for\npoint cloud generation. To facilitate transformers to better leverage the\ninductive bias about 3D geometric structures of point clouds, we further devise\na geometry-aware block that models the local geometric relationships\nexplicitly. The migration of transformers enables our model to better learn\nstructural knowledge and preserve detailed information for point cloud\ncompletion.

In\ntotal, another three candidates from our original sample of 11 candidates\nobserved at various resolutions with various instruments were refuted as\nco-moving pairs because their radial velocities are significantly different.\nWithin our sample of wide binaries, we found homogeneity amongst the pair\ncomponents in dynamical properties (proper motion and line-of-sight velocities)\nand also in chemical composition. Their metallicities are -1.16, -1.42, and\n-0.79 dex in [Fe/H] for each wide binary pair, which places these stars on the\nmetal-poor side of wide binaries reported in the literature.

We develop a design\napproach based on supervised neural network where class labels are generated\nusing an efficient sparse beamformer spectral analysis (SBSA) approach. SBSA\nuses explicit information of the unknown narrowband interference environment\nfor training the network and bears close performance to training using\nenumerations, i.e., exhaustive search which is computationally prohibitive for\nlarge arrays. The employed DNN effectively approximates the unknown mapping\nfrom the input received data spatial correlations to the output of sparse\nconfiguration with effective interference mitigation capability. The problem is\nposed as a multi-label classification problem where the selected antenna\nlocations achieving MaxSINR are indicated by the output layer of DNN. In\naddition to evaluating the performance of the DNN in terms of the\nclassification accuracy, we evaluate the performance in terms of the the\nability of the classified sparse array to mitigate interference and maximize\nsignal power. It is shown that even in the case of miss-classification, where\nat least one sensor location doesn't match the optimal locations, the DNN\neffectively learns the sub-optimal sparse configuration which has desirable\nSINR characteristics. This shows the ability of the DNN to learn the proposed\noptimization algorithms, hence paving the way for efficient real-time\nimplementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 01:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

Although the recent automation in surveillance systems\nare capable of detecting the anomalies, but they still need human efforts for\ncategorizing the anomalies and taking necessary preventive actions. This is due\nto the lack of methodology performing both anomaly detection and classification\nfor real world scenarios. Thinking of a fully automatized surveillance system,\nwhich is capable of both detecting and classifying the anomalies that need\nimmediate actions, a joint anomaly detection and classification method is a\npressing need. The task of joint detection and classification of anomalies\nbecomes challenging due to the unavailability of dense annotated videos\npertaining to anomalous classes, which is a crucial factor for training modern\ndeep architecture. Furthermore, doing it through manual human effort seems\nimpossible. Thus, we propose a method that jointly handles the anomaly\ndetection and classification in a single framework by adopting a\nweakly-supervised learning paradigm.

A challenge of training such a model lies in\nproperly infusing class information into its generator and discriminator. For\nthe discriminator, class conditioning can be achieved by either (1) directly\nincorporating labels as input or (2) involving labels in an auxiliary\nclassification loss.

Although\npromising performances have been achieved, they are still limited by two\nproblems: (1) existing underwater image synthesis models have an intrinsic\nlimitation, in which the homogeneous ambient light is usually randomly\ngenerated and many important dependencies are ignored, and thus the synthesized\ntraining data cannot adequately express characteristics of real underwater\nenvironments; (2) most of deep models disregard lots of favorable underwater\npriors and heavily rely on training data, which extensively limits their\napplication ranges. To address these limitations, a new underwater synthetic\ndataset is first established, in which a revised ambient light synthesis\nequation is embedded. The revised equation explicitly defines the complex\nmathematical relationship among intensity values of the ambient light in RGB\nchannels and many dependencies such as surface-object depth, water types, etc,\nwhich helps to better simulate real underwater scene appearances. Secondly, a\nunified framework is proposed, named ANA-SYN, which can effectively enhance\nunderwater images under collaborations of priors (underwater domain knowledge)\nand data information (underwater distortion distribution). The proposed\nframework includes an analysis network and a synthesis network, one for priors\nexploration and another for priors integration. To exploit more accurate\npriors, the significance of each prior for the input image is explored in the\nanalysis network and an adaptive weighting module is designed to dynamically\nrecalibrate them. Meanwhile, a novel prior guidance module is introduced in the\nsynthesis network, which effectively aggregates the prior and data features and\nthus provides better hybrid information to perform the more reasonable image\nenhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 06:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

We use effective\nmass theory to calculate the discrete eigenenergies in this new system and use\nthem to formulate a new spin-to-charge protocol that involves resonant\nphotoionization out the NV ground state into the diamond conduction band. The\nmajor sources of broadening are also addressed which guide the design of the\nexperiment. With this mechanism we theorise an optical spin contrast that and\nan associated spin readout fidelity of 85%. This significant improvement can be\napplied to a number of cryogenic quantum technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 07:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

Networked systems are often composed of many dynamic components and\nchange over time, which makes it difficult for existing methods to access the\nchangeable situation of network resilience. This paper establishes a novel\nquantitative framework for evaluating network resilience using the Dynamic\nBayesian Network. The proposed framework can be used to evaluate the network's\nmulti-stage resilience processes when suffering various attacks and recoveries.\nFirst, we define the dynamic capacities of network components and establish the\nnetwork's five core resilience capabilities to describe the resilient\nnetworking stages including preparation, resistance, adaptation, recovery, and\nevolution; the five core resilience capabilities consist of rapid response\ncapability, sustained resistance capability, continuous running capability,\nrapid convergence capability, and dynamic evolution capability. Then, we employ\na two-time slices approach based on the Dynamic Bayesian Network to quantify\nfive crucial performances of network resilience based on core capabilities\nproposed above. The proposed approach can ensure the time continuity of\nresilience evaluation in time-varying networks. Finally, our proposed\nevaluation framework is applied to different attacks and recovery conditions in\ntypical simulations and real-world network topology. Results and comparisons\nwith extant studies indicate that the proposed method can achieve a more\naccurate and comprehensive evaluation and can be applied to network scenarios\nunder various attack and recovery intensities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 08:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

In this paper, we make a\nfirst attempt to address this issue by proposing a new Out-of-boundary View\nSynthesis (OVS) method. By the nature of spatial coherence between adjacent\nframes and within each frame, OVS extrapolates the out-of-boundary view by\naligning adjacent frames to each reference one. Technically, it first\ncalculates the optical flow and propagates it to the outer boundary region\naccording to the affinity, and then warps pixels accordingly. OVS can be\nintegrated into existing warping-based stabilizers as a plug-and-play module to\nsignificantly improve the cropping ratio of the stabilized results. In\naddition, stability is improved because the jitter amplification effect caused\nby cropping and resizing is reduced.

Flow aggregation, namely origins and destinations\naggregated simultaneously, is one of the most common patterns, say the\naggregated origin-to-destination flows between two transport hubs may indicate\nthe great traffic demand between two sites. Developing a clustering method for\nconstrained flows is crucial for determining urban flow aggregation. Among\nexisting methods about identifying flow aggregation, L-function of flows is the\nmajor one. Nevertheless, this method depends on the aggregation scale, the key\nparameter detected by Euclidean L-function, it does not adapt to road network.\nThe extracted aggregation may be overestimated and dispersed. Therefore, we\npropose a clustering method based on L-function of Manhattan space, which\nconsists of three major steps. The first is to detect aggregation scales by\nManhattan L-function. The second is to determine core flows possessing highest\nlocal L-function values at different scales. The final step is to take the\nintersection of core flows neighbourhoods, the extent of which depends on\ncorresponding scale.

We have identified 17\nenergetic electron events well-observed with the SEPT instrument aboard STEREO\nwhich show a clear association with a hard X-ray (HXR) flare observed with the\nRHESSI spacecraft. We compare the spectral indices of the RHESSI HXR spectra\nwith those of the interplanetary electrons. Because of the frequent\ndouble-power-law shape of the in situ electron spectra, we paid special\nattention to the choice of the spectral index used for comparison. The time\ndifference between the electron onsets and the associated type III and\nmicrowave bursts suggests that the electron events are detected at 1 AU with\napparent delays ranging from 9 to 41 minutes. While the parent solar activity\nis clearly impulsive, also showing a high correlation with extreme ultraviolet\njets, most of the studied events occur in temporal coincidence with coronal\nmass ejections (CMEs). In spite of the observed onset delays and presence of\nCMEs in the low corona, we find a significant correlation of about 0.8 between\nthe spectral indices of the HXR flare and the in situ electrons. The\ncorrelations increase if only events with significant anisotropy are\nconsidered. This suggests that transport effects can alter the injected spectra\nleading to a strongly reduced imprint of the flare acceleration. We conclude\nthat interplanetary transport effects must be taken into account when inferring\nthe initial acceleration of solar energetic electron events. Although our\nresults suggest a clear imprint of flare acceleration for the analyzed event\nsample, a secondary acceleration might be present which could account for the\nobserved delays. However, the limited and variable pitch-angle coverage of SEPT\ncould also be the reason for the observed delays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 08:17:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

However, these systems suffer from issues such as hygiene, sensor\ndegradation due to constant physical contact, and latent fingerprint threats.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach for developing a contactless fingerprint\nrecognition system that captures finger photo from a distance using an image\nsensor in a suitable environment. The captured finger photos are then processed\nfurther to obtain global and local (minutiae-based) features. Specifically, a\nSiamese convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to extract global\nfeatures from a given finger photo. The proposed system computes matching\nscores from CNN-based features and minutiae-based features. Finally, the two\nscores are fused to obtain the final matching score between the probe and\nreference fingerprint templates. Most importantly, the proposed system is\ndeveloped using the Nvidia Jetson Nano development kit, which allows us to\nperform contactless fingerprint recognition in real-time with minimum latency\nand acceptable matching accuracy. The performance of the proposed system is\nevaluated on an in-house IITI contactless fingerprint dataset (IITI-CFD)\ncontaining 105train and 100 test subjects.

During continued sliding, combined\nshear and lattice rotation result in the formation of crystallographic textures\nwhich influence friction and wear at the sliding interface. In order to\nelucidate the fundamental lattice rotation kinematics involved in this process\nduring the early stages of sliding, we conducted unlubricated, linear single\npass sliding experiments on a copper bicrystal using sapphire spheres. Electron\nbackscatter diffraction (EBSD) performed directly on the bulk surface of the\nwear tracks in the vicinity of the grain boundary reveals crystal lattice\nrotations by approximately up to 35{\\deg}. Predominantly, the tribologically\ninduced crystal rotations appear to be kinematically constrained to rotations\naround the transverse direction (TD) and occur in both grains, irrespective of\nload (2 to 8 N).

A lower proportion of the\ncrystal lattice rotates much farther around TD (roughly up to 90{\\deg}),\naccompanied by a superimposed crystal rotation around +/-SD. Analysis reveals\nthat sliding direction and grain orientation exert a systematic influence of\nhow crystal rotations are accommodated. This is rationalized in terms of\ngeometry, anisotropic wear track profiles and slip traces. Under specific\nconditions, combined crystal rotation and twinning are observed.

We considered four effects: $K-$corrections,\ntime-dilation, the apparent change of host dust extinction due to non-comoving\nreference frames, and the change of observed color due to redshift.\nExtinction-dependent $K-$corrections were computed using stellar atmosphere\nmodels applicable to giant stars for $0.005 < z < 0.03$ in HST, JWST, and 2MASS\nfilters. The optical-NIR Wesenheit function advantageously combines filters\nwith oppositely signed $K-$corrections and avoids complications due to host\nextinction.

There are many reports in the\nliterature showing the potential for FPGAs to accelerate a wide variety of\nalgorithms, which combined with their growing availability, would seem to also\nindicate a widespread use in many applications. Unfortunately, there is not\nmuch published research exploring what it takes to integrate an FPGA into an\nexisting application in a cost-effective way and keeping the algorithmic\nperformance advantages. Building on recent results exploring how to employ\nFPGAs to improve the search engines used in the travel industry, this paper\nanalyses the end-to-end performance of the search engine when using FPGAs, as\nwell as the necessary changes to the software and the cost of such deployments.\nThe results provide important insights on current FPGA deployments and what\nneeds to be done to make FPGAs more widely used. For instance, the large\npotential performance gains provided by an FPGA are greatly diminished in\npractice if the application cannot submit request in the most optimal way,\nsomething that is not always possible and might require significant changes to\nthe application. Similarly, some existing cloud deployments turn out to use a\nvery imbalanced architecture: a powerful FPGA connected to a not so powerful\nCPU. The result is that the CPU cannot generate enough load for the FPGA, which\npotentially eliminates all performance gains and might even result in a more\nexpensive system. In this paper, we report on an extensive study and\ndevelopment effort to incorporate FPGAs into a search engine and analyse the\nissues encountered and their practical impact. We expect that these results\nwill inform the development and deployment of FPGAs in the future by providing\nimportant insights on the end-to-end integration of FPGAs within existing\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 08:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

In the first\nphase, multiple predictive models produce the probability of different\nimmediate user actions. In the second phase, these predictions are aggregated\naccording to a set of 'strategic parameters' to meet a diverse set of business\ngoals, such as longer user engagement, higher revenue potential, or more\ncommunity/network interactions. In addition to building accurate predictive\nmodels, it is also crucial to optimize this set of 'strategic parameters' so\nthat primary goals are optimized while secondary guardrails are not hurt. In\nthis setting with multiple and constrained goals, this paper discovers that a\nprobabilistic strategic parameter regime can achieve better value compared to\nthe standard regime of finding a single deterministic parameter. The new\nprobabilistic regime is to learn the best distribution over strategic parameter\nchoices and sample one strategic parameter from the distribution when each user\nvisits the platform. To pursue the optimal probabilistic solution, we formulate\nthe problem into a stochastic compositional optimization problem, in which the\nunbiased stochastic gradient is unavailable.

Recently, many CNN-based\nmethods have been proposed for rain removal. Although these methods can remove\npart of the rain streaks, it is difficult for them to adapt to real-world\nscenarios and restore high-quality rain-free images with clear and accurate\nstructures. To solve this problem, we propose a Structure-Preserving Deraining\nNetwork (SPDNet) with RCP guidance. SPDNet directly generates high-quality\nrain-free images with clear and accurate structures under the guidance of RCP\nbut does not rely on any rain-generating assumptions. Specifically, we found\nthat the RCP of images contains more accurate structural information than rainy\nimages. Therefore, we introduced it to our deraining network to protect\nstructure information of the rain-free image. Meanwhile, a Wavelet-based\nMulti-Level Module (WMLM) is proposed as the backbone for learning the\nbackground information of rainy images and an Interactive Fusion Module (IFM)\nis designed to make full use of RCP information. In addition, an iterative\nguidance strategy is proposed to gradually improve the accuracy of RCP,\nrefining the result in a progressive path. Extensive experimental results on\nboth synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model\nachieves new state-of-the-art results.

Secondly, we provide the convergence analysis of HFL\nwith user mobility. Our analysis proves that the learning performance of HFL\ndeteriorates drastically with highly-mobile users.

However, it is difficult to keep the POI database in sync with the\nreal-world counterparts due to the dynamic nature of business changes. To\nalleviate this problem, we formulate and present a practical solution that\njointly extracts POI mentions and identifies their coupled accessibility labels\nfrom unstructured text. We approach this task as a sequence tagging problem,\nwhere the goal is to produce <POI name, accessibility label> pairs from\nunstructured text. This task is challenging because of two main issues: (1) POI\nnames are often newly-coined words so as to successfully register new entities\nor brands and (2) there may exist multiple pairs in the text, which\nnecessitates dealing with one-to-many or many-to-one mapping to make each POI\ncoupled with its accessibility label. To this end, we propose a\nGeographic-Enhanced and Dependency-guIded sequence Tagging (GEDIT) model to\nconcurrently address the two challenges. First, to alleviate challenge #1, we\ndevelop a geographic-enhanced pre-trained model to learn the text\nrepresentations. Second, to mitigate challenge #2, we apply a relational graph\nconvolutional network to learn the tree node representations from the parsed\ndependency tree. Finally, we construct a neural sequence tagging model by\nintegrating and feeding the previously pre-learned representations into a CRF\nlayer. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate the\nsuperiority and effectiveness of GEDIT. In addition, it has already been\ndeployed in production at Baidu Maps.

This work presents results from integral field spectroscopic\nobservations of the BCG Haro 14 taken with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic\nExplorer (MUSE). The large MUSE field of view enables simultaneous observations\nof the starburst and the host galaxy. We built galaxy maps in continuum and in\nemission lines and generated synthetic VRI images, from which we produced color\nindex maps and surface brightness profiles. We detected numerous clumps spread\nthroughout the galaxy, both in continuum and in emission lines, and produced a\ncatalog with their position, size, and photometry. This analysis allowed us to\nstudy the morphology and stellar populations of Haro 14 in detail. The stellar\ndistribution shows a pronounced asymmetry; the intensity peak in continuum is\nnot centered with respect to the stellar host but is displaced by about 500 pc\nsouthwest. At the position of the continuum peak we find a bright stellar\ncluster that with M$_{V}=-12.18$ appears as a strong super stellar cluster\ncandidate. We also find a highly asymmetric, blue, but nonionizing stellar\ncomponent that occupies almost the whole eastern part of the galaxy. We\nconclude that there are at least three different stellar populations in Haro\n14: the current starburst of about 6 Myr; an intermediate-age component of\nbetween ten and several hundred million years; and a red and regular host of\nseveral gigayears.

Based\non the observation, we propose a kernel-sharing parallel atrous convolutional\n(KPAC) block specifically designed by incorporating the property of inverse\nkernels for single image defocus deblurring. To effectively simulate the\ninvariant shapes of inverse kernels with different scales, KPAC shares the same\nconvolutional weights among multiple atrous convolution layers.

In order to explain the observed correlation between the hard\nX-ray transition luminosity and the soft X-ray peak luminosity in the soft\nstate, we construct a magnetic disk-outflow model for the state transition in\nXRBs. We assume that the large-scale magnetic field in the outer thin disk is\nformed through inverse cascade of small-scale dynamo generated field, and it is\nthen advected by the inner advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF), which\naccelerates a fraction of the gas into the outflows. During the outbursts, the\nheating front moves inwards, and the field strength at the heating front of the\nouter disk is proportional to the accretion rate of the disk. Much angular\nmomentum of the inner ADAF is carried away by the outflows for a stronger\nmagnetic field, which leads to a high radial velocity of the ADAF. This makes\nthe critical mass accretion rate of the ADAF increases with the field strength,\nand it therefore leads to a correlation between transition luminosity and the\npeak luminosity in the thermal state. We found that the values of the viscosity\nparameter $\\alpha$ of the neutron star XRBs are systematically higher for those\nof the black hole (BH) XRBs ($\\alpha\\sim 0.05-0.15$ for BHs, and $\\alpha\\sim\n0.15-0.4$ for neutron stars).

Such machines are either driven by circular or linear\naccelerators. The circular machines, having the center-mass (CM) energy values\nreaching 200 GeV (for leptons) and above, experience beam energy loss and\nquality dilution, for example, due to synchrotron radiation, limiting the\noverall CM energy achievable and requiring a constant energy top-up to\ncompensate the loss and the beam quality dilution. Linear colliders overcome\nthese limitations, while the finite capabilities of generating high average\ncurrent beams limits the luminosity. This is partially compensated by the\nquality of the colliding beams. In this work, we suggest a novel design of\ncircular-linear accelerator based on the merging of the \"non-emitting\",\nlow-energy storage rings and energy recovery linear accelerators.

Directly\nregressing camera pose/3D scene coordinates from the input image using deep\nneural networks has shown great potential. However, such methods assume a\nstationary data distribution with all scenes simultaneously available during\ntraining. In this paper, we approach the problem of visual localization in a\ncontinual learning setup -- whereby the model is trained on scenes in an\nincremental manner. Our results show that similar to the classification domain,\nnon-stationary data induces catastrophic forgetting in deep networks for visual\nlocalization. To address this issue, a strong baseline based on storing and\nreplaying images from a fixed buffer is proposed. Furthermore, we propose a new\nsampling method based on coverage score (Buff-CS) that adapts the existing\nsampling strategies in the buffering process to the problem of visual\nlocalization.

In this paper, we consider the grant-free uplink transmission of an\nIoT network with a multi-antenna base station (BS) and a large number of\nsingle-antenna IoT devices. Due to the sporadic nature of IoT devices, we\nformulate the joint activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE) problem\nas a group-sparse matrix estimation problem. Although many algorithms have been\nproposed to solve the JADCE problem, most of them are developed based on\ncompressive sensing technique, yielding suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we\nfirst develop an efficient weighted $l_1$-norm minimization algorithm to better\napproximate the group sparsity than the existing mixed $l_1/l_2$-norm\nminimization. Although an enhanced estimation performance in terms of the mean\nsquared error (MSE) can be achieved, the weighted $l_1$-norm minimization\nalgorithm is still a convex relaxation of the original group-sparse matrix\nestimation problem, yielding a suboptimal solution. To this end, we further\nreformulate the JADCE problem as a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem,\nwhich can be solved by using the branch-and-bound method. As a result, we are\nable to obtain an optimal solution of the JADCE problem, which can be adopted\nas an upper bound to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing algorithms.\nMoreover, we also derive the minimum pilot sequence length required to fully\nrecover the estimated matrix in the noiseless scenario.

In order to alleviate the cold-start\nissue, most existing methods introduce content and contextual information as\nthe auxiliary information. Nevertheless, these methods assume the recommended\nitems behave steadily over time, while in a typical E-commerce scenario, items\ngenerally have very different performances throughout their life period. In\nsuch a situation, it would be beneficial to consider the long-term return from\nthe item perspective, which is usually ignored in conventional methods.\nReinforcement learning (RL) naturally fits such a long-term optimization\nproblem, in which the recommender could identify high potential items,\nproactively allocate more user impressions to boost their growth, therefore\nimprove the multi-period cumulative gains.

In RL-LTV, the critic\nstudies historical trajectories of items and predict the future LTV of fresh\nitem, while the actor suggests a score-based policy which maximizes the future\nLTV expectation. Scores suggested by the actor are then combined with classical\nranking scores in a dual-rank framework, therefore the recommendation is\nbalanced with the LTV consideration.

Though conventional captioning\nmodels achieve high accuracy based on popular metrics, i.e., BLEU, CIDEr, and\nSPICE, the ability of captions to distinguish the target image from other\nsimilar images is under-explored. To generate distinctive captions, a few\npioneers employ contrastive learning or re-weighted the ground-truth captions,\nwhich focuses on one single input image. However, the relationships between\nobjects in a similar image group (e.g., items or properties within the same\nalbum or fine-grained events) are neglected. In this paper, we improve the\ndistinctiveness of image captions using a Group-based Distinctive Captioning\nModel (GdisCap), which compares each image with other images in one similar\ngroup and highlights the uniqueness of each image. In particular, we propose a\ngroup-based memory attention (GMA) module, which stores object features that\nare unique among the image group (i.e., with low similarity to objects in other\nimages). These unique object features are highlighted when generating captions,\nresulting in more distinctive captions. Furthermore, the distinctive words in\nthe ground-truth captions are selected to supervise the language decoder and\nGMA. Finally, we propose a new evaluation metric, distinctive word rate\n(DisWordRate) to measure the distinctiveness of captions. Quantitative results\nindicate that the proposed method significantly improves the distinctiveness of\nseveral baseline models, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both\naccuracy and distinctiveness. Results of a user study agree with the\nquantitative evaluation and demonstrate the rationality of the new metric\nDisWordRate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:46:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 07:50:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 12:32:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 03:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

The underlying implementation takes advantage of a fast multi-linear\ninterpolation scheme with an efficient choice of interpolation grid points,\nthus giving the package a small memory footprint without compromising\nestimation accuracy. This makes latent correlation estimation readily available\nfor modern high-throughput data analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 13:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

However, DL models are often large\nin size and require large-scale computation, which prevents them from being\nplaced directly onto IoT devices, where resources are constrained and 32-bit\nfloating-point (float-32) operations are unavailable. Commercial framework\n(i.e., a set of toolkits) empowered model quantization is a pragmatic solution\nthat enables DL deployment on mobile devices and embedded systems by\neffortlessly post-quantizing a large high-precision model (e.g., float-32) into\na small low-precision model (e.g., int-8) while retaining the model inference\naccuracy.

However, most state-of-the-art models are designed to\noperate with short documents such as tweets, user reviews, comments, etc. These\nmodels have fundamental limitations when applied to long-form documents such as\nscientific papers, legal documents, and patents. When handling such long\ndocuments, there are three primary challenges: (i) the presence of different\ncontexts for the same word throughout the document, (ii) small sections of\ncontextually similar text between two documents, but dissimilar text in the\nremaining parts (this defies the basic understanding of \"similarity\"), and\n(iii) the coarse nature of a single global similarity measure which fails to\ncapture the heterogeneity of the document content. In this paper, we describe\nCoLDE: Contrastive Long Document Encoder - a transformer-based framework that\naddresses these challenges and allows for interpretable comparisons of long\ndocuments. CoLDE uses unique positional embeddings and a multi-headed chunkwise\nattention layer in conjunction with a supervised contrastive learning framework\nto capture similarity at three different levels: (i) high-level similarity\nscores between a pair of documents, (ii) similarity scores between different\nsections within and across documents, and (iii) similarity scores between\ndifferent chunks in the same document and across other documents. These\nfine-grained similarity scores aid in better interpretability. We evaluate\nCoLDE on three long document datasets namely, ACL Anthology publications,\nWikipedia articles, and USPTO patents.

An IDS distinguishes the malicious traffic\nfrom the benign one and determines the attack types targeting the assets of the\norganization. The main challenge of an IDS is facing new (i.e., zero-day)\nattacks and separating them from benign traffic and existing types of attacks.\nAlong with the power of the deep learning-based IDSes in auto-extracting\nhigh-level features and its independence from the time-consuming and costly\nsignature extraction process, the mentioned challenge still exists in this new\ngeneration of IDSes.\n  In this paper, we propose a framework for deep learning-based IDSes\naddressing new attacks. This framework is the first approach using both deep\nnovelty-based classifiers besides the traditional clustering based on the\nspecialized layer of deep structures, in the security scope. Additionally, we\nintroduce DOC++ as a newer version of DOC as a deep novelty-based classifier.\nWe also employ the Deep Intrusion Detection (DID) framework for the\npreprocessing phase, which improves the ability of deep learning algorithms to\ndetect content-based attacks.

The stability problem can be formulated as a free\nboundary problem of a quasi-linear hyperbolic equation of second order in a\ndihedral-space domain between the shock front and the solid wall. The key\ndifficulty is brought by the edge singularity of the space domain, the\nintersection curve between the shock front and the solid wall. Different from\nthe 2-D case, for which the singular part of the boundary is only a point, it\nis a curve for the 3-D case in this paper. This difference brings new\ndifficulties to the mathematical analysis of the stability problem. A modified\npartial hodograph transformation is introduced such that the extension\ntechnique developed for the 2-D case can be employed to establish the\nwell-posed theory for the initial-boundary value problem of the linearized\nhyperbolic equation of second order in a dihedral-space domain. Moreover, the\nextension technique is improved in this paper such that loss of regularity in\nthe a priori estimates on the shock front does not occur. Thus the classical\nnonlinear iteration scheme can be constructed to prove the existence of the\nsolution to the stability problem, which shows the dynamic stability of the\nsteady planar normal shock without applying the Nash-Moser iteration method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 14:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

Near-infrared\nspectroscopy (NIRS) is an established technology developed to monitor regional\ntissue oxygenation. Detailed waveform analysis of the cerebral NIRS signal\ncould improve the clinical utility of this method in accurately predicting\nbrain injury. Frequent transient cerebral oxygen desaturations are commonly\nobserved in extremely preterm infants, yet their clinical significance remains\nunclear. The aim of this study was to examine and compare the performance of\ntwo distinct approaches in isolating and extracting transient deflections\nwithin NIRS signals. We optimized three different simultaneous low-pass\nfiltering and total variation denoising (LPF_TVD) methods and compared their\nperformance with a recently proposed method that uses singular-spectrum\nanalysis and the discrete cosine transform (SSA_DCT). Parameters for the\nLPF_TVD methods were optimized over a grid search using synthetic NIRS-like\nsignals. The SSA_DCT method was modified with a post-processing procedure to\nincrease sparsity in the extracted components. Our analysis, using a synthetic\nNIRS-like dataset, showed that a LPF_TVD method outperformed the modified\nSSA_DCT method: median mean-squared error of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86 to 1.07) was\nlower for the LPF_TVD method compared to the modified SSA_DCT method of 1.48\n(95% CI: 1.33 to 1.63), P<0.001. The dual low-pass filter and total variation\ndenoising methods are considerably more computational efficient, by 3 to 4\norders of magnitude, than the SSA_DCT method. More research is needed to\nexamine the efficacy of these methods in extracting oxygen desaturation in real\nNIRS signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 15:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nallows doctors to discover clinical indicators and enhance their diagnosis and\ntreatments. Specifically, explainable AI offers tools to improve the clinical\nprediction models that experience poor interpretability of their results. This\nwork presents an explainability analysis and evaluation of a prediction model\nfor heart failure survival by using a dataset that comprises 299 patients who\nsuffered heart failure. The model employs a data workflow pipeline able to\nselect the best ensemble tree algorithm as well as the best feature selection\ntechnique. Moreover, different post-hoc techniques have been used for the\nexplainability analysis of the model. The paper's main contribution is an\nexplainability-driven approach to select the best prediction model for HF\nsurvival based on an accuracy-explainability balance. Therefore, the most\nbalanced explainable prediction model implements an Extra Trees classifier over\n5 selected features (follow-up time, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, age\nand diabetes) out of 12, achieving a balanced-accuracy of 85.1% and 79.5% with\ncross-validation and new unseen data respectively. The follow-up time is the\nmost influencing feature followed by serum-creatinine and ejection-fraction.\nThe explainable prediction model for HF survival presented in this paper would\nimprove a further adoption of clinical prediction models by providing doctors\nwith intuitions to better understand the reasoning of, usually, black-box AI\nclinical solutions, and make more reasonable and data-driven decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 09:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

Due to their high-penetrative nature, cosmic\nray muons can easily penetrate shielded nuclear materials with minimal\nabsorption and with leaving the target objects intact. However, despite the\npotential benefits from using cosmic ray muons for SNM monitoring, their\nwidespread application has been limited for various reasons, including\nrelatively low cosmic ray muon flux at sea level and the difficulty of\nmeasuring muon momentum in the field which can increase resolution and reduce\nmeasurement time. In this work, we explore in detail the effect of cosmic ray\nmuon momentum measurement, focusing specifically on SNM monitoring\napplications. Three different types of SNMs (HEU, LEU, and Pu) surrounded by\nlead shielding with five different thicknesses (0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 cm), are\nanalyzed using Monte Carlo simulation for three momentum measurement resolution\nlevels (perfect, limited, and absent). 1000 muons were generated in the\nsimulation which translates to 4 minutes of measurement time for a standard\ncargo container. We found that it is possible to identify and separate HEU,\nLEU, and Pu with high accuracy (> 3 s.d.) when using muon momentum measurement\n(perfect and limited) even when 30 cm-thick lead shielding was used. Currently,\nit is not possible to identify or separate the SNMs with 30 cm thick lead\nshielding without muon momentum knowledge.

In cloud systems, unplanned service failures may cause severe\ncascading impacts on their dependent services, deteriorating customer\nsatisfaction. Predicting the cascading impacts accurately and efficiently is\ncritical to the operation and maintenance of cloud systems. Existing approaches\nidentify whether one service depends on another via distributed tracing but no\nprior work focused on discriminating to what extent the dependency between\ncloud services is. In this paper, we survey the outages and the procedure for\nfailure diagnosis in two cloud providers to motivate the definition of the\nintensity of dependency. We define the intensity of dependency between two\nservices as how much the status of the callee service influences the caller\nservice. Then we propose AID, the first approach to predict the intensity of\ndependencies between cloud services. AID first generates a set of candidate\ndependency pairs from the spans. AID then represents the status of each cloud\nservice with a multivariate time series aggregated from the spans. With the\nrepresentation of services, AID calculates the similarities between the\nstatuses of the caller and the callee of each candidate pair. Finally, AID\naggregates the similarities to produce a unified value as the intensity of the\ndependency. We evaluate AID on the data collected from an open-source\nmicroservice benchmark and a cloud system in production. The experimental\nresults show that AID can efficiently and accurately predict the intensity of\ndependencies. We further demonstrate the usefulness of our method in a\nlarge-scale commercial cloud system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 09:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

These students typically\ntake final exams on paper at the end of the semester. In Kenya the system is a\npart of a plan to enhance mathematics education using educational technology,\norganised by the Smiley Charity with the African Maths Initiative. This has\nbeen done by donating servers running the tutor-web to schools and tablets to\nstudents. Typically these schools do not have Internet access so the\ncryptocurrency can not be used. Innovative redesign was needed during COVID-19\nin spring, 2020, since universities in Iceland were not able to host in-house\nfinals and schools in Kenya were closed so tablets could not be donated\ndirectly to students. Remote finals were held in Iceland but the implementation\nwas largely in the hands of the instructors. In Kenya, community libraries\nremained open and became a place for students to come in to study. Innovations\nincluded using the tutor-web as a remote drilling system in place of final\nexams in a large undergraduate course in statistics and donating tablets to\nlibraries in Kenya. These libraries all have access to the Internet and the\nstudents have therefore been given the option to purchase the tablet using\ntheir SmileyCoin. This paper describes these implementations and how this\nunintended experiment will likely affect the future development and use of the\ntutor-web in both countries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 16:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

We\nobtain useful insights into the system performance through the asymptotic\nanalysis which aids to compute the diversity gain.

The V2V application is important because it\nwill reduce the risk of accidents up to 70%-80%, improve traffic management,\nreduce congestion, and improve fuel consumption. Autonomous vehicles\napplications require a high bandwidth transmission channel where the 5G\ncommunication channel would be a reliable solution to support this disruptive\ntechnology. The dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), which is\ncharacterized with a frequency bandwidth of 5.9 gigahertz (GHz) (4G spectrum),\nwas used as vehicular connectivity with a bandwidth of up to 200 megabytes per\nsecond (mb/s) and limited capacity. The 5G band can support connected multiple\nautonomous vehicles with high data rates and large bandwidth. In this study,\nthe 5G communication channel is considered as vehicular connectivity with high\nbandwidth in the millimeter waves spectrum range. The quality of 5G wireless\ncommunication channels between connected vehicles possibly be affected by\nweather conditions such as rain, snow, fog, dust, and sand. In this paper, we\nestimate the effect of dust and sand on the propagation of millimeter waves.\nThe Mie model is used to investigate the effect of dust and sand storms on the\npropagating mm-waves. The effect of dust and sand on the communication path\nloss of DSRC and 5G frequency band is investigated in the case of urban freeway\nand rural highway settings. Results show that the attenuation of dust and sand\nis changed when the particle size of sand, frequency of propagating wave, and\nconcentration of dust are changed. Finally, the new model of link margin is\ncreated to estimate the effect of dust and sand on DSCR (5.9 GHz) and 5G (28\nGHz) communication path loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 15:44:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-19"}
