In\nparticular, the involved players are considered to be high-order integrators\nwith their control inputs constrained within a pre-specified region. A linear\ntransformation for the players' dynamics is firstly utilized to facilitate the\ndesign of bounded control inputs incorporating multiple saturation functions.\nBy introducing consensus protocols with adaptive and time-varying gains, the\nunknown actions for players are distributively estimated. Then, a fully\ndistributed Nash equilibrium seeking strategy is exploited, showcasing its\nremarkable properties: i) ensuring the boundedness of control inputs; ii)\navoiding any global information/parameters; and iii) allowing the graph to be\ndirected. Based on Lyapunov stability analysis, it is theoretically proved that\nthe proposed distributed control strategy can lead all the players' actions to\nthe Nash equilibrium. Finally, an illustrative example is given to validate\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 16:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

Spherical glass, a dome port, is well suited for high water\npressures at great depth, allows for a large field of view, and avoids\nrefraction if a pinhole camera is positioned exactly at the sphere's center.\nAdjusting a real lens perfectly to the dome center is a challenging task, both\nin terms of how to actually guide the centering process (e.g. visual servoing)\nand how to measure the alignment quality, but also, how to mechanically perform\nthe alignment. Consequently, such systems are prone to being decentered by some\noffset, leading to challenging refraction patterns at the sphere that\ninvalidate the pinhole camera model. We show that the overall camera system\nbecomes an axial camera, even for thick domes as used for deep sea exploration\nand provide a non-iterative way to compute the center of refraction without\nrequiring knowledge of exact air, glass or water properties. We also analyze\nthe refractive geometry at the sphere, looking at effects such as forward- vs.\nbackward decentering, iso-refraction curves and obtain a 6th-degree polynomial\nequation for forward projection of 3D points in thin domes. We then propose a\npure underwater calibration procedure to estimate the decentering from multiple\nimages. This estimate can either be used during adjustment to guide the\nmechanical position of the lens, or can be considered in photogrammetric\nunderwater applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 16:19:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2021 08:42:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

For example, we use our main\ntheorem to show that many faithful representations of symplectic and orthogonal\ngroups are generically free.

Methods: Body surface potentials were\ncomputed for 137 simulated ventricular excitations. Subsequently, the inverse\nproblem was solved to obtain extracellular potentials (EP) and transmembrane\nvoltages (TMV). From these, activation times (AT) were estimated using four\nmethods and compared to the ground truth. This process was evaluated with two\ncardiac mesh resolutions. Factors contributing to LoB artifacts were identified\nby analyzing the impact of spatial and temporal smoothing on the morphology of\nsource signals. Results: AT estimation using a spatiotemporal derivative\nperformed better than using a temporal derivative. Compared to deflection-based\nAT estimation, correlation-based methods were less prone to LoB artifacts but\nperformed worse in identifying real LoBs. Temporal smoothing could eliminate\nartifacts for TMVs but not for EPs, which could be linked to their temporal\nmorphology. TMVs led to more accurate ATs on the septum than EPs. Mesh\nresolution had a negligible effect on inverse reconstructions, but small\ndistances were important for cross-correlation-based estimation of AT delays.\nConclusion: LoB artifacts are mainly caused by the inherent spatial smoothing\neffect of the inverse reconstruction. Among the configurations evaluated, only\ndeflection-based AT estimation in combination with TMVs and strong temporal\nsmoothing can prevent LoB artifacts, while preserving real LoBs. Significance:\nRegions of slow conduction are of considerable clinical interest and LoB\nartifacts observed in non-invasive ATs can lead to misinterpretations. We\naddressed this problem by identifying factors causing such artifacts and\nmethods to reduce them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 18:50:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 16:05:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 14:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

Due to the lack of direct\nobservations, we rely on indirect bounds on this phase from the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) data. Using reheating constraints to arrive at\nadditional constraints on inflationary models is prevalent in the literature.\nIn this work, we develop a formalism to analyze the reheating constraints for\nthe general case of single field canonical slow-roll inflation without dealing\nwith a specific inflationary model. We find that using the lower bound on\nreheating temperature and the upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio: one\ncan constrain the inflationary energy scale and the duration of the reheating\nepoch after slow-roll inflation. Following the standard practice, we described\nthe reheating phase with an effective equation of state parameter~($w_{\\rm\nre}$). However, with the present formalism, we can have quantitative\ninformation of the reheating phase even when the reheating equation of state\nbehaves as radiation $w_{\\rm re} = 1/3$. For the canonical reheating phase\ndescribed by $w_{\\rm re}<1/3$, we find that the inflationary efolding number\nmust be bounded from above, i.e., $N_k\\leq56.09$. Consequently, if inflationary\nefolds satisfy this upper bound---i.e., $N_k=56.09$---a finite period of\nreheating is only possible for exotic reheating phases described by $w_{\\rm\nre}>1/3$. We also find that as we lower the value of $N_k$, the corresponding\nenergy scale of inflation also decreases. Consequently, it will be more and\nmore difficult to detect the corresponding inflationary gravitational wave\nsignals with the Gravitational Waves mission. Finally, we show how an extended\nperiod of canonical reheating can improve the situation in those cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 21:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

We explore the relationship between the dropout rate and\nmodel complexity by training 2,000 neural networks configured with random\ncombinations of the dropout rate and the number of hidden units in each dense\nlayer, on each of the three data sets we selected. The generated figures, with\nbinary cross entropy loss and binary accuracy on the z-axis, question the\ncommon assumption that adding depth to a dense layer while increasing the\ndropout rate will certainly enhance performance. We also discover a complex\ncorrelation between the two hyperparameters that we proceed to quantify by\nbuilding additional machine learning and Deep Learning models which predict the\noptimal dropout rate given some hidden units in each dense layer. Linear\nregression and polynomial logistic regression require the use of arbitrary\nthresholds to select the cost data points included in the regression and to\nassign the cost data points a binary classification, respectively. These\nmachine learning models have mediocre performance because their naive nature\nprevented the modeling of complex decision boundaries. Turning to Deep Learning\nmodels, we build neural networks that predict the optimal dropout rate given\nthe number of hidden units in each dense layer, the desired cost, and the\ndesired accuracy of the model. Though, this attempt encounters a mathematical\nerror that can be attributed to the failure of the vertical line test. The\nultimate Deep Learning model is a neural network whose decision boundary\nrepresents the 2,000 previously generated data points. This final model leads\nus to devise a promising method for tuning hyperparameters to minimize\ncomputational expense yet maximize performance. The strategy can be applied to\nany model hyperparameters, with the prospect of more efficient tuning in\nindustrial models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 23:49:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 00:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

However, these approaches treat the entire\nbackpropagation as a single task; this leads to an increase in computation time\nand processor underutilization. This paper presents novel optimization\napproaches where the gradient computations with respect to the weights and the\nactivation functions are considered independently; therefore, these can be\ncomputed in parallel. This is referred to as intra-layer optimization.\nAdditionally, the gradient computation with respect to the activation function\nis further divided into two parts and distributed to two consecutive layers.\nThis leads to balanced scheduling where the computation time of each layer is\nthe same. This is referred to as inter-layer optimization.

Therefore, we\npropose the few-shot fine-grained action recognition problem, aiming to\nrecognize novel fine-grained actions with only few samples given for each\nclass. Although progress has been made in coarse-grained actions, existing\nfew-shot recognition methods encounter two issues handling fine-grained\nactions: the inability to capture subtle action details and the inadequacy in\nlearning from data with low inter-class variance. To tackle the first issue, a\nhuman vision inspired bidirectional attention module (BAM) is proposed.\nCombining top-down task-driven signals with bottom-up salient stimuli, BAM\ncaptures subtle action details by accurately highlighting informative\nspatio-temporal regions. To address the second issue, we introduce contrastive\nmeta-learning (CML). Compared with the widely adopted ProtoNet-based method,\nCML generates more discriminative video representations for low inter-class\nvariance data, since it makes full use of potential contrastive pairs in each\ntraining episode. Furthermore, to fairly compare different models, we establish\nspecific benchmark protocols on two large-scale fine-grained action recognition\ndatasets.

On the other hand, deep learning has witnessed huge success in\ndifferent areas of pattern recognition, including HCR, and provides an\nend-to-end learning. However, deep learning techniques are computationally\nexpensive, need large amount of data for training and have been developed for\nspecific scripts only. To address the above limitations, we have proposed a\nnovel generic deep learning architecture for script independent handwritten\ncharacter recognition, called HCR-Net. HCR-Net is based on a novel transfer\nlearning approach for HCR, which partly utilizes feature extraction layers of a\npre-trained network. Due to transfer learning and image-augmentation, HCR-Net\nprovides faster and computationally efficient training, better performance and\nbetter generalizations, and can work with small datasets.

Heat conduction through the\nnanoconfined gas medium differs from macroscopic predictions due to several\nreasons. The continuum assumption is broken down; the surface forces which\nextend deeper through the gas medium become prominent due to the large\nsurface-to-volume ratio, and, finally, the gas molecules are accumulated\nnonuniformly on the solid surfaces. In this work, to better understand the\ncombination of these phenomena on the heat conduction through the nanoconfined\ngas medium, we present a series of molecular dynamics simulations of argon gas\nconfined between either metals or silicon walls. The gas density is set so that\ngas experiences a wide range of Knudsen numbers from continuum to the free\nmolecular regime. It is observed that the intrinsic characteristics of the\nsolid determine the gas density distribution near the walls and consequently in\nthe bulk region, and these distributions control the heat conduction through\nthe gas medium.

Based on this, the\nnew approach generates EA models with the desired views points. Furthermore, a\nrule and knowledge-based reasoning is used to obtain a holistic overview. This\noffers a strategic decision support from business structure over process design\nup to planning the appropriate support technology. Therefore, it forms the base\nfor organisations to act in an agile way. The modelling can be performed in\ndifferent modelling languages, including ArchiMate and the Nato Architecture\nFramework (NAF). The designed approach is already evaluated on a small company\nwith multiple services and an infrastructure with several nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 09:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

An effective solution\nis represented by cellular-connected UAVs, where traditional terrestrial users\ncoexist with flying UAVs acting as additional aerial users, which access the\n5G/B5G cellular network infrastructure from the sky. In this scenario, we study\nthe challenging application in which an UAV acting as aerial user (AU) and a\nstatic (i.e., fixed) terrestrial user (TU) are paired to simultaneously\ntransmit their uplink signals to a ground base station (BS) in the same\ntime-frequency resource blocks. In such a case, due to the highly dynamic\nnature of the UAV, the signal transmitted by the AU experiences both time\ndispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion caused\nby Doppler shifts. On the other hand, for a static ground network, frequency\ndispersion of the signal transmitted by TU is negligible and only multipath\neffects have to be taken into account. To decode the superposed signals at the\nBS by using finite-length data record, we propose a novel sky-ground (SG)\nnonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) receiving structure that additionally\nexploits the different circularity/noncircularity and almost-cyclostationarity\nproperties of the AU and TU by means of improved channel estimation and\ntime-varying successive interference cancellation.

Conventional\nCNNs/RNNs assume one-to-one mapping, and thus tend to predict the average of\nall possible target motions, resulting in plain/boring motions during\ninference. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a novel conditional\nvariational autoencoder (VAE) that explicitly models one-to-many\naudio-to-motion mapping by splitting the cross-modal latent code into shared\ncode and motion-specific code. The shared code mainly models the strong\ncorrelation between audio and motion (such as the synchronized audio and motion\nbeats), while the motion-specific code captures diverse motion information\nindependent of the audio. However, splitting the latent code into two parts\nposes training difficulties for the VAE model. A mapping network facilitating\nrandom sampling along with other techniques including relaxed motion loss,\nbicycle constraint, and diversity loss are designed to better train the VAE.\nExperiments on both 3D and 2D motion datasets verify that our method generates\nmore realistic and diverse motions than state-of-the-art methods,\nquantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can\nbe readily used to generate motion sequences with user-specified motion clips\non the timeline.

Achieving this\nusually needs experts to externalize their domain knowledge by manually\nspecifying a class-attribute matrix to define which classes have which\nattributes. Designing a suitable class-attribute matrix is the key to the\nsubsequent procedure, but this design process is tedious and trial-and-error\nwith no guidance. This paper proposes a visual explainable active learning\napproach with its design and implementation called semantic navigator to solve\nthe above problems. This approach promotes human-AI teaming with four actions\n(ask, explain, recommend, respond) in each interaction loop. The machine asks\ncontrastive questions to guide humans in the thinking process of attributes. A\nnovel visualization called semantic map explains the current status of the\nmachine. Therefore analysts can better understand why the machine misclassifies\nobjects. Moreover, the machine recommends the labels of classes for each\nattribute to ease the labeling burden. Finally, humans can steer the model by\nmodifying the labels interactively, and the machine adjusts its\nrecommendations. The visual explainable active learning approach improves\nhumans' efficiency of building zero-shot classification models interactively,\ncompared with the method without guidance. We justify our results with user\nstudies using the standard benchmarks for zero-shot classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 12:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

Yet, like the physical\nworld, the living world occupies space, is composed of baryonic matter, and is\nsubmitted to the four fundamental forces. To bridge this break in continuity, a\nstudy relying solely on the laws of physics was conducted to seek a pattern\nthat would unite both worlds. Here we show evidence of a common pattern that is\nbased on a gravitating organization. Seven criteria were worked out to define a\ngravitating concept that applies to any attractive force. A scan through the\nsecond version of the Integrative levels classification system revealed that\nthe following six types of objects satisfy the criteria: atoms, eukaryotic\ncells, vertebrates, nation-states, planetary systems, and galaxies. A\ncomparative diameter study was carried out on objects confined to the Solar\nSystem in the Milky Way. The trendline linking the average diameters follows an\nexponential function f(x)=0.2527x10^6.23x, with a coefficient of determination\nof 0.9904. The objects assemble into a superstructure spanning 32 orders of\nmagnitude, systematically skipping 6.23 orders of magnitude at each level. The\nunity of structure revealed in this study suggests that both worlds result from\na common underlying organizing process. Furthermore, the gradual and\nuninterrupted sequence leading to complex structures supports the idea that the\ngravitating organization offers a favorable pathway to complexity. The\nframework presented in this study may help address complex phenomena such as\nemergence and agency, broaden the scope of the theory of evolution and fuel the\ndebate on the definition of life itself. Ultimately, it may contribute to a\nmore complete understanding of the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 13:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

In contrast, CR-LIBM and RLIBM provide\ncorrectly rounded implementations for a specific FP representation with one\nrounding mode. Using such libraries for a representation with a new rounding\nmode or with different precision will result in wrong results due to double\nrounding. This paper proposes a novel method to generate a single polynomial\napproximation that produces correctly rounded results for all inputs for\nmultiple rounding modes and multiple precision configurations. To generate a\ncorrectly rounded library for $n$-bits, our key idea is to generate such a\npolynomial approximation for a representation with $n+2$-bits using the\n\\emph{round-to-odd} mode. We prove that the resulting polynomial approximation\nwill produce correctly rounded results for all five rounding modes in the\nstandard and for multiple representations with $k$-bits such that $|E| +1 < k\n\\leq n$, where $|E|$ is the number of exponent bits in the representation.\nBuilding on our prior work in the RLIBM project, we also approximate the\ncorrectly rounded result when we generate the library with $n+2$-bits using the\nround-to-odd mode. We also generate polynomial approximations by structuring it\nas a linear programming problem but propose enhancements to polynomial\ngeneration to handle the round-to-odd mode. Our prototype is the first 32-bit\nfloat library that produces correctly rounded results with all rounding modes\nin the IEEE standard for all inputs with a single polynomial approximation.
